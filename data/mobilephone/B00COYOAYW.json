{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone - AMAZING price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R36WHIVFVJH5Q8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first start of by saying, this is an amazing phone! I bought it as a cheap entry into Windows Phone 8, and I'm completely blown away. I wasn't expecting this. This phone was going to be something I use as a backup, but I'm currently using this as my daily driver, and I love it!Let me also say, that I'm not new to the world of smart phones. I consider myself a techie enthusiast that buys and tries new phones / tech every few months or so. I've been on every phone carrier, and tried every platform except for WP8 (until now). I've also picked up every iPhone released (1st gen to iPhone 5), and I'm HEAVILY invested in Google services. I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2). My most recent love has been the pureness of the LG Nexus 4. The fact that I'm impressed with this budget device is no small thing.Pros:-Fantastic Battery Life - (Appears to hold its charge while on stand by like an iPhone. Unlike Android phones that continue to drain heavily even without use. The phone also charges fairly quickly since the battery only rated at 1430mAH).-Great Nokia Construction - (Nokia does an amazing job with plastics. Remember the days of the old Nokia 3300's? You could drop those things over and over again without worry. I have nearly the same confidence in this phone. Something you definitely don't see in other phones these days. The phone even has a good weight to it. Not the light, cheapy feeling you get from some Samsung devices).-Removable Rear Cover - (Most WP8 phones that I see - even other Nokia ones - don't have a removable back. I was very pleased to see one on the 521. Scratch or crack a back? No problem! Replace it. Hopefully there will be some 3rd party support here making other colors and designs. I haven't had the need for it yet, but I can't tell you how many battery pulls I've had to do with some of my Android phones. I like knowing that if I ever have to reset my phone, I'm just a pop of the cover away. Even the buttons come off with the cover! This means if you ever have wear on the buttons, it'll be replaced with the new cover you put on there as well).-Dedicated Camera Key - (From what I've read online, this is a feature implemented by WP8. I was glad to see that this transferred even down to their entry level 521. I like having quick access to my camera, and this is a feature that is rarely seen on Android devices, and has NEVER been on an iOS device. It's also a 2-stage button. 1st click focus, 2nd click snap).-Acceptable Camera - (Now, you might be wondering why this is a Pro, since the camera is only a 5mp sensor. However, considering the 5mp limitation, I was very impressed with its quality. Even in low lighting, images are very acceptable. I rate this camera higher than my iPad3 & iPod5, and probably the best 5mp phone shooter that I've seen so far).-Great Speaker - (This was something that I didn't even care about right away. Then I tried using this to play some music from Pandora, and wow. It really caught me off guard. It can get really loud without distorting).-Snappy Processor - (I can't find any lag on this thing. I can't say whether this is hardware or software since I'm new to WP8, but it certainly makes it easy for me to switch back from an iPhone 5, Nexus 4, & S3 without really noticing a difference.-Generous Storage - (8 Gigs internal, with expandable storage options. There are phones that cost 3x this that don't even give you the expandable storage option. Other phones in this price segment don't give you anything close to 8 gigs internal space).There are other great things about this phone, but these are just the things that stand out.Cons:-Screen Technology - (I'm sure Nokia cut some cost here to keep the phone at a great price, so this is in NO WAY a deal breaker, but it picks up a ton of finger prints. You can't touch this screen without leaving smudges. It's just impossible. Higher end phones use a glass that's gone through anti-smudge treatment to prevent this. Wipe your screen more often, or put an anti-smudge screen protector and you're problems are solved. No biggie).-No LED flash - (Again another way Nokia cut cost, and again NOT a deal breaker. I only use LED flash on my other phones as a flash light. Everyone knows that those tiny lights don't do crap to help dark photos anyways. If I really have to pop some night shots, I'll be busting out a DSLR or a Point & shoot).Conclusion: - If you're on the fence about this device, let me help you. Stop reading my review here, and go buy this thing! You won't find a better value anywhere else. Prior to purchasing this phone, I stood by the Nexus 4 as being one of the best value's on the market, but Nokia is really putting a different spin on things. Any Android phone that you find in this price segment will be using an old OS (you'll be lucky to get Gingerbread), & extremely dated hardware. Here you have up to date hardware with an up to date OS at a 3rd of the competition's cost.Suggestions: - Buy this at Walmart if you can find it. I got mine for $129.00 at a local Walmart. T-Mobile sells this for $150.00, and right now Amazon has it for $199.00. Also I'm currently using this on Straight Talk. I see ton's of forum posted questions asking if this will work with Straight Talk, and I CAN confirm that it does. You just have to be sure you're using a T-Mobile compatible Micro-Sim. I also had to enter the APN setting manually. After just putting my sim in, I could receive calls and texts, but no data service. After entering the proper APN settings (available on Straight Talk's website), data worked just fine.... New $700 smart phones come out everyday, but the $129 Nokia 521 is a true gem.----------------------7/26/13 UPDATE!I still can't get over what an awesome deal this is. You can now get this phone as little as $99 OFF CONTRACT / OUTRIGHT. Since purchasing this phone, I've also picked up a Samsung Galaxy S4 & an HTC One. I can honestly say, that the differences between this phone and those other 2 \"Flagship\" phones don't justify the price difference. I still switch to his 521 regularly, and the only thing I miss or feel I'm sacrificing is the screen quality (resolution and technology). Still, it doesn't justify a near $500 price difference. The differences aren't even all sacrifices! The 521 at times feels quicker and less buggy than my S4 (although credit must go to WP8 for that), and the rear speaker is louder.I just have a few other notes to share:Battery - I love the battery life that I'm getting with this 521. I keep my phone on \"Battery Saver\", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle. I have this phone linked to my business Exchange account, and use this phone for work regularly (so the 521 is being used fairly heavily). Also, thanks to the small battery capacity, charging this thing really is EXTREMELY quick in comparison to the HUGE battery in my S4 that takes forever to charge. I suppose I must also credit WP8 for some of that.I did have that battery sucking bug that another reviewer experienced as well. For some reason, my battery life would just go from 100% to 30% in minutes. This had me really freaked out at first. After half an hour of testing, I found the culprit to be a bad app. Pretty simple fix: deleted the app, restarted my phone. Problem solved. I didn't even have to wipe my phone or clear it of any data (other than removing the bad app).Loud Speaker - Man. I don't think paid / \"Pro\" Phone reviewers give this phone enough credit. The rear loud speaker on this phone is amazing. I wouldn't say the quality is as good as the Beats Audio on my HTC One, but it may very well be the loudest speaker among my large phone collection.For anyone looking at this phone thinking that it's just a cheap phone to settle on, let me assure you, this is an AMAZING value, and you won't be disappointed. You absolutely won't find a better deal than the 521. If Nokia did more advertising in the US, the 521 would kill sales of many more popular devices out there. I truly hope the 521 pushes the market to create more budget friendly devices with fewer sacrifices just as Nokia managed to do. I find it truly ridiculous that phones are costing so much that some people are having to step into financing options to pay for the \"latest & greatest\" devices.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Let Inexpensive Fool You - This Phone is Packed With Features Including WiFi Calling & Tethering", "Author": "Carrie", "ReviewID": "R2XTIBZBDIOJJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ORIGINAL REVIEW:I thought about waiting on the Lumia 925, but after reading how much the Lumina 521 has to offer, I decided that since I tend to change phones about every 2 years, it made more sense to go with the phone that was lighter on my wallet. After finding that my local WalMart had one phone left, I snagged it and haven't regretted my purchase one bit.What I love about the phone:1. WiFi calling (set up instructions below) - calls are clear, but calls don't hand off to cellular network if you step outside of your WiFi range2. Tethering Capable (must add to your plan as a separate service, but no charge)3. MicroSD slot (up to 64GB)4. Camera is touch adjustable5. Adjustable font size6. Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7. Transfer My Data App makes switching phones super easy - even transfers text messages8. All of the Nokia app collection for free (drive, music, photobeamer, yousendit, etc).9. Touchscreen is very responsive - sensitivity is adjustable10. Visual voicemail (free, but have to enable your account)The few negatives:1. Camera isn't fancy, but is 5mp. Use fingers/touchscreen to zoom. There is not a flash, so indoor pics can be blurry.2. Phone supposedly won't be able to access the LTE network if available in your area. I haven't confirmed this claim. The phone speed is fast enough for my needs, but I am not a gamer.3. Plastic back. Does it matter? Most people use a cover anyway.The OKs:1. Screen is nice and easy to see indoors. Sunlight causes difficulties. I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2. Phone does not come with a headset3. Phone does not come with a car charger4. The ear sound can get tinny. I use to up the volume to hear on other phones. In this phone, I turn down the volume to get rid of the tinny sound. This is not noticeable when on speakerphone.I really like this phone - it has all of the features I want at a fantastic price point. If you are buying a Windows phone (and you should), this phone is a no-brainer.WiFi calling set-up: get wifi calling enabled on your t-mobile account (free set up), and make sure that you have a wifi enabled sim card (free at TMobile store).  Then do a hard reset on the phone (not just a simple update).  Reset is found at Settings - About - reset your phone. Once you do these steps, a WiFi calling button will appear on your home screen. Press it and choose your option (Wi-Fi Preferred, Cellular Preferred, Wi-Fi Only).EMail/Social Media set-up: was a Breeze. I set up Hotmail, outlook, Gmail, roadrunner and a business email. Facebook and other social media is also very easy to set-up.Font size & High contrast screen is at Settings - Ease of Access.Tethering is at Settings - Internet sharing.(This review is not intended to endorse a third party seller.)SOFTWARE UPDATE (news release 8/16/13):The Windows Phone Amber update--available for Nokia's Lumia 920, 820, 720, 620, 520, 928, 822, 521 and 810--includes Smart Camera, which promises users the tools to create higher-quality photos by taking a series of rapid-fire shots then editing the best elements of each image together, further bolstered by filters and effects.Windows Phone Amber also touts Nokia Glance Screen, which adds a clock to the screen when the phone is inactive, alongside indicators that depict the battery level when the device is running on a low battery, charging or set to silent mode. \"You can activate the Nokia Glance screen in the 'display and touch' section in Settings by swiping left to 'glance,'\" said Nokia Conversations blog editor Ian Delaney. \"Nokia Glance screen will be available for all WP8 Lumia devices except the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 625, which have a smaller display memory.\"Following customer requests, Windows Phone Amber additionally resurrects features from older Nokia handsets. Users may now flip the phone over to mute incoming calls and double tap the screen as an alternative to the unlock key.\"The rollout starts now first for the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 in selected countries as well as the Lumia 521, Lumia 810 and Lumia 928 in the U.S.,\" Delaney said. \"Exact delivery timings will vary by region, phone and operator, but we expect the update to reach your Lumia 520, Lumia 620, Lumia 720, Lumia 820 or Lumia 920 by the end of September.\"UPDATE (12/6/13T Mobile changed their international features in Oct 2013, allowing free data & texting in areas they serve (phone calls .10 unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).  I took & used my phone to Peru & it worked quite well, both roaming on the Moviestar network (free) & hooking up to wifi.  I tethered to my tablet as well.UPDATE (3/28/14)I just returned from a trip to Vietnam where I used the Lumia 521 continuously both roaming & WiFi. In airports and other venues that had spotty or no WiFi, I tethered my phone to my tablet & to another user's tablet. WiFi calling provided free calls back to the states & using my apps, including Facebook, was a breeze.  TMobile's free international features are awesome (free texting & data, $.20/minute network calls, free WiFi calling to states, not in-country) and saved me hundreds of dollars.That said, I'm finding that I use my phone a lot more to take pictures, and the 521 only has a 5mp camera & no front facing camera.  The 5mp is OK & my phone has taken some very nice pictures, but now I want more & will probably upgrade to the Lumia 930 when it comes out if it isn't insanely priced (the 930 is suppose to have a 20mp camera, a front facing camera).", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It has no equal in the value catagory", "Author": "J. Martinez", "ReviewID": "R23C95QJLP7DH5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In terms of price/performance this one is off the charts.  It completes nicely with phones costing 3x as much.  If you are looking for a high quality low price phone this is it. If this phone has weaknesses, I had to search hard to find them.  I will get to the cons in a minute but this is a well thought out well constructed phone.First off, I will say that I use an iPhone 4S as a business phone.  I am an IT professional and have used blackberry and droid phones and have touched many different devices so I have quite a bit of experience with what is out there.  While I like the iPhone ok, I wanted something different then everyone else and heard great things about the new Windows 8 phones and decided to give them a try.  I don't want to spend a bunch on a phone because I swap my phone out every year and have T-mobile's no contract family plan.  My old phone gets passed down to my kids.  My personal phone was a Sammy.  I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.  I used the Mango platform WP 7.5 and decided to try WP 8 and see if the hype is warranted.  Ok on to the pros and cons.Pros: 1) The Windows tiles look great compared to the very plain looking iPhone square icons. 2)The installed phone apps are much more useful to me then the pre-installed iPhone apps. 2)  The offline feature of the Nokia maps are very cool. 3) Most of the time I am near a WiFi connection so the Nokia phone makes it very easy to connect to WiFi and use only Wifi unless that is unavailable.  You can also use WiFi calling on the phone.  This can really help on keeping your bill down. 3)The device is small and easy to hold yet large enough to be useful.  I love the size of it.  The iPhone is a bit too wide for my taste. 4) Navigation on the phone is super easy. WP8 is far superior to IOS here.  It is a very easy phone to pick up and use out of the box. 5) When I connected the device to my Windows 7 computer, it recognized it right away and suggested the phone app to download and Windows got my phone hooked up to my computer very painlessly.  Going with all Windows certainly has an advantage here. 6) Price.  This is simply the best value out there.  There is no way you can get something even close to this capable phone for even twice the price. 7) easily connected to my Blue Tooth headset something my iPhone refused to do.  It easily connected to Wifi. It is just very simple to set up. 8) hooks up easily to the cloud to store files and backup your phone.  Skydrive is a big plus.  There phone backup utility is fantastic. 8) I like the music app much better than the one on the iPhone. 7) very snappy performanceCons: 1) Screen resolution isn't bad but could be better. 2) Speaker sound is better on the iPhone but again not bad. 3) Phone case is a bit plasticy. 4) Camera has no flash but not a big deal for me.Looks like Nokia and Microsoft have knocked it out of the park with this phone.  Sure there are better phones out there but at this price there is nothing.  It is hard to believe that Apple charges $600 for a phone that just isn't significantly better then this one.  No doubt to me that the hardware on the iPhone is superior but I can buy 4 of these of that same cost.  In terms of ease of use the iPhone has nothing over this one.  The iPhone has the best app collection out there but it has been around awhile.  I like being different in a world crowded with Sammy and Apple phones.  I would have given it a 5 star except that you can see how Nokia tried to shave costs to get the price down but in terms of value I would give this 6 stars.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, but if you have a Contract already make sure you call your provider", "Author": "Sean Bennett", "ReviewID": "R1WX6UI87UMJWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 2 year contract with Tmobile and my phone broke, but i dont have an upgrade, so I bought this, and my sim card from the old phone didnt fit, so i put the new one that came with the Nokia in and it didnt have any of my contract info, so if you have a contract, just call your provider, tell them you bought this phone and need to register it under your number, you just tell them your number then the number of the new sim card (its on the bottom of the box and its on the card the sim card comes with) you just tell them the number and then wait 10-15 minutes reset the phone and you should start recieving texts, calls, and have internet access", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Straight to the point!", "Author": "John S.", "ReviewID": "R1QUYP7GJVASGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can go on and on with a big list of pros and cons, but honestly, buying this Lumia 521 is a simple decision. Let me save you the trouble reading countless reviews. These are the four big points you would need to know.1) If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone. I went from Blackberry to Android to iOS. If you value apps, get an Android or iOS.2) If having a good camera is important to you, do not get this phone. With no flash, 5 megapixels, and subpar picture quality you will not be happy if taking picture is important to you.3) If price is a factor, then this is a no brainer. You will NOT be able to find another smartphone with the amount of features for $100 (less or more depending on where you buy it). Mid range smartphones start around $250 if you go the android route and you will find nothing in the $100 range to compare to this phone.4) Offline GPS and free music streaming. This is extremely important to people who don't want a data plan. You can use the GPS (it downloads the map to your phone) without a data connection and you can also stream free music at no charge (wifi or data plan needed).That's basically it after these 4 points, this smartphone can do pretty much anything the higher end phones can do for $100.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Smartphone", "Author": "pcc \"pcc94550\"", "ReviewID": "R1HLP5KDKN9F6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I are 68 years old and have used feature phones exclusively. I just wasn't interested in high priced, expensive contract smartphones and I make all the tech decisions in our household.  When my husband started wishing he had a smartphone, I began to read all the tech news on the phones and systems in mid-2012.  I have always been a Windows user and did not want to change to Apple.  I admire Google but realized that really tech savvy people were using it.  When Windows 8 came out, I decided I would start by buying a Windows 8 tablet, get used to the system, change my computers to the Win 8 operating system, and then buy us phones.  However, I wanted to wait for an inexpensive Win 8 phone with no contract. I bought the tablet in November 2012, changed my computer operating systems to Win 8 in March 2013. At that time the tech news started talking about the coming inexpensive Nokia Lumia 521 on T-Mobile with no contract.We bought our phones on the first day they were available at T-Mobile in May.  We have used them for a month now.  T-Mobile was very helpful getting our numbers from our old no-contract carrier, which was difficult - their staff at the Pleasanton store is to be commended.I had already changed to Microsoft Outlook on the web to get ready for my tablet, computer, phone plan.  All my addresses, phone numbers, friends and family were ready and waiting and available to my phone. I had set up an Outlook account for my husband but hadn't put in his addresses and such, so I did have to do that. I was extremely pleased that I could just do it comfortably on my computer and populate his phone. I just shared my calendar with him.  I have had to teach him how to use the phone but he was eager and ready to learn, and it isn't a difficult phone to use.  He isn't very interested in tech usually.  On his first weekend out, he took wonderful photos at a wedding that the bride's parents loved.This is growing too long, but if you are a new smartphone user and want to control your phone costs, try this phone.  The features that I love are WiFi calling, Here Maps, the high contrast screen, great sound, good size for small hands and the integration with Outlook and social media. It has all the apps we need now, probably because we aren't power users, and more are being added all the time.Give this phone a try, it is really nice and easy to use.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone, but battery/phone died after 4 days", "Author": "Dimsu", "ReviewID": "RXRJ553IBDHNQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was able to fully use the handset for 4 days.  I come from the Android platform and am an RF Engineer for 14 years working in wireless.The handset build quality is absolutely great for the price.  The touch screen is great, the keyboard predictability also great.  The way the phone handled day to day operation, for the price was also great.  It is not a Lumia 9xx phone, it is an entry level Windows 8 phone.  The camera is a basic camera, it did not take good pictures when my kid moved even slightly (there was blur).  The screen in sunlight, is not as bright as I'd like.  Once again, a great handset for the price.  I confirmed wifi calling, it worked flawlessly.  I had a major issue for the phone to allow me to create an outlook.com email address (needed to use their App store), it would not work and would return a hexadecimal error.  To fix this, I reset the phone and tried again and it worked. (hahaha... a windows product that requires resets hmmm... but to be fair, Android and iOs has needed a reset so no points lost there)Now onto where we have an issue.  The issue came about after 4 days of using it.  I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).  It turned off, I popped the cover off, and removed my SIM.  I went back to my Android device to do some work stuff, and came back to the Lumia 521 about 3hrs later.  The phone would not power up.  I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.  I tried to reset it (hold down volume down/power for 10s) did nothing.  The screen is working, it shows a battery charging, but it won't hold the charge and won't power up.  I will be returning it to the store, hopefully it is simply a defective battery.If you're looking for a good handset with all the functionality of a smart phone yes it is a great phone.  I enjoyed the size and interface.  Hopefully, the battery thing will be resolved today.Update - 5/29/13I was able to exchange the phone for another.  So far no issues with the phone.  There is one issue that was repeated on both phones and below is the description of the issue and its solution.During initial setup of email, I tried to sign-in to my outlook.com account.  Login/password work on my PC.  However, upon trying this on the phone it would fail.  The error I'd receive is - ERROR 0X80048264.  There is not much that would work, tried a soft reset, turning on/off etc it would not work.  The solution is to perform a hard reset (go into settings, click About Phone and perform a reset).  Once the phone restores, the login process worked.Please note, this is a T-Mobile store purchased phone.  It is my opinion, that when you turn on the phone, an update takes place (takes a while) and I believe it downloads WiFi Calling update.  Upon this being downloaded, it creates the scenario where the process of login for your Outlook or Live or Hotmail account doesn't go thru.  By doing a hard reset, the update for wifi calling remains but the phone's other settings reset.  Hopefully, this is a patch/update issue that will soon get resolved.Please feel free to respond if your process is successful to help others.

Leung", "ReviewID": "R29EDF03UZ3SVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I was looking to replace my not-so-smart phone, I have to admit that no WP8 phone was on my list. I didn't think there would be any, as I was aiming at a sub-$150 budget without a contract. At that price level, I was pretty much looking at Android phones of various specifications, OS generations, and/or refurbished with dubious quality. Then I saw a local electronics store advertise this Nokia 521 for $120, and that prompted me to do some research. And then I was sold.- High on my list was a battery that would get me through the day. This one will do it.- Also, is the battery user replaceable? Yes. They don't last forever, so this is important.- Expandable storage? Yes.- Easy to use? From the reviews about WP8, I hoped it was ... and I was not let down. Very intuitive, I must say.Yes, there are some drawbacks, as others have noted, but none are so detrimental as to completely ruin the experience. Factor in the price, the pros absolutely overshadows the cons this phone has. Are there better smartphones out there? Sure. Are there better smartphones out there for under $150? None I can think of.FWIW, I'm using the phone with PTel (Platinum Tel), a MVNO operator on the T-Mobile network. There is no need to unlock the phone - the only change you have to make is the network. To do that, go to settings, access point (it's further down), and then enter the applicable entries as documented on PTel's site.

It seems to have a pretty good antenna because the signal quality is a lot better than my LG Optimus L9 on the T-Mobile network which makes a difference when you live in a place where it is difficult to get a signal. One thing that really stands out to me and which I like a lot is the Windows 8 OS on the phone, it is well thought out especially Internet Explorer, I like how the address bar is on the bottom and not the top.  As a web and mobile designer I can really appreciate it.  Microsoft was always seemingly behind the curve with their web browsers and they can be a real pain to develop for as you have to do all sorts of hacks at times in order to get websites to render correctly, but not so with the mobile version of their browser, I think they really thought this one through and so far I like it better than mobile Safari and mobile Chrome. Overall a really nice phone and you will be hard pressed to beat the price.

That speaks volumes, doesn't it? Yes, I am THAT pleased with this phone that I decided to write a review.I bought this phone from HSN for $84.75 for my son (actually he bought it with his own saved up money but I ordered it online) a few weeks ago. It was on a $99.95 special and you got $20 off for being a new customer. Add $4.80 tax and the phone comes to about $85. It was free shipping so I was already happy. I did have my doubts because:a) it was a Windows phone, andb) it was a Windows phone, andc) well, it was a Windows phone, andd) people had complained about the lack of apps available in the Store for the phoneand lastly, what kind of quality phone can one get for under $100 these days, correct?However, I figured that since the phone had a 30 day return policy (HSN included a pre-paid, self-addressed UPS label in the shipped box) why not try it? If my son didn't like it, I'll send it back. Well, it only took a few hours for my son to become the biggest fan of the phone. He was speaking so highly of it that I had to check it out again, this time in much more detail than I initially did when I received the phone in the mail. Wow! What a great deal we got! It is definitely a quality phone and quite possibly the BEST PHONE AROUND for the price--please do not compare it to its sibling, the Lumia 925 also from T-Mobile which is over $500.00--and therefore highly recommended.If you are with T-Mobile, or are thinking about it, I would definitely recommend this phone. Unfortunately, HSN was sold out of this phone as of this morning, but the current price on Amazon ($100.00) is quite good, especially with Amazon Prime's free/two-day shipping.So, my son really liked it, and so did I. I already have two Android phones so certainly am in no need of buying a phone for myself, but it was time to upgrade my wife's old Android phone, which had become quite unreliable with frequent freeze-ups and other miscellaneous issues. Guess which phone I got her? You got it! She really likes it too. It makes integrating with one's Hotmail (Outlook), Outlook Calendar, SkyDrive, and sync'ing with Windows 8 quite easy, seamless, and enjoyable. Despite what many people have said, the selection of apps in the Store is not so bad, and it's growing by the day. Now, the options for free GAMES apps are not as huge as Google's Play Store but it's on its way. If the primary reason for you buying this phone is free games, you may want to wait a few more months as the Store becomes stronger in its games apps offerings.So far I have spoken highly of this phone but in all fairness, I must mention the two things that I did not like in this phone:1) The Back, Home, Search button/keys are NOT backlit so until you learn their position in your hand while holding the phone, it can be quite annoying when you are trying to accomplish a task.2) There is no flash on this phone, so if you take a lot of photos at night or in a dark environment, this phone may not be right for you. We have a Canon Rebel T3i as our primary camera, so a phone camera has NEVER been a selling point for my wife or me, but it's always a nice option to have a decent camera on the phone. Nonetheless, it is a secondary thing for us, but I know a lot of people who use their phones as their primary cameras...so just something to keep in mind.Lastly, both of the boxes that I ordered from HSN came with the phone, a charger, a (very short) USB cable, a charger, and a micro SIM card. I just called T-Mobile and activated the new micro SIM since my wife's old phone took regular SIM, and it took all of 4-5 minutes to have her new phone up and running.Well, I hope that this review will help the potential customer(s) decide whether they want to buy this phone or not. As for me, I am ready to buy a third (or more) Lumia 521 whenever the need arises.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blowing the Smartphone Market Wide Open With the Lumia 521", "Author": "JF \"Groovola\"", "ReviewID": "RPCOX05QQ0TZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia Lumia 521 is my first smartphone, although I am more than familiar with electronics hardware and software in general, and I keep up with the latest tech. Things like phones play a distant second fiddle to my interest in laptops and other computing devices. As far as phones and some other things go, I tend to wait until prices plummet when they become common.But, what a great phone to kick off my transition to a smartphone.  I could've bought an obsolete version of an IOS or Android device for more money than this. I'm simply floored by the quality of the Lumia paired with Windows Phone 8. I have to say, WP8 makes IOS7 and Android look obsolete immediately. But this review is about the Nokia, not Windows, and when comparing processing power and storage to other phones in this price range, it's not even close. Nokia has blown the whole smartphone market open with this thing.Build quality is very good, considering the price. The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery. Yes, this is a $100 phone that has expandable storage, with a more-than-ample 8gb already on the phone. And, the back plate is replaceable if you damage it or want another color. It's plastic, but like another reviewer commented, Nokia knows a thing or two about durability. They owned the market years ago with durability and quality. They don't fall short of that now, either.Paired with the 1 ghz dual-core Snapdragon processor, Windows Phone 8 behaves beautifully with no noticeable lag. The OS feels light and snappy on this phone, and transitions smoothly.What Nokia has done here has changed the whole way to approach first-time or budget smartphone buyers. You no longer have to settle for a distantly inferior phone with less money.  Nokia manages to shave off things like a camera flash, screen-side camera, HD screen and metal construction, and left high quality essentials and good hardware. It doesn't try to be everything - it clearly targets people who can settle for less options (although there are plenty) but want a good phone for what it does. To me, it does just that, and far more. Excellent product.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST $99 Smartphone.", "Author": "HRinCA", "ReviewID": "R3QLCXPKGWP1EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rarely write reviews for my purchases on Amazon.com but the Nokia Lumia 521 made me spend a good half hour typing this review up.This is an amazing phone! I bought it as an entry into Windows Phone 8 and as a backup to my Nexus 4. I was expecting it to be an eh eh phone since I had an HTC TyTn II about 5 years ago and was quite underwhelmed by the Windows Mobile experience at that time. For $95 I am simply blown away. I wasn't expecting this to happen. My intention was to use this phone as a backup, but I'm currently using this as my daily driver, and after two weeks of use I love it!I am familiar with all three major mobile operating systems. I have an iPad and an iPod, Samsung Galaxy Exhibit and Nexus 4 and now the Lumia 521 to round out the iOS, Android and WP8 operating system portfolio. Whilst I am quite content with the pure Google experience on the Nexus 4, I am just amazed by how much I like the Lumia 521.Here are some observations after about two weeks of usage.-FAST, fast, fast \u2013 There is no lag on this phone. It can hold up to the Nexus 4 without any issues. It blows the Galaxy Exhibit II out of the water about 2 miles away. Also the WP interface while loading large apps is much better than iOS or Android, I liked it when I saw it in action on Outlook.com and then the corresponding Andriod app.-Ergonomic Design / Construction \u2013 Love the battery cover and how nicely it comes off and goes back on again. Pretty light weight, right size as a phone and good balance/feel in the hand. This phone feels substantially superior to the Galaxy Exhibit II and at the same time is half price! The build quality on this phone is on par with the Nexus 4. The phone doesn\u2019t feel cheap despite the use of plastic!-Good Battery Life - Both the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy Exhibit II lose their charge much faster than the Lumia 521. It charges much faster than the other two Android phones that I have.-Camera \u2013 Nokia Smart Cam as a default app turned on with the dedicated camera key is a great feature. It takes really good pictures for a no name brand 5MP camera. Also the picture quality is much better than Nexus 4 or Galaxy Exhibit II, at least in my opinion. Nokia Creative Studio then helps out quite a bit in putting some nice finishing touches on the pictures.-Screen Display \u2013 I like the size, it seems just about right at 4 inches. Whilst it is not a super amazing display it is still a very nice screen. The screen is also quite sensitive and I can see why Nokia claims you can use this phone with gloves on your hands during winter months.-Great storage options \u2013 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card. I have a 16GB card installed so have 24GB total available on the phone. I cannot imagine getting a 24GB phone for about $110 from any other manufacturer.-Speaker \u2013 the quality of sound and the output level are amazing. The Nexus 4 speaker is downright pathetic in comparison.-No flash on camera \u2013 This is one minor irritant but not that big a deal. It takes reasonable pictures and then I can always process them later if I really like the low light picture. On other low cost devices there might be a flash but the actual camera and camera software is lousy and so the actual pictures are not that much superior anyways. I offer up two examples \u2013 Nexus4 and Samsung Galaxy Exhibit II \u2013 my two Android phones and of course the iPad2 has a horrible camera as well.-WP Ecosystem \u2013 This is a slightly weak spot in the overall experience. So far I am missing one music app (but the equivalent is actually just as good), Google Currents, a slightly better mobile  browser, and Vonage Extensions on the Lumia 521. I am not an Instagram user so that is not a deal breaker for me. The ability to sync my work and personal calendar and to have three live tiles \u2013 one for work email, one for Gmail and one for Hotmail on the home screen are huge advantages for me. Nokia Music, Nokia Maps are really good apps to use as well. The ability to sync files via the laptop and a USB cable is also quite convenient.In conclusion, if you're looking to try out WP8 or get a back-up smartphone for your $350 to $750 smartphone (Nexus to iPhone and everything in between) let me help you cut your chase short. Buy this phone for $99 on Amazon or Microsoft store for T-Mobile or Metro PCS or Straight Talk. You can even buy the Lumia 520 for the same price if you are a big fan of AT&T;/Aio or have a Straight Talk AT&T; compatible SIM card.At this price point I don\u2019t think there is an Android phone that can hold up to the performance of the Lumia 521/520. And Nokia is planning to roll out the WP8 GDR3 as Nokia Black update pretty soon so that makes this a really good phone with up to date hardware and an up to date OS for a price that is as good as a souped up feature phone. $99 Android phones running 4.4 Kitkat are still quite a ways away:-)", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Phone We've Ever Had", "Author": "Briana Kim", "ReviewID": "R36SGWJEOMTVGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to phones, I've had flip phones to slider phones, from the G1 to the Double play, and have owned nearly every brand and generic brand phones, so when i speak YOU should listen. With that being said, my husband and I were looking for budget phones till we get a GS4 at the end of the year, and stumbled on the Lumia 521. Our preference is to Android phones, as the majority of the phones we've had were android, so we instantly bypassed this phone because it was a Windows powered phone. After much painstaking searching, we were bummed. No budget 4g phones to buy and all arrows were pointing to this one. So began countless hours of research, reviews, and more reviews. We finally just said screw it and purchased two 4g Lumia 521's. Unpacking the phone was a joy and as we soon discovered, Windows 8 was the undiscovered jewel. First of, this phones dual-core processor and 512mb of RAM wouldn't make it very far in the Android world, but here it's snappy and responsive, no lag experienced and apps run smoothly. Secondly, this phone is the first phone we've ever had that allowed us to delete the slew of bloatware with a simple click. No more worries of rooting a phone just to be able to uninstall unwanted apps. Thirdly, while the main screen doesn't allow for much customization, you can change the apps on the live tile and change the color of the tiles as well. Fourthly, the phone has an amazing battery compared to other phones. Putting the battery saver on the setting \"always on (not recommended)\" preserves the battery. I'm not sure why it states it's not recommended to not have the battery saver on this setting, but we experienced two days on a single charge of light use! To maximize battery, set brightness to low, put automatic brightness on, and download a battery saver off of the Windows Store. Speaking of the store, we had heard that the Windows app store was incredibly small. Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps. But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free. With that being said, we found the W8 store to be plentiful with USEFUL apps, full of graphically cool games, and several jaw-dropping downloads that would cost money in the Android world. We rate this phone 10 out of 10 and would recommend it to all. On a side note, there is indeed hotspot/tethering on here, even though it's stated there is none. The on-screen keyboard works extremely well and the letters are nicely spaced out making two-hand typing more friendly.Pros:Awesome batteryGreat keyboardSnappy processorWindows Live TileTetheringGreat AppsLightweightResponsive ScreenAwesome Nokia Music AppCons:No LTE, which may be deal breaker for some, we really didn't careApp store may not have same apps as android, again no one has room for every single android app, let alone uses more than 20 apps IMHOLimited Main menu customization (tile color can be changed)", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun phone with some expected, and some unexpected limitations...", "Author": "adi", "ReviewID": "R3QOPMPHW83CQ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So the three phones I was most seriously considering: Google Nexus 4, LG Optimus L9 and Nokia Lumia 521. I decided to cross off the Nexus from the list purely based on price. I am just not ready to invest that much in a phone, this purchase was going to be my first smartphone. I ordered the L9 for my dad off amazon and waited to finally get a Lumia at Walmart. So I have had a chance to play with both of them.My uses for a phone: Talking, Texting, GPS, Playing Music, Light browsing (yelp, looking up restaurants, etc)Overall, I do like/love the Nokia.1)It's light, interface is clean. The layout and the ease of setting up everything is great. Lot of nice customization.2) Lumia feels solid. Feels good in the hand.*Compared to L9 - L9 looks a LOT sleeker, but also maybe slightly more fragile? L9 felt thinner, but felt better than the Lumia - better back.3) One big reason, I picked the Nokia is the maps/navigation can be used offline. So I thought that would be a cool feature.4) The sound is great, all apps run well. Videos on youtube played great, music sounds good, decent selection of apps. I installed all the apps I would want, and they all work well. Camera is adequate- nifty camera button on the side, so if you need to activate your camera quickly, you can launch it pretty fast.So those are some of the positives, and the positives are GOOD. Some gripes I have:1) In the GPS: There is no step by step directions list. Here Drive is in Beta, so I am hoping they will add it, but I don't know. The GPS will take you from point A to point B, BUT...I like to preview steps. A moderator's response to someone with a similar question:\"We might implement a list of directions in the future, but we would also like to know why you need them if you are going to get voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation anyway: isn't the map overview enough? If you miss the list so much, you can always calculate the route first on Nokia Maps and from there start the Nokia Drive navigation\"I did try that and it does work, only thing is, switching isn't as convenient as if there is a button that would just pull up the direction list. This reason alone, I am debating whether to keep it or not, I really like the phone though. And the GPS works fine otherwise, voice navigation.*GPS in the L9 does not have this problem, and seemed to be fine - also there is a voice input for destination in the L9. The Lumia can get around that (to an extent) by an app called \"Go to\" which you need to install but it's FREE!2) No Swype - which I knew beforehand, but texting with both phones: swyping with L9 felt more comfortable. Although I think it's just that I have to get used to typing on an onscreen keyboard (I am coming from a physical one, though I have used swype on friends' phones). And I have only had the 521 for 2 days, and it's getting better. The word predicting thing is already getting pretty accurate. So that's a plus.3) No front camera - I also knew this beforehand, but the L9 has it, and I think it would come in handy, gchat/skype all that good stuff, it would be nice to have.Final Thoughts: Sorry this was long, but I wanted to include as much as possible. L9 is probably the better phone (and only for a bit more - buy through amazon or HSN), but I really like the Nokia (almost love) only thing that's holding it back for me is really the step by step direction list. I just feel a lot more comfortable with that, if someone is giving me directions when I'm driving, I always ask what's after that...ok what's after that. So man. I am on the fence, but leaning towards keeping it.One thing I didn't get to test between the phones is battery life. No comment as of yet on that. Everything else works well. If the final version does have a direction list this would be a 4.5 star phone for me. Crossing fingers. Without it, a 3.5 to 4.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R3PKPY1Z8ROWVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is superb and a real testament to Nokia's greatness. Remember those old Nokia phones that everyone had in the 90's? You know, the ones that were great build quality and indestructible even though they were plastic? The ones that were so cheap it was easier to count how many of your friends DIDN'T have one? Well times have changed and we are in a smart phone world. Nokia almost died but they are once again making GREAT phones. This phone (and its 520 sibling on ATT) is a prime example.What is sooooo great about it you ask? Can a phone that I bought outright for $130 at the biggest discount chain in the world really be called GREAT? I believe it can, in the same sense that those old Nokia phones were GREAT.Those old Nokias were GREAT because they nailed 3 concepts. They nailed it on build quality, functionality for its intended purpose, and price. Let's compare these points one at a time.First up, they had GREAT build quality. Sure they were plastic and certainly weren't pretty but they were built solid and durable. I believe Nokia has done the same again with the Lumia 521. My experience tells me this phone is definitely solid and durable. About a day after I bought it I dropped it on a hard tile floor at a dept store. I didn't have a case or screen protector yet so I was really worried about my new phone. The back cover popped off and the battery flew out. The screen was face down. I picked it up and noticed the slightest dark scuff on the corner of the battery cover. I licked my finger and rubbed the dark scuff off. It was only dirt. To this day I can't find where that scuff was on the white cover. I did buy a case for it soon after but failed to buy a screen protector at the same time. I had the phone for about a month before I bought a screen protector. During that month I dropped it a few times. Each time the battery cover, case, and battery flew off. When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen. It looked like NEW! It didn't even have those little swirly micro scratches. I have since seen my screen protector get scratched (and self heal) multiple times and I have had it only about a week.Second, the old Nokia phones just worked and worked GOOD for basic functions. The Lumia 521 is for a new smart phone era and is required to do a lot more than the old Nokia bricks. But it does the basic smart phone functions very well. What are basic smart phone functions? Texting, email (multiple email services), Calendar (multiple online calendars), GPS navigation, Social Networks, Pictures, Music (streaming and local), Web, Most games, Phone and Speakerphone!!! Plus they are a lot more stable and less quirky than the Android alternatives, at least in my experience.Third, the old Nokias were cheap! Sure you could find other phones for the same price or cheaper but they failed miserably for build quality or basic functions. The Lumia 521 is a winner on this front. The total no-contract price you pay is cheaper than the on-contract down payment for a high end phone. It is cheaper than a month of service for many families and even some individuals. It hands down beats anything else for functionality at the price point. In fact I would rather have the Lumia 521 than a non-Lumia phone twice its price!Obviously I am enamored with my phone. Here are some things that surprised me about the Lumia 521:The camera: I really wasn't expecting much from the camera. I already had a Windows Phone 7.5 device with a 5 MP back side illuminated camera and a flash. I was expecting a downgrade because Nokia doesn't really claim anything special about the camera. And since there is no flash I thought it would be HORRIBLE. But I honestly like it better than the one on my previous phone. Nokia and MS have really done a good job with very little.The speakerphone: I have never owned a really high end phone but I have owned quite a few phones throughout the years, always getting a new one every 2 years at most. But the speaker volume and quality blew me away! I am very, very pleased! I have heard it isn't as good as a phone with BEATS audio but it sure blows away any other low to mid range phone my wife or I have owned in recent years.The touchscreen sensitivity: Nokia has done something really great with the touch screen on their latest smart phones, including the Lumia 521. They have introduced \"Super Sensitive Touch\" technology. What that means is you can use it with your gloves on. Now, I live in Texas and don't wear gloves in winter but I do ride a motorcycle and a bicycle. So I can just whip out my phone at a stop light and shoot off a quick text without taking my riding gloves off. Or I can mount it on the handlebar and easily use the GPS navigation or a fitness tracking app. I found that I get ghost touches sometimes with this feature turned on and I don't have gloves on. Fortunately, you can turn it off in settings when you know you won't be using it.Battery life: Windows phone has always touted good battery life. My HTC Radar 4G with WP7.5 lasted me the whole day most of the time, and that is saying a lot considering the intermittent signal I get in my work cubicle with all phones. When I first bought the Lumia 521 it had about the same battery life. But since the latest \"GDR2\" update the battery life absolutely ROCKS! I usually have about 40% charge left at the end of the day when I put it on the charger. My coworkers have to keep a charger at work with their Android phones.No SD card included: I consider this a good thing. This phone has a fair amount of built in memory and if you need more than that you most likely don't want the measly 2 or 4 GB card they would likely include with a low end phone like this. With this phone I don't have to pay for a card that I won't use. Instead, I can apply the money to a size that will meet my needs.All these things and more add up to the biggest bang for your buck in the smart phone world today. And for the price, you can afford to replace it if it gets lost, stolen, dropped in the pool, dropped in the toilet, dropped off a cliff, run over, vandalized, used as a hockey puck, slobbered on by your 1 year old, etc.  If you don't have one yet, go out and try one. You just might be surprised. If you have a high end phone, go out and buy one of these as a beater so you don't accidentally drop your precious $600 baby off the Ferris Wheel at the local fair.

Since I can no longer use my old lumia900 due to a broken screen, I needed something immediately. Still planning on getting the 925 once it comes out, I decided to go with the cheapest phone with 4g capacity.After a day of use, I really started fall in love with it.Things I really liked about it: lumia 521 is pretty light in my opinion. It feels a lot lighter than my old 900. The touch screen is super sensitive. In the manual, it says it works with gloves on. I tried, and it works great. The camera is also decent. I mean, its only 5mp, so I didn't expected much. But the noise in the picture is very low even with high ISO. it comes with a panorama app which i liked a lot. The time between shots are still a bit long, but it has this smartphoto app that takes four consecutive shots, which helped to solve the problem to a certain degree. It has wifi calling. I actually had never used this function on any other phones before, I'm not sure if lumia 900 has it, so I don't have anything to compare the quality of wifi calling with. It has removable batteries. The back cover is not the easiest thing to take off, but you know you can if you really need to. I really like the feel of the back cover as well.But there are a few things I don't like. Nokia really could have place the power button at a different place or at least change the side design. With the curve on the side, I always feel the phone is slipping out of my hand when I press the power button. There's no flash and no front camera. It does not have 4g LTE, but even the iphone 4s doesn't, so I think this is alright. And plus, 4G is really not slow at all.So bottom line is, you know you are not getting the most advanced phone in the world when you bought it, and you know this isn't something that's gonna blow your friends' mind when they see it.

You can really customize the phone to your liking (from the size of the tiles, the arrangement, the color, etc.) I can pin specific people to the start screen for quick access to call or text.

After having so many issues with my Exhibit, I didn't want to purchase another Samsung which left me with few options that were far more expensive.  By chance, I saw the announcement for the release of the Nokia 521 and decided to give it a try.  The price tag of $150 was the main reason I chose the phone.I'm a basic phone user.  Not really into all the tech specs, games or social media.  But I'll mention that later.  Overall, the phone was very easy to set up.  Installed my Outlook, Gmail and Yahoo email accounts without an issue.  Wi-Fi setup was a breeze.  The touchscreen is fast and very responsive.  Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.  No problems with the screen brightness as it is adjustable.  The buttons are strangely placed- the power button is directly below the volume controls and can be a little tricky to press depending on the case.  That's another thing- the cases for this phone are few and not all work with the model.Windows Phones are a bit different since the Live Tiles is a feature not included with my Android.  It's basically geared toward an active social lifestyle.  Tiles are customizable and it works with Facebook to constantly update your notifications, photos and status updates.  You can easily set up shared groups and a family room to communicate with family members (sharing notes, photos, calenders, etc).Apps: This is my biggest issue. Windows apps are different from those the Android market.  I expected there to be less to choose from (which is fine, I don't need thousands of gadgets) but I didn't quite expect all the apps to work so differently. I have the normal applications installed- Facebook, Pinterest,Tumblr, Amazon, Evernote, etc. Certain things are  difficult, for example, the Pinterest app is a major headache since the interface is laid out nothing like Android.  Facebook doesn't let you unlike pages or delete friends easily.Comes loaded with Nokia apps.  You can use the Maps offline, listen to music for free, etc.The camera is basic.Overall, it's a great phone.  I recommend it for anyone who wants a basic smartphone for a great price.  Feel free to ask any questions.  :)", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's Just the Best Selling Windows Phone in the World", "Author": "Richard Brennan", "ReviewID": "RLC1VN3ADERA0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes, the Lumia 520 / 521 is (by a large margin) the device that has put Windows Phone in the hands of more people than any other device. That's because with Windows Phone the experience is pretty much the same across all devices (aside from hardware). That means that whether you pay $100 for the 521 or $700 for the top-of-the-line Lumia 1020, you get the same features in your day-to-day experience. This automatically makes a lower-end device like this T-Mobile phone an attractive deal.That being said, what you are NOT getting in the 521 is a bright screen, LTE high-speed data, and a great camera. If you can make that trade-off (and obviously millions of people can), then this a great deal.A note on the lack of LTE - T-Mobile's non-LTE 4G service is VERY fast. So the lack of LTE is not as big a sacrifice as it would be if you are on, say, Sprint or Verizon (where the non-LTE data rates are horrible).In addition there are two hardware advantages of the 521 that are worth noting.  * It feels great in the hand - not too big, quite thin and light. You'll forget it is even in your pocket.  * It does WiFi calling. Even if you are in a building that has lousy T-Mobile cell reception, if you are connected to WiFi then the phone will send / receive calls using your in-house network instead. This can be a huge plus. For example, in my apartment I am on a side of the building that gets iffy reception in some rooms. With this feature, that is no longer an issue. All my calls go through the my WiFi router and are crystal clear. Only T-Mobile has this service, and not all TMo phones can do it. This one can.Weigh these advantages against:  * Photos are average for a smartphone camera. (Ok, maybe slightly above average.)  * There is no flash. Mostly I miss this because I can't use a flashlight app to help pick up dog poop in the dark.  * While adding an SD card will let you load tons of music, video, etc - there is limited memory space for apps. Many will never notice this, but if you want to load a lot of games, you may hit that ceiling.  * The screen is OK - but not great in sunlight and not the kind of HD resolution we are becoming used to.  * For a phone with a 4\" screen, it is not exactly small. As a matter of fact I put it next to my Moto X (with a 4.7\" screen) and they are almost exactly the same size. It's not huge, by any measure, but don't expect an iPhone sized device just because it has a smaller screen.In short, it is pretty good value for money and perfect if you want to give Windows Phone a try, or need a second phone on a cheap plan. If you need more network speed or a better camera, then the Lumia 925 (on T-Mobile) or Lumia 1020 (on At&T;) will make you VERY happy - but they will cost 6 or 7 times as much.***Update 2-14-2014I've gotta share this. Last week my Lumia went through the wash AND the dryer before I found the phone, back cover, and battery mixed in with clothes. My heart sank. I put it on the dresser and just left it for a week, and put the SIM in another backup phone.Today I put the SIM back in and turned it on... and it's working just fine! Kind of unbelieveable. This is a tough little guy.*** New to Windows Phone? ***Let's get some of these basic questions out of the way:Why is the processor / memory specs so low?Windows Phone is a light operating system that doesn't require much hardware to run well. The real question is: how fast does it run? The answer is very fast; very responsive. This is just as zippy as Nokia's top-of-the-line Lumia 1020 when it comes to everyday tasks. You won't see any lag until you run graphic-intensive games or photo editing.Why can't I customize the background like in Android / iOS?Because there is no background. The Windows Phone screen uses tiles, not app icons. Many tiles are \"live\", which mean that they show you information without having to actually open up the app. For example, weather alerts, new email or voice message, what someone has just posted on facebook or twitter. You can resize and arrange the tiles, and actually get quite fancy and graphically interesting, if you want. (See my pics.)http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1OZRLSQTX4G7Q/B00COYOAYW/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1OZRLSQTX4G7Q/B00COYOAYW/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkIs there an app for Facebook? Dropbox? Twitter? Instagram?...etcIf you mean an \"official\" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no. If you mean can I do Facebook; acccess my Dropbox files; do Twitter; post, search, or browse instagram - then the answer is almost always yes. Third-party developers are happy to step in to a vacuum an sell you their Dropbox (or whatever) client. They are all in the Windows Store.What about music and media? Can I play my iTunes stuff?The XBox Music system gives you music, podcasts, video, games, and apps. (Sound familiar iTunes and Google Play fans?) You can import your iTunes music from your computer to the phone. You can store music on the phone SD card, or in \"the cloud\" on SkyDrive.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia is where it's at lol", "Author": "Patrycja =]", "ReviewID": "R14JETPOZY3TJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing phone for the price.

I wanted to stick with Nokia, believing that getting my contacts and other data loaded into a new lumia phone would be easy using the Suite. Being a T-Mobile customer, I thought transferring my account to the new phone could be done easily online. I was wrong. Luckily, I already had an outlook mail account to turn to. After manually loading in my old contacts into that email account (2 hours), my phone was syncing and ready to make calls. Also, a relatively quick call to T-Mobile completed the account setup. I am not that excited about my contact information living 'in the cloud', but hopefully, the next time a phone dies I can recover from it more quickly. Certainly I was disappointed that, in 2013, it can still be a royal pain to manage contacts going from handset to handset. Can't all these digital systems just, get along?OK. Going from a premium Nokia handset to Nokia's cheapest offering means a loss of some features, specifications, and build quality. What I am learning, however, is that this budget phone is hardly crippled - it runs awesome. Most premium phones offer larger, better screens, better cameras, and better build materials. My last phone was metal, so pulling the 'cheap' plastic cover off the new phone was a little bit strange - so were the 'cheap' buttons. But my experience with premium devices (and I include the Nexus 7 here) has been that, even with top of the line processors, cameras, lots of RAM, etc., most do not really deliver performance and features that make upgrading an OBVIOUS choice. This phone costs 4-5 times less than Nokia's other top offering for T-Mobile, the 925, but hardly feels like a budget phone.The phone feels great in hand (a little slippery). The glass screen is great, and the buttons click and fall easily to hand. The plastic helps keep the phone light, it is still durable, and does not interfere with antennas like metal can. Having a removable cover and cheap battery easily replaceable is also a godsend considering the inconvenience of permanent batteries. There is no front-facing camera (don't care), 8 gb internal storage, 512 Ram, and a 1 ghz dual-core snapdragon processor. I threw a 16 gb card into the phone, and deleted all the pre-installed cr-apps since I knew I wouldn't use them. Contrary to what I read online, I don't see the storage or RAM limitations as a major issue - 1 gb is the upper-limit for Nokia's phones at this time, and I do not tend to heavily multi-task. Also, there may be 1 zillion apps in the world currently, but I only like a handful of them as it is. I have a tablet for more robust gaming/app needs.Despite its specs, the 521 runs great. The experience is smooth, the screen is bright and sharp (with some minimal bleed in the dark), the buttons feel good, and texting / browsing is simple and fun. The app store (like all app stores) is set up with a lot of categories, but I still find \"browsing\" limited - I feel like I need to know what I am looking for. But all my favorite apps were in there. The call quality is great, the speaker phone is louder and clearer than my old \"premium\" phone, and headphones sound great (better than my nexus 7). GPS worked fast and without hiccups when navigating. The camera is OK in good lighting, and 5 MP is still good nuff for an 8x10 assuming you get a good shot. Given that even 'premium' phone cameras still fail, in my opinion, to really replace a rudimentary point-and-shoot (especially in low-light), this is totally fine with me. There are some interesting camera apps to try out, and I'll look forward to seeing if they deliver better results (by basically doing 'burst modes').The MS Phone 8 software feels fresh, is very elegant, and really should give Apple and Android the night-sweats. But I have little doubt that it is harder to use out-of-box than iOS. That said I find it very 'premium' feeling. I love the live-tiles, customization, and overall presentation of most of its core features. I did need a couple days to learn the ins and outs a bit (at first the whole setup was confusing). There are some OS features missing that I want to see put in. Most importantly, I like Androids ability to close an open app by swiping it away, and Android and Nokia's pull down menus that let you easily turn off/on things like data, wi-fi, GPS, and Bluetooth (I am trying an app called \"quick settings\" which is mainly a bunch of short-cuts). Oddly, I can't seem to pick a home page in Internet explorer. Also, stock MS settings are a real battery drain - it is a good idea to read up on web tips for maximizing battery life. For starters, it is so easy to set up email accounts that I did 2 right away - then remembered I need to change the sync settings to balance update/power use. Auto-rotation is not active in all screens/apps, which is annoying when I feel like typing in landscape mode, but then again typing has been fast and accurate in portrait mode so far. There are also features on by default which are totally unneeded. Windows Phone is definitely a modern OS, and a good one at that, but it will benefit from more development. Hopefully the 8.1 update and others will hit this phone as they become available. I really hope they do, as updates are critical to keeping the experience fresh, reliable, and fun. Heck, half the reason I got a nexus was to ensure updates would be forthcoming.The most compelling reason to go Nokia is probably the free GPS + Navigation. Hands down, they are the best free solution I know of at this time, and they are exclusive to the brand. Most of Nokia's other apps are useful and add value to the overall experience. They are generally reliable phones also, and will survive drops, bumps, and a little water.The bottom line is that this phone is probably up there with the Nexus 7 in electronic super-values available at this time. Unless you have $300-500 dollars to burn, there are likely no better choices if you want an excellent smart-phone experience for a super-reasonable cost. I would gladly have paid another $100 dollars for a somewhat better screen (gorilla glass and a little higher res?), camera, more RAM, and a larger battery (and Nokia's 'altered reality' GPS app). But as is, I find no real faults here, just huge value.

Sure, there's no flash and the screen isn't the best around but, when you're paying such a low price for such a nice phone, you can't complain. Inclusion of a microSD card slot for expanded storage and Nokia's range of excellent (and exclusive) apps are major pluses for the 521.

Windows Phone OS is really innovative and fun if you are tired of Android and Apple iOS. Overall, I concur with other reviewers that this is an amazing value proposition that leaves only a little to be desired.  The only thing I really wish is for a front facing camera and brighter/bolder screen.  Here's some things you may not know.1) The Nokia Here Drive/Map apps give you free download of maps so you can do GPS turn by turn directions without using a data plan.  These apps are very good and will get you from point A to point B accurately. The GPS on this phone also locks onto satellites very quickly.2) This comes with WIFI calling app that you can setup to use with your wifi connection. If you have bad reception in your home or office, activating wifi calling will give you perfect reception to get/make calls (assuming your wifi/internet connection is good). Setting up WIFI calling though is rather a chore in patience. Note that your minutes used with WIFI are counted against your plan.3) Downloading skydrive app will allow you to sync your photos/docs/videos for free on your Microsoft SkyDrive account automatically. Up to 7GB free storage when you sign up. Skydrive is good for sharing photos with friends or between phones.4) The phone can play mp4 and avi videos but is finicky. Some videos will not play due to encoding variations. However, you can download the free Windows/Mac Desktop HandBrake application to re-encode your videos that will play very smoothly on your phone.5) You can hold down the \"back\" button and see all the apps running in the background. Hold down the \"windows\" button and make a voice command.6) You can pin a lot of items as a main screen tile. Items like contacts and single website pages can be pinned.7) You plug the phone into your PC using the usb cable and it will show up as a drive in your computer (with subfolders) where you can copy your media. You can also download the official Windows Phone application from Microsoft to sync your photos, music, and videos.After a few weeks of using this--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Still really like the phone. I had to drop it down from 4 stars to 3. HOWEVER, uploading music after installing SD card is MADNESS! I have a lot of music, so I installed a 32gb San Disk. I used the Window Phone software to sync my music and every song has a double entry. If you try to resync again, you will get quadruple entries. THere's no solution for this. I tried everything I can think of!  You can read the Microsoft support forums and nobody know show to fix this problem and Microsoft just ignores it. And reading the card is PAINFULLY SLOW. I used the same 32GB Sandisk car in WIndows phone 7.5 and it ran beautifully, never having any problems. If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone. The fact that they haven't fixed this for so long boggles my mind. It's a huge complaint when using SD cards in Windows Phone.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "A. Rekas", "ReviewID": "R1TBX390AI8OWW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to upgrade from my Lumia 710 on T-Mo since all the newer apps are only coming to WP8. The phone itself is a nice size, a little bigger than what I had before, but not overly big like the more popular phones - it also has a solid build to it but still feels nice and light in your hands. It comes preloaded with many NOKIA exclusive apps, which help make the WP OS pretty awesome in my opinion - I'm much more likely to buy a NOKIA WP than a HTC now because of the exclusive apps. The 5MP Camera is good, supposedly it will be getting NOKIA's PUREVIEW technology to make the camera better via a software update, but it's more than enough for what I use it for. Speakerphone is good, works well for when I use it. Screen is responsive as are the side buttons which feel solid. I was lucky enough to nab one of these from big W for $130, which makes it even more of a great deal. $130 for a quality smartphone OFF-CONTRACT is awesome, which is why I almost saw no reason not to upgrade from my 710.Just a few little CONS:I'm not wild about the white backing, I would really like the ability to buy a cyan or yellow back plate, but the Lumia 520 shells apparently don't fit the Lumia 521. Hopefully Nokia will eventually start selling them.While the screen is larger (4\") than what I had before on my Lumia 710 (3.7\"), it isn't very sharp, almost the same if not worse quality than what I previously had. It's not terrible, just not nearly as nice as the newer phones.Even though it's more of a budget phone, I still wish it had Corning's Gorilla Glass - otherwise it feels really strong.No front camera - this isn't a huge issue for me, but I'll probably be using skype a lot more now and it would be nice. Not a deal breaker, but it would be nice.Overall the phone is great, my cons are just little nit-picky things that obviously didn't deter me away from buying it and I'm still very satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.UPDATE 6/29/13Still enjoying the phone, however it is randomly resetting itself, which can be a little frustrating at times.

The Music player is awkward and tends to play things unexpectedly. In some modes, the device will be playing a song and there's no \"pause\" button in evidence, just a \"play\" button that doesn't magically stop playing anything. The user interfaces are generally not well organized.Check lists in some apps are more difficult to use than in others. It should be a standard window widget, I have no idea why it's harder to get the checks to appear in some apps than others.Apps remain thin and the apps that do exist are so-so.There's not enough main memory in the device and/or memory is badly managed. I have a 32GB SD card in it with over 15GB free but I can't get the maps to go to the SD card, they are stuck in internal phone memory. It's awaiting  a Windows update but I don't have enough free space in the internal phone memory to run the update, so I must delete the maps to make room for the update. Yes, similarly, you can't readily load the update to the SD card and run it from there. Why fight it? I'll just delete the maps and download them again after the update is finished.It does do hotspotting fairly well, although it seems to switch itself off when it thinks you're done using the hotspot feature and that can be annoying but I'll just accept that it prevents me running up a data bill and pretend I like the behavior. It's somewhat awkward to control these things, too.I switched to a new PC with Windows 8 and it allegedly has Windows Phone support but it seems you must go to the web and get the Windows Phone App or you're left managing the phone basically as a memory device. Microsoft's message, that the Phone support is built-in, is confusing.The Internet Explorer on the phone is not a good implementation of a web browser. I have difficulty with, oh, 25% of the sites I attempt to use. I had trouble entering flight dates on Travelocity, for example.I still have an iPod Touch, the one released in '10, and I prefer it for almost all apps and activities.However, having logged in and seen that the price has fallen to $70 or so, I'm not going to take away a star. For that price, it's a decent phone and, if you don't like the way it works, get an old iPod touch and use it via the 521 hotspot to get things done.The camera remains the one unadulterated bright spot. It does take a good picture.Original Review:I've been using it for two weeks.It's a full featured smartphone at a great price (I got mine from T-Mobile at $149 plus tax). The camera is excellent at this price. The performance on apps is good and it seems to be just as good as my old phone at pulling in signals. It works fine as a hotspot (one of my reasons for purchase).There's a Windows Phone app for the PC that handles the basics of the phone nicely (it's easy to copy iTunes music playlists to the phone and it's easy to move photos back and forth). Sound quality in music mode is good.I like the live tiles idea, it's used in some of the apps I use and is a benefit.The Windows interface is generally easy to use.The navigation apps (\"Here\", \"Drive\", \"Transit\") are very good (seems like lightning-fast GPS acquisition). I think they could integrate between each other a bit better and I'd like the option of explicitly shutting the GPS off (maybe it can be but I haven't figured out how). The map screens are great, especially the night one. (9/25 - It would be helpful if maps could be stored on the extended memory chip - it does not seem to have an option for this. To run the Amber update, I had to delete the maps to get enough space for the update.)I like the Wi-Fi calling feature I get on T-Mobile because there are a couple places I go regularly where service isn't good but I can still make and take calls over Wi-Fi. The phone app does occasionally get confused when switching from wi-fi to 2/3/4G calling. (9/25 - Amber update didn't fix this, however, the convenience of Wi-Fi \"service\" means that I don't mind if it occasionally gets confused)It also receives FM broadcasts (as of the Amber update I applied on 8/28).It has a user-replaceable battery (I wish my iDevices did). (9/25 - there's a higher-capacity battery available, I'm ordering it).Still, there are some things to consider.The Windows app store is thin (but improving as of 8/29).My Yahoo! contacts integrate nicely with my iPod Touch (my former \"smartphone\", as it had Skype and Pinger) but not at all with the Lumia. There is a two-stage transfer process that I haven't worked through yet. Syncing would be a far better solution.The music player is not as friendly as an iPod. I can play a playlist, artist or album but it's awkward to interrupt it and move on to something else. Music playback quality, however, is good (8/29 - I'm getting used to it).I didn't pay for a data plan upgrade, so I'm limited to 500MB of unthrottled access. Using Wi-Fi is mostly seamless but switching from a \"Wi-Fi preferred\" to \"Yeah, go ahead use my 4G allocation now for phone apps\" to \"Go for it, let's hotspot\") involves juggling a couple of different screens. I might end up paying an extra $10/month for the 2GB service that puts this concern to rest. I'm getting through a month on less than 100MB, so maybe I should worry less about this but I am a cheapskate on phone charge. What would really help would be the ability to select telecomm modes from the home screen or a single applet.There's some sort of X-Box games tie-in in the music player... not of interest to me at all, so it's annoying.Battery life is not great. However, it uses a standard Micro-USB cable to charge, so it's easy get extra USB AC or car power adapters, extra Micro-USB cables and plug it in everywhere you go.I had to set up a link to my Yahoo! mail (mail works, as noted contacts don't) but I've declined the Microsoft ID and the Nokia ID, so far. All in all, it seems like managing IDs starts to become awkward. It's true that the iPod wasn't much better but at least it only prompts for an iTunes ID, and not separate for hardware and software (and, maybe, games and music, I haven't explored all the possibilities and I don't particularly want to).Overall, it's hard to beat at the price and, except for contacts, the device does pretty much everything I need.

Turn off background apps and this thing runs a while!The phone is little (the 4 inches of screen is very narrow) but the touch sensitivity is great.Also, I had never used Windows Phone OS before and it is zippy. You look at the specs of this phone and think it's going to be sluggish, but the interface and launching apps is very fast. *** That being said, if you are used to Android or iOS then you will be disappointed. There are a lot of apps that I truly love on those (Plume, Flipboard, Cartwheel, Dunkin Donuts Pay, Starbucks Pay, Snip Snap) that are not available on Windows. That might not be a big deal for people newly getting into smartphones, but now that I know what's out there, it is hard to be satisfied with less.The screen resolution is poor compared to high end phones, but due to the smaller screen size it is not unbearable to look at by any means.I love how all of the battery saving options are made very clear and background apps are identified so you don't overdrain your battery. That said, if you use your phone heavily, the battery can drain aggressively when doing various functions, but it also warns you when the battery drops significantly in a short period, so if you know you won't be near an outlet soon, you can change your usage habits.Also, the Nokia Offline Music and Here Maps are crazy! Download some stuff while you're online then you can have access to GPS Maps and music offline for FREE!?!?!I honestly bought it because I knew at the very least I get a $70 GPS/MP3 player that has Wifi capability and can be a back up phone if I need.Shocked, surprised, impressive, all for the price point.You have to know what you're getting into and I'm a pretty big tech nerd (I used to have a Google Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and right now this thing performs faster and is less glitchy.Battery life is also acceptable. Read the Microsoft tips page on the website for battery saving and don't use it 24/7 and you can get most likely get a full day out of it, provided you aren't constantly downloading/watching stuff.Anyone who is hesitant about Windows phones or T-Mobiles network this is THE start phone to get.Let me know if you have questions, but considering I was running a high end phone before and still like this little guy (a lot) it's hard to go wrong at the price with T-Mobiles $30 unlimited data and text plan, it makes it a smartphone you can actually use all the time as a smartphone.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, cheap phone", "Author": "MikeG", "ReviewID": "R1Y3VUBXYNQERO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife's Lumia 721 developed a problem with the charging port just before we were leaving for Europe so I got one of these for her while I sent the 721 for repair. (The 721 was back before we were, no charge. Just use the Nokia site.)Got it in two days using Amazon Prime for over double the current price but don't regret it. We had very limited data in Europe but that did not detract from the main use: Nokia Drive+ and Here maps. Drive+ lets you download the maps you need so you don't need a data connection to use it. The only drawback that we didn't know about is that you have to buy a $20 license for Drive if you use it outside the country where it is registered. Try to do that before you need it if data or wifi is limited. But after getting the license, drive and maps worked great.Another advantage of the Windows Phone 8 version is that you can go to here.com, a mapping site run by Nokia. You can find places and add them to collections which then will show up as favorites on Nokia Drive and maps on the phone automatically as long as you use the same Microsoft account for both the web and phone. Pretty cool. So, I could plan our trip ahead and add locations we wanted to visit, or hotels and didn't have to add them manually on the phone.As a phone, it works great. Wifi and bluetooth are fine. Has built in FM if you use wired earphones.About the only slight drawback is that the screen is not gorilla glass and doesn't have Nokia's Tru-Black screen tech that makes most of its other phones readable in sunlight.

Windows phones OS is outstanding, and has never crashed.  I have restarted the phone only once, when I installed the micro SD card (you have to remove the battery ).Only drawbacks are: smaller screen size and no flash for the camera.

So for the price I can credit the seller and I am glad to see this price is the best on amazon.com.The phone is easy to use, the screen home page is tiled and you can arrange it anyway you want. The phone comes with an initial screen protector showing the labels for all the buttons however these buttons are not labeled on the case so I left it on for a few days until I memorized what each button does.I purchased the sim kit from walmart for the $30 month unlimited data and 100 mins of voice. The trick with that is you must sign up as a new phone number and pick this option, it is ONLY for NEW accounts. This option only appears once during sign up and so you can't change your plan to the $30 plan later. The sim kit MUST be purchased from Walmart.The phone comes with a sim kit in the box, so if you want the walmart deal you'll have to leave the sim from the box alone until you put in the walmart sim card.The phone worked right out of the box without a sim card using it's wifi capabilities. I was able to connect to my home wifi without any problem. Only 911 calls can be made without the sim card but you can still use the internet and search the app store.Once the phone was setup I was able to use the full features without a problem. I did find that the phone probably needs to be rebooted at least 1 time a day or the OS starts to get laggy when switching around different screens. Either it is the windows OS or one of the other apps on the phone so I can't say if the windows OS is slow. Most of the time the OS works smoothly and the touch screen is sensitive so you barely need to touch it, I am sure that will preserve the screen longer so it's a good feature.I tested the camera out and it took good photos indoors without any flash. As others have said this phone does not have a flash but the digital camera can handle most low light situations. If you use the Nokia Smart camera feature that was a good way to capture a good photo in low light, it snaps a series of quick photos and you can pick the best one to keep. There are a lot of good photo editing software already included and some very nice free photo editing apps in the app store.Since the phone is from Microsoft it helps if you have an account with msn, you can sign up and the phone is tied right in to the sky drive features where you can store you photos, media and documents nicely as well as have access to your hotmail or msn email accounts. Also the messenger from msn works on this phone.Google has a smaller presence on this phone as can be expected with the competition however there is some great gps applications and I loved the nokia music app, it streams radios or offers an offline radio feature, on top of that if you swipe through the screens it will locate live music events in your area! How cool is that!?Now for the downside, as you know this is not an iPhone or a galaxy. Unfortunately it is very hard to find accessories at any local shops for the Nokia Lumia 521. Even if they sell the phone they will say they do not carry accessories for it so you will best spend your time on amazon.com, Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases. There are some standard features which makes this phone compatible with a generic min usb phone charger. Actually I did find a small vendor at the local mall that had protective case for the Nokia Lumia 521 but it was so limited just 4 basic colors and none of the variety I found on amazon.com. Purses and pouches are a different story, most of those created a product that can be used with a generic smartphone size and this phone fits right in most of those items without a problem. I'd suggest just testing the phone pouches first before buying though to make sure.Another downside which was very disappointing to me was that I could not use the amazon cloud player app on this phone so I can not listen to my mp3 which are in my amazon digital vault. Very disappointed about that, but there is an amazon shopping app and the kindle app also works on this phone so that's indicating to me that soon I will be able to use the amazon cloud player as well.So speaking of the app store you have to fish around in there, the search is not always intuitive so you have to figure out the right keyword to locate things. I found that a bit frustrating, it's not as easy to shop for apps on the windows 8 phone as it is on an android so I hope they fix this.So if you want a good entry smart phone that is cheap and can be used with the T-mobile wifi calling feature (which is awesome by the way) this is a good phone to get. Just be aware this is not an iphone or a galaxy and it is not an android OS so it seems that there are just some things you'll have to learn to do without.I also have an android tablet pc so I do not really need to do everything that the tablet can do anyway, the screen on the phone is small so surfing the web is difficult as it needs to be zoomed in to click links. Most of the websites offer a mobile version but you have to pray they also support the microsoft windows 8 phones.Over all I am happy and really the wifi calling feature is what sold me on this phone on top of the pricing.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can use with T-Mo Pay As You Go Plan BUT", "Author": "DDLB", "ReviewID": "R1ZKD09551XC5I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off I buy most everything from Amazon.  I LOVE Amazon.  But I always check other sources and found the phone $17 cheaper elsewhere.  Now Amazon has matched that price which I found amazing but too late.That being said I had checked with T-Mo to make sure I could transfer my old Pay As You Go sim (larger size) with $80 worth of time to the 521 (mini sim).  Indeed I could.  All I had to do was call T-Mo and the phone number and $80 was transferred over to the 521 and I was good to go.Since the old phone was a back-up phone for my senior husband it was only used for an occasional call or texting ($ .20/.10 each).  Now, however he can get online with wifi and fiddle around with tons of apps including free texting apps/Facebook - etc.  One app I am still hoping to get however is the Magic Jack app - which presently is only available for the iPhone and Android.  So Keep in mind a lot of apps are NOT available on a Win 8 phone.BUT one thing I learned was this.  With the T-Mo Pay as you go plan you do not get any data period.  But more important is this fact.  The 521 comes with wifi calling.  I thought this was a wonderful feature until I found out if would use MINUTES IF you have the Pay as you go plan!  Since I did NOT have a T-Mo unlimited minute plan it uses minutes whether you use the phone and use wifi calling or the T-Mo cellphone tower.  Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).  But that is ok because I get a poor T-Mo signal at my house anyhow.  So the phone is set to prefer wifi for calling but is seldom used for calling anyhow.Kind of confusing right? But the bottom line is if you do get a poor T-Mo signal at your house this phone will direct the call over wifi first if you choose that option.  But like I said it will use your minutes if you have the Pay as You Go plan.  I have had Pay as You Go for about 5 years now - only costs $10 a year to buy minutes so all your unused minutes roll over for another year.Ok now to review the phone (if you have read this far).  This phone is excellent!  Good sound quality - decent camera - etc.  Well worth $100.  If nothing else you can use it as a camera and MP3 player.

The phone doesn't lag even with its lower specs, the screen is perfect for one-handed use, it's light and easily slips in and out of my pocket and it simply doesn't feel cheap even though it was!I love having all the integrated services available in the Microsoft ecosystem, including Office, Outlook(dot)com. X-Box, SkyDrive and more, which compete toe-to-toe with anything Google or Apple have to offer. It's a refreshing change of scenery with just the right amount of customizability without overwhelming me with options.And say what you will about the so-called limited app selection, I am having no trouble finding the things I want and need on Windows Phone. I don't always get all the exact same apps I had with Android, but I have found alternatives that are just as good or in those few cases where there isn't anything available, there's always mobile web versions of the sites and services I need that suit me just fine. If you're not picky about having all the EXACT apps you're addicted to, you won't have any trouble getting the functionality you need with any WP8 device. Those who are on the fence, just know Microsoft is not backing down from mobile and the apps will come with time.On the downside, eventually I'll want a phone that takes great photos so I know this won't be my daily driver for long, but the camera is adequate for my immediate needs and much better than what I was using prior. Also, the limited 8 GB of memory can be troublesome considering you can't install apps on an SD card, but for a casual to moderate smartphone user it shouldn't be a problem.All-in-all, I have very little to complain about with WP8 and this phone in particular.

In addition, I wanted to note that as I am using it as my personal media device, I can monitor the T-mobile reception.Currently, I have a ZuneHD 32GB that is attached to my X-box Music subscription which allows me to download my music and listen to them monthly without WiFi, although I never purchased them. I would periodically need to connect to a network to show that I am still a subscriber, but it works great. For those that are trying to do what I am doing, make sure that you download the song to the phone (and do not buy).As you can see, these devices are no longer supported and they have aged. This is where this phone comes into play. This device natively plays my protected music. I expanded the data with a 32GB microSD card. In result, I found a replacement ZuneHD, which is supported (+), with more memory storage (+), a decent camera (+), Microphone for WiFi Calls (check out the apps), and has a speaker. This device is more responsive and is cheaper than when I bought my Zune media player. I can check out YouTube and surf the web better my previous device.Just with the noted features above, I give it a five. So there is also the phone portion of the device.I do not have the service. I did not know if it would work in location that I would need it given the complaints that I have seen on the web. Well, without the service but with the SIM card attached, I can still monitor the signal strength! I have a minimum of 2 bars of 4G on where I need it. I look forward in using it in the future.Finally, for those that have an android phone with all their contacts stored in google, this phone syncs up with it!I have been completely impressed with this phone for the price. It is smooth.In result, the value of this phone is way more than what it is being sold. It is a great Zune/Xbox music player, with the ability to use wifi and surf the web.

The learning curve is nothing.The drawbacks now that we are using the phone is that:1. MS Xbox Music wants to \"sync\" online when playing music so you will see a HARD lag with the phone. This makes me want to upgrade to a faster phone with more ram to see if this gets corrected.2. The 8 GB memory gets used up fast even though I requested everything to be placed on my SD card.

It has always kept up with my abusive behavior of switching between 10 apps every minute.  The screen is big enough to enjoy watching movies on.  There is no better deal that I could find for the price.  It has 8 gigs internal memory!So here are the quirks:1.) Loose battery connection - The battery will slip out of place because the prongs are set a little too loose if it is shaken or shifted too quickly in your pocket.  This was super annoying as it turned my phone off several times a day.  I found out that many people had this problem.  To fix it, just wrap some paper around the battery to stick it in tight.2.) Limited apps and limited \"messing with it\" - This was a sad one for me because there is absolutely no way to explore the internal files on the phone.  Windows didn't build a file explorer into the system on purpose (security, hacks).  I hate not being able to get to the internal organs of my phone but I have to deal with it.  The apps are limited.  Companies make apps for iphones and androids and few make them for windows phones.3.) Many things don't save onto SD card - This is the very worst thing, in my opinion.  It only saves pictures, video, and music obtained the \"proper\" way.  If you install an app to search and download music beware.  It will save it to phone memory and there is no way to transfer it to the sd card!So, I just listed the bad things so you'll know, but the truth is I really like this phone.

I began with the Droid Global (Android OS, in case it isn't obvious), I loved it but it bogged down within a year of heavy use, the apps running in the background really do kill the phone after a while.  I switched to T-Mobile and tried the Nokia Lumia 710, I had it for a year until I recently had a biking accident and smashed the screen to pieces (RIP phone)...but that phone had Windows 7 OS and even after a year, it never \"slowed down\" like the iPhones and Android phones do alike.  This phone, the Nokia Lumia 521, has the Windows 8 OS (quite the upgrade from Windows 7), after just a year Nokia was able to release a product with a better OS, the Windows market is clearly expanding, and aside from the pointless cons, this phone is truly worth your money.*The \"new\" phone price on Amazon was half that of what the price was on the T-Mobile website. You will get absolutely the same product, but cheaper. Keep that in mind.Pros:-The ability to make tiles bigger and smaller, helping group up separate categories for apps.-It literally took me under 10 minutes to update everything on the phone, download a handful of apps that I use, syncing my contacts, these guys really do make it easy.-I don't care what people say, the app store is more than sufficient. Although Microsoft did make the mistake of getting into the market much later than the Android and iOS, they're playing catch up and giving them a run for their money. (Taking half a star off for it not being 'up to par' with everything yet, but it's still more than enough).-You can't beat the price for what you get.  An efficient phone with most of the features other modern high end phones come with, Nokia's included apps, at 1/4 the cost of these new high end phones. No flash? Oh no, I'm going to cry. *Sarcasm-It's the perfect size, but it will slip out of your hand if you're not careful: Easy fix, purchasing a $2 phone case on Amazon to give it more protection and grip.Cons:-The app store.  As explained before, it could be bigger..but it has everything you should need, and it's growing.  So, not a huge con on my end.In the end, it's an all around great phone.  Android and Apple do have their perks as well, and I can easily navigate through any of them, but Windows has provided the best experience for me so far.

I'm definitely a tech-friendly person, and this is my honest review of the product.  I've read countless reviews, and the only cons I see are simple ranting of people hate Windows 8, and if they happened to get a defective device, stuff happens, sorry to say.This is a great phone for your money, and even better saving money with T-Mobile. Windows definitely has my support.I hope this was worth the read. Have a good one.______________________________________________________________April 1st product update.After four months of medium usage, this phone is still working as well as when I've received it.  I've had more time to explore Windows and what it has to offer, Nokia keeps updates coming regularly, and I can certainly say I'm not insanely disappointed on any end.  My only drawback is seeing that a lot of companies and products are keeping away from making proper Windows applications, but it's nothing that will keep you from buying this phone if you're on a budget.  Onedrive has already done wonders for me with college, and I've received a fair amount of compliments on the phone itself.

On the Nokia side, the hardware and build is superb for the price. You wanna talk about plastic, grab a Samsung galaxy at $600. This phone is plastic but is beautiful.  I never use the front facing cameras so I don't miss it. The flash that is missing on the back can be made for, by adjusting the camera settings. I miss a lot of the apps from Android but they will come, give it a chance. This os is less than a year old.Update: not going back to Android anytime soon. The Windows Phone is has me impressed. I guess I grew up tired of my Androids lagging and freezing up all the time. I'm staying with this phone for at least a year. Most popular apps have ports via third-party developers on Windows Phone. Vine, twitter,tumblr, Facebook, reddit, every major app is there. I can't find good spreadsheet, vpn, PDF, programming apps though, but I'm a power user that buys cheap phones. Call me cheap, or smart buyer. But I'm willing to give all those apps up for this smooth phone. I still use my previous Android if I need to use those power apps, but this phone is my everyday workhorse. One major thing missing is that the browser can't save passwords.

I knew from experience with my work phone that a cheap Android phone meant an undersized processor, last-gen OS, and endless frustration.  So I took a risk on the Lumia 521.  The app selection is pretty weak, but the basic features of the phone meet my needs.  Basic browser, maps, email/text, all at 4G speeds.  The processor seems to have plenty of oomph to keep things running smoothly.In the future I might pony up a few extra dollars for a nicer phone.  The plastic case on the Lumia's kind of flimsy, and the camera could use some work.

I'm retired, live on a fixed income, and am always searching for ways to stretch a dollar.  The Nokia 521 may be the best bargain going in smartphones.I'll begin by saying that this is my FIRST smartphone.  Wal-Mart offers this Family plan deal (no contract) through T-Mobile for $29.99 monthly for unlimited phone and texts.  For $10 more, you can purchase a plan that provides unlimited data.  I thought, \"Finally, here\u2019s a plan I can afford, now I just need to find the right phone to pair with it.\"  The Lumia 521 and the Wal-Mart plan is a match made in heaven.First, some quick background ... all I was searching for was a simple phone.  I had a flip phone but I guess I yielded to the pressure of having a device that many consider outdated.  This phone cost a little more but what the heck.  I think I ended up paying $59.99 for this puppy.  It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.  Perhaps I've been living under a rock but I didn't realize a handheld phone could do so much.I read the reviews before making the purchase and after having purchased the phone, wonder how it can be criticized at all.  It works as advertised and if you're familiar with Windows, it's very easy to use and navigate.  I find Windows 8 to be very intuitive despite using Windows XP on my desktop.  Others have written more detailed reviews so I won't get into all that it can do.But I'll tell you this: I can check my emails, use it as a calculator, view my bank account, use it as a scanner for receipts or whatever, use it as a map, address book, people or business finder, stay updated with the latest news, cruise the internet (with virtually no lag time), watch movies, or do just about anything that I can do on my desktop computer.  I added a memory card and now have over 4 GB of songs I can listen to when I'm out and bored.  It even has a 5 MP camera that allows me to take pictures of my Grand kids! Oh, I also downloaded an app that allows me to use it as a pedometer to track my daily walk/exercise efforts.All I can say is those that complain about the phone obviously forget IT ONLY COSTS 60 BUCKS!  Because of its affordability, it won't have all the bells and whistles that other, far more expensive, smartphones would have but for the cost, it more than fits the bill.  I am so impressed with this Nokia model that in a year or so, I intend to upgrade and get the more expensive 1020 (the specs of the camera are the industry best).  It's funny, but owners of more expensive phones look at mine and are genuinely impressed.  They cannot believe it does about as much as their more expensive phones at a fraction of the cost.My recommendation, for what it's worth, is this:  If you're on a budget and looking for an affordable smartphone, I think you'll be very happy with this model.

After using mine for a while my wife replaced her Android phone with this as well!PROS: The phone is always fast and responsive -- never had any problems with lagging or crashing. The interfaces are intuitive and, to me, easier to navigate than both iOS and Android. With SkyDrive (ahem, OneDrive) integration and built-in Office this is a natural extension of my work computer. The camera is surprisingly high-quality for such a cheap phone. Has a microSD slot, so for $30 or so extra you can make this a 64GB MP3 player.CONS: Doesn't have a flash, so it won't replace your DSLR anytime soon. The biggest drawback is the Windows Phone App Store ecosystem. With iOS and Android, there's pretty much a variety of apps for any possible function you can imagine. Not so, here. My needs are pretty basic (facebook/twitter, evernote, RSS reader, weather app) so I'm covered, but you won't find a lot of games  or trendy new apps. I think this will change over time as Windows Phone is growing much more popular worldwide, due in large part to quality phones like this.The bottom line: if you're okay with the app selection, this is a remarkably high-quality phone that also happens to be one of the cheapest on the market.

I went ahead and ordered the budget friendly Nokia Lumia 521 to see how it works. Not only is this Nokia Lumia 521 a really great deal, but there are a few things that actually put it above some of the higher end smartphones out there.SpecsThe Lumia 521 is basically a T-Mobile USA version of the Nokia Lumia 520 (which is now the best selling Windows Phone worldwide). It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 dual-core processor running at 1GHz with 512MB of RAM and 8 Gigs of internal storage. That\u2019s not very much so you\u2019ll have to pay attention to what apps you install. Fortunately, there is a MicroSD card slot that will allow you to add up to 64 Gigs of extra storage for music, videos, and photos.The 512 Megs of RAM is also a bit limiting as there are certain apps that you won\u2019t be able to install. These include many high-end games as well as Zinio\u2019s magazine reader for some reason.The phone\u2019s size is 4.9 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches and weighs only 4.4 ounces. The 4 inch WVGA screen seems small by today\u2019s standards, but that\u2019s a good thing for one handed usage. In fact, the Lumia 521 is very well designed when it comes to one-handed ergonomics. The thickness and shape make the phone much more comfortable to hold than the extra large extra thin devices that are so popular. You can actually hold and use the Lumia 521 comfortably and that\u2019s very refreshing to see.HardwareThe design of the Nokia Lumia 521 is not terribly impressive or innovative, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. The plastic battery cover wraps all around to the front of the screen for extra drop protection. In fact, while the plastic certainly isn\u2019t premium quality, the build quality feels very solid and rugged. Like most Nokia phones, it feels like it could take a fall and keep on going.At the top you\u2019ve got the handset speaker along with some sensors, there is no front facing camera, but Skype will still work. You just have to point the rear camera into a bathroom mirror. Then you\u2019ve got a 4 inch WVGA screen which isn\u2019t very impressive. Outdoor visibility suffers a bit too, but it is still usable with gloves on. At the bottom are the usual Windows Phone capacities buttons for search, start screen, and back.On the right side there\u2019s a series of plastic buttons protruding from the edge for activating the camera, power, and volume up or down. The buttons are easy to find with your fingers and they\u2019ve got great tactile feedback.On the bottom there\u2019s the micro USB port for charging and syncing.The left side has nothing but plastic.On the top is the 3.5-millimeter headset jack.On the back is the 5 megapixel camera and speaker hole. There is no flash so you\u2019ll only want to use the camera outdoors with a good amount of light.nder the battery cover you\u2019ll find the fairly common and very inexpensive-to-replace Nokia BL-5J 1430mAh battery, along with a Micro SIM card slot, and a Micro SD card slot where you can add up to 64Gb of extra storage for photos, videos, and music.While the Lumia 521 is pretty thick compared to other higher end phones, its smaller screen keeps it feeling just fine in the pocket.SoftwareMost of our Windows Phone 8 coverage can already be found in our full Windows Phone 8 review. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll get the most meat about the software on the Nokia Lumia 521, however we\u2019ll look at a few highlights from both Nokia and T-Mobile here.I already mentioned how the RAM limitation may cause certain Windows Phone 8 apps to be incompatible with the Lumia 521, but there are also some interesting limitations to some of the Nokia apps. For example, the augmented reality view in Nokia\u2019s HERE Maps app is not available, nor is City Lens and the augmented reality feature in the included Weather Channel app does not work.The phone does include Nokia\u2019s HERE Drive free GPS navigation program though. The bad news is that the license only includes maps for the U.S.A., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. You\u2019ll have to pay extra for other countries, but still the United States is pretty big. You need to have a T-Mobile US SIM card in the phone in order for HERE Drive to work, but it does not require an active rate plan to function.Another feature that\u2019s probably worth the cost of the phone is the Nokia Music app. You can download up to 4 custom radio mixes for listening to offline. Then when you get tired of those, you can delete them and download 4 more. It\u2019s unlimited offline music! The catch is you can\u2019t rewind any songs. You have to listen to the whole playlist, though you can skip about 6 per hour. Still, that\u2019s free music with no data plan!The only T-Mobile customization that\u2019s really worth mentioning is the Wi-Fi calling feature. If you turn this on, you\u2019ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth. You don\u2019t need the cell towers outside at all to make calls. It\u2019s a little unreliable though, so I would only turn this on when absolutely necessary.PerformanceThe Nokia Lumia 521 scored 169.25 in WPBench, compared to 234.73 on Lumia 928  or 232.11 for the Lumia 925. The Lumia 521\u2032s score seems a lot lower than other Windows Phones and you would expect that for the price, but in normal usage everything is still buttery smooth. If you put the device side by side with a more expensive Windows Phone, you\u2019ll certainly notice that the Lumia 521 does not perform as well. The screen doesn\u2019t move quite as fast as the PureMotion HD displays of higher-end Nokia phones of course. Still, it\u2019s quite usable and pleasant.Unfortunately and as usual, Xbox Music can still be frustratingly slow when using it with an Xbox Music Pass. It seems like every time you want to access some music in the store it has to go out on the internet to recheck your permissions for streaming/downloading. Furthermore, sometimes it doesn\u2019t do the check properly and streaming doesn\u2019t work. The Zune days were so much better for music on Windows Phone. Still, copying MP3s to your MicroSD card and playing them from there will work  just fine.Battery LifeIn terms of battery life, the Lumia 521 does quite well with average use. It\u2019s certainly enough for a day and the device doesn\u2019t have any terribly power hungry features like a high resolution screen or image stabilization. The key thing here is that the Lumia 521 has a removable BL-5J battery which is pretty common in older Nokia phones. You can get another one for about $4 and swap it out whenever.Call Quality/Network PerformanceVoice calls actually sound great on the Lumia 521. Even at 50% volume, the handset speaker is quite loud. Normally I have to increase the volume to 100% on other phones in order to hear the person on the other end. That\u2019s not necessary with the 521.The Lumia 521 doesn\u2019t support LTE, but it still works with T-Mobile\u2019s 4G HSPA network, and for such a budget device like this, that\u2019s plenty. If you\u2019re in the market for this kind of phone you probably don\u2019t want to pay a lot for internet access anyway, so a slower speed is really an advantage for keeping your monthly bill a bit lower.Pros+ Very inexpensive+ Removable, inexpensive, easy-to-find battery+ Micro SD card expansion for extra photos, videos, and music+ Comfortable ergonomic form factor & design+ Wi-Fi calling+ Nokia HERE Suite (Offline GPS navigation for USA = worth the price of the phone alone)+ Nokia Music (free unlimited offline music playlist downloads = worth the price of the phone alone)+ GDR2 and Nokia Amber updates have been pushed to the device as of 8/14Cons- No flash- only 8GB of storage available for apps- Low resolution screen with mediocre outdoor visibility- No compass for augmented reality apps- 512Mb RAM means some apps won\u2019t run- No wireless charging option- Nokia HERE Drive license only supports USA, Peurto Rico, and US Virgin Islands (it\u2019s not a global license.)", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!

This Nokia runs Windows that is really intuitive and easy to use even for a person (like me) who never had a smartphone before.  The phone feels very fast and responsive. The menus look pretty. You can choose  color and content of your home screen as well as size, color, and location of the icons. Also, I chosen Bing background (beautiful landscapes that update every day or two) for the lock-screen and like it a lot. WiFi works great. It connects to my home or work network instantaneously. So, the only time I use my cellular data is when I travel to/from work. The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.I quickly set my Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Facebook, and Linked-In accounts. After that, I went to the People app and linked profiles of my contacts in all my e-mail social accounts. The phone pulled and aggregated all info from those accounts. So now my contacts all have pictures, birthdays, e-mails, and phone numbers from all those accounts. Very convenient.The pre-installed Nokia apps are very useful. The Scout, Maps, and Navigation helped me a lot when I was on business trip in St Louis. It helped me choose a place to eat or to shop and then guided me to that place. The App Store does not have as many apps as Android (I also own a Nook HD+ tablet that runs Android) or iOS have, but the most important apps are there. And it looks like the quantity and quality of apps are improving.My only complain is regarding the Music player. For some reason, it is unable to play music by folders or play entire albums that have more than one artist. I like to listen to different music when I am working/commuting (easier, more relaxing) and when I am exercising in the gym (harder, more aggressive). I have several albums composed of songs by different artists. This Nokia only plays either from all my collection or by artist. Even though it has an option to choose music by album, it treats an album that contains songs by several artists as sets of albums and plays songs from originally chosen artist only - even if play is set to random!Other than that, I am very happy with my Nokia.

Yes, it does not have as many apps as Apple or Android, but that does not bother me.  Used to have the T-mobile 30.00 a month plan (1500 talk/text and a pathetic 30 Mb of data). Use this phone so much now that I updated my plan to the 50.00 a month unlimited everything.  For the price and features of this high quality phone...I am a very happy customer.

My main phone is the iPhone 4S ... I was expecting the Lumia 521 to be much inferior to my iPhone, but honestly I think I'd be just about happy enough  to use the Nokia instead of my iPhone (which is really not what I was expecting). My actual plan is to have 4 Nokia 521's and one iPhone if I go the T-Mobile route - all paid for up-front... which upgrades the current 'dumb' phones being used by my family on Verizon and still nets a ~$100 per month savings.There are a few things to learn with the Windows 8 OS on this phone - but generally it's close enough to iOS (I'm using iOS7) that I quickly learned all the features. It seems less customizable than Android, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing (much of my family are a little tech-averse).Overall - I'd highly recommend this phone at this cost.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love This Phone", "Author": "TedW", "ReviewID": "R2N7ZSRU0LW1T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd Nokia 521 I have added to our phones in the home.

I obviously researched this carefully, lest I be in the dog-house. I read these reviews and decided to order this Lumia 521, not expecting a great success because of the low-price. I was blown away by the scaleable functionality (it can be as simple or as complicated as one configures). Battery life, call quality, apps, all of the things that the other reviewers here have explained better than I could.All I can say is it suits all ages, and technical levels. My mother in-law has one, my father in-law (previously a flip-phone user, and 85 years young) and I have one now. The Lumia satisfies all needs at all levels and does so beautifully well. As to the cost, I don't believe one could even buy a stolen iPhone for this price.A caveat regarding the battery! The Lumia uses a Li Ion battery, and not a NiCad battery. If you run down this Li Ion battery it will not have enough energy left to power it's integral chip, and it will never function properly again, if at all. It should not be 'conditioned' as the NiCads needed; the Ni Cads developed a sort of memory, and thus had to be conditioned - exhausted then recharged completely a number of times to ensure it's life. This one needs constant energy, and is also sensitive to heat.So, when you get this phone, the battery is often partially charged out of the box. Plug it in, charge it until it says full (a couple of hours max) and then remove it from the charger. After using the phone, charge it when it tells you to (about 11% remaining). Try not to leave it plugged in to a charger when you are using it, as it will also shorten battery life. This way it should give you about 2-3 years service before it dies. The Lumia also has a great app management function to stop apps draining (most free apps drain batteries a lot) and a superb battery saver function that will stop  apps working in the background until they are used again.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hands down win for smartphones but for a fraction of a price of its competitors.", "Author": "Matthew E.", "ReviewID": "R3OS3KUDE1H5MQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had every platform now...

Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R17PH5W81VE8W0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this on Amazon but I did get a similar price where I bought it (big box store). I've had it for 24 hours but I've spent considerable time so I do feel I have things to report. I will add more as I have more experience with this smartphone. I'm waiting for the T-Mobile SIM card so there are a number of things I can't do, like make calls!My personal reference is the iPod Touch 5th gen I've had for a year so you'll see some comparisons in my review. It's all I have to compare because I've never owned a smart phone before.There's no question this is a pretty good phone for the money. It's a lot more phone than I expected. But it has it's Pros and Cons.Pros:- Memory: I don't know why it was so well hidden in articles, specs, and reviews but this phone has more than 7.2GB of storage. About 4.2GB is available to the user. This should be plenty for apps. I'm adding a 32GB microSD card to store music, photos, and videos. So no problem with storage.- Removable battery: I can't tell you what a relief it is to find phones that still have user replaceable batteries. I'm not concerned about daily use and having a backup battery. What I want is the ability to drop in a fresh battery after a year or two when the original battery is losing it's storage capacity. All batteries do slowly fail. I won't have to send the phone back to the factory and pay the price of the phone to have it replaced. I see batteries for this phone as low as $8 on-line.- Display: While the pixel count (800 x 480) is well below my iPod Touch 5th Gen the quality is so close I think the 521 may sometimes be better then the iPod. That surprises me because I think the iPod display is exceptional. The 521 display touch screen is also very easy to use as it is quite sensitive.- Performance. I feel the phone is pretty snappy. The only time it seemed slow was loading web pages. That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.- Size: As I've been using the 4\" iPod Touch 5 for about a year using the 521 4\" display seems quite natural. It would be nice to have a larger screen but not at the expense of weight. To me the main thing is that it feels comfortable in my shirt pocket, and it does. It is almost the same size in width and height as the iPod but a bit thicker. If being thicker allows for a removable battery then I'm all for thicker.- Camera: Okay for daylight but quite poor for indoor shots. No flash doesn't help either. The quality of the outdoor photos is acceptable for posting on-line like Facebook. There is no front camera but I've had a front camera for a couple of years and seldom used them so this is no big loss for me. I really like the dedicated camera button on the side.- Phone: I'll report back here when I get the SIM card and T-Mobile plan. I'm going for the #30/mo no contract with 100 voice and unlimited data and text.- WiFi Calling: This is a great feature that should allow us to make cell phone calls through our home WiFi. Unfortunately I've learned that this still burns plan minutes; how unfortunate. It will compensate if our local T-Mobile service is weak at our house. I'm very much looking forward to trying this out when we get our SIM card and plan. I'll report back here in a couple of days.- Power button: It's on the side. Not a big deal but it just seems more natural to me to be on the top. I'll get used to it.- Volume rocker: One nice feature is when you click on the rocker while audio is playing a set of controls pop up on the screen so you can forward/back/play/pause from there even if you are in a different app at the time. The volume shows a number from 0 to 30 in the upper left corner of the screen as you adjust the volume.- Charging: Imagine this. A standard USB connector on the bottom. Not a special cable like Apple. I just don't know why Apple can't just use a standard USB cable. I charged the phone yesterday and have spent perhaps 8 total hours playing with the phone, downloading apps, cruising the web, listing to music, etc. The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.- Snap off back: It's a little unnerving to bend the back to remove it but it does easily snap sharply back into place. I wonder if it will weaken and come off to easily over time. I like the feel of the back on my hand. No fingerprint magnet here. The surface provides a little grip with its slightly rough surface.- Feel of the 521: The Apple iPod Touch 5 is a quality device, thin, metal back, and light weight. But it costs $399 and isn't a phone! The slight extra weight and thickness of the Nokia 521 isn't bad at all, and it costs $100 and IS a phone.- Buttons below the screen on the front: I'm very happy that all three buttons are capacitive rather than mechanical. I've had problems with the mechanical Apple iPod Touch start button in the past. I like having the \"back\" button below the screen as it's always easy to find. With devices such as the iPod the \"back\" feature is in the software and sometimes the back buttons are hidden or are placed in different locations on the screen.- Software: I'm a big fan of Microsoft and Windows Phone 8. I really like the idea of having Windows 8 on my desktop, my laptop, and my smartphone. The interface is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to figure out how to find things and customize the display. There are tons of apps and many good ones are free. Those that charge don't charge a lot of $. It is handy having \"live\" tiles that show things like the current stock market quotes, outside temperature, number of unread mail messages, and various other things.- GPS: I'm very impressed that you can download maps for free and use the GPS feature without even having a SIM card. I was able to select a destination and it will give me a course to follow using the HERE Maps app that came in the device. It isn't a Garmin. It doesn't auto correct if you take a slightly different course, but you can easily reset the trip and it will plot a new course. No voice directions. But still even if you spent the $100 to buy the device and just used it for a GPS it would be worth it.- FM Radio: Yes it has an FM Radio. I didn't know that until I was reading Help+Tips on the 521 and it was mentioned. I tried it out and it works. Too bad both AM and FM radio in Redding CA is not very exciting.Cons:- More than once I've set the Nokia Lumia 521 down on a table, not too hard but a little drop, and it shut off and rebooted. I don't know if it is just this particular phone. Hopefully other copies don't have this problem. In fact I'm returning this 521 today and getting another one because of this problem.- I've heard of others having problems with the phone dropping WiFi. This has happened to me just once.- Windows Phone 8, while adequate, is clearly behind in features. I understand an 8.1 release might have a notification capability such as can be found in both Android and iOS. No mistake though. Windows Phone 8 is fully capable.- Apps: There are many thousands of Windows Phone 8 applications, but still there are a few that I use regularly that are not available on Windows Phone 8. Alternatives are available but I haven't found any as good as the ones I've been using. This is true for just a few apps but they are critical for me.  First Downcast is an awesome podcast app, not available on Windows Phone 8  Second mSecure is the password keeper I've been using, not available on Windows 8  Third Toodledo to-do app, not available on Windows 8- Another thing I really miss in Windows Phone 8 is something like \"folders\" on iOS. I use them to group things together, much as Windows 8 on my PC can group things. Not available on Windows Phone 8.- No easy way to adjust screen brightness. If set to Automatic it doesn't work well for me. For example in a semi-dark room the automatic feature turns the brightness down so far I can't read the words on the screen. The alternative is Manual which only allows Low, Medium, or High brightness, no slider for much better control. The way to change brightness manually is buried in the Settings and takes several steps to get there. iOS 6 wasn't much better but Apple finally fixed that bug by introducing the Control Center in iOS 7.- Voice control: It works and I've used it a number of times. But it is no Siri or  Android's voice features (I understand the Android voice assist is much better than Apple's Siri). The voice control can be used to make phone calls, start apps, or vocalize texts.- Calendar. It works but it could use a lot of improvement. You get a month view that you can't zoom, and a day view which you can scroll through past or future dates. I was able to include my wife's calendar events and set them to pink while mine are in blue. I read a rumor that this app is being updated soon.For $100 this phone could be purchased instead of an iPod Touch. If you buy it, stick in a $25 32GB microSD card, and don't get a phone plan, you've got a cheap alternative.Given the price I do highly recommend this phone.We have been using only feature phones for about 15 years. I've never wanted to pay the high price for the data plan to own a smart phone. Truly what I wished for was to be able to use a smartphone on the Verizon network but only use WiFi for data and not pay for a data plan. Then I discovered the cheap T-Mobile service. I bought this 521 as an experiment to try out the T-Mobile service. If the T-Mobile plan work well the three members of my family that have phones will switch to this plan which means we will be paying the same monthly amount but now will have unlimited data and text too. If it works well I will likely buy a better phone, and as much as I want to use Windows Phone 8 I don't think it is ready for prime time. I will likely go with an Android phone.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy this phone, save your $$$", "Author": "Michael Desimone", "ReviewID": "R14E0TNFIJR85G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply put, this phone is amazing.

I still use iOS for my mobile trading but WP should see development  down the road. So other than trading this is a much better GUI for all your day to day communications. For those that will use t-mobile one cool feature is wifi calling so if you have a weak cell signal at home your still good. I turn off cell data and use my Skype Number and have a $2 daily plan and only get charged when I use my t-mobile number. This is a great way to have a home phone and cell service on demand. For FYI you can check your t-mobile voice mail from another number and not be charged for the day which is nice. You just hit star and enter your pin like all cell voice mails.Your phone will ring when it's on but if you don't answer there's no charge even with cell data off which you need to do in settings. I install a connection app to make it easy. If you like the daily plan idea just remember cell data must be off and do not answer your incoming call unless you want to pay for that day which ends at midnight then starts a new day.

You can't argue that it's not affordable.  When I purchased it it was just over $70 after taxes.- Easy to use Windows Phone interface.  This is a great phone for seniors or the less technically inept.  It takes a little bit of getting used to with the initial setup, but once you get used to it, it's very easy to navigate.  Much easier than an Android phone.- Quality was top-notch.  Screen does not scratch easily and surprisingly the white back cover does not pick up dirt as easily as I expected.- Battery life is surprisingly good for smartphone.  The phone goes two days or more for me, but I only make calls and texts.  I don't use any apps or games.Now, to the cons:- Screen brightness is not the greatest and viewing angles are fairly poor.  It's practically impossible to use outside.  I changed the color scheme to yellow so that I could make out the words and numbers on the screen.  If it had a half decent screen, I would give this 5 stars with no hesitation.  This is the only thing holding it back from 5 stars for me since I'm outside a lot.- Call quality isn't the greatest.  Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.  But, I guess that's expected for most smartphones.So, given that the pros outweigh the cons and that the price is the best on the market, you can't beat this phone.

There are two things that must be clarified if you just got this phone and you coming from Android or Iphone. Don't expect to get all the apps you are used to. Also know that this phone is a  budget phone and so dont expect it to work like high end phones.SOME OF WHAT I LIKE:1. The audio quality and overall system is very good in fact far better than my previous two Android phones (Nexus 4 and LG G2). Voice calls are loud and clear. I am amazed at how good my music sound when I hook it up to my car stere. Very loud and clear. Makes the G2 and Nexus 4 sound like toys.2. The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone. Also like the unique physical camera button; Overall smooth UI that beats all Android phones I have used so far including the G2, Galaxy S3 and S4. It doesnt lag at all and what a relief coming from Android;3. Essential Microsoft programs like Office, Skydrive, One Note all work flawlessly just like their bigger phones like the Lumia 925 and possibly Lumia 1020. Its amazing how you can pull out this very little phone from your pocket and actually get things done.4. Battery life to a certain extent is good. It has the \"battery saver\" option and if checked it does a good job managing the battery usage. It also shows you the time from last charge and also the amount of time needed before the battery runs out.5. Tmobile's Wifi calling is fantastic. For those situations when you have little to no cellular coverage the phone switches to wifi and then you can make all the calls you like. You can set it to make only wifi calls or give it a priority.6. The UI is as smooth as butter. It just flows with absolutely no lag. Very impressive.7. It takes a micro SD for a change. This is great for extending storage.8. Nokia Maps gives you the ability to download entire state maps for you to use phone as off line GPS.SOME OF WHAT I LIKE LESS:1. The lack of apps can be problematic atimes but not honestly not a big deal. I knew what I was getting into but this may be an issue for many people. Most of the available apps works great.2 The IE browser keeps forcing some sites to appear on desktop mode even though the browser is set to mobile. This is a bit frustrating cnsidering how small the screen is.3. The lack of flash is noticeable in those moments of total darkness when when you need to take a picture. You will need some form of lighting for the pictures to look good. Also the lack of flash means you cant use your phone as a flashlight.  Overall I really like this phone so far. Whether it will hold on to daily usage for a long time I cant say. but considering how cheap it is and no contract it is a risk I was prepared to take.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Entry into Windows Phone", "Author": "jloz10", "ReviewID": "R6U9UMC197T18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows phones are not used by much of the market here in the US but they are interesting phones. I purchased this phone for my grandfather since he thinks most smartphones are too expensive. I had no experience with nokia since the small brick phones they made back in ~2005, they were quite sturdy and could take any beating you threw at them. I was definitely surprised when I opened the package, it felt like a quality product not what I would have expected from a $100 phone (what I paid at the time). Setup was easy and it was a plus that all the tiles were resizable, especially for an older person with less experience with smartphones. They live tiles show relevant information without being intrusive. The widows store while smaller than google play or the app store had everything that was needed for him, it was a plus that it came with Nokia Here Maps that could be used for offline navigation were downloadable for free. The camera is average, good enough for outdoor/ well lit photos but darker shots will be blurry. The screen does not have the highest resolution but it is better than most of its competitors in this price range. Its definitely a great buy even for use as an mp3 player (can accept up to a 64GB micro sd card) or as an alternative to a garmin with more functionality.

For $69, this clearly is the best smart phone deal out there and I found it is more than I need for a smart phone (in a good way)! As I am not a gamer, I only use the phone for phone calls, text messaging, checking emails and browsing the web while not near my PC, and taking casual photos while my camera is not around. Here are the features I really like about this phone that other smart phones may or may not have:1. Pretty fast Snapdragon processor.2. Windows Phone 8 OS is easy to learn and operate.3. Replaceable battery....not too many newer phones has that nowadays.4. SD card slot for additional storage....again, not too many newer phones has that.5. SkyDrive for even more storage....free 7G space.6. Optional Voice-texting....don't need to use the tiny keyboard on screen if you don't want to.7. I especially like this feature: I can put all of my favorite contact person's names/pictures on \"Start Page\" as \"small tiles\" and they would work as a speed-dial short-cut for phone calls/texting.....I don't need to look for the person in a phonebook that can be frustrating sometimes.....good for people who has poor eyesight.8. \"HERE\" drive and maps can work as offline GPS....I have not tried them as yet.9. Like an iPhone, I can hand-write (as an input method) Chinese with emails, etc.10. There are many other features that I probably won't be using too often and you may have read in other reviews.In general, I don't really think there is any phone (new or used) has such value on the market today....it doesn't have the built-quality as an iPhone but, it is also 8~10 times less expensive too! The only downside for me is that it's locked with T-Mobile only and I'm not sure T-Mobile will unlock this phone or not in the future. I think most people, who are not heavy phone users like me, would be very pleased with 521!**************************************Update: After another week of using the phone, I still feel the same about 521......I think Windows Phone 8 OS really has plenty of features that most people would be very pleased with it. Sometimes, I feel it may give me too much information than I really need.....like, once I setup my Facebook account with the phone, I will automatically receive all the Facebook updates & feeds on the phone that sometimes may just be a little too much info for me on a phone. Also, sometimes when I delete emails (Verizon.net) on the phone, they would automatically be deleted from my Verizon email server also.....so, I may not be able to view the emails on my other PC if it is turned on after the emails are deleted from the phone first. It happens sometimes but not always.....I really could not figure out why because the phone email setup does not have an option for something like \"leave an email copy on the server\" to check.... Guess I just have to be careful about deleting emails on the phone.Other than these new minor findings, I still feel the phone is the best value on the market!", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great budget smartphone!", "Author": "Amazepale", "ReviewID": "R3CUWSNN9EWSKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First thing you have to do is that you have to avoid comparing this smartphone with higher end devices such as the Galaxy S4, HTC One, Iphone, or other Nokia Lumia devices. If you are considering this phone is likely you are trying to purchase a budget smartphone for you or someone else. I can honestly say this device looks and feels better than its price (expect to pay around $100 or less at Amazon).The screen looks nice, it is responsive and fast for a budget device, and it's easy to use. I bought this as a gift and it is the first time I use a Windows device since my experience has been with Android and Apple iOS (iPhone), and i love to learn and experience with gadgets and especially smartphones, and I can truly say the experience with Windows in this device has been positive so far, so if you are planning on getting this for people not used to handling smartphones I think it would be easy for them to learn the basics (making calls, checking voicemail, reading and writing emails and SMS, browsing the internet, etc). The only drawback so far has been the battery which is not awful, but could be better as it is the case with many smartphones out there, even high end devices.Once again, understand this is a budget phone so do not expect the best pictures, the fastest phone, largest memory or hard drive, or LTE connectivity. If you need any of this, look somewhere else and expect to pay a higher price for these features, but if they are not a deal breaker then consider this device.I will provide an update later if necessary, and also recommend checking the Moto G which in my opinion is the best budget device but it costs more at $179 (8GB) or $199 (16GB) depending on the model. Both are available at Amazon, and can be customized with back covers at an additional cost. So, if you are looking for the best $100 or less smartphone, get the Nokia Lumia 521, but if you are looking for the best device under $200 I strongly recommend the Moto G.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful product", "Author": "Elizabeth Rose", "ReviewID": "R3QR7CCP3F99EY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia Lumia 521 T-Mobile smart phone is great.

The only issue is the lack of apps - which i knew going in with a Windows phone (why don't they subsidize apps more to eliminate this problem? Nokia and Microsoft?) Anyway, best phone I have owned - which includes Sony Ion, Samsung S, HTC One, Razor, etc....if Microsoft gets their act together on apps I may purchase a Windows tablet when I am able. The live tiles feature is great and ridiculously easy to set up and change. Battery life is excellent as well.2 weeks with it - and still love this phone! battery life great - approx day and a half without using battery saver. Everything is smooth. Live tiles are nice! $79 dollar phone beats Sony Ion and Galaxy S. Not sure how it compares to the S4 - and don't care. Great phone!Nokia build quality shows. Feels good in the hand. A little plasticy but feels good still. Removable battery! Windows apps seem smooth. Tiles interface is nice. I've had Android phones and will update with my experiences once I live with this for a few days. So far - Google account synced right away - contacts, calendar, etcBy the way, they had this model on sale at Target for $59 - went to the store and they had two versions of this phone - same model number - but supposedly different versions.

Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia. Windows phone apps aggregate content well and app selection is growing.WiFi calling is nice to have. Good battery life, screen, speaker and camera are nice.Having to setup 3 accounts (T-Mobile, Microsoft and Nokia) is a little bit of a nuisance, but overall setup is easy.The phone I received had a broken volume-up switch, but Amazon return was simple.

It's ONE great phone. The sound is clear and I love being able to change all the settings to my own personal needs, wants and desires..... so many apps to choose from and such a good price. I don't need a phone to do anything more than bring me incoming calls and allow me to call out, but if I want to check email and Facebook, I can.Although this is being called a *BASIC* phone it does WAY more than I need it to do and it's been a blast trying to figure it all out. Since this is my first SMARTPHONE, I've been taking my time learning all the varied attributes, most of them I'll never use but it's nice to have them available. The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection. The second is that I can BLOCK all those telemarketing calls which drive me nuts, my land line wouldn't allow me to do this unless I paid for that service. The third is that I love the NOSTALGIA ring tone as it sounds like a phone from days gone by. My dogs seem to enjoy this ring tone the best too.....Don't hesitate to buy this phone....it's really such a good bargain and it's worth it weight in gold.

It's packed with features. One of the best is that it seems to have a real wifi router that allows sharing and networking between up to 8 clients. The router hands out inside IP addresses and creates a wireless LAN of its own. The phone audio is superior, the speakerphone works very well, it has an FM radio that works great.  To copy files to or from it you just plug it into the computer via a USB cable and it looks like any other USB file system. There is NO computer software (e.g. itunes) required.  It will charge from any USB port or a charger.  Management of multiple email accounts is trivially easy as each one becomes just its own square on the desktop.That said, I'm going to tell you all the things it will NOT do that I would wish it could, knowing everyone else will tell you what it WILL do.It is simply not as reliable and stable as my Blackberry 9700.  The 521 uses Windows 8 phone and while it is feature rich, apps or system features frequently quit or crash unexpectedly, and some phone features such as wifi calling will spontaneously lock out. All of these problems have ultimately been solvable by turning off the phone and restarting it or pulling the battery.  If I were Microsoft, I would aim to improve robustness and reliability ahead of features, but unfortunately that's not what sells.As another reviewer observed, the screen DOES attract and hold grime and slime seemingly more easily than other such devices.  This can be fixed by applying Rainx.  Remember, put the Rainx on an applicator or cloth first and the touch that to the phone.  Never apply a liquid directly.  I did this and the screen stays much cleaner, is easier to clean, and even feels smoother.No sync from Outlook via USB cable. I've tried everything including third party software and nothing works.No retry for failed messages.  It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.  My Blackberry 9700 would retry many times, typically succeeding in the most marginal of conditions, where one was in and out of coverage or in a very weak area.  This phone tries ONCE and that's it.  A major flaw since I had come to depend on automatic retries for messaging because I am often in marginal coverage.There is no customization of sounds except the ring for the phone, and that is size limited.  You cannot have custom sounds for other alerts such as text or email messages.There is no program for sending SMS using a PC program or a keyboard. Note, I have not tried to pair the phone with a bluetooth keyboard but that might work.There is NO user-facing camera for \"selfies.\"The shutter release is delayed - you have to press the shutter button 1-3 seconds ahead of when you plan to have the picture taken.There is no USB tethering - only wifi as mentioned above, and that works very well.Stopping the music from playing requires you to pause the player indefinately or use an app named \"stop the music.\"It has only buttons for volume (up and down), on/off, and camera.  I wish there were dedicated phone call and end buttons.It has no ability to detect holstering or unholstering.  Unlike a Blackberry, which comes alive when it gets drawn from its holster, the 521 requires you to press the ON button before you can do anything, unless you leave it screen ON and unlocked, which causes the screen to stay on and draw much more power while holstered.While it includes a calendar and contact manager (the people hub) which syncs with Microsoft's cloud, it has no \"todo\" list feature.  You can get DejaOffice for contacts, calendars, tasks, and memos and sync with Outlook.Smart phones have gone from being phones with some smarts to computers that are small and include a phone function. I had been using a Blackberry 9700 which I still like, and it clearly was the former. The 521 with W8P clearly is the latter.  While I still CAN go back to the Blackberry, many of the 521's features such as the built in wifi router for tethering and ease of managing multiple email accounts are very compelling.For the price, you could consider it a learning experience, even if after trying it you ended up giving the thing away.  If you did not use it as a phone, it will still work as a wifi connected tablet, which is not necessarily true of other similar products.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Enterprise apps that work", "Author": "Roadstr", "ReviewID": "R17KYQWQBL6A3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those that need Good.com and Lync 2010, they work and work better than on Android. I am selling my Nexus 4 and staying with the Nokia 521. I don't need the 925 camera or screen resolution, the 521 screen is fine and sound is incredable. The 521 is a great phone and has options that are not on the 925. It is always easier to use, yesterday I was on a bridge call and added another phone connection to the bridge call... surprise, we have support here on the bridge! KeePass/7Pass sync works with Drop Box, but not Sky Drive. TuneIn radio is there along with Nokia's music. XMSirius is not. You can put in a 64GB micro SD card and have a backup battery, those are the 2 important options not on a 925. There is the Desktop Sync tool that you can install on your PC to synchronize photos and music.Skinomi TechSkins are the best, they even sent me a second complementary set for my Nexus 4!SoundMAGIC E10M - the M means a microphone... You will not believe the sound for the price! My SoundMagic does not work with microphone for the Windows phone, no problem with the Nexus 4. Not sure it it's SoundMagind, butEtymotic hf2 does work... it requires a good seal to get the base, the E10M doesn't require such a good seal, but helps.7PASS works great when it's database is stored on Drop Box, it does not work with Sky Drive... know problem admitted by the developer. 7PASS works with KeePass.Conference Calleague works great to dial into conference calls and enters passcode. I copied GOOD calendar items that are conference meetings into Outlook calendar. This would not be necessary if I could establish conferences through Good.Wells Fargo and Fidelity apps are in the store... Citibank card is getting a lot less use.SiriusXM does not have an app and there is no Flash for IE, so you can't use it.Nokia Music is great.Tunein Radio is there so you can listen to NPR.TechNet radio is cool.There aren't as many apps as the competition, but the ones that really count are there and they work great.Data Sense and Flixster are also among my favorites.I can't believe how responsive Dropbox is. SkyDrive can take a long time to sync to find your files on another device.Hope this helps.EDIT:It turns out that SoundMagic Headphones mic does not work on Nokia Lumia 521. I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925. Lync is impressive and it's an app I really appreciate, works well on both phones.I upgraded to a 925 on T-Mobile Jump plan. The SoundMagic headphones are that good, add a great display (yes, it's a noticeable difference when not side by side) and wireless charger...

This phone is a little smaller and fits nicely in my hand. Not like a Tablet like other phones.  I like the windows scrolling start page instead of icons. I like the constant picture scroll. The screen size is smaller than the 900, but no less enjoyable for me. I will say that the 900's screen seemed to \"pop\" more than the 521, but the 521 still has a nice color pallet. I am pleasantly surprised with the speed of the Internet. I can't find anything to dislike about this phone and I don't know how Nokia or Amazon can sell it so cheaply.

Outstanding hardware for the price.2.  Phone is surprisingly quick for only having 512MB3.  Camera is pretty good4.  I like the battery saving feature that kicks in when battery drops below 25%.  Nothing worse then not being able to make a call.5.  WiFi calling very handy feature when you have weak signal.6.  The windows tile system has grown on me actually pretty nice although not many apps really make use of it.7.  Nokia maps/GPS great feature to save wasting data.8.  Has an MicroSD card slot.9.  Phone feels sturdy in your hand.10.  Home,back, and search button not in screen area.  A lot of android phones do this and waste precious screen space.11.  Touch screen sensitivity adjustable.12.  Has a pretty good facebook app.13.  Battery life is impressive when compared to low end phones.  I get about 1 1/2 days per charge.14.  Phone has an orientation sensor but is smarter about not constantly flipping between landscape and portrait view.15.  Removable back cover.  Makes it easy to repair and replace the battery.16.  8 GB of flash storage is quite a bit for a phone in this price range.Cons1.  Lacks apps - some of popular apps missing that are found on iPhone and Android such as flipboard.  Many social media apps are made by 3rd party companies that puts banner ads in the app or you force you to pay for them.  These apps are free on iPhone or Android.2.  Some social media sites only accessible through web browser which is a poor experience in small screen such as Google Maps.  Some things don't even work through web browser such Amazon music.3.  Needs many more customization options in the settings.  Battery strength, WiFi signal, and strength auto-hide in less then a minute. Screen should be brighter and screen should not shut-off as quickly when plugged in.4.  Do not like music services available on Windows OS tries to force a Microsoft eco system on you, and selection is not as good.5.  Headphone jack is strange size so far unable to find head phones that fit it.6.  Bluetooth is very buggy.  After about 1 hour of listening to music phone will stutter and needs reboot.  Happens on both phones so highly likely is a software bug.7.  Would be nice to be able to install apps on SD card.8.  Unable to text photos.  This could be T-Mobiles fault.9.  I miss Google Now.  Google Now is a killer app that I wish was on this phone.ConclusionI consider myself an Android phone fan, but make no mistake until you get up to about $200 phones such as the Nexus 4.  You will not find a better phone.  Most phones anywhere near this price have issues with just doing basic things smart phones should do.  This phone just works.  If you are on a somewhat tight budget this is the phone to get.  Most of the problems I have listed could be fixed through software updates by Microsoft.Update 4/14/2014Windows Phone 8.0 update 3 fixes bluetooth bugs.  Still unable to text photos from what I have read this is Nokia's fault not T-Mobiles.Installed Windows Phone 8.1 Beta works great with this phone.  The update allows you to install apps on the SD card very big deal because this phone has only 8 GB.  Best cheap phone for T-Mobile until you get up to the Samsung Galaxy Light in price.

That said, I couldn't justify shopping T-Mobile's online storefront, only to find the most basic of smart phones running well over $100. So, for the first time ever, I did some shopping at Amazon to search for a phone that suits my needs without dumping loads of cash into one.Quickly, I found the Nokia Lumia 521 to be at a surprisingly great price for a phone that stakes big claims in capability. As I stated earlier, I am an existing T-Mobile customer with a plan that I had no intentions of changing. Because this purchase comes with no contract obligation, this was the perfect fit for me and any T-Mobile customer who is looking to just own a new phone.Once it arrived, the transfer from one device to the Lumia 521 was seamless. I previously owned a phone that utilized the larger SIM card; but, fortunately, the Lumia 521 included the new micro SIM card. The cost to swap SIM cards? $0. The time spent on the phone with customer service to swap SIM cards? Not a single second. Current T-Mobile users can use their TMobile.com online account access to switch SIM cards by simply typing the number supplied with the Lumia 521's SIM card! So much ease!Now, weeks later, I have used this phone for social media access, internet surfing, phone calls, text messaging and more - all with no troubles what-so-ever. Needless to say, this was exactly the phone I was looking for - it performs extremely well and at a price tag well below $100, I highly recommend this device to anyone who wants smart phone capabilities coupled with affordability.Furthermore, I should add that my previous phone was formatted with the Andriod operating system - something that I very much enjoyed. So, I was a bit apprehensive knowing that the Lumia 521 employed a Windows OS. That said, my experince with it has been nothing but positive. Only two downsides about this phone: 1) the three function keys at the bottom of the device do not light up, 2) this device, in order to cut expenses, does not have a compass (it does feature GPS, however) that would be useful with some navigation applications. Other than those findings, navigation is a breeze, customizing the tile layout is superb, and the phone processes actions with very little effort.Additionally: the screen is nicely lit, the battery has a good lifecycle, and the phone sports the level of sleekness reminiscent of its more expensive Nokia family members.Overall, this phone and the Amazon discount offer the best bang for the buck - that I am aware of - in this day and age of cell phones! If you are a current or prospective T-Mobile customer and would like to save some serious cash without comprimising quality, look no further than the Lumia 521.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, great price!", "Author": "Jaime", "ReviewID": "RMY3VTEWM4DJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this for my daughter for her birthday.

You can chose the color scheme and design the pins to fit your needs. The battery life is also really nice on this phone. I charge my phone usually every other day. Now for the negatives though. One issue I have had the past few weeks is the phone turning on and off. It seems if I move it in anyway or don't set it down careful it turns off. There has been two occasions in the past two weeks were it shuts off and doesn't turn on for about four hours. I read a lot of reviews online and it seems a lot of people have had that issue. It seems the battery does not fit into the slot right. Another negative is the Microsoft store. It is very underdeveloped.

Very easy, convenient, manageable and easy to set up the way I want to tailor it to my needs.-I've had excellent battery life with it, although I carefully manage WiFi, Bluetooth, location services and usage, etc.  It's easy.-I used Nokia's complimentary \"set-up service,\" where you make an appointment and they call you (preferably on a separate line) to discuss things you don't understand with the phone.  I waited a few days to explore the phone myself, so as to hopefully have some \"intelligent\" questions, and it was a pleasure.  Although you categorize the areas you want to discuss, you're free to ask whatever you like, so you can effectively use your phone.  The Nokia representative was efficient, knowledgeable and friendly - i.e., real customer service.  And they said I was free to call any time as a Nokia owner.  Nice!-Although the 521 lacks a couple of things that would be nice, such as a magnetometer for true location services, a front-facing camera, etc., with my provider, T-Mobile, it has several advantages, such as WiFi calling.  I bought this phone specifically to replace my old Nokia E-series and to use with T-Mobile's so-called \"Wal-Mart Plan.\"  $30/month, 100 minutes of calling, unlimited text and data (up to 5gb at 4g) - perfect for me.As for the returns, the first was likely not the phone but the SIM card.  Nonetheless, T-Mobile suggested returning all and starting fresh.  I considered that solid advice.  Second, probably a battery, but again, with the sane advice of Nokia, they suggested a complete reset.  I will say this, the recovery was much less painful with Nokia/MS Windows phone's OS than I expected.  If you log in via an MS account, and allow them to save/update your system, such occurrences (which happen with all variety of phones!) is not so painful.I recommend, but again, I'm NOT an apple fan, nor much of an Android fan, either.Bottom line: Find another phone with this much functionality and utility for this price point.

Lamb \"dsl2002b\"", "ReviewID": "R399MA74DQ7HB7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've moved to this phone from a Samsung Exhibit 4G running Android 2.3. Not the latest Gen but definitely not 1st gen.I wanted a change, and better Android phones were out of my price range (so was the IPhone). I have a Mac, use Windows 7, and also have an IPad. So I can say I have some experience with almost all of the OS.I've used the phone for about a week and half and am quite happy with it. None of the competitors offer anything as well designed, sturdy, speedy, at this price level.Pros:The HERE navigate app is excellent. You download the data for your state or current location and does not depend on your data connection which saves you download limits. The navigation was spot on, and the roads seemed up-to-date. I liked it better than the google navigation app available on Android 2.3. It actually seemed more up-to-date in terms of the network. However, Google maps is far better at locating points of interest. There is a new pizza restaurant around the corner. Google Maps had it instantly, HERE does not even show up.This phone is responsive and fast. It takes a little getting used to because it manages applications differently. I didn't find a Task Manager, so you have to back out of applications to close them. Not better, just different. The battery life is really good. I had wifi on and used it moderately for 2 1/2 days without draining it. I would have to charge my Android phone daily (it is also a couple of years old). It comes with 4gb of storage is better than the 400 mb on my phone, and both have room to expand with an Micro SD Card. I don't think you can install apps on the sd card on Windows Phone 8 but I'm not sure.It's just kind of fun to use. I think the Tiles are a really nice UI, and simple to work with. Everything is right there for you. I imagine you can modify Android phones to do this as well, but the change is nice.Cons:I didn't think the lack of flash would bother me, but it does. I'm surprised there isn't one given that Nokia is focusing on camera's in the phone. Nothing I can really do about that.The apple app store has by far the largest selection of apps. Most of the big ones are on Android too. Windows Store lags behind. In some ways this is advantage, because it isn't bloated with a lot of crap Apps like the Apple store. Some of the ones I wish were there but haven't found: NPR, NBA, politico, official google apps (e.g. youtube). All the social media ones are there (Facebook and Twitter). I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app. This is because of market share. Companies are better served making apps for phones that make up 90% of the market. The apps I have found are generally pretty good, though. If there is an app that you can't live without, chances are it is not on the Windows Phone.I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a phone at this price range.Update:I would still recommend the phone, but now that I've used it longer I have some other comments. With the most recent update, they have made it easier to exit out of applications. Holding the back button gives you a screen grab of each open application and a little X in the corner to close it.The web browser kit on this phone is not the greatest. It is based on IE, and sometimes it renders pages funny and locks up. There are some other browsers available, but I wish Firefox would put their mobile version on Windows phone.The phone does have trouble reconnecting to the network after it has been lost. I was in a couple of places this past week that lost the network, but when I was back within range the phone didn't update. I had to turn off the phone or enter flight mode to get it back.A minor annoyance - the voice mail requires you to turn up the phone volume to hear it.

The Lumia 521 combines perfectly with T-Mobile's competitive range of plans, but can also be enjoyed as a smartphone without plan (i.e. without phone use). AT&T; offers the technically identical Lumia 520 at an attractive price without contract.On my wishlist for Windows Phone 8:- deeper integration of speech recognition, not just available for web searches and translation and few others but throughout all apps imbedded in keyboard- more access to folder structure and files not just on Skydrive but on the hard drive and on the SDcard as well- tech support by Microsoft for Windows Phone OS (currently non-existent).

Window 8 is smooth and easy to find your way around.2) Has all the apps that I want. I am not a big gammer so if you are, Apple or Samsung products do have more. I guess since so new the programmers need to catch up for Windows 8. Still, tons of apps to use.3) I like the size of the 521 and case. To me, I do not even need a case.4) Price, for all that is has. Cannot beat the price.Things I would not mind being different on it.1) Game apps. really only thing that it needs to catch up on compared to Apple.2) Camera flash, most of the time you do not need a flash. I am sure when Nokia was deciding on the price point flash was taken out since 90 plus % of the time you do not use it. A flash would come in handy however.All in all.

Realized that I have wifi at home, at work, and at the shops I frequent. In an attempt to save money, I canceled my current data plan and trying to go with the best alternate. I've also used Skype for years, and have relatives overseas.521 Pros:- Fantastic Skype integration. Will use speaker by default, but you can change that and use it like a phone. Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality. Only drawback is no front facing camera. Also, you'll miss Skype calls when the phone is asleep, but FIXED if the phone is plugged in charging.- OFFLINE Maps. Turn-by-turn voice directions. NO DATA PLAN REQUIRED, since maps download to your phone. However, you must know the address of where you're heading, since searching for 'Jiffylube' will not return results without a dataplan or wifi hotspot.- Loud Speaker. Listened to a ball game recently with it...set it on the counter and I could hear it clearly from 30 ft. Puts more expensive phones to shame.- Slick Interface. WP8 is smooth as butter, even with the hardware being somewhat below current expectations. Touch screen is same as iphone, very quick and responsive.- SD Card. Tried a 32GB card, which worked. Also falls into the CONS category, though.521 Cons:- Slippery. Cover fixes that. I thought covers would snap-on, but they're the typical wrap-around types.- SD Card. WP8 limits use to media files and photos only. You can upload other file types from USB, but you won't be able to find the files. Also, the USB uses the MTP protocal. For example, running EXE files from the SD storage on windows will fail (MTP limits random access to files). Guess you'll still need that trusty USB stick or HD, no thanks to Microsoft's great decision to use ancient MTP.- WP8 (windows phone 8 OS). I like many things about the OS, but they made some poor decisions. The security acts like an iphone, where each app is sandboxed. This makes things difficult: sharing files, making email attachments, or downloading general files. Accordingly, no file browser exists. Also, no alternative browsers exist (NO chrome, NO firefox, NO dolphin, etc), nor any alternative keyboards.- Camera. Great quality in good light, but lack of flash limits its use.Conclusion:Overall, I'm happy with the phone and like 80% of WP8. Happy enough that I bought another for the wife. However, WP8 needs to LISTEN to their customers and make some compromises while the OS is still young and alive. If not, my next phone will likely be an android, and I imagine WP8 will die a few years later.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A 5 star phone.......considering the price", "Author": "w3apon", "ReviewID": "RDI50Q63CXMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me cut to the chase here.

For people that don't want a 5inch superphone, this size may be perfect for them.Runs all of the Nokia exclusive apps like Drive, Maps, Music, etc...Battery life seems to last a very long time and its removable in case you want to carry and extra one.What are the drawbacks?Only 8GB of internal memory:  But you have the option to include an SD card which can store your maps and media.No camera flash:  However the pictures are surprisingly good for a 5mp camera.  Easily beats out my old Focus and maybe even Lumia 900.No Front Facing Camera:  That could be a deal breaker for some.  Personally, I've found that I never actually use my FFC.No NFC (the tap to send thing):  Again, I've found I never use it.  Well I used it once on my 920 to transfer a picture just to try it out.512MB of RAM:  There are some games on the platform that require 1GB of RAM.  However most games work with 512MB and I can't think of any non-game apps that require 1GB.Screen:  While I think the resolution works just fine on a 4inch screen, there is no denying that the LCD looks cheap when put next to the ClearBlack display of a Lumia 920.No LTE:  For me this is probably the biggest drawback.  But you still get \"4G\" HSPA+.Summary:If you want to save money, this phone paired with no contract T-Mobile plans, is a great choice.  Just compare spending $200 on an iPhone to lock yourself into a 2year contract at $80-100+ a month.  Or you can get this for $130-150 and paired with $50 T-Mobile plan, or even the $30 Unlimited Data/Text plan offered through Walmart.  You could be talking thousands of dollars over a 2 year period.

I bought it as a cheap entry into Windows Phone 8, and I'm completely blown away. I wasn't expecting this. This phone was going to be something I use as a backup, but I'm currently using this as my daily driver, and I love it!Let me also say, that I'm not new to the world of smart phones. I consider myself a techie enthusiast that buys and tries new phones / tech every few months or so. I've been on every phone carrier, and tried every platform except for WP8 (until now). I've also picked up every iPhone released (1st gen to iPhone 5), and I'm HEAVILY invested in Google services. I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2). My most recent love has been the pureness of the LG Nexus 4. The fact that I'm impressed with this budget device is no small thing.Pros:-Fantastic Battery Life - (Appears to hold its charge while on stand by like an iPhone. Unlike Android phones that continue to drain heavily even without use. The phone also charges fairly quickly since the battery only rated at 1430mAH).-Great Nokia Construction - (Nokia does an amazing job with plastics. Remember the days of the old Nokia 3300's? You could drop those things over and over again without worry. I have nearly the same confidence in this phone. Something you definitely don't see in other phones these days. The phone even has a good weight to it. Not the light, cheapy feeling you get from some Samsung devices).-Removable Rear Cover - (Most WP8 phones that I see - even other Nokia ones - don't have a removable back. I was very pleased to see one on the 521. Scratch or crack a back? No problem! Replace it. Hopefully there will be some 3rd party support here making other colors and designs. I haven't had the need for it yet, but I can't tell you how many battery pulls I've had to do with some of my Android phones. I like knowing that if I ever have to reset my phone, I'm just a pop of the cover away. Even the buttons come off with the cover!

This phone was cheap, non-contract and i got to try new things: wp 8.so, for android users who look into deep customization, don't come to this phone. wp 8 is not designed for that.for hard core smart phone users who run all kinds of weird or tough jobs on their phones just because \"i can\", give this one up. This one had limited ram and does not have NFC and the tethering function was messed up (by T-mobile). Many beautiful 3D apps cannot be run on this phone including the famous game temple run. and one big fail is that wp 8 does not allow installing apps on microSD...and 8gb runs out very fast for a hard core user. it is definitely not enough..at all!for beginner smart phone user, this is an amazing smart phone! it is extremely smooth (i've got to say, my nexus freezes/lags all the time). it has built-in office (much better the office apps on other platforms); it has autofcus camera which performs amazingly with very decent quality; it also has an enough resolution for the screen: very clear and bright. it is basically fully functional as a smart phone in spite of all the bad reviews about wp8 and the lack of apps in the store. The stock map app, music app (similar to spotify) and camera apps are useful and fun.basically, wp 8 is a closed system like IOS but allows at least a little more customization compared to IOS. you can change the theme color; you can arrange the tiles in the way you like and with certain apps, you can make a wallpaper with the tiles which are also functional as buttons.to sum it up, for hard core android users, it will take some get used to if you swtich to wp8 but for iphone users, you may find this phone pretty and more fun (IOS7 is coming out and it is supposed to be amazing...so i dont recommend switching at this time hehe...).This phone is the best smart phone that you can get at this price range.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent starter smart phone (but quirks)", "Author": "Gregory A. Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "R11Y2HVP1PRWAX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll just do a short Pro and Con list here as someone else has done, but overall I'll say first that this would be a good choice as a first smart phone for teens, people who don't want a complex super-feature phone, or older folks looking for something easy to use that won't break the bank like an iPhone.Pro List:1)  Solid build overall - feels solid for the price.2)  If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3)  Win 8 OS is fairly easy to figure out, and online tutorials are easy to find.4)  Major apps available for Win 8 OS now, secondary apps (eventually).5)  Rear camera takes *decent* photos (but no flash).6)  Slightly above average battery life.7)  Affordable, and a good value for this price range overall.8)  Screen/phone good size for \"pocketability\" - not too huge.Con List:1)  The power/standby button is VERY poorly placed about halfway down the right side of the phone - where you want to grip it, causing fairly frequent accidental pushes and therefore causing you to have to push the button again to come back out of standby mode.2)  No front facing camera (sorry, no Skype video calls).3)  Dedicated camera button on phone does not work (Dead on my phone - not sure how common this is).  As a workaround, you can touch the screen to focus and snap the shot but it's more awkward and time consuming than the button would have been.I won't comment about the T-Mobile service in a con way though some complain about it.  They do have less coverage than the other major carriers but are supposedly bolstering it with new towers all of the time.  In my particular area of metro Atlanta we can get very strong signals from Verizon, AT&T; and most of the time from Sprint.  T-Mobile's signal can be \"iffy\" and indoors I find it slipping back into a 2G speed mode.  This is not the fault of the phone, hence again, why it's not on the con list.  Just be aware that T-Mobile service can be excellent in some areas, but somewhat poor in areas where the others are still good.  Test the phone reception thoroughly when you get it in your area, home, out and about, etc.If half stars were available I'd give the phone a 3.5 instead of a 3, but the misplacement of the power button irritates me enough from a design perspective and daily use perspective that I have to knock points off more for that, along with the other cons.  Even so, there ARE much worse phones out there, and this could still be a good, basic, smart phone for those who can work around the quirks.  Alternative:  The LG L9 (Android) is a T-Mobile phone that Best Buy and Amazon regularly put on sale from $179 to $199, and it's a much more feature rich mid-range phone than the Nokia 521.  If you can handle the Android OS and don't insist on Win 8, then the LG might be worth looking into for only a few dollars more.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A real alternative to endless iOS and Android screen swiping", "Author": "M. Richardson \"virtualmike\"", "ReviewID": "R1KC5BIBL2H0FE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using Android phones and an Apple iPod touch for a few years now and have enjoyed both very much. Lately I have been reading some good press on the Nokia Windows phones and wanted to give it a try. What also got me very interested was that Nokia phones have traditionally had good hardware. I had been using a Samsung Galaxy S Blaze for about a year now and it's been solid but a bit slow. I chose it over faster cell phones because I like a phone that can go a day or two on a full charge. My wife's Samsung Galaxy 2 has a great screen but you better have a charger and a current supply around because extended use will drain it quickly. My Samsung Galaxy also an annoying problem when trying to connect to my built in Bluetooth speaker system in my car. I would have to turn the Samsung Bluetooth on and off to get it connected. This problem never occurred using my older Motorola phone.Anyway, ordered the Lumia 521 and figured I could sell it on eBay if it was a dog. I got it last Friday, July 26 and have been using it a lot.This phone is really great: it's very fast and the ability to create a custom display with what you really use makes it super easy and frustration free. No more endless side swiping to get to the app you currently need because the Windows animated tiles show what you want in the way you want. Many of the tiles function as small video screens that display information status related to the app. After using it a while I realized how limited the swiping system is in both iOS and Android.I cannot emphasis how useful and functional this is it real life when you need to get things done efficiently. Microsoft doesn't communicate this effectively and perhaps people are so conditioned to swipe, swipe, swipe to get what they want that no other way seems possible. But it really offers an extremely effective way to monitor the many information streams that mobile phones can provide. You can design a kind of information cockpit with important streams where you want them and less important info streams in a view able but less conspicuous location. And this increased efficiency translates in a better user experience.I found the interface design beautiful in terms of legible fonts and colors. A pleasure to use. Touch screen is very sensitive and fast, fast, fast. And linking up to my car's hands off Bluetooth system is quick. By the time I turn on the car engine and back out my driveway, it is always connected. No more Bluetooth tag to get a working connection.For another viewpoint, Google \"Wozniak praises windows phone\".Battery easily lasts a day.Built in speaker has plenty of volume. The 521 camera is OK, not great and there is no built in flash. For a better camera, look to the Nokia Lumia 925 with Carl Zeiss lens. For now I really don't care to spend the $$ as the pictures are good enough.This weekend I'll put my Samsung Galaxy S Blaze up for sale.

Sure it might not take the highest quality pictures, have a forward facing camera, or a rear flash, but as phones go, it's great. I can make calls and send texts, which are the basic requirement of a phone. The audio quality is fantastic, and the built-in speaker produces a great and loud sound. It also gets better coverage on the same network from my old phone, so that's another plus to it.As Windows mobile goes, sure it might not have all the fancy new apps that come out for Android or the iPhone, but there are work arounds for most of them, and the ones that you can't find you probably don't need. The functionality of the OS is spot on for my needs in the overall.The battery and the touch screen are really my only two downsides to it. The battery life is great if you're like me and you don't use the phone for constant gaming, video streaming, etc. I usually get around two days of charge when I use it as a simple phone. However, if you're into gaming or need to stream lots of videos, the batter sucks. I tend to get about four or five hours out of the battery when playing games or streaming, and that's using the power saver mode. However, the battery is accessible, meaning you might be able to replace it with a higher capacity model.As for touch screen, it can be a little unresponsive at times. Unless you game significantly on your phone, this is really a non-issue, but I had to include it for the gamers out there.On the whole, it's an entry level smart phone. It's missing features available on more expensive models, but that's the price of cutting costs. The battery life isn't the greatest, however it seems decent in comparison to higher level phones, and smart phones have never been really known for phenomenal battery performance as an item. For the price though, it's a solid phone that can call and text, has the ability to download apps, and can connect to the internet.

Do not buy a non US version of this phone, you will not be a happy camper it you reside here. The only real thing this phone is lacking is a flash for the camera, other than that it has all the rest of the normal smartphone functions. Really nothing else compares to a Windows Phone. You can have your Apple's and Android's, I will never go back. You want a Windows Phone, especially if you use your phone for any business activities. Simply the best, Office already there, Skydrive auto upload feature of all your pictures so they are immediately backed up. Manages multiple email accounts with ease. All your contacts and everything linked to your Microsoft account so if you loose or break your phone, they are still their. Simple, easy to use, never continual updates like with iPhones that seem to take hours. Longest update will be the first time you plug it in and get the software current. After that, maybe a five minute update once a year. I highly recommend any Windows Phone made by Nokia or Samsung. I am still using a 3 year old Focus Flash that has hit the ground so many times I can't even count anymore. Swimming in mud holes, dropped from two stories up onto concrete, flies into pieces. Pick up the pieces and put it back together again just like Humpty Dumpty. I will say the one thing I look for is a metal case like my Focus Flash has, they last longer.

When I first got my computer with windows 8.1 I wasn't sure I was going to like 8.1 but after getting used to it I really like the new windows. Now to have a phone with windows 8 and seeing how easy it is to work, I'm glad I bought it. For 29 dollars you can't go wrong. Of course it doesn't  have all the bells and whistles, but if you uses it for just the basics this is a great phone. It's fast, the bluetooth pairs easily, and the speech recognition works perfectly. The only thing I didn't like was the toolbar at the bottom doesn't have a back light but for 29 dollars it's a minor flaw. So if you want a great smart phone for little money this is the one. One other thing is that it's a Nokia and I've always had good luck with that brand.  Update: Now that I've had this phone for over a month I thought I'd give you an update. This was the best 29 dollars I've ever spent. I can't believe what a great phone this is. I usually buy mid priced phones because I'm not a 17 year old that needs to have all the bells and whistles. I could never justify spending 5-6 hundred dollars on a phone, like the saying goes - a fool and his money are soon parted - (Steve Jobs probably will have this put on his grave stone). Getting back to the subject - this phone has everything you'll ever need. People complain about the amount of apps available - how many apps do you need. There are some great apps available and more on the way. The voice recognition is amazing for this priced phone and I can't believe how much i like Windows 8. Windows 8 is so simple to use, I don't think I'll ever go back to android or ios. The only draw back is that it's not a fast web browser, but if your like me, I do all of my web browsing on my computer. So take it from a person who only writes reviews if the product is really good or really bad - you'll love this phone.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nokia 521 - perfect backup for me", "Author": "Happy Cappy", "ReviewID": "R36EGYL9AZB10S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all this vendor sent this way fast.

I was eager to move away from very expensive phones and was curious about Windows on the phone. It's very, very different than an Android phone and my initial reaction was negative. Android is a simpler OS (from a UI perspective).Two days into it, I'm liking this phone a lot. Getting used to Windows, and appreciate what it does. At first I was concerned about missing my apps. I got those replaced with Windows apps. I can't get the same apps and don't have the same number of choices, but they work just fine.I was also dismayed that this phone doesn't do USB tethering. What?!?!?! No tethering? How am I going to get a network connection from my phone. It has this \"internet sharing\" thing, which I begrudgingly tried. This feature is great! Much nicer than having to use a 3rd party app and a USB cable and fighting problems with those. It's things like this are making this phone attractive to me.So far this seems to be a great smartphone and I'm expecting to like it more than my Android phone - will give an update in a couple of weeks. For the price this seems like a great value.---------------------Couple of weeks later and I am really liking this phone. One caveat: it does not have the same number of apps. I'm missing one or two that were convenient to have. For me the number is that small. Otherwise, it's been great. The features are good - better than on my Android phone. The UI is different.

It will identify songs playing on the radio within  a few seconds with name and group performing. Nokia provides a free music service offline as well.

cost me just $29 you can't complain , what you get today for this pricethe phone came with $50 monthly plan and sim card for unlimited talk, text and web .. this is a great deal, I am windows user so glad to have it all under one Os, love the synchronization with my laptop and tablet , a lot of great apps , the 5 mb camera is not bad for under way , it shot nice photos even indoor with the additional lenses and also 720p video , you can use it also with your own WiFi for talk  , my internet speed test is bellow :Test Date: 1/8/2014 20:21:52Connection Type: Wi-FiServer: New York City, NYDownload: 33.05 MbpsUpload: 12.29 MbpsPing: 58 mson 4G I am getting around 20 Mbpsbut since I have optimum and free wifi on the go I save the data for the case I need itIt also have GPS so you never get lost in the city :)  great when use on bike or as I do with my adidas training app , it show me how fast I run between point A to Byou can also connect to the phone from windows phone website, see

light conditionsgreat for watching hulu, or talk on skype  when you are on the way, the only one negative thing about this phone is that it does not have front camera webcam , what a mistake , otherwise it would be a great phonebut I have my tablet, laptop and PC for doing it so not big deal for meI purchased the phone for fun , but now I like it more and more everyday I use itdid really not expectedalso using anti glare screen protector and casethe screen is nice and brightfor this price i would do that again no question that why I give it 5 stars as there is nothing that can be compared to this phone for the priceas with all things on this earth, you have to love it or hate it, it is your personal opinion , as what is good for me don't have to be good for you, however I am saying goodbye to Android on this point , win8 Os is so much more fun for me", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellant value.", "Author": "Scott Westendorf", "ReviewID": "R19ADX1VQJTIAI",

Yamamoto", "ReviewID": "R2LDK1F0V56ZG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to post a little disclaimer before I get into the review, I'm a bit of a tech junkie and my primary phone is an iPhone 5S and before that was a nexus 4 (1.5 ghz quad core, running Android 4.3 - sold it before 4.4 Kit Kat was released), so my thoughts on the Lumia is compared to my past and current high end phones.That being said, the Lumia 521 has far exceeded my expectations!Software:The first thing that caught my attention was how surprisingly fluid this phone is for a 1 ghz dual core phone. It is more fluid than the nexus 4 and just as smooth as the iPhone 5S; it just goes to show how amazing the software is optimized. You would think this was a higher clocked quad core phone! The live tiles are pretty useful as I don't have to dig deep into apps to find info, like the weather for example. The customizability isn't as good as the Android platform but on par with iOS, because well, Apple doesn't let you change much unless you are jail broken. I believe the engineers for Microsoft is on par with Apple.Hardware:The Lumia 521 has a 1 ghz dual core Snapdragon S4 plus processor with 512 mb of RAM. It has lower end specs in the smartphone world but it doesn't show it when you're scrolling and going through different apps.Camera:First off, I use my iPhone for pictures, which is among the top two (Lumia 1020) so it further makes the 5 megapixel camera on this phone seem sub par, but takes decent photos in a well-lit environment, keyword: well-lit. That was one of the gripes I had with this phone, that it doesn't have a flash. The video cam takes 720p video and actually fares well. The Nokia Smart Cam takes a series of rapid fire photos and has features like best shot, remove moving object and change faces. The change faces feature is really useful. You can actually change just the face and keep the background the way it is in case someone blinked or like another smile better. Overall, it's just okay, nothing to write home about. Another thing it lacked was a front facing camera so if you video chat, you might want to look elsewhere.Apps:Yes, their App Store is pretty limited compared to iOS and Android. It does however has a lot of useful apps like Microsoft Office and the weather channel. I expect it to continue to grow as the popularity grows.Connectivity:One thing that this phone lacked that is fairly common in smartphones is LTE connectivity. It is limited to HSPA+ 21 which is plenty fast for web browsing. Hey, they had to cut corners somewhere for this price point.Battery:It has a relatively small 1430 mAh battery but the software is very well optimized for minimal battery usage. You can enable a battery saver feature that kicks in at around 30% charge. I easily got a full day out of it, 28 hours to be exact. Since the battery is small, it charges very fast, roughly 2, maybe 3 hours to fully charge.Overall:My overall impression is like mostly all of the reviews, a GREAT value. Probably the best bang for your buck in terms of lowest price (competes with the Nexus 5; 2.3 ghz quad core - but that's around $350) and I managed to nab one for $69.99. I gave this 4 stars for lack of LTE and a flash for the camera.

The phone has a rather large screen that renders high quality pictures, videos and texts alike.  Its processor is fast and quite responsive to touch.  The phone's interface was very easy to get used to and installation/removal of apps was a snap.  As for the phone build quality, I couldn't recommend it enough.  It's the most reliable smart phone I have ever used.  No instance of freeze up, hang up, or forced shut down for several months I have using this phone.  A dedicated button for its 5 Megapixel camera is also very convenience.  For a 99 dollars phone, its camera alone is worth the price.  Web browsing on 4G is amazing, loading web pages, photos, and streaming video are equally fast on the phone thanks to it fast processors.  Call quality is quite decent, most of my calls on this phone were quite clear.  There are some drawbacks, such as few apps are available for windows platform, its hard plastic cover is not comfortable to hold, and it only has three preset brightness levels.

Music: plays well and clarity is good at high volumes too. Better than many low end androids that I used. Not as good as my Iphone or S3, If I rate Iphone and S3 as 100 and 96 then this would be a 85: as good as my BB Bold2. Browsing: phone is good in this department as well. S3 is only better because it has a larger screen  and the super sensitive touch is great, 4\" screen is large enough for convenient browsing.3. GPS: I think this phone beats all others hands down. You can have offline maps, just download  US maps which is about 2.5GB by connecting to WiFi and you are good to go. You don't need data for navigating. But might need data to search something on the map, u can try and avoid that too. If you don't have data plan then look for points of interest and navigate.So far am loving the phone, people who are looking for gaming and high end photography might be disappointed and there's no front camera for video call or Skype. but its a great phone for $80 (I bought  it on hsn)Windows 8 tiles is impressive too, so far I have no complainsI would highly recommend this phone for anyone who would like to give a try to windows phones.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Choice for First Smart Phone", "Author": "Ng", "ReviewID": "R2CXX7KXZOM1DO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone.

I downloaded quite a bit of music and podcasts and have only used my 5th Gen IPod a couple of times since my purchase, because this works so well.Pros:- Intuitive and responsive screen- Great storage, and expandable to 64 Gb- Good music player- There appear to be quite a few apps, including free ones (don't have much use for many apps)Cons:- I'm not a fan of the screen colors (maybe there's a way to change it?)- I searched for several hours online and there doesn't seem to be a way to connect my phone directly to my car like my IPod does.  I know I can use a line in cord, but I still nipped a star for it, because it's ridiculous that Microsoft hasn't done this for Windows smart phones.

I have an android pad and would have rather had an android phone but for the money I am thrilled that I bought this phone.One of the keys to enjoying this phone is to take the time the time to setup your home screen tiles properly. If you hold your finger on a tile it will allow you to modify the tile, you can change the size, the location and add and delete tiles from your home page. I like to have all of my tiles display on one page so I removed everything I don't use and shrunk most of them to fit on one page. The tiles I left large are those that can display information in the tile like the weather channel and my photographs.  I have added a screen protector and a protective case to the phone.

I had a flip phone with T Mobile, mostly for emergencies and rare phone calls. Sure, I didn't really NEED a smartphone, but dragging my nine inch android tablet places wasn't all that convenient (and made me feel kinda dorky, frankly). I like that I can check my mail and my Facebook, do a little surfing, scan QR codes, play a few games, use the free nokia mixradio, use the calendar, use the free here maps which have turn by turn even without a connection...you know, do stuff that all the really expensive phones do and maybe some they don't. Oh, and you tube and videos look surprisingly good on this little phone!I refuse to pay an arm and a leg for data, so I will be using only WiFi for that. Many places I go to have it for free, including my workplace...which I of course only access at break time... I also get somewhat sketchy cell service at my house, so WiFi calling may come in handy, although we do still have a landline (which also costs an arm and a leg but that's another issue).A note about notifying T Mobile about my new phone: there was absolutely no pressure put on me to buy a data plan; in fact they didn't even mention it! Color me shocked...I was only disappointed that I could not take care of it online, as pay as you go customers were instructed on the website to call to update a new Sim card onto their account, so I feared a sales pitch.My husband now wants one of these, too...easier than carrying around his iPad mini, but tons less expensive than buying an iPhone.So, is it worth the money and am I satisfied? You betcha! And now I know how to work android, iOS, and windows on all different kinds of devices.Looking forward, too, to the WP 8.1 update coming soon.

You know, a pre-paid $30 per month phone that I wouldn't care if it got banged up a bit.Now this is the only phone I use, period.  What makes it so great?  The Operating System.  Yeah, I know ... Your saying the same thing I said 'yeah, right' ... but its True.. its just works, its fast and the ability to PIN anything from anywhere INSIDE of a program is awesome.PIN TILESThe PIN thing:  For instance. the people I contact frequently EACH have their own tile right on the home screen - Each webpage (like amazon.com) I frequent has its own tile right on the home screen ... Each band (or down the song) or playlist has ITS OWN tile.. all RESIZABLE and easily prepositional ...NAVIGATIONNokia HERE maps - Nokia really went out of their way to make this FREE GPS MAP system great.  Free traffic, etc - everything you expect from Google Maps - but somehow prettier ...CHEAP PRE-PAID (Auto-pay if you want) PLANS$30 a month for UNLIMITED data (5GB 4G unthrottled, 3G 100% unthrottled), UNLIMITED TXT msgs, 100 Mins in Voice time ($.10/min after that) ... The 100 Mins  kind of made me thing a bit about it... I haven't reached that limit yet - Partly because the WIFI calling works GREAT - Leaps and bounds better than it did with any previous phone (although last time I tried WIFI calling it was about 5 years ago) ...I did NOT get this phone on Amazon.com - I picked it up from BEST BUY, right off the shelf for $80.If you want the $30 a month DO NOT activate the phone at BEST BUY.  Do it from T-MOBILE.com - just grab the phone and check out.. For some reason the $30 month deal is only valid through T-MOBILE.com.  Its super easy if you can read instructions... and maybe even if you cant :) ...BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on this phone is so far the best out of any other smartphone I've had.  I usually leave WIFI on all the time and I usually charge it once every 3 days or so ... I do watch videos, listen to music, etc - so its probably being used as an average smartphone would be.CAMERAThere is NO front facing camera on this phone... so If you HAVE to take perfect selfies, you may want to upgrade to the next Lumia ...STORE APPSI think major companies are finally realizing how fast Windows 8 Phones are growing in market shares - There are apps popping in all the time... Wanna check to see if you app will be on there before you invest your $100 in a phone?  [...]PROFESSIONAL's BEST BUYMicrosoft OFFICE - ONE DRIVE (skydrive) all built right in ... all designed to work right out of the box...COLLEGE STUDENTS BEST BUY (see PROFESIONALS BEST BUY + FB, Instagram, Twitter, etc all available as one would expect) ...SUMMERY - No one now-a-days has $600 to throw away on a device...

I think their OS is great and offers users a different experience. It is NOT the most exciting OS out there, but at the same time, it is a very solid OS and runs very smoothly. It is not a battery hog or glitchy like the Android OS. My pros and cons are below. I know my cons list might be a bit long, but remember that you are getting a lot for the price.

I highly reccomend this product, and for the price if all you get is a basic plan, thats ok. All of nokias apps are free to use and acess without service or wifi. Although one feature is call through wifi. great phone. Best one ive ever owned.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone at great price. Worth it for offline navigation alone.", "Author": "Romwell", "ReviewID": "R36I60LR2ILDK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My #1 reason for purchasing this phone is that you can download maps for the whole world and use them without even inserting the SIM card. Flying in the airplane and tracking its position on the screen, comparing the map to what's outside the window is something you can do on Nokia 521 out of the box (and can't easily do on most other phones).Yes, navigation works in offline/airplane mode, without the data connection. You need to insert the SIM card to activate Nokia Drive, but after that you can just use WiFi to download maps for the whole world, one country with one button press. Navigation software is easy to use and see if you place the phone on the dashboard; extra data speed limit is displayed, and text-to-speech for street names is available in English at the very least (haven't checked other languages).Aside from that, Windows 8 is surprisingly nice and easy to use. Many of the good things come from the OS itself. Now Microsoft, Nokia and Skype are one company, so all the products place well with each other. If you have Windows 8 installed, you will be familiar with the Metro UI; while I am still unsure about it on the desktop, it definitely works well on the phone, providing fast access to all features and settings. It is quite minimalistic, but does what is required of it.Hardware-wise, this phone is fast; everything loads just the way it should. Touch screen is sensitive and precise, can use it with fingernails; multi-touch is supported, of course. You can share the 4G connection over Wi-Fi in two seconds; or you can use your home Wi-Fi.Battery lasts a day with (my) average usage if you turn on the battery saver mode (prevents live tiles from updating automatically, which I don't use anyway). The phone is using the same BL-5J battery as my old Nokia 5230 Nuron (that I am upgrading from).Overall, I am more than happy with the phone. I bought it for the maps and WiFi hotspot functionality, but now I often use it to check email and make skype calls/chat conversations instead of pulling out my old netbook. Calendar and facebook/google integration are also very nice. Nokia photos apps (panorama, cinemagraph) are a nice touch as well.On the downside, there are not as many applications on the market as there are for Android; this is changing for the better, though (I will probably contribute an app: student dev licenses are free). Also, I am not sure I like they way files are managed on the phone (apparently, this is similar to iOS): for instance, if there's no app to open a file extension, IE will not save it to the memory/sd card. There are third party apps that remedy this to some extent, but I have found that many apps rely on Skydrive to store and access files, which is silly (what if there's no signal?) and costly (in terms of data and battery). However, with my usage, this is not yet a problem.I would generally recommend it to anyone, especially if working offline navigation is a desirable feature.SUMMARYPROS: completely offline navigation, WiFi hotspot, Windows 8, simple, fastCONS: not too many apps yet, Windows 8 way of dealing with files is too restrictive, battery life is average.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly capable phone .", "Author": "txmail", "ReviewID": "R2NMPG7XFXDAXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The screen on this thing is not viewable in the sun, and the material the screen is made of attracts smudges like no other material I know - but at the end of it all it is a very capable phone.

Clay \"drakkar91\"", "ReviewID": "R169X9A26SPRDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Once T-Mobile introduced the all inclusive (talk, text, web) for $50 a month with no contract, I knew it was time to buy a new phone and replace my \"known memory issues\" phone, the Samsung Gravity Smart Android Phone, Sapphire Blue (T-Mobile).  My first cell phone ever (in 2004) was a Nokia no frills model.  That would be followed by 3 Samsung models (2 flip phones that were very good and a smart phone that was utter junk).  Based on how poor the Samsung product was I was using, I looked away from Samsung and decided to give Nokia a chance again - and this time with Windows 8.  I must admit, I had little clue what the major differences would entail.Opening the Box and Basic Start-up:Out of the box and initial setup was a 1-star event.  The back cover is as tight (or tighter) than a spaceship cover.  I had to actually take it to a T-Mobile store and have them remove the back (which they did easily).  Next up, the battery.  Inserting it was no issue, but getting it out?  To this day, that requires a paper clip!  Even a veteran Smartphone user at work couldn't get it out.  Why did I need to get it out you ask?  After charging it, I needed to insert my SIM card from my old phone.The SIM Card:The SIM card slot is underneath the battery and smaller than the one I was using from a phone about 3 years old.  TIP: The T-Mobile rep had a device that could cut the old SIM card to fit the new phone (while also allowing you to switch it back to your old phone if the new one failed).  This is important if your cell phone is your only means of communication (nice to have a backup option).  Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail. The \"oh so easy\" process to import did not work.  A 45 minute call with T-Mobile and a 30 minute chat with Windows Support and eventually we got lucky.  Unfortunately, it created 2 Outlook profiles and now one had to be deleted.  Because it's a Windows phone, my guess is it wanted me to create an Outlook account, vs. using my GMAIL account.  I did that, then we had to send the contacts CSV file from GMAIL to Outlook.  Then the phone could not import the CSV file and already was advising me to download an App for that!  Enough already!  There was not apparent option to download from My T-Mobile account to the phone.  To which I ask why?  Seems like someone missed a step.Using the Windows Phone Platform - The Early Days:This is no Android phone! If you have never used Windows 8, let alone on a phone, there is a huge learning curve.  Be prepared - if you're not a fighter, you may give up (especially if you're still battling inserting the battery, SIM or importing your contacts).Windows Phone - A Few Weeks Along:It gets better! Once you realize sliding to the left reveals an alphabetical list of applications and options, you'll start to breathe again. It's a Windows Phone, not an iPhone, not an Android.  All 3 platforms have their own quirks, challenges and successes.The Phone and Apps:The keyword is \"tiles\".  As a Windows phone, it's got a 1 touch button to search Bing!  I use it, I like it.  Of course it has a tile for Internet Explorer, Messaging, your default email (be that Yahoo!, GMAIL or Outlook) and you can add tiles for other email accounts.  Tiles for the Navigation App (Driving) - which is 1,000 times better than whatever was on my Samsung Android.  Many apps are Nokia designed exclusive for the Windows 8 phone, and I like them all (but it takes time to understand and learn some of them, like the music app).  It comes with a phone version of Office (have not used it yet), but no way to open a CSV file (commonly opened with Excel).  Are there less app's for Windows Phone?  Yes, which is also why these phones are still a great value.  Nokia offers several apps titled HERE! and all I have used performed well.Typing or Speaking?Of course it has word prediction technology.  What it doesn't have is memory to remember that you regularly type a word not in its dictionary!  Here the Android beats the Windows phone, as it remembered funny words or names you used often.  It has voice recognition so you can speak your messages - my Android did too, but the Windows Phone is better.  However, within certain apps, the voice option does not appear, which is annoying if you want to speak vs. type your message.Best 2 Pro's:1. I actually have come to like the smooth Windows 8 tile interface. Very receptive to touch!2. Great connectivity - no dropped calls nor failed messages sent (a constant issue with my Samsung Android on the same T-Mobile network). Proof it was the phone, not the network.Worst 2 Con's:1. As other reviewers I have seen mentioned, the phone shuts off / restarts way too often.  Press the button to take a photo, and bam, your phone restarts.  I have read this will be resolved when Windows 8.1 for T-Mobile phones is released, in July 2014 they estimate.2. No flash! Really? My \"free\" (with contract) Samsung Gravity Smart acquired years ago had a flash!  And flash is available on every other Nokia Lumia phone!  Aaargh - the one cheap design flaw.The Final Verdict:I like my Windows 8 phone, and would recommend it - even buy it again! It truly beats my Samsung Android in almost every aspect.  If the upper tier models were more reasonably priced, I would definitely consider the upgrade for more storage of apps and the camera with flash option.  If you desire iPhone quality photos and video, you won't get it in a $70 to $90 Nokia Lumia, which is justified.  If you are app addicted, you'll need to stick with another platform until Windows Phones become more popular.  If you have had enough of over-priced phones, Android or iPhone living, or you're looking for a fresh, sweet phone with lots of features for an unbeatable price, try the Lumia 521 (but expect a learning curve and some early on challenges).

There may be 100s of 1000s more apps for IOS and Android, but Windows Phone has most of the \"high usage\" apps. Just received my phone a few days ago and coming from Android I'm not missing much. Facebook, Groupon, Pandora, Spotify, Groupme, Instagram to name a few were all readily available.Have to agree with just about everyone on this phone, a friend just picked up an LG Android skinned for around the same price, and this absolutely blows it out of the water.Pros:Display - While not AMOLED quality, very sharp.OS - Coming from Android, or really any smart phone, it's actually very intuitive and easy to set up, I didn't need to read anything to get everything the way I wanted.Windows 8 phone feels extremely well designed, there are things I miss from my Galaxy like the drag down summary screen, but I've found most things easily accessible.Build quality - The phone feels great, it honestly feels better than my last phone which was almost 10 times more expensive.Design - Button placement etc feels good, there are some nice built in hardware touches i.e. hitting the volume rocker pops up your music player, hitting the search button brings up search engine, hitting the camera button (Dedicated camera button on side) brings up the camera app.Speakers - good, already back to using my phone as my portable music player.Speed - This is the low end of the lumia series, but it's virtually unnoticeable. Slight load times occasionally, but for the most part everything opens up smoothly with sharp animations.Internet - Good, you get 4g with this phone, I had 4g lte with my last phone...it's a little slower.Photos - Decent quality, and able to switch through camera programs quickly.Touch screen - This isn't quite on par with the best touch screens, noticeably on the bottom navigation buttons I sometimes have to tap twice, but very responsive.Cons -Headset jack - Sometimes (and it's plugged in firmly), I'll start a music app with the headphones plugged in and it will play over the speakers, if I unplug/replug it after starting the app it will pipe through the headphones, annoying to have to do that though.Dead pixel - Honestly I didn't notice this after 3 days of fiddling around with the phone on..but when I restarted one day and the screen was blank and lit I did notice a dead pixel...absolutely not noticeable during use but still there.Flash - This phone doesn't have one, but be honest how many low light shots really turn out with a camera phone anyways?Forward facing camera - For \"Selfies\" the easy-to- hit dedicated camera button means selfies are pretty easy to take.. if you facetime or anything like that this won't work.Call quality - During the first day there was noticeable static on the line, through various callers etc, never had that on my old phone.Overall this is retail dollar for dollar probably the best phone out there bar-none. I've researched lots of phones at various price points, demo'd them, gotten feedback from friends, on top of the actual other phones I've owned. Not saying it's better than a GS4, or Iphone5 etc of course but considering how much more they cost. (at certain times this phone drops to $60-70 with no contract) this is a ridiculously good deal, a no-brainer 5 star product.Honestly this phone is still a backup when it's all said and done, I'll use it as my primary phone for the next 6 months, but I'll upgrade when my plan allows. That being said, I'm not really biased towards any of the major 3 players, and this phone has planted Windows Phone as a contender for my $$ when I purchase a top of the line phone.

The camera no good for taking photos where there is no light/when it's dark out.  The camera is quirky as well when taking pictures, this circle icon appears and it takes like 3s for it to focus and take a shot.  It would be even better if the camera button had two stages, half press to focus, and full press to take shot, which it does not.  It only offers a full press that focuses and takes the shot which you have to wait 3s and hope that the shot is good at the end of the 3s.  Also the keys don't light up in the dark so you have to guess where the keys are.  It would be way more of a complete package with a flash and lit keys.

NOKIA MUSIC is fantastic.  Ads free music with offline availability.  We have not listened to Pandora since getting this phone.  HERE DRIVE is available offline as a GPS with turn to turn voice guided direction.  BING, although not as good as Chrome at doing searches, provides excellent results for locations of interest (restaurant, stores, etc) with link to tripadvisor's detailed location info that can be pinned to screen (address, phone, direction) and automatic link to phone call or HERE DRIVE with a simple click.  SKYPE is available for chat, and calls to landlines for a very small fee. LIVE TILES allow me to view schedules on my calendar, pictures, music, new mails/messages, etc.  Even Nook for reading books and NETFLIX for watching movies if I wanted to do this, but honestly who would do this on a small phone?  Youtube HD is good even though Google decided not to make it available for windows phone for competitive reason, but again who would watch youtube on a phone with better devices (smart TV, computers, tablets, etc) readily available anywhere in the house or workplaces.  Most of all, I got the phone for $70 with $20 credits for the APP store.  I could easily replace it if I break it, lose it or whatever bad happens to it.  Very easy to navigate.  My 8 year old told me that it was more clearly laid out than his mini.  He even downloaded some games on my phone and plays with my phone instead of the mini from time to time.

For instance you have to pay for apps different than the Nokia music that's different than Xbox music. With iPhones the same payment method is captured between the iPhone app store and iTunes. I like that they both syncs up that way. Everything is interrelated with the iPhone.*Whether I'm using the Tmo network or wifi, pages load more slowly than with iPhone.*Also, there are not as many apps or podcasts for Windows, but there are enough to keep me occupied and who needs all those games? This is great for helping me be productive. I must say, however, because there are less podcasts, I was able to find Joan Sotkin, which I never would have found or be introduced through iTuns on iPhone. (I love her. She approaches prosperity from a holistic viewpoint.)Pros*I love the customizable live tiles. You can see what the weather is like without opening up the app. I've made direct links to Coast to Coast Am, Contacttalkradio.com, and my favorite music, all without having to open the app to play them. (I miss Hay House Radio though, but I can listen to that on my computer.)*You can try out apps for developers who let you, so you don't invest/commit money and then not be happy with your purchase.*Phone quality seems nicer. I'm not saying \"huh\" every other sentence on some calls.*UPGRADABLE memory. For around less than $50 I am at 64gigs plus the original 8 that came with the phone. Should I upgrade my phone, I can just bring the card with me. SCORE!Hopefully I can get over the little bit slower lag time it takes for the screens to load on the Internet. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase. You can find this phone from $20-120. Shop around. Last time I saw, Frys Electronics was offering a $20 phone with Metro service through some kind of rebate. No bad. The vendor through Amazon changes prices regularly charging from $75 to $99. Again, shop around. HSN had this phone for $75, plus you get a phone cover and other extras.I would prefer the iPhone 5s, but for reasons I won't get into here, I am beholdin to the Windows phone.Also, I found out that Nokia is offering an instant $20 app card with the purchase of this phone.

As near as i can tell, its because the battery is losing contact upon shock, or even a gentle squeeze in your hand. I have other issues, too, which I'll list, but this first one is the deal breaker, everything else is just for information purposes for others.CONS.The capacitance of the screen is too high for me. I have been using the touch features, but the sensitivity is so great, i've 'floated' my finger near the screen without touching, and the phone counted it as a touch.The camera's LUX/low light sensitivity is TERRIBLE. Pictures indoors after dusk will be all but useless without major ambient light.It also has no notification LED to let you know if a txt is waiting, and the Windows buttons are not back-lit and impossible to see in the dark.Apparently, the hardware for the sound in this phone is a budget chip that has no hardware supported features like DSP and EQ. No app exists for EQ of sound either. Thats really sad considering even cheap Symbian phones from Nokia of before could do that. This phone even uses the same battery as the Nokia Nuron.I didn't realise how much i miss a 'click' vibrate when typing a touch keyboard. this phone does not have such a thing.At least half of the phones STOCK functions do not tilt into horizontal mode, including the navigation map, this is highly annoying. Also, generally speaking, the phone's UI is a bit difficult to navigate without looking directly at it. I noticed this while driving that i could operate my previous phone without looking at it and not have to look away from the road.There is also a general design paradigm problem I have with Windows Phone as a platform.This phone's UI flys in the face of 30 years of cellphone design. when the phone rings, most phones offer a green answer button, and a red hangup/goto VM button. not Windows phone. the answer button takes on the colour of whatever 'theme' colour you've set.The Modus operandii as I have come to find in using WP is that Microsoft wants you to replace/overwrite existing programs, accounts, and apps that you use in an effort to unify your experience in WP.  This is so that Microsoft can link all of your activities together in order to track your usage habits more accurately. This is basically the same as Google forcing people to create a Google+ account in order to be allowed to use Youtube features.The goal of both companies is the same, to track your habits and use the data for marketing. No matter how anonymous Microsoft and Google assure me such info gathering is, and that it is forced compliance to use their technology, doesn't mean I like it.example: the Skype app for WP rejects any existing accounts you have and wants you to create a new account with Microsoft. only then are you permitted to 'link' your existing account to the newly forced Microsoft account.this process serves Microsoft far more than it serves you as a user, because Microsoft now ties all your usage of Skype to all your other activities online to build more usable profile about your habits.If you install an SD card, WP wants to 'sync' your data with a backup cloud and refuses to simply browse the contents of the card. There is no 'file manager' to browse the contents of an SD card.  The WP system is setup so that all apps can only access their own storage thats set aside. While this has the potential to greatly increase security, the way its implemented completely hamstrings what most think to be a very common phone feature. Even 3rd party file managers that you may download are restricted by WP to not allow access to a 'music' or 'document' folder on your SD card.Many applications that came with the phone demand location services that have no business needed to know where you're at.  Calender, games, help & tips, and others.that being said, the system isn't bad, but it isn't for everyone. if you've already given in to super integration and forced compliance with tracking, you won't care even a little bit about what I've pointed out.EDIT:Additional problems have appeared. For one, even when it has full connectivity with 4g coverage, it REFUSES to connect to service until I disable the connection (airplane mode or reboot) and reconnect it. This only affects voice service, data still functions perfectly, leaving me to think its not a service issue.also, the voice to text feature requires network access to work. That means they are downloading every voice to text message you make, analysing it remotely and sending you back what they think you said.  That means they're keeping every recording you make...", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "My First Windows Phone", "Author": "squinky86", "ReviewID": "R1S2NDQE9CECTL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nokia Lumia 521 to get into the world of Windows Phone App development, but have found that I quickly need to get out.THE GOOD:* The phone is fast. With half the processor of the Android phone it was replacing, it still feels like a hardware upgrade.* The interface is intuitive - the tiles afford no explanation to figure out what each one does. It's very easy to use this phone.* The price is good.* T-mobile wifi calling.* Sturdy construction; this phone should last you for a while.THE BAD:* Apps. There aren't any really good ones.* The ability to make apps on this phone has been CRIPPLED with the version 8 update.  - Do you want to record a phone call? You can no longer do that because Microsoft makes it so that you can't access the microphone while in the middle of a call.  - Do you want to build an app that manages wireless connections? Too bad - the wireless interface is completely inaccessible form code.  - Do you want to change your default keyboard? Sorry - Microsoft says you have to stick with theirs.* No flash (camera and browser), but already knew that before buying.* Try plugging your phone into your Windows 8 computer with the Windows 8 Phone app up while an sd card is plugged into your phone... oh, you aren't allowed to access the phone while an sd card is in use? I have to turn off my phone and use an sd card reader just to get images off my card.* Wifi calling does not switch between wifi and cell zones as seamlessly as the Android app does. It takes nearly a full minute once you've left wifi coverage before the app will give up and switch you back to cell coverage.* EDIT: When wifi calling is enabled, you cannot receive MMS (multi-media messages). They won't download properly, and t-mo won't let you change the bad settings to get them (this is a wifi calling app problem with t-mobile). Every time the download of the MMS fails, you receive a new text alert even though you don't have a new message.THE UGLY:* Google is blocking access to the API key that Microsoft uses for the Youtube app, making the default youtube application unusable. Google - you don't make an API key and then complain when someone uses data from it to build an app. Microsoft - you don't change Google's advertising code provided by the API. Both companies - get your act together!!!THE BOTTOM LINE:I highly recommend this phone if you want a fast little smart phone capable of calling, browsing the web, and staying connected with friends. If you are a power user that wants to record calls, do massive amounts of texting, or build your own applications - the iOS and Android platforms are leaps and bounds beyond what Windows is even capable of doing. Until Microsoft gives developers the ability to create powerful and usable apps on their platform, the Windows Phones will forever be in the realm of low-end smartphones that aren't capable of reaching the complexity and power provided by the iOS and Android platforms.Final rating - 2 stars. Unusable for my needs, but may serve others' well enough.

This is my first Windows Phone (8.0). The phone is pretty easy to set up.  I had GMail, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn set up in minutes. The phone is extremely responsive and it recognized my 16GB mircoSD card.After a few minutes a few things stood out as troublesome:* The user interface wastes a lot of screen real estate. For instance in the \"news\" social update app almost the top 1/4 of the screen is taken up with huge words. The UI relies on font size and color way too much.  The screen real estate is not big enough for that layout.* You can only choose two background colors: black or grey. Black is too hard to sort out content and gray is annoying.* The power status not displayed by default.  I'm always paranoid about power level and having to swipe to see it is annoying. I turned on \"Battery Saver\" just in case.* Setup defaults to the least private options. both Nokia and Microsoft seem to want to track everything I do.* The music app doesn't have a mode to browse by file hierarchy. Id you load up mp3 files organized by folders on the microSD it isn't possible to easily select them individually.* Many important apps aren't pinned to the start page by default and a lot of useless ones are.* Setup seems to connect you to Facebook but you need to download the app to really read posts. The pictures in the news section are far too small.* No option to display text messages on the swipe screen.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value, but BEWARE: faulty headphone jack breaks easily, and Nokia support is of no help!", "Author": "LucaR", "ReviewID": "R18P8HWU6EB2QP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about 4-5 months ago and I've been happy with it as a phone. The battery life is good, it's zippy and relatively lag-free, especially given its pedestrian hardware, and I like the Windows Phone OS. The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned. The screen isn't the greatest, but given the price, it's hard to hate anything about this phone.Well, except one thing. The headphone jack! Under normal use, my headphone jack got \"loose\" after about 2 months, causing the audio to cut in and out whenever the cord brushed up against something. The problem got progressively worse until I gave up and mailed it to Nokia support.They sent me back my phone without any changes. They didn't fix the problem! What horrible service. And now my friend who has the same phone tells me his headphone jack is cutting out as well.As far as I can tell, this phone has a FLAWED design. I'm not sure I even want to bother trying to send it back to Nokia - even if they do bother fixing it, it'll probably just break again in a few months.For those who listen to music or podcasts on your phone - better invest in a set of bluetooth headphones if you buy this phone.

Johnston", "ReviewID": "R1O383LH17152H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since Apple effectively bricked my formerly working iPhone 4 with the release of iOS 7, I became a refuge and ran into the warm, welcoming arms of Nokia. So far, I have not been disappointed with these phones, though I admit to having held my nose at the thought of switching to a Windows-based anything. From everything I've seen so far, at under $100, these are an excellent bargain.My gripe is not with the phone. Rather, it is with the product description, which is comically inadequate for an Amazon-sold item. I offer a warning to all those buying this phone who plan on subscribing to T-Mobile with anything other than a prepaid plan: it won't work - at least not until you buy new sim cards, for those included with this product may only be activated on T-Mobile's prepaid plans.  Anything else, such as the family plan I wanted to signup for,  will require that you purchase a new sim card. Unfortunately, Amazon's description doesn't mention that, and the signup sheet that comes with the phone doesn't make it clear either. So pity me, spending  3 hours  bouncing from person to person at T-Mobile for an explanation of how to get the 2 phones I purchased setup. Finally, I had a moment of inspired genius and simply called their sales line to get an answer.So is the phone worth the money? Absolutely. In fact, it's probably worth more than you'll pay for it. But Amazon's sorry product description has left me with a sour taste in my mouth that I don't usually have when buying from them. I'm out $22 for new sim cards, plus the 3 hours I spent that I could have avoided if only Amazon had mentioned one of the most critical details about this product.UPDATE:I contacted Amazon regarding the product's inadequate description and how it had caused me (and probably others) to waste so much time trying to activate a phone with a sim wholly unsuited to anything but use on a prepaid plan. Credit them with doing the right thing. They acknowledged the problem, extended a refund to me for the cost of two sim cards and said the catalog team had been notified and the description would be updated.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for the price; bad for the build", "Author": "huaping mo", "ReviewID": "R3K89RXHTG9G4V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "very good price for a smart phone.I bought the same model about 8 months ago, but now the power switch is barely working. wifi calling keeps taking over at home and prevents multimedia messaging.other points: wp is not as efficient as iphone; needs reboot more often (just like PC's).", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ordered two and neither of them worked.", "Author": "Krista Ward", "ReviewID": "R2EZT1I1TXDVLI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered two of these phones.

He's not technical and he doesn't care about installing more apps.[Good]Easy to Use: Just as intuitive as iPhone. In some ways it's even easier to use.Original and innovative UI: Unlike other mobile operating systems, it doesn't feel like a cheap copy of iOS. The Windows 8 tile UI is innovative and just plain nice. Of course like everything else not everyone will like it but it's original.The Best for the Vision Impaired: All text can be made bigger. Also, unlike iOS you can even resize buttons on the Home Screen. It even has a high contrast option. In my opinion this is the best for people who can't see very well.Cheap: You can't beat the value. It's stylish, functional, fast, and it's at a low price point.Pay as You Go: It's compatible with pay as you go plans. I'd say the Lumia's are the best phones for those plans if the iPhones aren't available.(T-Mobile only I think) Wi-fi Enabled Calling: On T-Mobile, if you have access to wireless internet; calls won't count against your minutes.It has all the core apps that you need: Email, Facebook, Skype, Twitter, a Web Browser, and more.Decent Camera: It's 5 MP. For the price, it's not bad.Expandable to 64 GB: You can add extra SD storage up to 64 GB.Good Performance: Pretty fast and I rarely noticed any lag. Then again I didn't even try playing games on it, even though Angry Birds is included on the phone.Good Facebook Integration: The phone seamlessly merges everything on your Facebook into all parts of the phone. i.e. All of your phone contacts will have extra data like pictures and email pulled from Facebook, making it one of the nicest phone contact UIs found on a smartphone.Good MS Services Integration: The phone seamlessly works with everything Microsoft like Skydrive and Skype.[Bad]There are very few apps compared to either Android or iPhone. Thankfully the main ones like Facebook, Skype, Google Maps, Viber, and What's App are available. If you like apps, this isn't the phone to get.Build Quality: While the front of the phone is nice, the back of it is all cheap plastic. I don't mind since it's a cheap phone.No Camera Flash: Pictures with poor lighting will not turn out well. It's an understandable sacrifice for the price.No Front Camera: You're not going to be able to use this for video chatting with Skype. It's understandable for the price.Extra SD storage can only be used by pictures, videos, and music: Apps are only limited to the 4 GB of storage that the phone comes with (yes it's really 8GB but the Windows 8 OS itself uses up 4 GB of it so you only have 4GB left to use). Only the videos and pictures that you take, and the music that you add can use the extra storage. This would be really bad if Windows 8 had a lot of apps. Fortunately (and unfortunately) there aren't very many apps on Windows 8 Mobile.Call Quality: It's horrible isn't great when it's not on speaker phone. Even when the volumed is maxed, I can barely hear anything.[Verdict]Personally I'm sticking to an iPhone for myself. If you're younger AND open to new tech then iOS or Android is for you. If you don't care about the latest apps and games or are firmly into Windows, this is a really great starter smartphone at a low price.This phone is just really awesome for the elderly.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "If there exists a better smart phone deal...", "Author": "Centauri \"Centauri\"", "ReviewID": "R30COFQ5M50K46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...I'd love for somebody to shine a light on it, because it must exist in some dark corner somewhere.

I had no trouble getting them to email the unlock code to my friend, then he forwarded to me.Now, WHY did I do this when the AT&T; Nokia 520 is cheaper? Because the T-Mobile phone doesn't automatically come up in their database when it connects. They don't know it's a smartphone as long as I have cell data and location services turned off.

If you're a first time smartphone buyer, you may not know what you're missing, but if you're a Android (Nexus) or iOS user, you'll definitely feel the downgrade.I've had the device for about three months now, and I'd like to share my observations.Pros:+The WP8 layout/style is appealing+Performance/responsiveness is solid (especially compared to Android devices)+Idle/low-use battery life is great+Nokia Music offers ad-free streaming music+Nice physical construction+Simple, expandable storage+Live tiles bring the best elements of widgets into a sane formatCons:-Screen is mediocre (resolution and viewing angles are tolerable/sufficient, but not great; a little small; poor contrast/black levels)-App support is extremely lacking (and free apps are generally ad-riddled)-Internet Explorer/UC Browser can't handle large/multiple web pages, and Opera Mini isn't available-Music/podcasting support is very poor (no gapless playback, regardless of app; no playback speed adjustment; built-in podcast support is weak and other podcast apps cannot automatically update; playlist support needs to improve)-Lack of Google services/support, even using Internet Explorer-Scrolling vertically through the homescreen to get to apps/live tiles is cumbersome-Multitasking is quite limited; most apps require a lengthy resume process upon switching-Active/moderate usage drains battery fast (note that there's a bug in Internet Explorer that will let it keep running scripts even if it is closed)-There's a dedicated hardware Bing! buttonWishlist: I'd love for Microsoft to offer some better app organization (e.g., horizontally scrolling hub-style home screen), a better core media app (gapless playback, simplified design, sane podcast management), and switch the search button back to fast, context-sensitive searches (with a long-press for full Bing) in WP8.1.Overall: I'm using the Lumia 521 primarily for media playback (while at the gym or on the go) and as a quick-reference second screen, and it's mostly fine for those purposes (with the caveats listed above). It's a huge step down from iOS in terms of apps, though -- not only are games right out, but banking apps, city services (paying parking meter fare, etc.), hobby/website apps, GMail, Pulse, Opera Mini and the like are also unavailable and the closest equivalents/workarounds are a tremendous downgrade. Overall, I'm still happier with the 521 than I've been with any non-Nexus Android phone/tablet I've owned, and I may very well make it my main phone/portable device if supplemented with a tablet (probably an iPad Mini).In summary, if you're unwilling to spend more than $100 for a smartphone (and can't find a used iPhone 4 or better for that price), the Lumia 521 is the device to get. Just note that it's a big step down from high-end devices (iPhone 4 or better, Nexus 4, HTC One, Galaxy S4/Note 3) and the app ecosystem is much, much worse than what you'd find on iOS or Android.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery Life", "Author": "c.c.strandberg", "ReviewID": "RWJIOGNLBAWXY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Quality control must really be bad as of the reviews I read I'm not the only one not liking this phone.

That is an insane deal for a phone with a dual core processor, 4G connectivity and a micro SD slot. After my wife dropped her 8x and broke the screen I got her this one as a replacement because it was cheaper than any phone I could find, including used ones. It has exceeded my expectations in pretty much every way.Pros:- It has great hardware for the price, a dual core snapdragon processor and 512 mb of ram is nothing to scoff at in this price range.-Windows 8 is very fluid and snappy, masking the fact that this is a budget phone.-The case is stylish and looks flush to the screen while still being easy to remove-Has a micro SD slot, unlike most windows phones no matter the price range- No features commonly locked by carriers like WiFi calling and tetheringCons:- The screen could be sharper, but what do you expect?- The face gets smudged pretty easily.- it's pretty thick and the case selection is badWindows phones have a distinct advantage in the cheap phone arena because Windows 8 is so light and snappy even low end phones are fast and responsive when running it. Even though this is a budget phone there really isn't any noticeable performance woes. In fact, comparing it to my S3, it's usually keeping up or faster in every day tasks. Obviously the low end specs catch up to it in apps with a high demand such as 3D games, but for day to day internet browsing, streaming, calling and texting it's plenty fast.If you are someone who is looking for a budget phone that can still keep up with the other smart phones, you've found it. The fact that the phone is so cheap OFF CONTRACT is nuts considering even the junkiest of phones are at least $200 off contract at Verizon or Sprint.TIP: Pair this phone with the either of the cheap T mobile prepaid plans for $30 or $50 and you have quite the deal.

This is also an excellent entry level phone for newbies to the smartphone world, and intuitive to use for the less technologically-adept.  Wifi calling works great, particularly since T-mobile doesn't have great coverage everywhere (like inside my house).  You do need to enter a 911 address in your account for it to work (at least that was the case when I did my initial set-up).  Voice quality and volume are quite good.  The best thing about this phone, and Windows phones in general, is the live tiles.  I can't believe how much better this is than those dopey little cartoon icons.  So much more efficient to have information like your local weather forecast and daily appointments at a glance without opening an app!Cons:That said, this is certainly no iphone or samsung galaxy in terms of performance (not a knock - you can't compare a $100 phone with a $600 phone - I just mention this because some reviewers here have indicated that it's better). I won't go into the lack of apps - this has been covered and is a Windows issue, not specific to this phone.  If you're happy with basic apps, you're good to go with this.  I thought I'd get a lot of use out of Nokia Drive, the GPS app, but I've been very disappointed in it.  I have found it inaccurate and even when set to say street names, it's a nightmare trying to follow.  I've gone back to my Garmin for this function.  E-mail is also a little annoying in that it doesn't save e-mails sent from the phone to your yahoo or gmail sent folder due to some sort of folder naming discrepancy.  My biggest issue lately is batter life.  I say lately because initially it was fantastic.  With light use I could go two days on a charge, and even with heavier web surfing and videos I could easily go a full day plus.  In the last few weeks, however, this has deteriorated by a good 50% for no seeming reason.  I've minimized all the apps running in the background and turned off location tracking as has been suggested, but it's only helped slightly.Overall, 6 months later I'm still pleased with my purchase and the value for the money, though disappointed in some of the functions I was looking forward to using. If I could afford to upgrade, I'd probably go with a Samsung Galaxy S4.

It's especially strange since Bing Maps on the web show the directions correctly. Also, in the navigation app, I could not find a way to view the route that it calculated or suggest alternate routes.

Many of my previous comments still hold. A few updates below.On the bright side:- The price is low for all the features of this phone. If it works as advertised, this is a great bargain as an entry level smartphone.- I had not used Windows 8 before, but I found the tiled interface easy to navigate. Tiles for all of the basic functions I want the phone to perform are right there, and I can reorganize them.- The touchscreen is normally very responsive.- Overall, the small size and weight are comfortable for me to hold (although I do use a case for better grip).- Pictures are okay, but I did not have high expectations based on other reviews.  UPDATE 1/1/14: Pictures taken outdoors in good light are actually pretty good. Crisp with accurate color.There are a few things that keep it from being a perfect phone (for me).- I am not a fan of the back cover, that is having to press in on it and pry it off with my nails to access the battery, SIM and memory card. I have imagined breaking the phone in half, however unlikely, or losing grip and flipping this thing across the room which is very, very likely to happen one day. But maybe that's just me.- Signal strength is fine outdoors, but very poor indoors. One or two bars poor. No dropped calls yet, but a lot of breaking up and having to repeat myself. I briefly started looking into signal boosters, but it seems the more effective ones can be up to $300. I was not expecting this additional expense to use a $100 phone. I will check with Nokia and T-Mobile to see if they have other solutions, but poor signal strength is a big deal for me because I want a phone primarily to speak to people and not as much for other tasks and entertainment. I use other devices for that.- But on the other hand...the app store for Windows Phone seems limiting. The selection isn't that large and a lot of it looks like third-party apps I've never heard of and I'm not sure I want to deal with.- For some reason, it keeps losing the WiFi connection even when I've been near the router.  UPDATE 1/1/14: Maintaining the WiFi connection hasn't been a problem with the replacement phone.I may have received a defective one. The touchscreen on my phone became nonresponsive for a while today. I had placed a call that went to the recipient's voicemail, but when I tried to hang up, tapping 'end call,' or the home and back buttons didn't do anything. I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results. I had to take the battery out. A few reviewers advised not to download too many apps at once. I only downloaded two apps to the phone from sources I thought I could trust.UPDATE 1/1/14: It has only been a couple weeks, but the replacement phone has not frozen up like the first one. I have also downloaded several apps (including the two I downloaded to the first phone) without noticing a change in the overall performance of the phone. The first phone might have had a defect.I'm willing to give it another chance and boost the rating if I don't have another problem like that again.UPDATE 1/1/14: The 3-star rating will stay where it is for now because of different issues. I intended to use this for voice and text, but I tried to use the music + videos app. Unless you are a diehard Windows fan, my advice is to leave that alone. Basic music management tasks are tedious. Navigating the Windows site for help is (still) a chore and revealed a slew of issues users are having with basic functionality of some of the apps. For a tutorial in counterintuitive design, just go to windowsphone.com and search for instructions on \"creating a playlist.\" Read it and weep, people. Download music files from SkyDrive to your Windows Phone? No. If you're not concerned about some apps having a bewildering complexity or limitations, or getting fast help with them, then this phone may be fine for you. I think the Lumia 521 is fine as a basic phone, so that's how I'll have to use it.At least I bought it here and I may still have a chance to exchange it.UPDATE 1/1/14: The replacement process, initiated online, with Amazon was easy and fast. Just returned the first one at UPS and the new one came shortly after. Simple as that.

NONE! ... best ya can do is find an app by someone (no, not MS ... not apple ... not google ... no one like that), install it, and cross your fingers ... which I did ... it would not display basically any file I had on my microsd because they do not end with a \"y\" ... SERIOUSLY! ... check it out!Also, and this is the #1 problem with my tablet, as well ... the onscreen keyboard is pick-n-poke ONLY ... no Swyping (swyper)!  If you're not used to using Swype on android, this is probly no big deal to you ... but once you're used to Swyping, taking it away is very, very unsettling ... again, I don't use my phone for much ... for texting, no Swyping is a pain ... but I'm not writing novels, eitherI'm not gonna whine about the lack of apps ... there's actually a fair number of apps ... and most of em look to suck pretty hard ... but if anyone thinks the vast majority of android apps don't suck, they're off their rocker!  That said, I'm not seeing a GMail app by Google ... a few by what's-his-name ... ya, I'm gonna give you my gmail credentials!It did come with Office ... that's pretty neat ... so, I go to open a tab-delimited file I got on my skydrive (same account) ... right in Excel, they got a menu that says \"skydrive\" ... I tap it ... it opens IE!!!! ... REALLY?!!! ... so eventually I install the skydrive app (why it didn't come with the phone, I can't imagine ... particularly considering the bloatware they otherwise got on there) ... anyhow, even the skydrive app knows nothing of Excel ... and aside from its existence, Excel knows nothing of skydrive ... and of course, there's no way, in Excel, to navigate any files, to open a tab-delimited file.  I imagine, if ya otherwise got an .xls on there, it's like photos, songs, or videos ... there's probly a scanner that keeps track of what's on there, and tells the appEvery once in a while, we'd joke with a younger guy about to get married ... tell him horror stories, and how he's gonna regret it.  Excel is very much like this.  If you're married to it, things may be ok ... but if ya ever want a divorce, LOOK OUT!I had Polaris Office on my Galaxy ... that was excellent! ... even then, I had to download a Google spreadsheet at work, so I could open it with Excel, to save it as an earlier version, that Polaris could open ... and then I learned, only Samsung devices can run Polaris! ... everything else is garbage!It's amazing to me, in 2013 ... some 30yr after Lotus-1-2-3, I can't pass around a spreadsheet w/o running into either someone doesn't have software to open it ... or their software just can't open my version of it ... and/or they otherwise gotta be using a particular brand of hardware ... or otherwise pay $100+/yr ... just for the privilege of keeping data in rows and columns!... but I digress ... I didn't take the star off cause of the fact that everyone wants to get paid, one way or the other, for using spreadsheets ... I took the star off cause Excel on this phone has no clue what's going on with my skydrive ... and unlike my tablet, even though the set-up asked me if I wanted to, my phone has no clue about my skydrive ... or at least, if it does, I have no way to find the files on my phone, that're otherwise also on my skydrive ... I honestly can't imagine no one lost their job over this!otherwise, like switching between apple and android, Windows phones have their own idiosyncrasies ... in the case of windows, you need to navigate from the \"start\" to get to \"settings\", than work your way down, to find things like \"bluetooth\" and \"running apps\" ... not the least of which, \"blocking background tasks\" and \"battery-saver option\" ... vs. merely swiping from the top, or one corner, on android ... and tapping :\"bluetooth\", and the likespeaking of the battery, I'm hoping it's good enough to last a full day ... on stand-by! ... but if you like to use your phone for much more than talking/texting (or a lot of that) throughout the day, you should probably carry a cord with ya!now for the really bad news ... so, there's three \"buttons\" along the bottom ... \"<--\" (back), (home), and (search) ... guess what (search) does?! ... it opens BING!!!! .... even when ya don't mean to brush your thumb against that area of the screen, it opens BING!!!At the end of the day, it's a Nokia ... and despite the shortcomings, the Windows OS on it appears to drive phone calling and texting just fine ... despite attempting to get ya to open an \"XBox account\" every time, even the music app ain't too bad ... it also comes with a built-in FM radio (uses the headphones wire as an antenna) ... and it works quite well!As a phone, for the price they're going for now, to spend any less on a Sparq er whatever is absolutely insane!This is a \"good\" phone! ... it's no S3 er S4 ... but it's still a \"good\" phone!", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Downsides to This Phone", "Author": "Stilt Wiltafacation", "ReviewID": "R1EJTZFNANY7MH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've given it a good rating because the price is amazing.

Craw", "ReviewID": "R23KG5BOCIY1L2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought two of these phones from Amazon recently, and here's my take on the phone.The phone itself is fantastic.  It's just the right size. Not so big that you have to hold it with both hands, and not so small that you feel cheated. The look and feel of W8 on this device is amazing.  It's such a smooth platform. And I think it's really user friendly. The only thing I didn't care for is that they don't have all the apps I use, yet, and that I have to set up a Microsoft account to download apps. Both just bothersome, not deal breakers. Sadly one of the two phones I bought is going back.  It repeatedly turns itself off for no apparent reason.  It can happen in middle of a call or when it's just sitting around. 90% of the time when it comes back on it's in airplane mode.  So I go to the settings to turn that mode off, and it won't let me. SO, I have to take my protective case off (a PINB by the way), take the back of the phone off, and pull the battery out and reinsert for it to come back on in the correct mode. The other phone, which is my husband's, hasn't had this problem, so I'm hoping it was an isolated incident. I don't want to take any chances though, so I opted for the full refund and will wait for the Nexus 5 to hit. Basically, get this phone because it's a great deal for this price, but make sure yours isn't a dud before your return window is closed.On another note, totally unrelated to the 3 star review of this product, is the terrible service I received from Amazon on this item.  I've never had shipping problems with them before, but they really dropped the ball on this one. It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item. Once it was shipped it sat at the carriers facility for another 2 days before they sent it on it's way.  Total fail!

I decided to give windows 8 and nokia a chance.This review will be about both the Windows Phone OS and the phone itself.  There are pros and cons to each.Pros:It just works. Easy to get email and texts and everything working.Stable without crashes.Office apps are awesome.Camera and video look great in daylightLove the tiles and the layout - very customizable and functionalGreat battery life.  One thing I noticed is that the battery doesnt drain as much as my android phone when idle.  If I leave the phone overnight for 8 hours it will drain about 10% while on all night.  I can often go 2 days on one charge if I haven't been streaming videos, etc.Beautiful ScreenSnappy and responsiveCons:Wifi calling doesnt allow MMS... this really sucks.. you get a message and cant open it.Apps are limited.  I didn't think this would be that big of a deal - but I realized that a lot of the social things on my phone I now cannot do.  Whenever my friends say \"hey download this app\" everyone on android and iOS can get it... usually its not an option so I miss out.No facebook, instagram, and other major apps.  This deserves a completely different point.  Really microsoft its 2013!?I miss Swype, Chrome, etc.  Defaults in wOS are good but having options is better.No LED flash for the camera.No front facing camera.The phone without a case is slippery.  I almost dropped it.  A friend was looking at it and almost dropped it.  Get a caseFinal thoughts - I feel like the OS is awesome.  I like the tiles and the design.  The apps they have seem to work really well - the ones that you can get...  But, there is just so much missing....it just feels incomplete.  If you use your cellphone for texting, calling, web browsing and creating documents this is a great phone.  If your phone is your constant social connection with the outside world, windows phone OS leaves you sitting indoors on a sunny day looking out a window at all the kids in the neighborhood playing - wishing you could join in.Phone - great value.  for the cost you get an amazing piece of hardware.  Not the best on the market - but a great value! 4.5/5 starsOS - what it does have is great.  Design is great.  Just needs more.  A lot more.  3.5/5 stars", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, Worst operating system! You'll feel the Windows OS quality downgrade", "Author": "DJ", "ReviewID": "R1NN7S8JCD4JZ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know why Nokia dropped the Meemo/Meego/Hartman/Symbian operating systems, which were the BEST, simple and most effective. The Windows Mobile 8 operating system makes the Nokia phone just not \"SMART\" enough for a smartphone. Just like the Windows 8 that I choose to ditch in the favor of Windows Pro 7, the windows mobile 8 is probably by far the worst compared to iOS, Android and other proprietary OS's.Don't get me wrong: the phone is good, light weight, looks solid, decent appearance, good battery life indeed. Highly excited about the new phone, as I stick my sim card in, I can't see my contacts. You require a MICROSOFT account to ACCESS all your CONTACTS, leaving your privacy completely exposed. If you do create a Microsoft account, all of the sudden, ALL YOUR CONTACTS are uploaded on the Microsoft server, along with your history. Why can't I just use the phone WITHOUT giving Microsoft my list of contacts? Why does Microsoft need to know and access that? I tried deleting the contacts, and guess what? Just like the GMAIL account ( that I dropped years ago for privacy reasons) Microsoft will still \"keep\" all your contacts \"just in case you change your mind\"! And it tracks ALL your history of browsing, calling, texting, searching and installed apps! I feel like the Big Brother watching over my shoulder! I call that INVASION OF PRIVACY! I can't sync my private email account, unless it's an \"APPROVED VENDOR\" on the list, that likes to create and keep a history of everything you do on the account. I can't fully use the bluetooth features like with other phones (Iphone and Android). I can't just close an application when I have multiple apps opened, instead you have to select it and keep clicking on back until it takes you to the main Home Screen.Update:Major Cons:1) I found most of the apps to be useless/\"entry level\". Can't compare the quality of the apps to the iOS and Android. ( I had both) If you are a heavy user of email / productivity apps you'll hardly find anything on the \"Microsoft Market\". You'll be able to open Microsoft Office docs but you'll need an app for PDF's, that will be \"entry level\". Android opens PDF's \"natively\" and even has a \"night mode\" to invert colors! What a downgrade!2) You cannot sync all your accounts in one along with receiving updates as they come in. The phone will only sync the mail box/ other apps \"every 15, 30 minutes / 1 or 2 hrs\".2) Camera only works in good day light with a \"decent\" resolution and quality and there's no flash. Don't expect anything else from the camera.3) The phone side buttons and touch \"buttons\" are not clearly marked / lit. If you're in the dark it will take a while to figure out where to press.4) Screen although responsive when sliding, it lags and does not fully react to smaller option menus or when trying to accurately copy/paste. Cheap phone, cheap response.5) Closing an app will take longer than with any other OS. Basically you click and hold back, wait for the opened app screen, selected the app and just press escape(back until closed. (this could be as long as 9 to 12 times if you've clicked several options in the app, tracking your steps backwards) Really?6) Auto rotation of the screen cannot be removed/stopped. This can get annoying if you're not sitting/standing in vertical position.7) Bluetooth will only work for certain devices / services.Major Pros1) Nokia off-line GPS and maps are the ONLY good thing, (that's not Microsoft's credit) worth with this phone.2) Relatively cheap phone.Inconclusivea)Battery is good, not great. You can charge it every day or 1-1/2 days but no more than that.b) The so-called wifi calling only gives you the option of making calls over your wifi but does not increase the quality of the call. Unless you are within the clear range (same room with the router, no walls) of the wifi transmitter, EXPECT the call to DROP!c) You don't get any cool pre-installed ring tones, but at least the speaker and the audio volume will be loud. This should be expected from a phone.Overall in my experience Windows Mobile just sucks (Not just version 8)! This is a major flaw that cannot be corrected no matter what windows phone you'll get. I'm sorry but I'll have to take this back and stick to another operating system.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery doesn't fit properly, otherwise a great phone.", "Author": "Pmm368", "ReviewID": "R1TNA4OA9WVRHP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After some debate if I should get this phone (since it's a Windows phone), I purchased this phone on the 24th October, 2013 at a local Wal-Mart for $100.  For the first 3 days I had this running, it worked great.  Over the last 4 days, this phone has been restarting itself several times (usually 3 to 7 times) a day.  Turns out the battery doesn't fit in the phone properly (little bit of wiggle room, causes the battery to come loose from the battery terminals on the phone).Pros:5MP camera.The pictures come out better than I thought, sometimes the photo comes out blurry but the majority of the time it takes pictures really well.  Shoots video in 720P High Definition at 10mbps.4G HSPA+Not LTE, but decent.  The coverage is great in my area and I get anywhere between 4 & 8 mbps download speeds.  The ping is usually between 80 & 100 MS.Mobile Hotspot.This phone allows you to tether your internet connection, depending on your plan.GPSBest GPS I've used on a phone.  The GPS I've used on any of my previous Android phones would give me turn-by-turn directions, but Windows is the only one I've used that tells me the speed limit in an area.  I can also use it to tell me how fast I'm travelling and how far I've traveled.  I had to install a separate app on Android to do that.Cons:Music.  Transferring music to the phone seems to be a pain in the rear.  I transferred music using Windows Media Player, but after I deleted a folder, none of my music showed up in my phone again.Battery.  As stated above, battery is fairly loose from the battery terminal on the phone, causing it to restart on me several times in a day.  It usually happens when it's in my pocket while I'm walking.Transferring files off the phone via online storage.  I installed dropbox, hoping to be able to upload photos to my dropbox, but I can only put it on my skydrive.  Videos can only be uploaded over WiFi to prevent going over your data package.Transferring files via bluetooth.  I have sent files from this phone to an Android tablet and it works good.  I can only transfer pictures via bluetooth, but not videos.Overall, I would've given this phone a 4 star if it hadn't been for the battery problem I'm facing.  I'll update if the company (either Nokia or T-Mobile) is able to fix this problem.Edit 11/1/13My phone has shut itself off 14 times from 10pm 10/31/13 to 7:30am 11/1/13.  I'm not taking a chance on trying another Lumia phone.  I was hoping for a more reliable phone for $100.Edit 11/3/13I returned the phone back to the store to get my money back.  Unfortunately, Wal-mart wouldn't let me keep the sim card, which contained my phone number that I wanted to keep.  I started a number port to my home phone, so I'm hoping Wal-mart keeps it active long enough for the transfer to go through.

This is important for me. The datasense server from Microsoft preloads webpages then delivers to your phone. This is huge.

On receipt of the new phone, I was to switch out the battery, memory card, SIM and the back of the phone, returning the non-working phone to T-Mobile.  I did this.  Problem solved?  No, the battery still did not hold a charge.Soon after, I went to T-Mobile and was told to call Nokia customer care, which would send me a new battery free of charge.  I called Nokia, spent a few minutes on the phone, and was told a battery would be sent to me.  Then I waited.  We went on vacation out of the country.  We returned.

I was told that the battery was not in stock.  The battery is made in Finland, but needs to be sent to Asia before it can be shipped to the U.S. and they just don't have the battery.  On April 11, 2014 the customer service representative checked to make sure the battery was in stock.  They could not tell me when the battery would be in stock.  Can I get a refund?  No.  What can I do?  The customer service representative said he the problem would be escalated and I would be contacted later in the day.Despite being told I would be contacted again, I was not contacted.April 28, 2014, today, I called Nokia customer care.  Yes, they have a record of the prior conversations.  No, the battery has not come back in stock.  No, they do not know when they will have the battery, but they will ship it to me when they get it.  Can they give me an idea of how long that might be?  No.  I asked if anyone tried to reach me by email or phone after the problem was escalated (which is what I was told would happen) and was told that they do not have any record of anyone at Nokia attempting to reach me by email or phone.If you buy a Nokia phone, don't expect any assistance from Nokia if you have a problem with the phone.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not sure what all the hype is for....", "Author": "shmitty01 \"shmitty01\"", "ReviewID": "R1OYFYVOBYPSNQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone 7 months ago as a primary phone for my wife.  At first, I was impressed with the features vs price.  It quickly became evident why this phone is so cheap.  The problems started showing up quickly, and only got worse with time.  As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.  First, windows phone OS is not capable of MMS over wifi calling.  This may not matter to some people, but we like to exchange pictures with friends and relatives, and this is not possible over wifi calling with this phone.  Issue 2, also related to wifi calling.  Frequent dropped calls, poor call quality, etc.  Sometimes the calls were great, sometimes very bad.  As time continued, another problem with wifi calling came up.  When you would leave the house and return, the phone would refuse to reconnect to wifi calling(while connected to the network fine) and would show no signal.  The phone required a hard reset to resolve the issue.  As for the good, the camera is ....ok.  The phone is fairly durable.  Battery life is great.  I have always had a great love for nokia phones because of their call quality and durability.  This phone has lost me for nokia permanently.  Maybe the problems are all related to windows 8, I am not certain.  We have since upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy Light, and guess what?  It works!  And it works really well at that.

The app store is a FAR cry from the playstore, let me tell you. The same apps I had on my own phone, run COMPLETELY different on this system, so much so that even the ones I used daily on my own phone I wont even bother with on this one.

I haven't figured out most of the features yet, and probably never will.  I wanted a phone, which I got.  Setting options are ring + vibrate, vibrate, or off.  Hmmmm . . . am I the only one missing the \"meeting\" feature on my original cell phone 14 years ago?  (I could tell it to vibrate or to make no noise as of, say noon, for x number of hours.)  Meeting was a great feature because my phone remained on and I didn't forget to turn it back on later.T-Mobile transferred my stored data.  Sort of.  Their first attempt only copied a fraction of my data.  The 2nd attempt seems to have moved all data, but it isn't exactly correct. Not all phone numbers stuck to the correct name and some mobile numbers are now landlines, etc.  Kinda weird.  I bought this 2 months ago and am still double checking who I'm calling and which phone number it really is.I have taken some pics & videos.  They look fine, but please note that I am neither a photographer nor an artist!  I haven't figured out how to get them off my phone yet.One weird \"feature\" is that the speaker is on the back of the phone.  Huh?  What purpose does that serve?  My mouth doesn't wrap around to the back of the phone!  This makes my public conversations even more public.  When I set my phone down, then I have to put it face down for the speaker to work best, but when my phone is face down in my lap (i.e.: on speaker while driving), the touch screen phone has a tendency to dial other numbers, put me on mute, turn off the speaker, etc.  So, I'm neither a huge fan of the touch screen nor of the speaker on the back.The phone takes too long to turn back on after it was turned off.I haven't figured out any way to customize various volumes, such as ring tone, reminder (calendar alerts), key stroke volume, earpiece volume, and speaker volume.  I'd prefer that the alarm set to wake me up be really loud, but I don't need the keystroke volume to be equally loud, for example.  (This could be operator error, but teenage helpers haven't resolved this issue for me, either.)One irritating thing about the call history is that it omits information.  It does not include ahistory of all incoming calls.  It omits some, but not all \"unknown\" phone numbers as well as numbers of people who leave voicemail, and it omits some phone numbers of people who not already in my contacts.  That's just weird . . . and sometimes irritating.I sent a copious quantity of texts.  I like that this phone learns my typical vocabulary, jargon, & writing style quickly.  Based on what I write, it anticipates the subsequent words well.  For example, I text the phrase \"scrip envelopes\" and my address frequently.  When I type \"scrip\" it anticipates that \"envelopes\" will follow.  It does the same thing with my address and names that I frequently text.  Kinda creepy, but mighty handy feature.  I like this one.  Also, it does not spell correct with the horrendous, vulgar, and embarrassing corrections that I've seen come from IPhone users.  (This I count as a *huge* plus!)A teenager found the settings to make my phone use wi-fi, so I should now be able to get pics off.  She plans to teach me how to do that as a Christmas gift, which I consider a good gift!I still haven't figured out how to sync my phone with my computer, but anticipate doing so in the future.I do want to use office software -- mainly excel -- but haven't figured out how to use it.

Hastings \"DryHeat\"", "ReviewID": "R3UA7CYQ4N5T1Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used Nokia and T-Mobile for some time and have always used relatively cheap phones. I break them and don't need a game phone. My last phone was a Nokia X2 with a standard buttons and a real QWERTY keyboard. The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used. I used both phones with the same T-Mobile 1500 min of voice and text plus 30 megs of data. Yes that is megs and not gigs. I don't need a lot of data. I have had the phone for over a month now. That is the context for this review.You can go from the X2 to the Lumia easily for very basic use. Beyond that it takes some time to learn. Finding how to do things often takes searching the internet for them. This is a Windows 8 phone but it is not like your win 7 desktop. On the X2 you could select an item and then you would have a key for options. In win 7 you would have drop down menus of options. You have neither on the Lumia. Some options are hidden. Some options are little icons, very little. There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time. If you need reading glasses you will want to have them ready until you know the icons by placement. There is also on some screens a \"...\" which indicate there is more information below the bottom of the screen, that can be accessed by sliding the image up. In some other cases there are option that have to be taken while selecting an item, not after it is selected. To select an item you just tap it, but to bring up options touch and hold the item.On the main (home) screen there is a phone icon. If you tap it a list of calls, incoming, outgoing, and missed, comes up. At the bottom are four icons, voicemail, keypad, people, search, and \"...\". If you slide the image up you will see the names of the icons and two more options, Delete All, and Settings. There are no other option to see. No option for sorting the calls by incoming, outgoing or missed, something I could do on the X2. I did find that if I touch and hold a number there is an option to delete that call. I like to keep missed calls and some special calls listed in the call history so \"delete all\" is not an option for me. The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2. You just have to know how to find it.Another option that took me some time to find was for forwarding text messages or resending them. From the Home screen there is a Messaging icon. Tapping it brings up a list of threads or conversations. If you tap on one a list of messages in that thread appear. Again, there are little icons at the bottom and the \"...\". You will want to check them out. If you want to forward a message or resend an old one you have to know there are options that come up by touching and holding an entry for a message, delete, forward and copy. However, if there is only one message in a thread then you only have that and when you tap on the thread you go right into the message and those three options are not offered. If you touch and hold the listing for the thread the only option you get is to delete the thread. If I am wrong about this someone let me know. This is more difficult than on the X2.I have large fingers and I need to hold the phone in landscape orientation and not portrait or I get to many errors where it thinks I want the next key over. In landscape orientation the keyboard is better than the X2. Otherwise the X2 is better.Sometime the Lumia does not respond to my touch. This mostly happen with incoming calls and I can't get it to answer. It does not happen often and it can be with other features too, not just calls.Once the Lumia froze and I had to take the battery out. To do it as the instructions say is almost impossible for me. I find it easiest to do by releasing the side opposite the power button first. Be careful, the halves can be hard to hang onto. There is suppose to be a way to reboot the Lumia holding the power button but it did not work for me.The camera can be better than the one in the X2, which was not much good, but not always. The problem with the camera is it needs good lighting or any movement of the subject or camera causes terrible blur. In the sunshine it does a good job.On the plus side. The Lumia has data use controls that limit the data use. If you make good use of them you can get by with the 30 meg limit on the prepay plans. On the home screen is a Data Sense icon. Using Data Sense you can let the Lumia know how many days you have until your megs expire, and how many megs you have. I add a few days and reduce the number megs to leave me some extra room but I don't seem to need to do that. The Data Sense icon will display the numbers of days and megs left. In the setting for the Lumia under Celluar is a setting for Data Connection. You can turn that off and stop data use on the cellular network. There is another for Limited Wi-Fi Connectivity and another for Data Roaming.WiFi works for me. The use of data over Wi-Fi does count against my data limit. I have not paid much attention to whether calls count. 1500 min has been more than enough for me anyway. I assume Wi-Fi calls do not. At the end of my plan's 30 days I download maps and apps with my remaining megs.If I use the Lumia much the battery runs out much faster than the X2. It also charges faster. Not a big deal for me.The voice quality of callers is probably the best of any phone I have had.

I spent $69.95 at BestBuy and that seemed like the least expensive way to get WP8 hardware. I don't intend to use it as my daily phone since I have a Nexus 5, but I'm trying it for a few days to see how things have progressed with WP8. For the price, it's hard to beat. It's basically hardware from 2009, but is adequate to do most smartphone tasks. I have only had brief exposure to iOS products and found them to be too limiting for my use; WP8 is in the same category - too many limitations. It's probably best to break it down into lists of good and bad things about the phone and OS separately.Good things about the Nokia 521 hardware:1) Built-in speaker is surprisingly loud and clear2) Built-in FM tuner that works pretty well3) Feels good in your hands and is light weight4) Display is bright and clear5) Reception seems good on wifi and cellular6) Battery life seems good so far - lots of calls, internet, photos hasn't drained the battery7) Dedicated camera button (required by WP)8) Supports microSD card (with limitations - see below)Bad things about the Nokia 521 hardware1) Camera is pretty bad - requires lots of light to take half decent, grainy photos2) No built-in flash3) Can only record 720p video which constantly \"pulses\" as it tries to auto-focus. Very distracting and not good results.4) Includes 8 inch USB Sync cable - 3 feet is a minimum useful length5) Low res display - 480x800 was adequate on a 2009 smartphone, not a late 2013 model.6) The speed of the CPU/Graphics is usually adequate for most tasks, but the start screen actually has jitter/lag as you scroll up and down. WP users seem to brag a lot about how \"smooth\" the UI is, but this phone has trouble keeping up.Good things about Windows Phone 8:1) Voice dictation can be used in most places that a keyboard is required. There seems to be a 30-second limit to each voice capture, but the results were usually accurate.2) Live tiles can display useful status info. Android Widgets are much more powerful and flexible, but WP tiles are reasonable in what they can do.Bad things about Windows Phone 8:1) File system is a bad set of compromises. This is something that I had hoped would eventually get fixed, but MS insists on keeping files locked/hidden away. Any application which needs to access any type of file will make the user go through unpleasant steps to accomplish it. SkyDrive is the most popular crutch to allow access to files and it's an inconvenient kludge at best. Email attachments are a particular weak point - you really can't do a lot in terms of sending/receiving attached files unless they are JPEG photos.2) No sharing of data between apps. I guess I'm spoiled from using Android, but when I use an app that generates or receives data, I expect that I can share/use that data. This is not the case in WP. An example is text messages with attached photos. The only thing you can do with the photo is save it in the \"saved photos\" folder. You can't share it or do anything with it without switching to a different app and retrieving it from the \"saved photos\" folder.3) Single volume level for everything. This is such a simple feature that even dumb phones have, I'm surprised WP hasn't implemented this. I want my ringer volume loud and my multimedia volume low. Maybe this will be fixed in WP9.4) Multiple steps to make and receive a call. Android allows me to pin a contact to the home screen such that a single click will make the call. WP allows you to pin a contact, but then you have to wait for the silly animation, and click again on the phone number. When answering a call you need to swipe up and then tap. Why not a single swipe or tap?5) WP8 supports the microSD card, but doesn't know how to read a NTFS formatted card. This format was invented by Microsoft so it's kind of ironic that it doesn't support its own format.6) Screen times out when plugged into charger. This is really an odd bug that the phone can't stay awake while plugged in to a charger. For a developer, this is the normal use case.7) The phone's status bar takes up space, yet has very little information. The different status indicators come and go. It would be better to have them displayed all the time.8) App navigation seems to be hit or miss. When switching between apps, some apps will reload, others will snap back to where they were and some will give an odd flash and resume after a second or so. Starting an app from its tile also seems to give the same random results if the app is already running.9) Many of the apps that are free on other platforms cost money on WP. This situation is helped a little by the fact that MS has a \"try\" option. Some apps allow you to try them for a few days, but still limit the functionality during the trial period. This doesn't make any sense since if I can't fully test the app trial, I'm not going to buy it.10) There is no way to get a refund for app purchases. Apple and Google have come up with a reasonable way to handle this and MS needs to fix this ASAP.11) No way to disable live tiles. On Windows RT/8 you can turn off live tiles. WP needs to add this feature. The worst offender is the \"people\" tile. I don't want to see it flicking and flashing at me all the time.12) Status messages disappear never to be seen again. Supposedly a future release of WP will have this fixed with a \"notification center\", but for now it is poorly implemented.13) No fast-scroll option for long lists. Microsoft's method for dealing with long lists is to add a \"letter\" grid to jump somewhere in the list. I think Android handles this much better with a fast-scroll knob and the way the contacts list shows you the first letter of the name as you scroll quickly.14) No cohesion between WP's app store and the Win8 store. If I buy an app in Windows 8, I have to buy the same app again in WP8. Microsoft says they're working on integrating the stores, but for now this is unpleasant.I need to spend more time with it to flesh out my review. I'll edit this after I have had a few more days with the 521.Overall I think it's a bad idea to cut corners when you buy a smartphone. If you're going to spend $30-60 a month on the service, spending $100 or less on the phone seems penny wise and pound foolish. For people that can't afford the up front cost, all the major carriers have installment plans.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish it worked!", "Author": "WesA", "ReviewID": "R1CGBIGK7189OL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone would be fine if it worked.

Whoa whoa whoa. One week? That's barely enough time to figure out how to make a call! How can you write a review with less than a week of handling? I would usually ask the same question, but this phone is a nightmare.I purchased the phone from amazon 4 days ago with two day shipping. It arrived yesterday, on time. I opened the box and everything seemed to be in order. But i realized that my sim card was too large to fit in the phone. So I decided to make a trip to a tmobile store to get it cut. between the purchase of the phone and my sim card experience everything was fine. I downloaded an app and was working my way around the phone, customizing my pins and testing out the camera.I liked the phone as a whole! It was fluid and neat. I was able to customize everything easily. I actually like they keyboard even though it is basically the same size in portrait as well as landscape. I was tickled by some of the knockoff apps that the windows store offers, and I loved the fact that Microsoft office was installed on the phone.Today i excitedly drove to the t mobile store to get my sim card cut. They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card. I was pleased. So after getting suckered into buying a cell phone case and my phone was all set up, i was satisfied and excited to enjoy at least a year with the Lumia. But this is where the problems start. As soon as i had driven to my boyfriend's house, the phone said that there was no service. My boyfriend lives about 2 hours from the tmobile store and i wasn't going to drive back. My boyfriend also has tmobile so we compared cell service. He had 3 bars, i had none and an error message that said \"No signal. SIM card not installed or not installed properly\" I called tmobile customer service from his phone. After being transferred back and forth for more than an hour, my phone wouldn't even come on! I would press the power button, the 'nokia\" screen would come up and a blank blue screen would flash for a second or two and then the phone would shut down entirely. Eventually the last customer service rep just told me that I would need to get a (free) replacement phone. I mentioned that I bought it from amazon and she said that the process is more difficult to getting a replacement phone through amazon.Moral of the story. It's a great looking phone with some jazzy features if you can get it to work. If this phone worked for a year, this would be a solid 4.5 review.

It has a lot going for it as you see from the reviews.What follows this updated review is the original, I am now 10 days into this POS and 3 factory resets later, I can soundly conclude that this phone is garbage.Great ideas, built like a toy, and completely unreliable. I've had plenty of phones and never seen anything so aggravating before.BEWARE: If you are foolhardy enough to bother with this after research, make sure you don't save anything to the phone itself, only the SD card, as there is no file manager you will lose everything everytime you reset, and reset you will. Bye bye contacts, pictures (camera sucks btw), apps, all down the toilet.Buggy buggy buggy. Just Google \"Nokia 521 issues,\" then have a good laugh at my expense, then go get yourself a reliable phone. This ain't it.Just days ago I was more optimistic... This is my older review:But here is what is what I don't like:-No forward facing camera. You might want to think about how this will affect you. Forget Skype or any other video calling, no dice. In this day and age VERY limiting. Deal breaker item. I personally will never own another phone without this camera.-Windows. You might like it or not, I personally kinda do, but if you have gotten used to the app selections of android or iPhone, this will be like stepping back in time several years. There are enough apps for me, but check out the selection first.I really don't care for the disappearing tiles all the time, what's up with that?-The screen lock is absurd. Major deal breaker. Spent a day locked out, and every time you try a password it doubles the amount of time you have to wait to try again. How stupid is that. I ended up forced to do a factory reset and lost valuable pictures and data in the process. I will never buy another phone with that obnoxious feature. Epic fail.-No file manager, really? Weak. I shouldn't have to make 7 navigations and open 3 apps just to find a simple file.I will say though:-This phone is very fast, apps usually load quick.-Good cell reception and great WiFi reception.-The keyboards are fantastic, right on queue!-I LOVE SD expandable memory. MAJOR plus.-Best touch screen I have ever owned. And my last phone was the Samsung Infuse (priced at 6 TIMES this Nokia 521). Wow.-Battery life is through the roof. I watched 6 hours of video while traveling and she had lots more in her. Pretty amazing.-Strong audio and speakers. Again, best I have owned yet. Maybe the screen lock can be worked around. Until then I refuse to use it.One thing that will make my relationship brief with the 521 is the lack of that forward camera.

The interface, the design, the features. Just a great phone for a great price, or so I thought.It began to act glitchy the first month. I thought it was a fluke, so I did a factory reset and it seemed to behave fine again. Until I took it to Central America. Nokia's are known as global phones, so I figured I'd have no problem using this phone abroad. Wrong.When I got south of the Equator, things went haywire. The phone would not detect networks, and would not connect when they were detected. It would power off and on randomly, sometimes several times in a minute. The time and date were constantly being reset incorrectly, even when I manually input the time and date. The battery would not hold a charge. Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I'd be able to get and receive messages...sometimes...with the wrong time and date stamp. It was just acting...bonkers. The phone did not work correctly for the duration of my trip. I spent hours fooling with the SIM and battery and googling troubleshooting steps. Nothing helped.So I made several attempts to troubleshoot/repair the phone...and this is where Nokia loses major points with me...although the phone was well under warrantly, Nokia jerked me around for a month before accepting the phone for repair, only to advise me that the humidity in CA must have tripped the moisture strip behind the battery and therefore voided my warranty. Groan. Prior to that, Nokia repeatedly told me to return to the retailer or the carrier. Neither of those companies REPAIR phones, though, and once you're out of the 30-day return period, well then you're just out of luck.So now I'm stuck with a phone that's DOA and no hope of ever seeing my $150 back.

At first the phone was great!I initially purchased this phone due to the fact that my old phone's earpiece sucked...I couldn't hear anything.  So I decided that it was time for an upgrade.  Web worked well, calls came in clear and I could hear what the other person was saying, it had some okay apps...not really an app person.  But then a couple of weeks ago I started noticing dropped calls and bad call quality; calls would break up or become full of static.  So I called T-Mobile and they had me reset the phone and I went to a T-Mobile retail location to try replacing the SIM card.  Nothing has worked.  It has been two weeks and I have experienced more and more dropped calls.  Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.  So, I attempted several times to contact T-Mobile's billing department from my land line and their story was that they couldn't hear me.  Customer service and Tech Support could hear me just fine.  The reason I was contacting billing was to see if they could compensate me for the two weeks I have been unable to receive reliable service and to pay my bill.  They hung up 3 times.  I'm done with dealing with T-Mobile...their customer service is AWFUL!!!  It's worse that AT&T.; Will be sending this phone back for a replacement after Monday.  I have my old phone which needs a SIM card which I can use until T-Mobile sends me a replacement for the Nokia Lumia 521.  If the replacement doesn't work, I will then know it is T-Mobile's service and send the phone back for a refund and head back to AT&T.;Update:  04/07/2014.For a short while my phone service with TMobile was good.  But then I began having the same issues and then some!  It was not the phone, it was the service provider.  My calls kept getting dropped, or they'd cut out and I couldn't send or receive texts.

I even used WebOS long after Palm/HP had given it up. But my God! Seriously, Microsoft? You have years to try out the iPhone and the Android iterations and THIS is the best replica you can come up with???In summary, Windows Phone remains the phone OS of those with @aol.com email addresses, the elderly, and those who miss Snake Game on their Nokia 3310.Okay, let's get to the pros and cons...PROS* It can both make and receive phone calls -  Yup, it works as a phone. Once you get to the phone section. Oh, and don't forget to turn off the wifi calling, since that makes you sound like you are talking on a 1999 Motorola MicroTAC. Submerged. Roaming.* Battery life is good for two solid days -  Though this may be because I stopped using my phone when it stopped informing me of... anything.* It looks just like a bar of soap -  Made me feel cleaner.CONS* No option for a background picture \u2013 I know it's stupid, but I like seeing my family.* Giant, space-hogging tiles that don't do anything \u2013 The email tile shows ONE unread email. No matter how big or small you make it. The weather tile uses its space to let me know it's getting info from the Weather Channel. The CALENDAR tile only shows one appointment too!* Voice recognition recognizes whatever you say \u2013 after it beeps at you, even in silent mode. And if you tell it to punctuate, it writes that. Where Android or iPhone would write I am going to the store, then home. Do you want to meet me there? Windows Phone writes I am going to the store comma then home period do you want to meet me there question mark. Yes. Windows phone puts a period at the end of everything. Whether it needs it, or some other form of punctuation, or none at all.* Voice recognition is a prude \u2013 want to swear? Too bad. Want to talk about (for example), my customer Mr. Aswalla? Nope \u2013 He's Mr. **#*$*# Walter now. That's exact, by the way... I'm not censoring. Windows is.* Apps? Nope \u2013 Yah, you can Yelp (if you can get to it). But you sure can't do much of anything else. Oh, and most mobile webpages don't show well.* Vibration sucks \u2013 in an Android phone, you know by the pattern of the vibe exactly what just happened. On the Lumia, it's more of an awkward death rattle for everything.And my absolute favorite? Ready for this?* NO STATUS LED! - That's right... If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh.

If you cant handle hyperbole, then i recommend leaving the internet now before yu get any further.  This phone is absolute junk, and my issues have no rectification.This phone, without a single doubt, is the most infuriating, unreliable horror show you could possibly invest in.  I have been using this phone since July 2013, and honestly this review would likely devolve into a foaming rant.  Instead, lets just place a series of bullet points here.-camera is unwieldy.  The delay between pressing the button and the actual taking of the image can regularly be 5 or more seconds.  Grainy resolution and no flash, its a major step backwards even from the cheapest smartphone.-it ignores all settings regarding wifi vs. Cell connectivity, so be prepared to use up all your data, even fom home.  An example of this is if you mvoe from one wifi to another, it requires turning off and restarting wifi connectivity to reconnect with your initial wifi connection.  To do this, you must enter three menu screens.-complete and utter lack of customization.  This is windows 8 in all its glory, you get to pick from a limited palette, and that is it.  Everything else is the wonky square pattern UI that is the opposite of useful. And you are etuck with the god awful stock keyboard that prevents easy txt editing.-no apps.  I know the windows store is adding more apps, but the quality is lacking in every regard.  Investing in Windows 8 mobile is like investing in LaserDiscs in 2013.  There are few functional apps, so if you rely on google docs, you're in for some frustration.-voice recognition for dialing is unresponsive and unreliable.  Maybe one in ten attempts can recognize I'm even saying a name.-my phone contact list was imported directly alongside my entire facebook list, without my input.  So to call anyone, I have to slog through my ENTIRE fb list to find them.  This sort of prethinking \"we know better than you\" stuff is rampant with this phone.-what apps they do have are barely functional.  Go ahead.  Try using the ebay app, or netflix without wanting to throw this thing across the room.  The unifying visual themes are forced throughout each and every app, which means the dysfunction of windows 8 can now be had in every endeavor.-the unlock button goes off on its own in the pocket, and on multiple occasions I heard a voice only to realize I had inadvertently dialed a random person ffom my fb list while it was in my front pocket.-the volume button requires a restart of the media to take effect, so if a video starts, and its at max volume, youll have to stop it and restart it to change the volume.-the headphone jack doesnt always cut out the speaker.

What's worse, Bing was absolutely useless in the country I was in.If you just want an upgrade from a dumb phone and don't need to have access to any of the great apps on iOS or Android, go ahead and waste your money on this phone. If you want to actually have a phone you can use and that has access to literally everything that is available, spend a fractional amount more and get an Android.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Please dont spend money on the Nokia Windows phone or Tmobile service", "Author": "Jared Boyle", "ReviewID": "RGUS2JB1HEDDC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This review is related to the Nokia Lumia Windows phone as well as the service through T mobile. I purchased this phone from a T-Mobile store in April '13 and immediately noticed that the phone shuts off frequently while being charged. The phone will also shut off completely while in a rest or battery saving mode. The main problem with this is that while it's off you are not getting calls, and when it shuts off while charging things like the alarm cannot be relied on. I have been sent a replacement already, and I am assured that when my second replacement in 2 months arrives, it will also have the same issue. The most amazing (disappointing) thing is that they will still sell you this phone right now, even though they know the phone fails to work properly. T mobile however will take no responsibility for the phone they retail, and even had the nerve to refer me to Nokia. I did not purchase the phone from Nokia, I purchased it from T-Mobile, when my 3rd phone fails for the same reason I will be calling the state consumer board and my credit card company to dispute the charge. Clearly the phone fails to perform as promised and I cannot get the retailer (T-Mobile) to make the purchase right. I have been with T-Mobile for 11 years now and the best I can get from them to make this right is that they will give me a small credit for the phone I paid for 2 months ago, that is legitimately defective, and let me pay for a new one. I hate to see that after all these years T-Mobile has ditched their traditional customer focused service and gone to the usual, ignore the customer until we lose them way of thinking. I have to highly recommend against this phone if you are looking for reliability and cannot afford to have your phone shut off without notice. I also have to say that if you are considering T-Mobile based on reputation, they are not the customer service company they were a few years ago.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPSET WITH PHONE!!", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R3W4F5JFGIOMHG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this over amazon and I was told this phone was brand new. The exact words used. The phone was used and opened and broke. It powers down over and over. I can charge it to full it lasts on for about a hour than starts turning on and off over and over. The seller was not honest. but I will say the company took care of me and sent me a new one. And they are billing the sender for it. I love nokia.
