Wu \"gui\"", "ReviewID": "R3US4E3RJ5ZZKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK..to start, I gotta say that the FREE shipping from Amazon SUCKS. So, if you want good shipping, dont use the FREE shipping that Amazon offers. Why? Tracking is horrible, tracking history is completely inaccurate.(I used the nokia N82 before)IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE CELLPHONE, READ THIS REVIEW. I THINK IT WILL HELP A LOT. IT IS LONG, I KNOW.Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price. Come on, where will you get a 300$ cellphone that has all the functions that this one has? It is insane: 3.2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc.Regarding the touchscreen...I think it is personal taste.. I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive. AFTER buying this phone and getting used to it, I used a friend's Itouch and I gotta say that my nokia 5800 is the winner. But as I said, it is personal taste. Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)..like, you got no excuse..it is responsive, and it is responsive. PERIOD.Good things about it:-Starting to have more apps...you just gotta know where to find, for FREE.-MACRO of the camera is awesome.-I got the GPS with turn by turn voice direction (trial), and it is a dream. I wont know when they take away my trial...however, with voice direction, this thing it is a real GPS.-The media button is pretty useful.-It is legit that it unlocks when you take it close to your face when you are talking.-Speakers are also awesome. Super loud. Sound quality when you plug in earpieces are also really nice.-I love the cable to plug it in to the tv. I convert videos, put it on my cellphone and lay on my bed, plug the cellphone into the tv and voila. It is REALLY nice.-About apps. Right now I have 42 but I only use maybe 8 of them lol.-The screen it is mega-clear. It is one of the best screens ive seen.The \"so-so\" of this phone:-Build quality. It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky. When I put it under the sun, the reflection shows a big difference in the surface, I mean..it is not completely flat. Using the reflection of light you will realize it is not completely flat. In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance). However, the rest of the cellphone is well built. If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone.-The camera. I dont know. Sometime it takes great pictures, sometimes it stinks. When there is too much suns, it doesnt work well. When there isnt light, it also sucks. It has to have the right amount of light.-For some people it may be ok, but this is a freaken fingerprint magnet. only the back cover it is mate. The rest of the cellphone devours fingerprint as a dinasour.-Battery life it is not the best, but not the worst.The bad:-The interface it is not the friendliest. It could be better. I hope that with the update, it will be user friendlier.-The screen. As I said, it is too flexible. It kills me to see differences with the reflection of the light (you know what im saying if you have the cellphone). It makes me hella nervous.-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard. I always keep tapping the wrong thing. in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error. however, in landscape mode the scroll bar is in the middle of the screen, so it gets tricky.-Honestly, the phone it isnt the best looking phone in the market. It is just a chunk of plastic. (This is for people that care about appearances. I personally dont care, but im trying to be objective)Ok, I think this is pretty much it. If you read this, you may decide whether to buy ir or not. I think it is a pretty good phone for the price. If you are RICH and money it is not your main problem, I would say go buy yourself a N97. Oppositely, I would say definitely go for this cellphone; I like it pretty much. You wont regret it (however, remember all the things I wrote in this review). If you are ok with the cons of this cellphone, you wont regret. And in my opinion, the Pro's overcome the Con's so... I dont know, it is your call!I hope this helped.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Phone on Market", "Author": "Aussie", "ReviewID": "R31N279HQNX86F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along  with the 3.2 MP on the back, Video is far better and there were no sluggish performance as far as I had used for more than a month, unlike iPhone this phone can run multiple applications at same time which is like multitasking in PC, so I can play music and browse websites at same time and switch to GPS , attend a call and type an SMS.. And it goes on...all at same time, iPhone cannot do more than one at a time, we get millions of free software, games, themes etc., unlike Apple App store, no need to pay more and more. Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price.If you like Garmin for GPS, Garmin GPS software available for this phone and installing that will make it the best GPS (it comes with Nokia's map software too) and no data plan or internet required for GPS as maps are copied to memory. It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that.It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone.And FM is there to use while driving and at the Gym, Google has lot of software available for this phone like latitude, docs etc. If you want free chat software Fring ([...]) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users. It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically. We can import and export all contacts from outlook, Lotus notes etc.And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too.For brand conscious users like me, I want to buy a phone from a telecom company like Nokia than a computer (apple) or TV (Samsung) company, who were just trying phones as one of their business.iPhone doesn't have many of these features and only selling because of marketing, if nokia did their part, this should beat any phone for sure, I don't want to lock with AT&T; for lifetime with iPhone and pay $ monthly and pay for any applications and did I say its unlocked? What else you can expect from a phone?", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "A best kept secret?", "Author": "Mr. Hop", "ReviewID": "R17JI05QGQZEVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While most people clamor for Blackberries or iPhones or the latest Androids, I found myself eager to get back to the first brand that I ever used: Nokia. I won't lie - while I find the features of today's smart phones finally starting to live up to the hype, I am just unwilling to pay 100 dollars a month for all the service and contract craziness that comes with it. The average iPhone, for example, can cost over 3 thousand bucks over 2 years. I can't stand locked-down, over priced products that fail to really create compelling value for users that pay for the total package. Many companies, in their quest to make a buck off us, prohibit certain features or limit usability in ways that I always find frustrating. An example? 10 Dollars a month to use the Nuron's GPS feature through T-Mobile - when in fact you can and should be able to use it for free. My old Motorola wouldn't so much as let me copy 1 inferior quality, .3mp photo on my desktop without data charges, or picture texting charges. Stuff like that makes me want to just end the service and throw the phone in the can.Enter the Nokia 5800:With just a texting and voice plan, I am able to use 90% of the features of this phone. GPS works, and works great so far - the trick was to turn off assisted GPS and download maps straight to the device with the Nokia OVI suite. Then, using the built in GPS for all navigation needs was possible (including Turn-by-Turn Directions). The suite, by the way, also allows you to back up your device and sync it in different ways and edit contacts and things like that. This is usually an extra-cost item you have to pay for. And why should you? Losing your contacts alone would be a HUGE step backwards for most of us, and my opinion is that such protection should be standard across the board. Especially as our phones become more central organizers in our lives!Wi-Fi is a great substitute for paying for 3G services, but 3G will be there when and if you need / pay for it. You don't really need net services anyway if you aren't downloading any of the FREE apps, themes, games, etc. that the OVI store provides. You also don't necessarily need e-mail to be harassing you all the time while you are on the move. Heaven help you if you think you can web-browse and drive! Trust me, I used to have a blackberry for work which CONSTANTLY buzzed me with the days emails - the phone became a source of anxiety rather than a handy tool. With Wi-Fi, I can connect at the restaurant, store, or friends house I am hanging with, or at school, and have full access to extra content or web-browsing without worrying about X-Mobile's extra charges. It also provides me with a nice 'not now' feeling when I really do need to get away from work! One does have to constantly specify Wi-Fi instead of \"X-Zones\" in my case - but you can change connection priorities to help the ensure the phone doesn't jump on the information super-rip-off without your consent.Those two features alone make this phone really stand out to me, however there is more! The touch screen is responsive, and if you can't get it done with your stubby fingers, the included stylus does the trick. The screen is about big enough, and fonts can be enlarged for readability. I won't lie though, as with other phones, I wouldn't spend much time 'browsing' the internet - only things like checking email (easy with yahoo or google so far) or checking the weather, or seeking out an app make sense to me at the moment. Otherwise, I find that I probably wouldn't get much done at all without the stylus (just not enough screen real-estate to really handle today's typical sites). I do find that the auto-rotation of the screen gets worse when multiple apps are running (fails to rotate), but if one tips it right (think, parallel to the floor!), it works every time. I can type rapidly and accurately, and enjoy it more with the vibration off and just a small beep on. This was key for me, since I've used different touch screens and qwerty keyboards and often just can't do it with my blunt fingers. My only issue with the Nokia is that the full-screen qwerty touch does not put some common symbols on the primary screen, symbols like @ for emails or ) for smiley faces (hey I like to be friendly). They are an extra tap away. Otherwise, I have been impressed with the typical responsiveness and speed. Obviously, we all wish our phone were big as a laptop at times, or as small as a credit card at others. I think Nokia's compromise is good - the phone feels and looks small, is light, and doesn't feel any more burdensome than my old Motorola flip. Brightness is more than adequate except in direct bright sunlight, where it really washes out, and text is very clear. It really seems higher res to me than it is, and font sizing is changeable pretty much everywhere, and zoom is available if needed.The latest symbian update allows a seemingly infinite number of contacts on the home screen (previous was 4 - yuck), and did link to my primary emails without a hitch, and I can manually update to read them when I think I want to! I especially like that the contacts on the home screen are 'tracked' - I can see texts for example, that I've exchanged with just that one person, and send a new one. Graphics are cool (if not as polished as some of the newer phones) and the UI in general is pretty straightforward once you spend some time with it. I do find myself getting lost a lot however, or forgetting where certain settings are, though, this is not different to me than other phones I have used - some things are always front and center, other things get buried in sub menus. It would be nice if Nokia used some of the new nifty '3d' effects like pages turning or things moving when menus were changed, to help give a visual cue that you are 'interfacing' with the UI, but again eye candy versus capability? I would rather have control than better visuals when it comes down to it.\"Express Music\" should mean that media is no-problem with this phone, and so far, I am impressed with the overall sound quality of the phone and the included headphones / mic, though the quality of those headphones, and the fit, is a little iffy to me (these are in-ear type, I think I prefer buds). Happy to know that they put emphasis on the sound rather than the look however. Plenty of volume by the way. The phone did an awesome job of organizing my files accurately, and provides a big in your face letter to let you know where you are as you search by album, artist, etc. They should have ported that feature to the contact list as it greatly simplifies the search! No major issues there. Also, the phone did come with 8gb of extra storage, enough for 600 or so high-bitrate Mp3s. Though, given the many uses of storage on this phone I think that I would need to upgraded to 16 gb or more to really stuff this thing with songs.Call quality has been excellent so far, both for the ear piece and for the speakerphone. The speaker phone sounds better than my laptop when playing music, more balanced and a a sense of actual bass. Signal strength has been excellent, and I'll be in the boondocks this weekend to find out how it cope there (usually service drops in and out). All in all voices sound full and clear, and I can detect problems with other people's phones (thats how good it has been so far).Camera? A dual-LED Carl Zeiss at 3.2 Megapixels. After a recent fire which burned down my building, I re-discovered the critical value of having even a bad camera on hand and available, if only by phone! Hence I am forgiving of camera phones in general. I've shot mostly indoors so far, and find that exposure ranges from unusable to good, grain is pretty bad in low lighting, but the flash is quite powerful. Focus lock is a tad slow at times, and I don't know why I get some blur even when using flash on occasion. I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good. There are tons of available settings however, and all around I think this camera spanks the .3 mega pixel disaster I've had to rely on previously. But I won't be throwing away my digital camera any time soon.Battery life? This baby is rated for up to 8 hours of talk time, which is excellent. Yesterday I toasted the battery in about 6 hours from a mixture of trying out the Mp3 Player and playing with the internet, setting up, etc. I assume that when I stop constantly fiddling with this thing (oh how I love my new toy) It will go for days on normal use without a hitch. This is certainly one of those phones however, that multi-tasks, and one should remember to make sure that all un-needed apps are shut off b/t uses. The phone will not warn you, but you can check this from pretty much any menu. It recharges in about 2 hours I've found, which is really good. A charger is included, but the USB cable is data-only. Pick up a powered Micro-USB cable if you want to add a charging option to the phone. I'll be picking one up as it is generally more 'portable' than an AC adapter. I am going to GPS a 2.5 hour drive on today, and head to a low signal area. If the battery proves to be really strong, or weak in these conditions, I'll report back. Otherwise, assume that it did its job!Lets Do the pros and cons:Pros: Great Mp3 PlayerGreat GPSWi-Fi rules!Easy to transfer files8 gb memory included!Excellent Call qualityCan act as a USB wi-fi hotspot if you have a data plan (is it time to drop Comcast yet?)Well executed touch screen / stylus back-uplots of free and useful apps / wallpapers / you name it.OVI Suite makes life a little easier - backups, edits, map downloads, syncing, seamless so farEssentially UNDER priced given its capabilities (compare this phone to a 4-600 dollar newer phone)Feels like a true open-source, unlocked phone (unlike Google's ad machines and Apples prison-camp approach to technology)decent camera with functional macro lensCons:UI is not an A+ - more like a solid B.Learning curve - though not necessarily worse than other smartphones. But I have been trolling the net and thumbing the manual a lot so far.OVI not as well integrated as iTunes (but I hate iTunes anyway)Not sure what documents this thing can handle (pdfs will cost you)Your girlfriend will HATE the amount of time you invest getting set up, updated, downloaded, etc.I expected a plastic case to come with it - I got nothing. Europe only I guess. But it did come with a car mount for GPS, Headphones, Charger, and 8 gb of memory, so, I'll get over it.All in all, when I got the GPS working the way I wanted, I fell in love with this little phone - it is a true powerhouse for the price, and if it lasts, I expect it will be remembered as my first great smartphone. My biggest concern now is that Nokia has not been succeeding in the U.S. lately (though make no mistake, they are a world leader everywhere else, and innovative in their own right) and I fear that a switch to Meego and away from symbian will mean the general end of support for this kind of smart phone. This platform feels as though it could only get better, so that would be a sad loss. I feel like such a 'cheater' using this phone (buying direct from Nokia means NOT being FORCED to buy a data or GPS plan from my carrier) that I really wonder if the Nokia approach of providing an open and unlocked experience can really compete against the nickel and dime wireless economy being pushed by apple, at&t;, google, verizon, and others. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll get a FREE update when Nokia decides what direction it wants to take.In the mean-time, I'll be greatly enjoying a solid all-around experience with a ton of value added for a minimal cost. This phone is the real deal, if you can live with the fact that it is not quite as polished (or large) as the more popular phones available at the moment. Though, capabilities and features have already improved through one update, perhaps another one will take it even further!Why are you hesitating?

Every phone in the AT&T; store and at their online site just did not seem to be attractive.  Sure, the iPhone is great, but I didn't want to commit to a 2 year contract with a required $30/month data plan attached.  And I can't replace the battery myself?  Can't use the phone as a wireless modem? Hmmmm, there must be a better option.  Hey, what's this?  An unlocked Nokia phone that doesn't require a monthly data plan and I'm not locked into a 2 year contract?  I can use the phone as a modem and the battery is easily replaced?  Too good to be true?  Actually it just gets better from there.  Don't want to incur data charges? Just go find a local wi-fi spot and you're online in a few seconds!  Oh, its an incredible music/media player as well.  The built in speakers are the best I have ever heard coming from mobile phone or any other small device.  If I turn the volume all the way up I can rock my office when I am alone, otherwise I need to turn it down or plug in the headphones.  Did I mention the GPS?  Very nice feature for a phone, but it was a little slow giving directions during a trip to Seattle recently, still worked ok and helped me find my way around town.  I signed up for the free trial and it was useful, but my Garmin does a better job, but the Garmin was more expensive than this phone and that is its primary function. Still a cool feature, but that's not what I bought it for.  First and foremost I use this as a mobile phone!  You know, talking to people the old fashioned way, by voice.  And this phone does that function flawlessly as well as letting me access the internet either via hot spots or through AT&T;'s 3.5G network (must mean that they're half way to 4G), which blankets Southern California and worked well in Seattle too.  The other features you'd expect are present as well, a decent 3.2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones. So if you want a great phone that does just about everything an iPhone does and a few things more, for less and without a 2 year contract and a required data plan, check out this Nokia, you won't be disappointed.  In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I signed up for an unlimited data plan for $15/month that does not carry any commitment, I can drop it at any time, but I enjoy being able to look things up or access my email while away from my office that I have continued to use it.  Also, don't be concerned that this is an unlocked phone, its too easy to set up if you have an existing phone you are replacing.  Just slide out the sim chip in the old phone and slide it into the Nokia.  Pop the battery in and you are good to go!

Other times when I get a call it does nothing until a few seconds later when it beeps to tell me I missed a call.2) When online, the browser will sometimes just freeze up or close without warning. When it freezes up, sometimes the only solution is to pull the battery which sometimes causes all settings and information to be lost. I have to back up the phone nightly for this reason.3) When my calendar alarm goes off, sometimes it will beep and vibrate like it's suppose to, other times it will just beep without vibrating.4) When my alarm goes off for a calendar event and I try to press either the 'snooze' or 'stop' button, sometimes the alarm won't stop.5) When I click on an event under the calendar, sometimes it opens the details of the event, but other times it opens a small window with the options of 'delete' or 'send'.6) When standing outside, the GPS may pick up satellites within a minute or so, but if I turn it off and try it again, it sometimes takes up to 20 minutes to locate the satellites again while standing in the same location. I can stand in that same spot with my Garmin GPS and it will pick up the satellites every time within a minute.7) When opening a video on YouTube's desktop version, half the time, instead of playing the video, it just shows the flash player icon where the video usually plays. (I tried deleting their latest application update and this seems to have fixed the problem.)8) Calendar events no longer show up on main screen.I went through 3 Nokia 5800's which all had the same problems. Nokia's support was horrible. They had me perform a hard reset and update the software on all 3 phones multiple times only to have the problems return after a few days. After many calls, resets and updates, they told me to do it again. I eventually refused and explained to them that performing a hard reset and updating the software was not a solution. They said I had to then send it in to them for repair. I reluctantly agreed. When they returned the phone, I found out that their \"repair\" was to perform a hard reset and update the software once again. Surprisingly, it didn't work.Amazon's support and return policy on the other hand was EXCEPTIONAL!", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Smart and Affordable", "Author": "Henrietta Will", "ReviewID": "R1EP4N1WGNW2K3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Comes with Handset, 8 GB MicroSD card, battery, charger, music headset, connectivity cable, stylus, user guide, quick start guideOne of the most difficult tasks today is to find an affordable cell phone that has the most technological function. In the past, I had the Sony Ericsson w600i which plays music really well, but I could not pick up reception of anywhere. How can regular I affordable a cell phone that can play music and videos, take pictures and videos, connect to Wi-Fi, GPS, and bluetooth all in one for cheap? Well, the Nokia 5800 is a start to having all these applications in one phone at an inexpensive cost.Display ScreenThe screen is a 3.2 high-resolution touch screen that support up to 16 million colors. This makes viewing pictures and videos with clarity and vivid color. It has a built with an Accelerometer sensor that can automatically rotate the picture or video based orientation of the phone. On the homescreen, any contacts or application can be displayed and contacted through a single touch. The upper left corner is a shortcut that allows users to directly access music, pictures, GPS, videos, or the Internet. The touch-screen is very responsive therefore making everything easily assessable. However, if you are someone with a bigger thumb, you can use the pointer provided on the right-hand side of the phone. All the starting applications, including 3 free games, are all free. Multiple applications can be used at the same time, such as talking on the phone while browsing the Internet. I like to how it can make joined calls without any extra cost.MusicThe music played is quality music because it has a built-in-stereo speaker that is 3.5mm audio jack. Songs can be organized by artist, album, genres, or you can even built your own playlist. No MP3 conversion is required. Just connect the phone with a provided USB and drag the songs into the music folder. It has a build-in-recorder with 16.9 aspect ratio and 30 frames-per-second playback. This is ideal for students who want to record lectures and playback at a later time. I record my almost all of my lectures. Then I would the Nokia's bluetooth to send it to my computer. This makes reviewing my notes a breeze. It works best if you place your phone in-font of the class. If you are worry about your cell phone going off in the middle of the class, then you can turn the phone to offline mode, where incoming or outgoing call will not be allowed.InternetWhile waiting for friends at Starbuck or Barnes and Noble, the Nokia can easily pick up free wireless Internet from any hotspot. This makes time fly while waiting.MemoryThe phone has an internal memory of 81 MB. It also comes with a 8GB microSD card, which can be upgraded to 16GB.CameraThe camera's lenses are made by Carl Zeiss, a company known for its high quality camera lenses. The 3.15MP camera offers autofocus, dual-LED flash with red-eye reduction mode.While I was visiting my family in Vietnam, I forget to bring my camera wherever I went. The Nokia helped to preserved call my most precious memory with my family. When taking pictures in the daytime the picture are absolutely beautiful. The pictures were clear and the colors vivid even after uploading it onto your computers or after development. However, the pictures are pixellated if taken at night or in dark places.Videos can be recorded in four resolution modes, including 640 x 480 pixels (standard TV resolution) and 640 x 352 pixels (widescreen quality)--both at 30 frames per second (fps). But when making videos, make sure there are lots of light or  else it would appear really dark and pixellated.In addition, there is a secondary Camera on the front of the phone, which can be used for video calls or taking pictures. I used this often when taking I'm trying to take a picture of myself and another person.BatteryIn stand-by the battery can last up to 406 h. Talk time mode can last up to 8h 45min. Lastly, music can be played up to 35 h. I use the phone all the time. I'm always making phone call on it throughout the day. Whenever I'm not on the phone I listen to music, usually while walking, working out at the gym, or studying. I can use it for a whole day without recharging it. It takes only about thirty minutes for the Nokia to by fully recharged.For many international travelers, this unlock phone is great when traveling. There are no plans necessary when outside the United State. In many other countries, you can by a SIM card and add minutes to it. While I was in Vietnam, I just bought a SIM card for only 5 dollars and it had 100 minutes on it. I was able to call and send text messages within the country as well as internationally.Overall, this is an affordable phone with many convenient applications.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "pretty good phone, iphone alternative for someone who doesn't want to pay $30 a month for data", "Author": "some guy", "ReviewID": "R2F37ER54APKPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "works great in the bay area with att signal. had the iphone before and it was mediocre with such slow internet over a 3G connection. This phone has an excellent antenna. I live in probably the worst areas for a cell phone to operate and this thing constantly gets 3 bars better than any phone before including the iphone. this phone also connects at mostly 3.5G (HSPDA) where not too many devices do which is like driving in the carpool lane - very fast download speeds. The mp3 player works great, sounds good. It is very easy to load music files into the phone either via usb transfer mode (fast) or by bluetooth. The internet is very functional and stable. Can open youtube videos, yelp, etc. Google maps can be downloaded and is better than the iphone version having more integration with the web browser and some other feature.Email is great, easy to setup with predefined profiles of gmail and other known sources.  This phone also has a dedicated GPS chip and a assisted GPS chip so if you want you can use the maps software included with the phone and get turn by turn direction, re-routing as well as POI's via telenav maps. It also has acompass via GPS but i havent used it yet. The battery is quite good, lasting over 2.5 days with average use before needing a charge. Theathering can be done via bluetooth and you can use this phone as a high speed modem for your laptop. just make sure you use wap instead of isp and you don't get all crazy, using the std data plan on att of $15 a month you get a pretty good deal. The camera takes decent shots during the day but is quite shotty at night or in low light. The LCD screen is not as vibrant as the iphone and the touch screen is good enough but i feel could of been better.

That had the first firmware with no updates...and it sucked. Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade. So now we advance to today. And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone.  The most current firmware 20.0.012 has made this Nok great. I know this because I have owned both.  I take off .50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch. the other .25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down. So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly.  This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother.  Their is no crazy ear piece problem.  The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand.  This cant be said of the Iphone.  The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone. ok let me real this in. The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen.

Being a nokia phone user for years, I am well accustomed to the features and interface even with some technological changes (like touch screen). The features you will read here are just some of the highlights I think is usually overlooked but as important when using cell phones.Pros:Data management. An example is for contacts. You can easily select and transfer phone numbers to and from the sim card. This is a must when upgrading to a different phone without bothering to use a computer. Try that with a blackberry pearl you will see what I mean.Unlocked. You can use most gsm sim cards from around the globe. (hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges. Another plus is that you are not tied to a network so you can switch whenever you like.Price. I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required. This was 350 USD when I bought it and has gone down to 300 (as nokia is trying to put out a newer model)Cons:As with other reviews, the plastic battery cover needs to be a lot sturdier.

I was hoping to hold out until the n97 but decided to give the 5800 a try.The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing.  I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into...I hope this doesn't break on me quickly.....but I don't see a need to be removing the cover very often, as the memory card and SIM card are inserted through the side, meaning this phone can have its memory cards switched very easily.The user interface seems like a quick and dirty job, it is basically the s60 v3 operating system with some bigger icons to make selection by touch a little easier. Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion.Another major concern that hopefully will be alleviated soon is the lack of third party apps, I'm assuming this operating system is still an infant and over time developers will start adapting their existing apps to use on touch devices.Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second.

I've used touch screen phones that my friends have (iPhone & Omnia), but this is the first I've owned.The touch screen works very well although it did take a little to get used to.  I am impressed with how accurate it is.  The full querty keyboard is easy to type on.  Surprisingly I'm even able to use the mini querty keyboard with my fingers although it's really designed to be used with the stylus.  I noticed some people voicing displeasure with the resitive touch screen.  I think most of these came from users with early firmware versions.  After using it for a while now I'd say it has both advantages and disadvantages over a capacitive touch screen.  I think scrolling is easier on a capacitive screen.  It's not hard to scroll with just your fingers on a resistive screen, but in some applications when you need to use the scroll bar the bar is a little to narrow and it's difficult to grab the slider.  In this case using the stylus works better and makes scrolling very easy.  The option to use a stylus gives you very precise control.  A resistive screen is less fragile and can be made more economically which helps to keep the price down.The screen is bright and clear.  The resolution is great and I like the 16:9 screen format for watching movies.  It can be a little hard to see clearly in bright sun, but I haven't found a screen that isn't.It's loaded with extra features and functionality like the built-in GPS receiver which means it works even when you are out of cell phone coverage although it does take a little longer to initially find your position if you disable the assisted GPS (A-GPS mode).  The other advantage is you are not forced to pay for GPS service from your cell provider.  The FM radio works well, but I wish the antenna could be built-in rather than relying on headphones as the antenna.As a phone i think the reception and sound quality are excellent.I am a little disappointed with the camera quality in low light, but from talking with others I think this is a common problem for most camera phones.  This issue can be minimized with the camera settings if you know what you are doing.  In medium to bright light the pictures are very good.  I really didn't expect this to function as my main camera.  I just wanted a camera that was always with me and could take decent photos if I didn't have my main camera with me.  It serves that purpose well.My only complaint with this phone is that it uses micro USB and doesn't charge over this connector.  A mini USB connector is much more common (I have 6 or 7 of these cables already) and I'm sure they could have fit this into the phone.  It uses a separate port for charging.  You can buy a charging cable which will let you charge from your PC (or any powered USB port), but it still has to use the charging port on the phone.  This seems like an oversight, but maybe there is a reason for it.Battery life is good although it will certainly be affected by how many of the radio features you turn on (wi-fi, bluetooth, GPS, FM radio) and how much you use the video screen in addition to the cell phone use.Overall I am very happy with this phone.  There are certainly more expensive phones out there if you are willing to pay for them, but this one has a lot to offer for a more reasonable price.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "WOW!

It does not have a graphics chip accelerator, though games are still pretty decent on this phone.

But really, who wants to repeatedly visit a service centre and reload files. Bottom line, this is my first Nokia and probably my last! Absolutely disgusted with the product!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW (19 August 2009)If you're looking for a 3G cell phone with wi-fi connectivity and large memory (maximum 16MB capacity), the Nokia 5800 Express Music is perfect. It surfs the internet with relative ease, links to RSS feeds, plays on-line radio stations (listen regularly to KVOD in Denver and SWR1 in Baden-Baden, Germany) and downloads podcasts.  The browser can be magnified similar to the Opera browser application. The 3G networks in Malaysia work well on it.Applications for Symbian 5 touchscreen phones like the 5800XM seem to be minimal, and this might be a drawback for some. Nevertheless, I've found many 3rd party developers with applications and widgets that fit my needs, among these: WorldMate, Psiloc World Traveler, Office Suite, AccuWeather, Phone Torch, Level, Scientific Calculator, YouTube, Google Translator, France 24 News, AP News, GPS with Garmin, Scratchpad, Mobbler for Lost.FM, Facebook,, MySpace, Twitter and NimBuzz,  to name just a few. Some are free while others may be purchased on-line.  Some Java applications work well too, as do some Symbian 3 applications. Gaming applications are also available.Using a touch phone takes some getting use to, and the Nokia 5800XM is no different. This is especially so when scrolling through the address directory. It can be very fast and a contact can be overlooked with much frustration. Nokia solves this problem with an alphabetical keypad; simply key the first initial of a name and it compiles a short-list of names.The media player is terrific. It is indexed with an FM radio, Podcasts, music player, video player. The sound is sufficient for my needs and I've stored hundreds of music files, that play instantly at a touch on the desktop.The 3.2 megapixel camera uses Carl Zeiss lenses. It focuses with a touch, hold down and it snaps photos easily. You can resize the photos or add special effects to it. With some 3rd party applications you can do some photo/art touch ups as well. With Nimbuzz application you can even video conference or carry on video calls with the front lens.Data can be downloaded via Bluetooth or Mass Storage using a cable. With Bluetooth only small data can be downloaded since it is received in the Message folder that is placed in the small megabyte and fixed memory chip.The Nokia 5800XM is indeed a great little pocket computer. It does many things very well.

Looks like a kids toy or candy dispenser.The unacceptable: I have to say that I'm very surprised by the number of people who review this phone very positively on Amazon and elsewhere and yet seem to report the same problems I had when I owned this phone. Dropped calls, dropped internet connection, dropped GPS, frequent locking/freezing which requires the battery to be removed then reinserted. I had all these issues, constantly. I cannot imagine how anyone finds this acceptable and is glad to own a phone that you can't rely on.Contacting Nokia for support was a mixed bag. Nice CSR on the phone, but the only suggestion was to send in for a replacement. I've seen enough of these reported problems to believe it's not just a few bad phones out there. This seems to be a systemic problem. Suffice it to say I returned this phone on day 29 for a full refund.Those interested in touch screen mobile devices would be better served by looking elsewhere.

The Nokia 5800 honestly impressed me, though not so initially, but after a couple weeks of usage it has the tendency to grow on its user offering a solid and sleek feel, gorgeous display, and outstanding audio (the audio is really that good, through speakers and earphones alike, especially with stereo widening enabled, it is truly an experience). In addition, the touch-enabled Symbian OS (even though it is still maturing) is quite responsive and provides a user friendly experience. What I can say is that the UI was designed with the correct balance of animation and snappiness (animation effects are turned off by default, activate them through Themes > General > Options > Theme Effects). If the UI is not that eye-catching for your taste, there are thousands of themes you may download and apply, in addition you can even design your own theme through Nokia's Carbide.ui software (downloaded separately). What's more is the variety of apps available for the phone, I can recommend a few that I have found quite useful: Photo Browser, Handy Shell, Paint Pad, Phone Torch, Opera Mini, AccuWeather, QuickOffice, GoogleMaps and Fring.  (google them to find out more)Another aspect that truly impressed me is the phone's ability to act as a mini entertainment system. Bundled with the package is a certificate which allows you to download $50 worth of movies from Amazon. I got six movies (both hi-def and mobile versions) for this price and they all fit on the 8 Gigs of hot-swappable storage that comes with the phone.  In viewing the movies on the phone I was impressed at the display quality (16M colors, 640x) and more so with the audio quality - the stereo speakers were loud and rich, able to simulate the acoustic depth of the movie and I must say that it rivals some laptop speakers I have come across.Another highly important aspect is the battery life. For the first few days of owning the phone, it was constantly used, testing out the Camera, GPS, Wifi, playing movies, installing apps, etc. and with such constant use (which is unusual for a typical user), the phone was able to operate for a full day and a half before the battery warning kicked in.  Now I charge the phone every three days or so with a few daily calls, light web browsing and YouTube playback. (A tip for you is to make sure you fully charge the battery with the phone off when you get it initially, it operates and keeps it charge as it should this way).The phone's camera is quite decent in my opinion. It shines in daylight conditions able to capture great photos and widescreen videos of surprising quality. In low light conditions, you may have to play around with settings a bit and get as close to the subject as possible to get the best possible result. Overall, the phone's camera could be better given the quality of cameras on previous Nokia products, namely the N95, but this judgment is relative. I believe, however the choice was made to make it affordable, given the fact that it also comes with a front-facing camera for video calls.Final thoughts and tips about this interesting piece of hardware center on its value, quality and reputation as a Nokia branded product. Some say it rivals the iPhone, and honestly, it does have more collective strengths as a smartphone than does the iphone in spite of its resistive and non-glass touch interface. It even has a downloadable simulation of the iPhone's interface called MyPhone if you prefer that flavor. In this light, the phone shines as a more flexible device with swappable memory, battery and service, features not present in the lauded iPhone, but I say what's to compare? In short I chose this phone and adore it now due to its form-factor (not too big, not too small), its screen, its expandability and flexibility, its hardware features (GPS, Wifi, audio) and most of all, its competitive price/quality ratio.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Nokia, wait, Best Phone!", "Author": "Mecha Aslan", "ReviewID": "R2QIAE7QEW1RH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone now for a little over a month.  I can tell you that after using it for this length of time that it is an excellent phone.  It can do more than any other touchscreen phone out there today.  The only two phones that can even come close are the iPhone 3G and the BB Storm.  This phone can do more than either of them two.  The camera gets dogged a lot, but in all actuality, it does a pretty good job when taking pictures in bright outdoor/indoor light.  The front facing camera is an outstanding feature and works very well.  The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh?).  The virtual qwerty is very nice and has all the keys in the right place. I also have an Eternity, but the layout of the 5800's keyboard is way better (don't make me dig for my apostrophe Samsung!) >:[.  Also, the haptic feedback is awesome too.  The vibration actually 'feels' localized and not just vibrating the whole phone.  The call quality is top notch, not sure why some reviews say other wise, but compared to previous phones I have owned, this was on par with my old Nokia E51, and better than my Eternity, Quickfire (what a joke), SE w580i or LG Vu.  I've had other phones too, but they were very basic phones and were also Nokias.The OS is still a tad bit immature, making its crossover to the touchscreen.  However, it is still very stable and functional for its 'immaturity'.  I love how they managed to keep all the previous capabilities of the S60 3rd and include it into a very well packaged bundle what is now called S60 5th Edition.  I love the 'tap and hold and slide' to copy and paste things.  It is so awesome!Syncing is great as usual.  I downloaded the iSync plug from Nokia website and was able to sync my calendar and contacts via bluetooth flawlessly!  Also, PC Suite worked like a charm as with any Nokia phone.The sound is best in class.  I don't think anything out there can compete with the sound quality that this phone puts out.It's still a new phone, been out only about 7 months now.  But they provide excellent firmware support (3 to date) and are constantly looking for ways to improve performance and enhance any existing features if not, they even add more useful features.As for all the other features (gps, radio, messaging, browsing); it does them all very well.  I have no complaints.  Probably the only drawback if there were one, is the fact that this phone can do so much with its Symbian OS that you really need to read up and research all the things it can really do and how to do them.  This phone's OS has a very rich Symbian ancestry.It's an excellent phone and I honestly believe that this phone is best in class and overall compared to the other phones currently out there.  I would even go so far as to say I am glad I did not wait for the N97.  I know blasphemy!  But it's true.If you get this phone, you will not regret it.  Just keep in mind that it does come with plenty of features and the OS is very 'sophisticated'.  Oh, by the way, I do have to admit, that it is very nice to have a 'Smart Phone' that can use the internet and check email without having to pay any PDA fees.Kudos Nokia!

I can also connect to my wireless network with ease when I'm at home and chilling on the sofa and can't be bothered to get my laptop.

Also, because I can get unlimited Web deal from my phone company for $10, my bills are much more affordable than they would be if I had the iPhone from AT&T.;However....its a little bulky compared to the iPhone and most blackberries. For me that's cool because it slips out of my pocket less than my other phone and I drop it less too (I'm one of those annoyingly clumsy people!). What annoys me the most though is the fact that there is no alphanumeric keypad option when you want to make calls. Its only available for text messages and web browsing. Fine if you're in Europe where phone numbers are always given numerically, but in the US, phone 'words' are used all the time, so you either have to memorize the alphanumeric keypad or switch to text messaging to type out memorize the number form of the word.Despite those minor flaws (in my opinion), a very good phone indeed!", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 XpressMusic", "Author": "Joshue Fernandez", "ReviewID": "RJGE965ZOATJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, all I have to say is that this phone is amazing.

The Nokia 5800 is more fun than a Blackberry. And the iPhone? Well, it's really just a \"feature\" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone. The iPhone is great for what it can do, but terrible for what it can't do.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a truly useful and functional communication and entertainment device. It is the best convergence device I have used to date. It excels as a phone with great call quality and RF reception (I get 3G signals where other phones barely get 2G, or even no signal at all)! As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback. And as a web/communication device it has one of the best mobile browsers available (full HTML with support for Java and Flash) with applications available for popular IM and social networking sites (ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, Googletalk, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and more) and email with support for attachments (POP, IMAP, SMTP, MFE). And since it's all controlled by the Symbian multi-tasking OS, you can use just about any combination of applications and features you want (within the limits of the phone's memory)!Nokia has been supporting this phone well with several major (free) firmware updates since it was released late last year. Be sure to update to the latest firmware, because there have been significant improvements in performance and stability, as well as new features added.It's small and light weight with reasonably solid construction. While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket.It's about as loaded as you can get feature wise.

PC sync software.The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS.

It feels solid in your hands it does not freeze at all, like the n96 when you fill up the memory. Before i bought this phone i owned the nokia n95 (great device) and the nokia N96(more memory but not so good)  The only reason i did not give this nokia 5800 five starts its because of the camara quality which by the way is good but the n95 and n96 were better quality camaras and also video recording capabilities.But It Works a lot faster and with a lot less or none problems so far than previews owned nokias. I Think Nokia  could have done better in the camara area, Other than that nokia took a big leap from the symbian 3rd edition to the fifth touch screen base.  making the phone very user friendly and simple to use, yet adding a lot more features and ways to get to the applications quicker.  it supports a 16GB memory card to store a decent amount of music video and pictures(it comes already with an 8GB memory card). the battery life (VERY IMPORTANT at least for me),  is great.  Much better than the n95 and n96.I can go a hole day surfing the web and playing with the phone and the battery does not seem to die.  There Is A Shortcut for almost everything from the main screen that can also be customized to your four favorite contacts being able to see all the recent activity like calls e-mails or text messages and place calls from their picture icons.  this phone can be used as a router which is great if you are carrying  a laptop and do not  have a network available the phone can provide it for you. it also comes with an amazon coupon of $50 to download movies from amazon unbox (another plus). Music Sounds  clear and loud with hidden speakers. If You Are Planning on buying a nokia i really recommend this one over the n95 and n96 ( if you like touch screen) . E-mail settings is very easy the phone automatically recognizes the servers and ports  from the e-mail you are typing in like (yahoo,hotmail, gmail ect). it was more complicated with previous devices to set up e-mail accounts also GPS works faster and better on this device. In General its the most refined version of symbian working better in every aspect.

Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection. Plus, I wanted this all at a reasonable price since I would not be getting any plan subsidy. Using this criteria the 5800 seemed perfect and there are a lot of great things about this phone for the traveler which I'll go into later. The main negative I found was that the American version of this handset and the others in its product line do not support 3G outside of the Americas. The 5800 American edition does not support the UMTS (3G) 2100 frequency (Wikipedia has an entry under \"list of UMTS networks\" that show which carriers use which frequency). Now the point can be made that I bought American edition and shouldn't be surprised that it won't pick up 3G in other countries. The only problem is that almost all of Nokia's other American version 3G handsets like the N97, X6 and E75 (my wife's phone)do support the 2100 frequency. To be fair, the 5800 will support EDGE networks wherever you want to go and if you use a browser like opera mini, you may not even notice that much of a difference in general web browsing. It's just something to consider if  you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you.Now the 5800 does have some very nice features for the traveler that should be noted. First and foremost is the ability to pre-install free Ovi maps in your phone before you get on the plane. This allows you to use the 5800's GPS with voice directions without an active data connection. This is something that other free mapping services, like Google maps, cannot do. Of course you could go with third party software like Ndrive and pay up to $70 per map. Personally, I'll go with free. Of course with Nokia there is usually a catch. This one is that not every Nokia handset that has a GPS gets free Ovi maps. The 5800 does but my wife's E75, a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the 5800, does not. If you are looking at other other Nokia phones and this feature is important to you, then check make sure the phone can use free Ovi maps.Another important travel feature is that the 5800 has Wifi. If you spend time overseas, you will probably be buying local pre-paid sim cards (the 5800's quad-band GSM capability lets you do that everywhere) with no or expensive data service. Therefore, Wifi is essential. Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home. The Nokia catch here is that connecting with Wifi can be a mysterious and confusing process. You would think that once you hook up to a Wifi connection then that the phone would automatically use that connection as the default. We'll you would be wrong. The first thing you need to do is go into all your applications that go online and insure that the default connection is set to \"always ask\". That way you can select the connection you want the app to use. If you don't then the 5800 may or may not use the free Wifi connection and instead drain the money out of your sim card without you noticing.As for long train, plane and automobile rides, the 5800 is a very decent media player. It has a standard 3.5mm audio jack and the music playback is very good quality. The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3.2 inches, but it is very high res at 360 by 640 and hence the video is sharp and clear. The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable. You will need to convert your videos to the MP4 format for the installed Real Player, but you would want to do that anyway to bring the file size down. Nokia also provides a generous 8 GB micro SD card, that can be upgraded to 16 GB. That means that right out of the box you can put a lot of media on the phone, without having to spend money on a bigger SD card.As for apps, the 5800 uses the S60V5 software and the phone has been out long enough that there are a fair amount of apps for the phone. You may have to dig for it, but pretty much everything I want the 5800 to do, and I want it to do a quite a lot, there is an app out there to let me do it. The difference with Apple and Android is that you may have 10 flavors of apps to do the 1 task you want, while with S60v5 you will probably only have one. The Nokia catch here is that S60V5 is a tough operating system to get to know and work with. It is not intuitive and can be initially very frustrating, but with time you get used to it's quirks and there's lot's of support on-line in different forums to help you learn the ropes.In the end I was looking for a phone that if I was traveling very light could do all the things a basic netbook could do. Despite it's lack of 3G outside North and South America, the 5800 does meet those expectations. With a small folding Bluetooth keyboard (The Iphone won't let you do that yet) and a battery backup charger (get one that uses either AA or AAA batteries so you can keep replacing the batteries)I can watch movies, listen to music, write long emails or notes and play games for all of my long haul flights and layovers. There is even an e-book app (ereader) that works pretty well if you bump the font up. Then when I finally do get to my destination, I can fire up the GPS and load a local sim card and I'm moving and communicating in no time. All this for a reasonable price without a contract.There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets. The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware. With stores in the US selling $99 dollar 8GB IPhone 3GSs (with a two year contract), there is becoming less and less reason for folks to put up with Nokia's \"Quirks.\"", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "6 Month Review", "Author": "J.P 62 \"J.P 62\"", "ReviewID": "R9AOR5KJCB8N9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up the 5800 and have been using it for 6 months. I bought the phone initially because I wanted a more feature rich phone and an unlocked phone which allowed me more freedom than standard subsidized phones. I took a risk and bought the 5800 sight unseen. Part of my decision was based on the specs and part on the incredible price for those specs. I have no regrets.I've owned it for six months now and I still have a hard time putting this phone down! LOLHeres a few of my thoughts as well as a few tips and tricks.The call quality is superb. Voices always sound crisp and clear with no tinny or distorted sound. The speakerphone which I use often is also very good. Alot of people overlook and are willing to put up with subpar call quality if the phone looks sexy and is fast with lots of eye candy. Not me. I actually use my cell-phones to talk on. So call quality is still the most important thing to me.Connectivity....Transfering data using the Nokia collection of software is a snap. The USB works flawlessly. I use it all the time to transfer music, pics etc to and from my pc. I also use it to back-up my phone content as well as synching activities.Bluetooth works decently. The only problem I have with it is that it does not seem to have the range I've experienced with other phones. I LOVE being able to voice dial when using a bluetooth headset. Thats the whole point of being \"hands free\"User interface and performance....I know that Symbian is outdated and gets ragged on. I don't care. I know it does'nt have the intuitiveness of an iphone or the eye candy of Android, but the Symbian OS on the 5800 works well for me. For me its a stable, mature and easy to use UI. Good Apps, both free and paid are plentiful ALL over the web.Couple things I've learned to keep the phone running well...Don't bog it down with alot of useless software. After adding alot of useless apps I learned to add only the things that I will actually use. Also, cleanup the phones internal memory once in awhile. Its easy to forget, but its also very helpful to always clean the browser's cache as it can accumulate quickly and really eats up spaceAnd finally if your phone is really sluggish, do an onboard or pc back-up via the Nokia Backup Software and then do a reset of the phone. It will make your phone factory fresh and totally give it new umph! that has been lost to the installing and removal of apps and the traces that it leaves behind. I did it a couple of weeks ago because I wanted to make sure I had enough internal memory for the upcoming 5.0 Firmware Update. I was amazed at how fast and fresh my phone was after the reset. If you do a proper back-up you can reset safely without loss of data.As I said, I've found and enjoyed some really useful apps for the 5800. These are worth checking out. Some are free and some are paid.....AccuWeather, Google Search with voice, Absolute Radio, Nokia Photo Browser, Opera Browser, Smartlight, Total Recall, Handy Shell. Thats just a few of the really nice apps I've found for my 5800All in all, I've been very happy with my choice of the Nokia 5800. I've found it to be an incredible value for the amount of money it cost.

It has all the features one can possibly want in a phone. Here are some Pros and Cons. The only reason it did not receive a 5 star review is the lack of commitment from Nokia for the US release of this phone, in terms of firmware updates which are long overdue. (UPDATE: They have released several firmware fixes for the US version and it is amazing. PLUS FREE NAVIGATION SOFTWARE, beat that i-can't do anything-Phone)Pros:-Amazing interface and ease of navigation-Has great GPS Function. Nokia maps is awesome and for good measure you can get Google maps to work even better with this device.-Sound is spectacular on the headphones and not too shabby coming from two built in speakers.-Great array of apps online for use as a work phone or a entertainment phone.-Great colors and touch screen response.-Most importantly great sound and connectivity during calls.-Decent camera not great in the dark.Cons:-Nokia doesn't really care too much about the US market when it comes to this phone. No 3G on T-Mobile and No firmware updates that have been out in other countries for some time now.-Little buggy and sometimes can freeze and needs a restart. This is why they need to release a US firmware update really badly.-The dial pad lacks letters that correspond, so if you are calling tech support that has e.g 1-800-WHAT good luck figuring out what WHAT is numerically.-Battery is kind of lacking but what touch screen isn't.-A little thick but not too bad. Other dimensions are perfect in terms of hand grasp for texting and emailing.-Definitely not a camera phone despite its great Carl Zeiss lens.Overall:If you want to put away your ipod and still be able to listen to music, have a good navigation system, be able to SMS/EMail quickly, read Office documents WORD, EXCEL, PPT, PDF on the run, maybe squeeze in a few games, and have a stable OS interface (for most part) this is really a great phone. I forgot to mention it actually is a great cell phone in terms of call quality. I did not want to get the G3 from T-Mobile because I am tired of the commitments and have Google force everything down my throat kind of like Apple has been doing to their customers. This phone has gazillion free apps that are actually useful. You will be able to squeeze a lot of use out of this phone on the cheap and enjoy doing it.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wait for the next firmware update?", "Author": "MountainMan \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R1ENVIA3B3E657", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firmware updates for the 5800XM seem to come every few months and the system automatically reboots after but there is also a soft reboot and a hard reboot if needed. I have not used either. For my purposes, mostly music, appointments and alarms, and the phone, it is stable with just 1 exception when the battery overheated while I was talking on the phone and connected to my Wi-Fi. This has not happened again.Kinetic scrolling is what most XM users are waiting for in the next upgrade because current dragging scrolling is not as accurate and is inconsistent depending on what app or utility you are using. The bad news is that the kinetic scrolling will only be for the home screen, contacts, and the browser. I don't think the dragging currently used in the 5800 is all that bad but there is a learning curve if you are not use to it.The browser is slow and sometimes hangs but anyone using the internet knows that sometimes any browser, including FireFox will hang. This is really not specific to the 5800XM. When it stops responding I do the same thing I would do on my laptop or PC, change to something else I was doing and wait for the browser to either respond or I kill it. With the 5800XM simply click on the menu button and get out of there. I have never had to reboot because of the browser. It is, however, slow. I have full AT&T; 3.5G coverage (7 bars) but the browser still works faster over Wi-Fi. Response time is supposed to increase with the new firmware.On icon screens the 5800XM requires only a single tap to open but on some of the menus 2 taps are required. That is real confusing until you get use to it. The upgrade may fix this as well.Supplied documentation is basically non-existent other than for just general operating instructions but there are tips and hints tutorials on the net.Outside, the camera takes crystal clear pix. Inside takes a little tweaking but there are plenty of options. The new firmware is also supposed to contain a camera enhancement.The auto-orientation screen rotation sometimes gets discombobulated but corrects itself in a second or so. Some screens don't rotate but this is addressed in the next release as well according to the Nokia USA discussions forum.The speaker distorts sound if it is set at max but although I would expect better from a phone advertised exclusively as for music, it is typical of almost anything I have had plus I usually have on the earphones so the sound in not on max that makes this mostly a non-issue for me.There is built in Flash player but it does not work with version 9 so some of the videos you want to watch online simply won't play until this is upgraded in the firmware.Mine and some others have a small open area on the top right side where the top screen section of the phone meets the main phone section. You can see it real good if you hold the top of the phone against a white background, look along the side and front and between the 2 black sections. It almost looks like someone took the phone apart and did not put it back together correctly. Dust and even hair can get below the screen. I keep the phone in my pocket at all times so I don't see where this will be an issue and after 2 months, it is not. If it becomes an issue, I will have to ship it to a Nokia Care center so I kept my other Sim-card phone just in case.The issue with earlier European phones that involved a defective ear speaker is not an issue with mine.I had trouble connecting to my home Wi-Fi but once I upgraded my router's firmware, the XM found it without further incident.The GPS turn-by-turn directions through Navteq and Nokia Maps are flawless and the phone comes, if I remember correctly, with a 3 week free trial.The battery life is about the same for any other phone I have had and even better seeing as how I am always listening to music.So, why did I stay with this and not go with the iPhone 3GS? Every phone and every OS has some issues. This is really the first attempt by Symbian at a touch interface and they seem responsive to enhancement requests. I did not want to get locked into a contract in case I move and can't get the AT&T; signal. I don't make or take calls every day so I did not want to pay the minimum monthly for the iPhone. I use Pay as Your Go.It has tactile as well as visual feedback (the key you press enlarges and there is a slight vibration that you can turn off), making typing on the large QWERTY easy and the XM remembers where I use the large keyboard and automatically brings it up with the apps where I use it. It is just the right size and the rubber-like back makes it easy to hold on to. The XM has both primary and secondary cameras. It backs up to both its own folder on your PC as well as synchronizes with my Outlook Express. Also, for all music lovers, the surround sound in the 5800 is the best I've heard on a phone.Some of these things would have totally turned off most people but I searched for over 2 years for a better alternative to my Sprint Palm and the 5800XM is the only phone that fulfills all my needs. The enV Touch came close but it has no Wi-Fi and I could have been locked into monthly fees and a contract. I am willing to put up with a few minor inconveniences while they iron out the bugs. I would not have been happy at all with the alternatives and it is the best phone I have owned.Update 10-16-09 the browser freeze does not happen since I reoriented my Wi-Fi. Version 3 update still not available through PC Suite. Most times Bluetooth works flawlessly but sometimes, under exactly same circumstances, it constantly cuts out and this is reported from people using different BT devices.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "garbage", "Author": "jackoso", "ReviewID": "R32I5LU8MW34W1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this was the review i wrote initially when i gave it four stars...i spent a week online trying to figure out which smartphone i should buy. i required an unlocked gsm phone that would receive the most common 3g bands as well as wifi.  i also wanted a decent camera. i've never used a smartphone before and would have normally tried a few models. only nokia had phones that filled my requirements. i selected 5800 because it has the biggest screen and is the cheapest. the phone performs my requirements fairly well. it feels very clunky but since i've never so much as touched another smartphone, i have nothing to compare it to. amazon service was excellent.the phone worked fairly well for first 100 days. (curiously, the warranty was 90 days.) first, it stopped keeping time. then every time i received a call, it would switch into another function so that the call ended up on voicemail. thinking that it might have needed a software update, i tried to hook the phone up to nokia's pc suite. in the past hooking up took anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour: it never worked the first try. so i spent an hour and a half without any success. i tried the support system in the past never with success. i was able to find a way to send the phone back--i have extended warranty from amex. but even if my phone would be fixed, i would still need to buy a new phone for the interim; moreover, i had no reason to believe the problems would be remedied. instead, i decided to take out my frustration by badmouthing nokia every chance i get for the rest of my life. no wonder that every other cell phone company is taking share from incompetent nokia.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 - top smart phone you haven't heard of yet!", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "RZI0EAA8LVE71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone only for a few days now but what a great smartphone! It's actually smaller than an Iphone and has tons of features that actually work. I owned a couple different phones over the last year and I am definitely going to stick with this one for quite awhile. My previous phones were the RAZR V3t which I ended up giving to my wife and my Cect I9+ which is an Iclone but performance-wise is an okay smartphone at best.I wanted a new smartphone not only to replace my cell but to also replace my aging Dell X50v Pocket PC. I feel like this smartphone helps me accomplish those goals. It's pretty fast when it comes to input and using applications. It could be a little faster when switching from portrait to landscape mode. Inputting text with the full QWERTY touch keyboard is pretty fast and easy. Of course you can use the stylus too for writing text as well but I prefer the touch keyboard. I don't have a data plan but I do have a home WiFi network and Wifi at work also. The 5800 found the Wifi signals from home and work easily and once logged into them it's like surfing the web on your home PC except on a much smaller screen! Facebook, Youtube and other websites work and look great on this phone's screen which does pick up a lot of fingerprints but doesn't bother me too much...I'm getting a screen protector and case anyway. Call quality is also very good and the speakers sound really good on calls and when playing music. An 8gb microSD card is already preinstalled and you can expand the memory upto a 16gb microSD. There are a few preloaded apps, games, vids and music. The games are pretty cool--not surprising, remember the N-Gage made by Nokia? A one press media button (located above the screen) pops a menu on the screen for you to quickly select any media you want to access (pics, MP3s, vids, etc.). There are actually 2 cameras--one on the front above the screen can be used for tele-video calls kind of like a web cam. The main camera is a 3.2 megapixel camera with built-in flash which is located on the back used to take digital pics and video. It does a good job good for taking quick snaps when a digital cam is not around but would not replace a higher resolution compact. Pics can be grainy especially indoors and in low-light situations but the flash does help. Recording video is also okay but will not replace a good camcorder.I am contracted with T-mobile as my carrier which this phone is compatible with. I went to several reputable websites (CNET/Gizmodo/Amazon) to compare the ratings on several smartphones. The ones that are getting the most buzz are of course the Iphone, Blackberry Storm, Palm Pre and HTC Magic (soon to be the T-mobile G2). Unfortunately, the Nokia 5800 is kind of under the radar...most likely due to lack of marketing and not being attached to a large carrier like those smartphones are. If you are looking into the smartphone market you should seriously give this one a look at. After looking at reviews and pricing my final selections came down to the 5800 and the HTC touch Diamond/Pro. The HTC Diamond has Windows Mobile 6.1 which I'm used to since I have Windows Mobile (older version) on my Pocket PC while the 5800 does not...But the 5800 has a bigger screen than the Touch Diamond. Most of the other features are the same for both phones. Both are also priced reasonably well for a smartphones of their calibre but the 5800 is a bit less expensive. I've also played around with a family member's Iphone 3G which is also a great smartphone but to get an unlocked version for T-mobile would have costed over $350+ via Ebay. That goes for the other top smartphones. Although I am with T-mobile I wanted to wait for reviews on the G2 which has not been officially released yet in the U.S. The G1 is also a nice phone but I would've had to wait until the end of the year to get my upgrade discount ($400 if bought without the discount). I got the unlocked Nokia for under $250 through Dell with EPP discount, free shipping and a $50 rebate that is available right now. Great value for such a fab smartphone.Some other things worthy of notice are the 5800's neat little phone stand that comes with the package. It lets you prop your phone up on a flat surface so you can watch your videos comfortably. There's also a AV cable (RCA output) so you can watch your videos on TV, headphones and built in GPS (sorry not tested yet but other reviewers say it works well). Definitely overall a wonderful smartphone in nice compact design...highly recommended by this reviewer!", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia Phone from the Dark Knight", "Author": "N.

It regularly told me that I was 300 yards from a turn when I was already in the left turn lane and only 20 feet from the intersection. Suddenly it realized where it was and told me to turn left.In addition, the GPS works much better if it is A-GPS, which uses your phone network as a part of its navigation process.  That uses up valuable minutes on my phone service that I am not interested in donating to AT&T.;  That's especially significant because we want a GPS for long voyages.  You can use it without the A-GPS, but it's not nearly as good.Beyond the GPS, the phone is astonishing.  The screen is gorgeous and watching movies on it is a blast.  It sounds good and it's easy to use.  Others have complained about the interface, but I don't think it's a problem.  If you don't care about the GPS, then buy it in a second.

People tell me they hear quite clearly when I'm speaking but I hear their voices with that slight muted quality that you can get with a GSM phone but conversations are fine. This phone allows you to have Google sync for your contacts and calendar only. It works with the exchange software on the phone and it works flawlessly. Google sync is in beta and as of right now you can't sync gmail. The good news is that you Can use Nokia's mail program to set up your mail to be retrieved on your desired schedule.

It seems to respond better to fingernail taps rather than fingertip taps, but that works better for me anyway.  Double-clicking takes a bit of getting used to but does reduce the amount of fat-fingering and hitting the wrong options.  A lot of the reviews I read online were spent groaning about responsiveness, but I haven't experienced much of that.The music player:  As wonderful as all the other Nokia music players.  Easy to navigate, easy to set up, easy to customize.  Not to mention that transferring the music is a breeze and the Nokia Music Manager seems to compress the files or something because I have loaded 6 hours of music and a full-length movie on and I still have 5GB left.The camera:  Another one the reviews were bashing on.  Gorgeous crystal-clear images come out of this camera every time.  If you set it on all the wrong exposure settings and fiddle with the sharpness/contrast you MIGHT get a bad picture out of this.  Extremely impressive for 3.2MP.I can upload pictures directly to Flickr/Ovi from the gallery- which takes less time than standard MMS.I have been thoroughly enjoying the WLAN on the phone as well.

Seems to work the best that way.I LOVELOVELOVE that the phone extracted all my network settings from my sim!

Camera has a flash and works for night scenes, but the resolution is not that great.  Wi-Fi is automatically scanned just like a laptop does.  Haven't downloaded all the Nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do. Expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to 16 GB.  Great Amazon price, quick shipment, way more positive add ons than the overpriced Iphone.  Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets.  You can also just add AT&T;'s media data plan down the road if you need 24/7 websurfing, think its about $15.

The GPS locationing might take sometime, if no-data plan available, since no AGPS. using build-in GPS to get a lock on location takes about 2-3 mins with good view to the sky. With AGPS, it is instant.Email. It works great with build-in Nokia Messaging. IT's not a PUSH email. You can set the interval of checking. When I am at predefined WIFI coverage, it uses wifi; uses data-plan when I am out of WIFI.Phone just works good, no complaint.EXTRAS out of my expectation.Ovi contact, let you chat to people with google talk client, using wifi or dataplan.Google Maps, no need to say more.Skype, free call over wifi to other skypers.Plan suggestion:For people who hardly uses their voice minutes and needing small data access to check email, Google map where the goodies are, chat with google talk friendI would assume most people who buy this phone doesn't want to pay the combination of data+voice, about 60-70usd/month . I am one of those people. I uses Att prepaid and uses prepaid data when need to, like going to a trip or away email access for days. The data plan offered by ATT which gives you 100MB in 30days costing 20 USD is perfect. On top of all that, you can use the unused prepaid voice credit in your att prepaid account to go toward this data plan.

I have had this phone for a few days now and was going to wait a week to write my review, but I have been so impressed, I just could not wait.Reviews are great, but I always wonder about the reviewer and if we are similar. Here are some of my details just to help inform you. I am 36 and fairly well versed in technology. I use my cell phone as a phone, with occasional photos.I wanted a new phone with: 1) navigation 2) apps for the weather etc, 3) a music player, and 4) wifi.  The Nokia 5800 meets all of these needs.The advantages to this phone are many. I bought this phone to use on my existing phone carrier without extending my contract. Secondly, the (GPS) navigation is free with this phone. My carrier charges 5 dollars a month, that's 60 bucks a year I am saving. I have been told that I can use a 15 dollar data plan with this phone and not a 30 dollar data plan required with all of the carrier's smart phone offerings. You can use your phone without a data plan, I use my wifi at home and work, but the data plan is nice.This is not an iphone clone or \"killer\". The set up is different and according to other reviewers sometimes confusing, I don't think so but again I am somewhat tech savvy. The phone has all the standard phone features expect, calendar, notes, messaging, plus a dictionary and a voice recorder.  I have large thumbs and I am able to use the on-screen qwerty key board with some patience. No physical keyboard on this unit.If you are looking for apps galore, Nokia (symbian) offers fewer than apple and almost every other OS, but it is growing. Some obvious apps are currently missing; Pandora for example. I suspect that with the Symbian OS being a smaller player in the North American that developers are slower to get those apps to market.Pros: cost, free GPS navigation, wifi and size / weightCons: the back cover feels thin and cheap, I worried about breaking it when opening it to put in the battery. The touch screen could be more responsive, but with a little practice I am getting better.ALL in all I would have to say this is a great phone! 5 out of 5 stars.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really good phone!", "Author": "Eric M.

I personally use this phone with AT&T; network, a Go phone account in fact, so you can imagine that having the Wifi is a great feature for me since I don't have an unlimited data plan. I use the phone a lot to make long distance calls through skype with the program Nimbuzz and I have to say that it's excellent. Streaming videos live through Qik is also very cool. It has a good variety of apps.As for cons, well I find it a bit unstable sometimes and I've had to reset it to factory settings twice cause certain features like the camera and music become unaccessible, and I don't even tinker with it much like some do by installing apps from other sites other than the store or installing custom firmware. This is my first touchscreen phone so I can't really judge too much the keypad but it has full qwerty and I've found it a bit of a challenge to get used to. Depending on how precise I am, sometimes I write pretty fast (Only a tad faster than T9 with predictive text) and sometimes I struggle a bit. I love the music player, and the camera and video recording capabilities are awesome. Also, the browser is more than decent, pretty speedy and you can also use Opera mobile 10 (not opera mini) which feels like a more full fledged browser than Opera mini and is also quite fast. Youtube works great, and so does google maps and GPS. Though I suggest you use Nokia maps, that way you can download the maps of your area and install them and avoid data usage, which is great for me.

Despite the fact you can buy the dual sim card iphone fake in chinatown across the river was not an option. Also when I do my international travel I can switch in my sim card and use the same phone.I must say I have discovered so many nice tricks and features with this phone the more I explore it. I love  the fact that you can put 5 of your closest contacts images on the main frame and simply press the pic to call, text etc. I also assigned a ring tone to every person. Phone call quality is awesome no one has ever complained they could not hear me and vice versa. The volume I wished was a tad louder but that is being picky. I love the headphones with the music controls there so you can ff or rew or even while listening to music you can get a call and the phone automatically turns off the music until you end the call.I love the GPS as well as the dictionary. I am a traveler and I do a lot of crosswords on my travel time so having the dictionary was a nice discovery. The versatility of the keyboard for tap, plectrum, mini, full qwerty as well as the handwriting makes writing notes or texting convenient.There is even copy, cut and paste. I was able to record a phonecall for a return of a product so that if they said I did not call i can play the conversation as my proof. I have used both cameras and the picture quality is great, the video feature is awesome as well. I was able to assign a picture to most of my contacts from my pc as well using the very versatile Nokia PC Suite. The ability to simply drag and drop any file including my music has really made a difference. I also love the fact that on the phone you can edit your pics just like you would do on coreldraw or any graphic program. I have added talk bubbles and  designs to some of the pics. You should see the one I did with my ex hehehehe!!! Thankfully Amazon not only gave us the rebate( which I am yet to receive) but the videoondemand 50 credit. I have so far bought mall cop and night at the museum pt 1 and downloaded to my phone. I watched them recently waiting for my delayed flight last week using the nice stand that they gave me to hold the phone landscape style.The graphics on this phone is awesome the speakers are adequate and loud. When I hooked the tv out cables from the phone to the tv it actually worked!!!! I was able to see slideshows of my pics on the phone as well as anything I did with the phone. This phone is awesome. I did play the tactile games, guitarrock, bounce and car racing cute but I am not a gaming person but they did keep me entertained. Goshhhhhh there are so many other things on this phone but I will end on the music. I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO love this phone for the music. I downloaded album art and 578 songs so far including my personal cds and I am loving it. I have not been using my IPOD recently because I have the same songs, pics etc on this phone which is really neat. I am really happy with my purchase but I wished the dialer had alphanumeric keys I wanted to call 1800 flowers and I had to call someone to ask them to look at their phone and tell me the numbers for flowers which SUCKED!!! Otherwise I have not found anything bad with it.

The phone is a touch phone that comes with a little stylus, which is lost easily but very cheap and easy to replace if you buy spares on eBay.  I barely use the stylus because I find it annoying, but when you want to press a smaller detail on the phone it's good to have. The display sort of looks like a wanna be iphone, and it responds fairly well to commands. The camera is nice and the video records fairly clear which is also nice.I have had to send mine in for service twice since I bought it, the first time for them to tighten the seams around when the phone locks and unlocks (it is a little switch that you push up to lock or unlock, which I find annoying and looks like it might break if you accidently push it too hard) which were coming loose, and the second time because my screen went black.  While this was annoying, the good thing was that it happened within the warranty period so the fixed it for free both times.  If you think somethign (and I mean anything)is wrong with the phone, call Nokia right away and don't linger until your warranty expires or else the won't fix it for free.The Bad-The phone is a fingerprint magnet and you will be constantly wiping-The screen is sort of plasticity feeling and not as nice as other touch screens-The phone is too thick, and if you get a cover(which you do need) it gets even thicker-The stylus is annoying and is easily lost-The graphics mess-up and freeze all the time, sometimes distort and you have to lock and unlock, or even reset in extreme cases, to fix them-Every couple of months the phone will get stuck and vibrate uncontrollably, you'll need to reset it to fix-It can sometimes get confused with orientation and won't known whether to be vertical or horizontal when you text-The setting take a little while to figure outThe Good-The phone is the nicest touch phone you'll find at such a low price-The customer service is helpful-It is very resilient for a touch phone and has withstood many falls and bangs (in part thanks to the case)-It seems like it will last you a couple years-It's a nice phone for someone on a budget who wants to get something a little nicer than a basic phone-You can browse the internet-You can download some apps and different features-I have never seen anyone else with the same phone at least here in Florida, and it seems to be a little more uncommon in the US, so you'll probably be the only person you know that owns one (which can be a good or a bad thing I guess)In conclusionIf you want a nice not too expensive touch phone, with some web capability get this phone, but if you're looking for and iphone or Android substitute look elsewhere.

Prior to the Nokia 5800 I had an old Nokia from 2005. I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function). After a year and a half, the results are mixed.The video cam is convenient to use but the results are just ok. In broad daylight the picture is clear. But in any other lighting condition degradation is rapid. Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input. This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth.The audio quality of the phone is pretty good. The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal, so I just turn off the auto-turn feature. Unfortunately there is no option to switch. Either it is stationary or it turns eratically on its own.With the updates the phone functions a little smoother. Originally there is the full/mini QWERTY keyboard along with handwriting, now with the update there is an alphanumeric keypad.

This item came up at the top of the list at the price range I was looking for. That is one of the best features with Amazon in my opinion.Boy, I am not at all dissapointed. This is simply the best phone I've ever had or that I've ever seen. It does everything I could ask for in a phone, and it is totally useable as an Internet device. It is small enough to carry on your hip, less than 1/2 inch taller than a closed Razr V3, yet large enough to read a book or a web page pretty easily. And of course you can turn the phone for a landscape view. Plus, it is light as a feather as compared to an HTC for example.I have it set up to ask me what network I want to use everytime I access the browser. That way, I can use WiFi whenever it is availabe. I switched from T-Mobile prepay to AT&T; prepay so I could get the monthly data package of 100mb for $[...]. This works perfectly for me. From what I've read, I can re-fill the data package for $[...] each month for 1mb and roll over the unused data. I also pay an additional $[...] per month for 200 text messages since AT&T; charges .20 per text. And, at $.[...] a call, I just try to avoid the voice and send email or texts. The $[...] prepay re-fill will last a year and each of these monthly items get deducted from my prepay balance, along with the phone minutes. I really don't use the phone very much, and I would usually get away with about $[...] per month on T-Mobile. With the AT&T; data plan and texting, I figure it should be closer to $[...] per month. Not a bad deal compared to the T-Mobile minimum unlimited data plan at $[...]/mo plus $.[...] per call, or AT&T;/T-Mobile @ $[...]/mo plus outrageous taxes for calls and data.The big plus is that this phone is DESIGNED to be used unlocked from any carrier. Unlike the Blackberry, where you have to figure out ways to bypass their network, the Nokia 5800 Xpressmusic sets you up to avoid the carrier and tries to warn you as much as possible that you may incur data charges.

I did not think I could go a couple of weeks without my phone so I bought another. I keep a Nokia N75 for backup but it was driving me crazy thinking I would have to use it for weeks; I use my phone way too much and have become quite addicted to the touch screen. I was having trouble making a purchase on the Nokia website so I decided to try Amazon. So far, I cannot complain, it was brand new, straight out of the box. Shipped on time and got it the day quoted on the site. Both of my phones work perfectly, though I have heard horror stories about the 5800 I cannot add to or corroborate them. I have only ever owned Nokia for myself but I have purchased other brands for family members and have heard more negative things about them than I have about Nokia. This phone does everything I want it to do and more. The only thing lacking in the phone I purchased here was no music stand, no $50 gift card from Amazon and no car charger. The original phone came with all three because they were promotional items for the first release of the phone. I would have loved the gift card but I can live without it, I still have the music stand from the first phone and do not really use it, and as for the car charger, I only need one. It is a great phone; then again, I am a huge fan of the Nokia brand. Nokia customer service is lacking but they usually hit the nail on the head with their phones. The 5800 is not too big and it is not too little, easy to navigate through shortcuts and menus. The camera is great and takes good pictures, the screen is gorgeous and looks nice when surfing the web. I have a 16 GB memory card so I have more than enough memory for whatever I want to store on it. My battery life is ok; I listen to music all day on stereo bluetooth, so I really give it a work out and have to keep it charged.

On top of that great deal, I am going to send my phone to Nokia Trade Up For Cash program, which means overall I have spent $200 on this really cool phone.I had Nokias my whole cell phone history and last year got a Motorola. I really did like my Z9 but it was almost obsolete from day 1 (but I really don't have anything bad to say about it, it was a good phone.) I missed Nokia with their simple menus and excellent quality.To be honest, the menus are no longer simple and sometimes seem counterintuitive LOL. And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone). The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though. And my learning curve is getting better with touch, so I don't see it being a problem after a while. I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes. The Music Player is the bomb! Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity. It sounds amazing. I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch.The screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well. I have my music transferred, my contacts transferred and am very happy. I like the compact size and heft of the phone. I don't like lightweight feeling phones. The camera seems fine to me. The battery life does seem to be on the shorter side but make sure you close web applications after use. The phone does so much that you can dejuice it quickly. My Touch does the same thing.Nokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the Music Store available for the US! Also if you message the downloads to yourself it is a pain, so it is better to download on the phone direct from the store. The App selection bites though, but that's what my ipod is for. The thrill of app-ness dies down anyway, so it's not really a big deal, but not having music store access is just silly.Otherwise this phone is very competitive to iPhone. Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory. I love my Touch of course but I got an 8g and I'm maxed out with music and apps and now I can't do anything to it unless I get rid of stuff. That kinda bites. So the 5800 has a true edge there.I already had AT&T; and it was no problem to pop my SIM card in the phone and move right along. I had everything except the TV out cord and the stand which it appears on the website that they do not sell that in the package anymore so that is more Amazon's fault for not upgrading the info, but I don't really need the stand or cord. The USB cord is entirely too short. The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice. Of course the charger is included and is acceptable. It easily connected with my internet, easily paired with my bluetooth, and once I finally figured out how to transfer music from my ipod to it, there were no problems there.I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone.PS I LOL at 8g holding 6000 songs. Maybe 6000 ringtone sound bytes. 8g will net you between 600-800 average songs....", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "I'm sooo happy with this phone", "Author": "O.

What I would want to share is that I'm very happy with this phone. I've been using it for about over a month and I'm so happy with it.The QWERTY (normal one) works excellent, the hand written function is also VERY useful. Calling people or sending text messages is so simple (the usage of the phone book is so simple). You can get cool free apps at the OVI store. Radio work great. Music player works great. Video also awesome. The GPS at firs did take about 20 min. to hookup with sat link, but after that, it work perfect (using the nokia maps app) with no kind of internet connection or aditional service fee. I have 0 complains (up till now) about this phone. The only problem that I did encounter was (not directly with the phone) that in the description of the product (when I got it) it said that in the box was the data cable, hands-free earphones, charger, tv-out cable, stand, and stylus pen. Well the stand and the tv-out cable were not in the box. The stand I don't really need, but the cable is something that can be useful. But anyways, got this sorted out and now all is well and good.And just to close, (because a lot of friends asked me about this) I've used iPhones before, and I won't say it's better or worst than an iPhone, but that it is a great alternative to it.

I like the design, specs, it has keyboards!!! but is too expensive. Really is too much pay almost USD600 for that phone.

The movies and videos looks awesome.-A lot off apps in Ovi Store-The phone is fast, even with the 16gb microSD.

Overall, I feel it has the potential to be better than the iPhone or any other touch screen phone on the market today. The phone does, however, have a few drawbacks. For one, the phone does not have multi-touch. It has been demonstrated that the Nokia 5800 can utilize multi-touch and maybe we will see it in future Symbian OS releases, but that is one thing that is currently lacking. Additionally, there is limited application support for the new S60 5th edition. I have looked long and hard and found very few applications that are compatible. This will, of course, change in the future as more developers start work on this new OS but right now that is another major drawback. Aside from that, however, the phone is light, has very high screen resolution and has a built in accelerometer. It comes with an 8gb microSD card so you never run out of space for music and videos, and it has 3G and wi-fi so you're always connected at the speed of technology.

It's far better than buttons. Just touch what you want to do.- This phone is very responsive. Nokia has always proved that the S60 based OS used on higher-end phones does not need high horsepower. If you feel your phone sluggish, check for open apps... they do NOT close by clicking the red \"End\" button anymore... go to Options-Exit.- the full sized QWERTY on screen keyboard is great, but some people will still preffer the standard predictive text input.- Finally, a phone I can hear across my house when someone is calling... music is pretty loud at max volume, and not distorted. Great stereo speakers.- Included 8GB microSD card. Nice.Cons:- as stated, the screen tends to flip \"accidentally\" from time to time. It's annoying, but can be tweaked under configuration, to have it be less sensible.- Contacts screen. You have to \"Enter\" a contact to see their phone number.

After months of deciding on IPhone or something different, I came to the conclusion that the missing features of the Iphone were too much for me.  I needed multi-media messaging, video recording capabilities and a better camera.  I also wanted the ability to change batteries at some point as I've had bad luck with devices that had built in batteries.  So I ruled out Iphone and went on a search for the perfect phone.  While I can easily say that there is no such thing as a perfect phone, the Nokia 5800 comes close.  I was going to wait until the N97 was released but the $600 or $700 price tag was too much to take.  I ended up buying the 5800 from Amazon at a reasonable $302 which was the same cost as the 16gb Iphone minus the 2 year contract.What I like about the phone:1. It has everything I need that the Iphone was missing including very good video recording capabilities.2. The Bluetooth works well with my car and head set.  No difference in sound and everything is very clear.3. Music Player is clean and clear but it could be a bit louder.4. Web browsing works well although not as smooth as the Iphone5. Flash support!!!!  Yes, you can watch youtube videos on it6. Amazon On Demand $50 gift certificate - While I don't see myself using the phone to watch movies, this was a nice treat and it looks very sharp on the screen7. Battery life is great compared to other phones that have these features and can be replaced8. Access to any type of e-mail including Exchange support9. The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers!)10. Ability to use apps such as QIK which allows you to stream video for live sharing (very cool feature)11. Customer support from Nokia has been top notch for me12. Expandable memory - comes with 8GB card and I expanded it to 16GB.  I've heard through the grapevine that it can also handle the new 32gb SD cards that just came outLast but definitely not least13.  Multi tasking!  Listen to music while tracking your fitness and browsing the web.  No problem....well except for the actual working out part!What I think needs improvement1.  Camera takes incredible pictures in bright light but is brutal in low light situations.  Supposedly firmware V.21 helps this problem but it is not available in the U.S. yet2.  Limited Apps available compared to Iphone.  Not a big deal but it would be nice if Nokia can get their App store up and running beyond the limited themes and music tones out there right now3.  Firmware Updates - U.S. versions seem to be last on the list since no major carriers over here carry this phone.  Waiting for V.21......4.  Touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for sensitivity5.  There is a learning curve for the Symbian software that runs the phone - Not as intuitive as the Iphone but once you get the hang of it is not too bad6.  Web browser - yes, it is one of the things I like but it also has some flaws with navigation.  Iphone got this one right and no one else has gotten closeOverall, in my opinion, this is one of the best phones on the market under $400.  I think the N97 coming out will be the king of phones but I doubt it will break into any major U.S providers since it would compete directly with Iphone, Storm, Pre, etc...  It's too bad for Nokia that they are left out and that means too bad for U.S owners of their phones since we get all the newest firmware releases last (if at all).  I don't see myself changing phones anytime soon as the 5800 seems to have everything I need for now.  Maybe if 4G or 5G or whatever is next on the horizon becomes available, I will consider changing.  For now, this is my choice.*****Update May 27, 2009*******Great news!!

The installs were always hit or miss and I could never tell if the app was compatible with the 5800.Now, with the new app store, I feel like the one thing missing has been fixed.  The number of apps seems to be very large upon the initial opening.  I heard that something like 20,000 apps were supposed to be released on launch day but there is no easy way to know how many are really out there.Prices seem a little bit higher than the IPhone store.  There are a good amount of free apps but the ones that cost money seem to range anywhere from $2.99 to $20.You can either shop the store on your computer and send a text link to you device or you can download the OVI app which will automatically connect you to the app store.Hopefully the amount of GOOD apps that are released will increase fast now that the store is open.  In my mind, the only benefit of the IPhone was the apps...but that it now in the past.Oh, and it seems like us U.S owners are getting abit more support.  The App updater works now and I was able to update to the newest version of Flash Lite which could only be done in the past through firmware updates. And speaking of firmware, I haven't checked to see if V.21 is available in the U.S. yet but tech support seemed to goof up a bit last week when they told me to download it to fix a minor issue I was having.  When I told them I couldn't see the update, they quickly corrected themselves and told me to keep checking.  So hopefully any day now!!Finally, I love this phone so much that I just picked up a second one for my wife.  With the $50 rebate, that puts the price to below $300 which is just amazing compared to what the IPhone would cost coupled with PDA monthly data charges. The 5800 is the winner.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Happy with the on-time delivery", "Author": "pratibha sachin", "ReviewID": "R1I0TJD1F6AI7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was in a good condition and seemed to be brand new.

Maps can be downloaded and saved to the phone for free and works with the built in GPS so no need to download maps on the go and use a data plan (as is the case with android and iPhone).-Good music player that works with standard 3.5 mm headphones.-Good browsing experience with opera.-It is probably the only smart phone that works with Rogers Wireless unlimited Browsing plan for $10 a month as of this writing. Other smart phones require a data plan and will cost you much more.-The price of the phone is really good compared to the competition.-The camera quality is not that great. Do not expect it to replace your digital camera.-I am very happy with it in general (for what I need to do with my cell phone). I am giving it a 4-star because I think it could have been better and faster.You have to understand this is not an iPhone, it's not as fast or powerful and it does not have all the bells and whistles of the iPhone. If you want an iPhone just go ahead and get one, but if you care less about the games and cool stuff and are more of a practical person that needs the GPS navigation software and the unlimited browsing.

The free navigation and 8gb card were a plus. I haven't actually tried the navigation yet.It was really easy to put my SIM card in this phone, there's a slot right next to the memory card slot on the left side of the phone (instead of having it under the battery like in a lot of other phones). The memory card is a little difficult to get out.I watched some reviews on youtube before I bought this and I was a little worried about getting it because in the videos, there seemed to be a big lag between when they pushed a button and when something opened, or when they flipped the phone it would turn black for a couple seconds before flipping the screen. Also, they were having problems getting some of the buttons to work, especially the xpressmusic button above the screen. But, I haven't had any problems at all with any of the buttons and there is a slight lag when flipping the screen, but it's usually less than a second, so it's not really a problem at all. I'm not sure if the lag depends on how loaded your phone is with music and other files, though.I bought this phone used and the person who had it before me didn't delete any of their texts, contacts, pictures, or music from it. So I had to go through and delete everything when I first got it. I was hoping there would be a \"delete all\" button for text and contacts, but I couldn't find one.I like the xpressmusic button above the screen and the 4 favorite contacts on the main screen. It makes everything really convenient. There is also a (tiny) clock/alarm button on the top right corner of the screen, so you can set your alarm clock pretty quickly.The alarm clock doesn't work as good as the one on my last phone did. You can set the snooze for a certain number of minutes, but you can't choose how many times it will repeat. I usually get woken up by the first alarm, but either sleep through the rest of them, or it doesn't always repeat at the correct intervals or something. It automatically makes your alarm tone ascend, which is nice at first, but it keeps ascending for like 5-10 seconds and ends up being REALLY loud. I can't find any setting to change that or to adjust the volume of the alarm. Also, it vibrates every 2 or 3 seconds the entire time the alarm goes off. That wakes me up more than anything, because it's annoying. You might be able to change that setting in the ringer profile (the phone's ringer also vibrates/pulses unless you change the setting).Texting is nice with this phone. The other phones I've had were just the normal number keypad, so this is definitely a step up. It's a lot easier to type if your nails are a little long. Also, I like that my inbox doesn't fill up and stop letting in new texts (hasn't yet anyway). The screen is black and text is white, so that's easier on your eyes if you're in a dark room too.I haven't tried any of the applications other than the camera. It takes pretty good pictures sometimes, depending on the lighting. It does have a flash, which is nice, but it's LED, so it doesn't really give you the best looking pictures. Daylight pictures look pretty good for a camera phone. I put some pictures I have taken with my other camera on the memory card and they look great on the screen and are really clear.You can chose any of the songs on your phone as ringtones, alarm tones, or even text tones. I did end up using one as a text tone too, because it basically didn't come with any good options for that. If you don't shorten it, it will play the whole song though.The music player is nice. The speakers are pretty good, the only problem is that it rattles if there's any bass at all in the song. Even just normal bass guitar or synth bass, not just bass boost. Everything else sounds nice and clear.I have a Mac, so the software that it came with for loading music on your phone wouldn't have worked for me, but I just made a folder on the memory card and dragged songs into it. They won't show up in the music player until you click \"Options\" and \"Refresh Library\".Pros:xpressmusic buttonFavorite contactsPretty good pictures and video (sometimes)Really nice screen for viewing photos/videosQWERTY keyboardTouch screen feels/works greatMusic playerMusic tones8GB cardCons:No delete all button for texts and contactsAlarm clock settingsUPDATE: I did end up finding how to change the settings on the alarm clock to turn vibrate off. I can't find it now to write instructions though. Also, apparently the snooze (when set at 5 minute intervals) goes off for 25 minutes before it stops.One major con about this phone (really the only problem other than having to individualy delete items) is what, I believe some other people have said on here... At one point (so far, I guess it does this in intervals, though) it stopped sending texts that I was trying to send, they would immediately go to the outbox and not attempt to send. I could still receive texts. Then the whole phone froze, I couldn't even turn it off. Eventually, I took out the battery and turned it back on and my inbox was cleared. Then I looked around online and saw that there's a code that you have to use to reset your phone to get it working properly again (which erases your contacts too, so write them down). I don't remember what the code is, but I'm sure someone posted it. I still like this phone a lot and since I reset it, it's froze a couple times, but I turned it off and back on and it was fine.Also, since other people have said that they don't like the touch screen, just saying that I really like it. I've tried a couple of my brother's phones and his are harder to control with scrolling, swiping, and accidently clicking things. The touch screen on this is a lot easier to handle and you can change the settings to adjust the intensity of the slight vibrate that it does when you push buttons.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 A practical phone", "Author": "J.

I would have to say that i really do like this phone. I was really impressed with amazon shipping, it came right on time!! Whats great about this phone is the touch screen is really user friendly. I love the thing where it has the icons of your favorite contacts on the home screen (it accomodates for way more than 4 i think i have 7 at the moment. I like the fact that it has a gps but you cant really use it unless you have 3g or your at home or something. I like the fact that it has the button for the xpress music it has great shortcuts. One thing i dont like about this phone is the fact that so far i have not found a way to but a security code on it (im paranoid about loosing my phone and have someone go through it). I dont like how you have to press the button like 3 time for it to actually start calling the contact. I dont like how it doesnt change very well from landscape to portrait, i end up having to do it landscape alot of the time when i want it portriat. Alot of features are kinda hard to access so you have to read to find out, you cant just pick up the phone and know. I still havent been able to find out how to send a song or picture through bluetooth, but im sure ill find out. Anyway, ill give an update later about how this all turns out but i really do think the phone is worth the money it may have some annoying aspects about it but you wont find a phone with all these features for that kind of price so if you want a nice phone and dont have a very large budget i would suggest this phone.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Osvaldo Vindas", "ReviewID": "R2JIHWHJ6TBDOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very satisfied with the product, excellent sign, sound and video.

A few quirks", "Author": "Leblon Lad \"Brave Musketeer\"", "ReviewID": "R1FVBZ6GGTTRFW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review amended Nov. 2010After 6 months of use this is how I view the 5800 XpressMusic now.Pros:The 5800 ExpressMusic is a very adequate 3G phone.  The touchscreen is smooth, both the touchscreen and soft keypad are very responsive. It hold a lot of media in it's external micro-SD card (up to a 16gb microSD now).  The sound volume is good using it's internal speakers and with both wired and wireless headsets.  It pairs easily with multiple bluetooth devices. It picks up wi-fi connections quickly and connects to the available wi-fi router in a reasonable amount of time.  The software is intuitive and things are where you expect them to be.Cons:The camera takes somewhat good pictures, especially with the flash. The camera does have focus problems in low and excessively bright light. When I say focus problem, I'm not intimating that the pictures are blurry or look like you are taking pictures under water, but that they are not sharp.  This could be called \"soft\" focus.  The video camera takes video, not particularly sharp video, but it adequately gives you decent video images.  The camera/video part of this phone is not equivalent to a stand-alone camera, like my Panasonic Lumix. It won't fast focus or quickly adjust to changes in available light.The 5800's GPS is a real GPS, but that said, it takes a long time to link to enough satellites to actually see your position on the provided maps.  The free maps are very good, once they appear.  I sat with the Nokia GPS and my Tom Tom 340XL under a cloudless sky and started both searching for satellites at the same time. The TomTom connected and found itself in less than a minute, the Nokia GPS took almost 4 minutes to come alive.  Once it did connect it did function as well as the TomTom, with respect to showing the relative position.  As I use the GPSs primarily for location while walking and I don't drive, I can't describe it's performance in an automobile.The screen of the 5800 while not distorted as intimated in a previous review, is slightly wavy, but not in any way unpleasant to view.  I don't find this waviness to be a problem.  What I do find to be a screen problem is its tendency to be a fingerprint magnet.  I spend a lot of time wiping the screen on my shirt to get rid of the latent fingerprints.  The FBI would love this phone if it could suck fingerprints from an adjacent surface.  I have the same fingerprint problem with my Compaq 931 laptop, but I don't get fingerprints on its screen as often as with the 5800.The last con I want to bring up is the battery life.  The 5800 does have an auto-shutdown feature which shuts off the screen and asks you to push the unlock lever on the side to restore the screen.  The problem with the auto-shut off feature appears to be, that the screen goes off as it should, but if I leave the camera function on and then while the screen shuts down, it does not shut down the camera and the battery continues to be depleted as if the screen was on and I was using the camera.  The same appears to happen if I leave the video player on and let the phone go into auto-shutdown mode.  I would hope that Nokia would address this in a future update, but they may not be aware that it is a problem.With consideration of all of the above, would I still buy this camera if I had it to do all over again?  Yes, I would and knowing what has been presented here, and in other reviews for the price, I would recommend the phone to others who are considering it vs. other 3G phones.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love my Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Anime Freak!\"", "ReviewID": "R21EV1YFPV0L17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love, love this phone....couldn't afford the iphone so guess what the next bestest thing is?.......My nokia 5800 xpress music phone!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 XpressMusic", "Author": "Edson B.

This is not an iphone so don't expect the features of an iphone. The Name Nokia itself gives you the assurance that the phone has to be a good quality and it is.

There is Nokia OVI Maps built in which gives you access to maps anytime even if your phone is not connected to internet. You have to go online and download the maps for your state that you want. It does have one month of GPS included. The touch screen is not bad, but you sometimes have to use the tip of your finger as the area to touch are small. Once you get the phone you have to update the software or else you will be having weaker scrolling and weaker touch sensitivity. The update wasn't easy as the settings were all incorrect. I had to Google the right settings before i was able to update. The calendar is a good feature, but it looks like a weaker calendar compared to the previous versions of this phone. The screen lock feature is great as it is on the side of the phone. The phone is not really thin as it should be. It does not have keyboards so you would expect it to be thinner. The Sim card is very hard to remove as you have to remove the battery. The memory card is very difficult to remove as well. The music player is great. The thing that i hate about this phone is while you are talking on the phone to a customer service and they ask you to press 1 for yes or 2 for no, you don't have keypad to enter that. You have to go to options and open dialer to enter this. This makes it difficult while dialing any customer service numbers.

Too many double or triple clicks to do stuff.4. Crappy camera. Come'on Nokia you are supposed to be the phone camera kings! In good sunlight the pictures actually come out pretty nice, otherwise they are awful but you can tweak them on Photoshop or other program.5. I haven't been able to work the GPS, always says satellite signal is low, even on open air fields. However, I dont care about GPS but other people do.6. Manual that comes with the phone is awful. Had to go to the web to search for a lot of \"how to\" stuff.7. They should include PC Suite or enable Outlook syncrhonization with the included Ovi Suite.Hope this review helps someone!", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 XM US version", "Author": "Ruben", "ReviewID": "R2ZIUJO2BST2XD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Al momento de comprarlo, no me fije que era la version america, sin embargo no he tenido problema usandolo en venezuela con la operadora digitel, la conexion de datos es rapida, el wifi y gps excelente, la camara un poco decepcionante al principio, ya que tomaba fotos blanquecinas, pero esto cambio totalmente cuando se actualizo el firmware del equipo, mejorando mucho la camara.otro punto debil del movil es la duracion de la bateria cuando utilizas el wifi, se consume rapidamente, del resto dura entre 1 y 2 dias.es rapido y la intefaz es muy intuitiva, el touch es muy bueno, la pantalla insuperable...lo recomiendo ampliamente, solo lo cambiaria por un nokia n900 ja ja ja!!!.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mr.T", "Author": "Thiago FS \"Mr.T\"", "ReviewID": "RODK2XD27QFVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "well...i just got this sweet phone from amazon a couple of weeks ago, and is a very good phone, it has nice features, the image is good, camera is good, touch screen is not as sensitive as the iphone, but is very good also...anyway is a good phone, i rather nokia than iphone anyway, nokia is tougher.the only problem that i had with is that the speakers is not that good....when you put a music with some boom boom like hip-hop and the volume is at his maximum it get a lil distortion, its noticible when you put the speakers at max volume.but thats the only problem...witch is not even a problem, if you want to listen to loud music buy a boom-box.by the way....the volume with the headphones on is loud and good.so if you where like me, allways with a mobile and an ipod, just buy the nokia 5800 express music.you gonna like it.  thanks for reading, i hope it helps.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCc", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not what I had expected", "Author": "Sargra \"Sargra\"", "ReviewID": "R1A59N4XV5D215", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had upgraded the micro SD card from a 8 gig to a 16 gig.

First, I normally would not buy a Nokia - I am a Sony Ericsson fan. However, I needed a quad-band  phone for a trip to Europe and I wanted a touch phone. The SE Satio has been released, but not in the USA and it is pricey.  So I went with the Nokia. I love the look and feel of the phone.  I have had absolutely no problems - no screen freezing and battery life has been very very good.  The battery charges quickly. It is easy to lock and unlock the phone manually.  There is an automatic lock feature which you can disable or set a longer time before it automatically locks.  Calls are easy and call quality is great.  A prior reviewer said it is to hard to make a call, but I do not find that to be the case. You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number. I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great.  I am not a big web user but it connects quickly.  I have not tried the GPS yet. I do have to say the camera is not so great, so if you are looking for a good camera phone I would not buy this phone.  Also, I do not know why the phone icon is found in applications and not on the main menu (maybe I can change that). I am still learning to use all of the many features this phone has to offer.

While i wasnt exactly looking for a touchscreen phone, i am not unhappy that i got one. While i can only base it on what i have read, it seems far superior to the iPhone in many ways.

Unbelievable improvement difference compared to my old Nokia 6300.-Can Multitask (Listen to music and surf the net at the same time)-3G and GSM-Integrated GPS Antenna (GPS can be used totally offline with OVIMaps without needing to download data, Free to use, free updates, directions with street names via update)-The GPS is fantastic, clear precise instructions and you can even record your own voice using OVIvoice from Nokia-Comes with two pointing devices (Stylus and Plectrum)-Input by Stylus, Plectrum or Finger, also has handwriting recognition.-Brilliant High Resolution Screen (Great for watching dvd's)-Stereo Speakers with great sound-TV Out cable can be purchased to connect to a tv-8gb Micro SC Included (expandable to 16gb)-iTunes is not required (I can connect to a pc as a storage device and download files as normal with no other software required)-Came with a music download voucher-Great battery (which can be changed by the user)-3.2mp camera with dual flash-Video recording using flash as light-standard 3.5mm headphone socket-wifi-many free applications are available on the net-Its a NokiaCons - Phone-----No Countdown Timer (This was my most used app on my old Nokia 6300, But i downloaded Eggtimer free from the OVI store and have a timer now)-Touchscreen (still not a fan of the touchscreen phones, can't beat and old fashioned keyboard)-No reminder calendar item. To set a reminder i have to make a meeting. This was something i used often.-Birthday reminders do not display the age, only the since date.Cons - Supporting Software-----Ovi Suite (The original Nokia Data Suite was very buggy when it came out, but its now a very good application. Ovi Suite is no different, very buggy. They have made it look all pretty without the trusty reliability of the old DataSuite)-Ovimusic is just plain annoying. If you have it installed and want to download music from the html page, you can't. When you visit [...] etc, It automatically opens OVImusic. I had so much trouble with OVImusic, i couldnt sign up, couldn't login, couldnt search properly. DO NOT install OviMusic, do yourself a favour, sign in to the html page and download through your browser!-Map upgrading problems in OviSuite(I tried four times before i was able to update my maps for Australia, Three times i had an Internal Server Error). Nokia needs to offer a link to download and install offline and i am sure these problems would be avoided.IMO Nokia should dump Ovimusic and Ovisuite and stay with the Datasuite.UPDATE------After using the phone for about 2 months. My opinion of the phone has not changed. It is a great phone and does so many things that others don't.There are a few things though that have come to my attention.Pros- I just downloaded a voice update for the gps and got the English with Street Names update. Now the GPS not only gives directions but also states the street names. Getting this phone was the best thing i ever did. The GPS alone is worth the cost.- I have found information online to be able to change the font in the phone and use true type or open type fonts. Currently i use Bauhaus as my screen font. I had a bit of playing around with different types. Some were too small, some too large and on some not all the characters displayed (but that might be because the font doesnt have a complete set of glyphs).- I can't state enough how impressive the GPS is. I use it all the time, its very accurate and fast to get the satellites. My old GPS took about 2 minutes to get the satellites.- I have compressed some movies down to about 500mb in mp4 format. The display is unbelievable, the movies are crystal clear and the stereo sound is fantastic.Cons- I have found that writing sms's are not as convenient as my old Nokia 6300 because there is no predictive text facility.- A few times the phone has frozen, requiring me to take the battery out to turn it off. It then ran fine though. I think an update to the latest software might help. I am at least one version behind.- The strap for the plectrum keeps coming out. I have just taken it off as i am using the stylus more anyway.- With use the stylus no longer holds firmly in the phone cover.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 XpressMusic", "Author": "John Splain", "ReviewID": "R1K724WXFRQIEI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I resently purchased the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic from TigerDirect through Amazon, BIG MISTAKE.

As such a software / firmware upgrade will not allow the phone to support any additional features and language packs. If the phone does not have the language already installed then unfortunately you will not be able to use the language in the phone.

My phone is broken in thirty some days. The phone won't power on. Before sending it to Nokia repair center, I tried to find a local Nokia care point. Couldn't find one online. Emailed Nokia about it, received totally irrelevant response with unwanted advice. The repair center mailed back my phone the same day it received it. The phone was in exactly the same condition after charging. In the letter came with the phone, they give me an no existing web site to flash my phone. I called the repair center explained my situation, the first agent said another agent will call me back in one hour. After four hours and 2 emails, still no response. I called again, the second agent asked their supervisor and told me that they will try to diagnosis the problem and call back in \"24 business hours\" (meaning three business days). They don't want me to ship back the useless phone right away. I asked for an extension number so I can call back if I don't hear from them after three more days. She offers none. To contact them, you just have to go through all the options to get a different agent every time.Dec.5, 2009 Update:My phone took second trip to Nokia repair center and came back still not working! I called three times since last Thursday,when I received my phone. Each time, their call center agent just telling me a specialist will call back within \"24 to 40 business hours\". How absurd! Why not just saying within a week? I was able to use this $300 phone for only four weeks and spend three weeks to repair this phone.

I had trouble sending texts initially, but after going through some fixes on the Nokia user forum I got that solved (it had to do with message center settings).One of my favorite features is the music player.  It has freed me from my iPod.  Uploading and playing music is easy and intuitive.  The camera is nice but I don't ask much of it.  The GPS feature is really cool but it takes a long time to find satellites.  It's only really useful if you're in network range although you can get a GPS fix when out of range.  If you leave the GPS function running by accident though it seems to drain the battery quickly.  Speaking of the battery though, I've found the battery to last quite a long time otherwise though. Several days with normal phone use and music playing.  The computer interface is easy.One other minor negative is that it seems the screen can be scratched easily.  Be careful.I'd definitely buy this phone again and recommend it to others who are not afraid of solving minor tech issues.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "As described", "Author": "R.

They had low end phones, high end phones. Even Neo rocked a Nokia in The Matrix. Back then, firmware updates were uncommon, data usage and 3rd party applications were either unheard of, or the exclusive domain of the power user.Palm moved in, and Nokia managed to keep pace, Windows Mobile moved in, and Nokia struggled. The iPhone was released, and Nokia was nearly obliterated in the high-end phone field.They're trying, in a way best likened to a drowning person. There is a lot of splashing and flailing, but very little swimming happening. Further, if you get too close to them, they'll shove you beneath the surface out of a desperate, crazed, perhaps primal need to stay afloat.Some have tried to attribute this to Nokia's misunderstanding of the U.S. Market, and it's hard to disagree with this point. In a country where carrier subsidies are the norm, the only major carrier subsidizing Nokia's S60 5th Edition phones (like the 5800 XpressMusic) is T-Mobile with the bottom-end-of-the-line Nuron.It's worth defining this in general terms, at least: Windows is an operating system; Windows computers can run Windows apps. Macintosh computers use Mac OS X as an operating system and can run Mac apps. iOS is the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch's operating system, and all can run iOS apps. This phone runs the Symbian S60 5th Edition operating system, and runs Symbian S60 5th Edition apps.The 5800 is a phone that seems to best exemplify Nokia's flailing. They've shipped an underpowered phone, with a sub-par screen. They've released updates to most of the world to fix these problems, but hold those updates back from buyers in the US. They pre-install a music store that doesn't work here, a front-facing camera that doesn't work here (save for a few apps - anyone need to video call someone on Fring?) an IM app that doesn't have any service to log into.Oh, and the Amazon and Dell versions have a product code that gets updates later than other US models.Let's look at one usage scenario. Let's post to facebook. Tap the physical center button, then tap internet. Next, tap Facebook. A browser window opens and shows you a Nokia web page that suggests you install a beta Nokia Facebook client. Tap that link, then install the client. Enter your Facebook credentials, then click log in. The app will tell you it needs an update. You confirm the update, then a browser opens on a 404 error page. No explanation is offered. If you hop on the computer and do some research, it turns out the app Nokia is currently telling you to install was just a test platform. Nokia has killed the app, and appreciates all of the help you gave them in developing it. They'll be using what they learned to develop a Facebook app for a phone that you will be able to buy in a few months, but they have no plans on making a similar app available for the phone you already own.Sadly, this kind of situation isn't unusual. They released the N900 around November, as the first Maemo OS powered phone, then six months later, said they were killing Maemo, and merging with another linux-phone distro, leaving many people holding a super powerful $600 phone that only runs apps made for the tiny market of people who buy $600 phones. They're trying to release a new high-end Symbian^3 phone, but say they won't use Symbian^3 for any more new high-end phones. This phone, the 5800, by the way, isn't a Symbian^3 OS phone, and if you buy it, you're already orphaned.They build something, tease it, maybe let you try it, then pull it back and/or kill it. Maybe they'll offer a cool new service in your software updates - that doesn't actually work in the US.I imagine this phone is quite a bit nicer in the EU, where you get unlimited music downloads, can actually use the video calling, and maybe even the IM app.Unless you're going to be touring the EU on prepaid SIM cards and VoIP, skip this phone. I'm done with mine, and won't let Nokia pull me under with their sinking ship.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wifi Doesn't Work and Tech Support Unable to Help", "Author": "Robert R.

Insert an AT&T; sim card and it was able to figure out various network setup(internet/MMS/Message) automatically.- Touchscreen was responsive and pleasantly easy to use- Price/feature is good compared with other models- Battery life seems to be quite decentCons:- Even though I didn't install much additional applications(nightstand + Opera browser), it kept generating this error \"memory card full...close some application\" message even when I was simply composing an email message(Messaging).  The phone comes with 81MB memory and 8GB card and it should have tons of space left.  I googled around and looks like this might be a known problem with 5800.  You may have to turn it off and back on to get around the problem but this error happens once every few hours.  Not good.- In addition, unlike its competitors, it is unable to render CKJ language(lack of unicode support?).  Looks like the only way to get around this is to fake the product code, and use some freeware to flash it with some older version of firmware(which supports whatever language you desire).  This most likely will void the warranty so that's not good.I'll work with Nokia support to see if we can resolve the memory full message problem.Update: I called Nokia support and they basically told me to get a replacement since the \"memory full\" message indicated mine was a defective unit.  Got a replacement, but the new unit somehow freezes frequently for 15 or 20 seconds at a time.  One time it hangs completely and I have to remove the battery to restart it.

It worked great.... I loved the camera, the touch screen, the long battery life, and even the qwerty keyboard. In June 2010 it started having some serious problems. If I ever had the screen unlocked, the phone opened either my call log or contacts and dialed the first number on the list without even being touched. While it was doing this, I couldn't even end the call before it was repeating the process again. One night when I forgot to lock the screen, I overslept because my phone alarm didn't go off-- the phone (which had previously been good for 6 days without recharging) had died because it called my best friend 42 times that night and left 4 long voicemails while I was asleep. Not to mention, if I ever had the screen unlocked while I made a legitimate call, it would often put the person I was talking to on hold, open the call log, and attempt to call that person again. Text messaging proved to be impossible, as the phone often sent an unfinished message while I was typing it, opened the call log, and called the first person on the list. In short, my phone became miserable to use.I sent it back to Nokia after attempting several factory resets and software upgrades (which was a task in itself because I had to have the screen unlocked-- which caused problems as mentioned above). They were \"not able to duplicate my problem,\" which is odd, because this started happening within 5 minutes of the phone being on and wouldn't stop until it was shut off. They claimed to run some diagnostic tests on it, which uncovered some hardware failures. These were resolved and the phone was sent back to me. When the phone was returned-- lo and behold-- the same problem occurred. I've gone two weeks without a phone in the hopes of getting mine fixed, and now it looks as if I'll either have to repeat the process a couple more times or get a new phone. But rest assured, it will not be a XpressMusic 5800.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good but not Great", "Author": "Winter", "ReviewID": "R2KRPX59LTY1DE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "IMPORTANT NOTE:  This phone is carrier-unlocked.  It means that the phone itself does not require you to go with any one specific carrier in order to use it:  you just buy it, swap your SIM card (if compatible), and start using.  HOWEVER: if you are not currently on an unlimited data plan with your carrier, you absolutely MUST call your wireless carrier and talk to them about the phone.  The Nokia XpressMusic 5800 has a lot of settings that default to using your wireless carrier to pull down data, and using these features (or in some cases just having them turned on) when your carrier bills you for data by the kilobit WILL lead to astronomically high phone bills.  I had a long conversation with AT&T; Service prior to purchasing this phone and their representative indicated to me that many people don't realize the hidden cost of their phone's features when not signed up for an unlimited data plan.  Before you buy, take 10 minutes to call your carrier.  It can save you a lot of headaches.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is an excellent phone for people who love media: it's got a browser for streaming, easy-to-use software for transfers of your own files, and it even has a built-in FM radio for listening to local stations (with the added bonus of being able to tag and label them). The screen is approximately the size of the screen on a Nintendo DS or the older Sony PSP, with the difference being that colors are brighter, resolution is sharper, and the backlight is superior. Power button, standard headphone adapter, charge plug and USB connector are all on the top, making it easy to access but conveniently out of the way. The touch screen is unlocked via a rocker key on the side, and volume can easily be adjusted up or down along the same edge.In addition to this, you can expect all the same features you find in most smartphones today: GIS-driven mapping systems, Internet connectivity via WiFi (if, like me, you're not on an unlimited data plan), a multitude of Bluetooth capabilities, integration with a PC or Mac via the USB Cable, and of course a digital camera that takes good (but not great) pictures and video. One nice extra here is that if you hold the phone like a camera, a button on top will quickly switch the phone to camera mode and also double as your auto-focus and picture-taking button.I like the feel of this phone, and I definitely like the clarity and strength of the calls. There are times when it appears that I have only one bar, but still can place clear and noise-free calls that don't disconnect. The software is regularly kept up to date, and once you get through the process of setting up an account at the Ovi Store, it is remarkably easy to download and install applications, many of which are free (but only some of which are useful).The one big drawback--and it is a serious one--is the interface. Features and Applications are in two separate sections, and sometimes the dividing line between which is which is not exactly clear. The auto-rotate that switches from Portrait to Landscape can go off at the slightest of bumps, and I have to shake the phone and wait for it to re-set. I bought the phone because I wanted a good, solid handwriting device, and this is where I have been most disappointed. Despite being a whiz at PDAs, despite training (and re-training) the phone to my handwriting, I get many botched translations. I have to force myself to scribe slowly because the delay time between reading my strokes and rendering a character is noticeably long. I have to patiently re-do most of my strokes over and over. To give credit where credit is due, Nokia gives you a slim stylus cleverly hidden along the side of the phone, and then they throw in a hip little gadget called a \"plectrum\": it's a triangular guitar-pick that makes a handy substitute for a fingernail--consider this for pointing and clicking and the stylus for handwriting.There is, however, one sin that seems unforgivable, and I'm surprised that a year and a half down the road, the updates still haven't addressed it:The phone dialer has no letters on it.Let me rewind that: if you call up the dialer in other areas of the phone (such as via contacts), you will see the letters imprinted on the dial pad. However, if you want to dial a number with letters in it (say, \"1-800-FLOWERS\"), you are out of luck: the dialer shown when dialing the phone does not display any letters. The fact that the letters are imprinted elsewhere in the system, but not where they are most important, is what makes the lack of this \"fix\" annoying.Also, while the software is easy to use, it is also incredibly slow and buggy in Windows Vista or Windows 7. The interface often turns black and I have to scrub my mouse over the window to re-draw my menus and panels.If you really like media and want a phone for music, pictures, and video, the 5800 XpressMusic is not bad. However, if you're looking for a pocket-sized computer that can do whiz-kid propeller-head tricks, the 5800XpressMusic will most likely disappoint, especially given its price. As much as I appreciate what Nokia was trying to do with this phone, it really wasn't significantly different from my Motorola RAZR.NOTE: I cannot confirm that this is true of all Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phones, but the \"USA\" Phone that was shipped to me contained a European power adapter. This huge chunk of plastic contains a converter to allow it to plug into US electrical outlets, but it also means that your charger is anything but pocket-sized.

It also has Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and GPS.What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap.What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call. And why does it have to ask me if I want to make a video call ?!? Like I do video calls from my land line.2/ So far I haven't found a way to do phone card call, without having to type in about 20 digits.3/ Could not manage to get the blue tooth conduit to run with my Vista Laptop. Vista asks for a driver, Nokia says that they have provided the driver.4/ Even the full size QWERTY is very difficult to use. You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common.5/ Help and support are pathetic6/ The battery died after about 8 hours, during which time I had made 3-4 calls. It virtually died it went from full charge to almost empty in a matter of 10 minutes.All in all, I am considering to return it and get a phone that actually works, without having to have manicure or three hands.============================================  10 DAYS LATER UPDATE:-------------------------------Here we go:PROS:1/ The battery issue disappeared after about 1 week nightly recharging. Now the battery indicator has a tendency to be 100% all day long, and I do talk more than when I was testing the phone. I am not sure if the indicator is correct, but at least it has not let me down while I am talking.2/ The phone has relatively decent \"Voice Command\" feature. That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call.3/ I received an SMS from NOKIA - telling me how to turn my GPS feature on. That was awfully nice of them - ~2 hours after the activation the GPS found me. Obviously there is a \"soak\" period. So don't expect immediate results. The \"soak\" period also falls in the CONS category.4/ I must admit that the \"Camera\" is fairly decent. Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera. If you need a camera - \"you buy a camera\". I am looking more into the \"organizer\" functionality. (\"I-DON'T-have-to-attach-my laptop-to-my-butt-but-it-helps-if-handy) kinda' application.CONS:1/ The voice command works fairly well. The problem is that NOKIA has prerecorded commands from, I am sure, some terrific Finnish guy, who has a terrible Finnish accent (as far as English is concerned). That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as \"Contacts\" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name.2/ The DTMF issue is a real problem. I do a lot of call card calls and conference calls. The phone has \"Copy --> Paste\" function, but this does not cut it. There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'.I do understand that \"One\" is not supposed to talk on the phone while driving, but this is \"One's\" decisions. By no means it is NOKIA's decision.3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature. I wonder why is that!?!WHO IS WATCHING?!? AND WHAT that \"WHO\" IS?The long \"soak\" frustrated me and invoked questions about the safe keeping of my privacyCONCLUSIONThis phone is an acquired taste ... or maybe Symbian is an acquired taste ... I don't know.It has potential, if NOKIA fixes the annoyances in the firmware - e.g. the voice command works fine, minus the Finnish accent. GPS works,AND people know how to make it work and what to expect. (SMS simply does not cut it).There is no way to convince me that this phone is user friendly. It simply is not. You can easily access the most basic features, but if you want to do something beyond basics - it is a nightmare.I am sorry, but I do not buy a \"cheap\" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture. I buy it to be able to do all of the above - EASY.And learning how to do that has to take place in \"reasonable\" time - say 1-2 hours. This is not the case. So far I have invested about 8 hours to figure out the some of the questions, that are most annoying. Probably it will take twice as much to figure the answers.How about an brand new idea! How about, a user guide that actually guides you?!? Or how about some useful webcasts, that would teach you how to use the phone features, without having to spend 7 days trying to figure them out !?! What a challenge !!!THE VERDICTI WILL KEEP the phone.I will keep it, simply because, based on my experience and judging by reviews about the competition, it is MORE acceptable.It is nowhere near to the iPhone, but that is another can of worms.I expect huge improvements from NOKIA on:1/ User interface2/ User manuals or instructions3/ Ease of use - functionality.All of the above can be fixed by software, so I am expecting the upgrades.Happy upgrading !!Enough said - 2-1/2 stars - FINAL !============++++++++++++++++++============LAST UPDATEThe headphones coming with the phone are AMAZING !!!Easily comparable to BOSE.I heard depth and breadth of music, that I hadn't experienced in a long time. (That is after I figured how to copy the music to the phone, and how to start it). Seriously - the sound from the headphones is exceptional !Maybe it is what it says \"XpressMusic\" - I will give to NOKIA that - Music is PERFECT !!! Much better than my wife's iPod !Still - 3 stars for the overall phone - MAX.Music on the headphones is excellent though!!The phone is an acquired taste ...", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unreliable Phone", "Author": "Malcolm Lowry", "ReviewID": "R2N64X40SXG0X0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone died within one week.

I found one on the Nokia site but it was for older models.  I have a Nokia N8100 internet tablet and it has a great internet music app.  Can't believe this phone doesn't.  I am about to give up and send this back.Update.  On the 7th day...I tried once again to update the firmware via wifi & phone and it connected and updated on first attempt! Great.  But another thing happened that is really strange.  A call came in and the phone vibration started.  But it would not stop.  It just kept vibrating and the keys locked up.  After a couple of minutes I just pulled the battery and inserted it and it was alright.  Strange phone.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Yes! Go ahead and buy it!", "Author": "A.

I usually wait and use the product before writing any reviews. I am not a bot and neither was I paid to write this review. I'll sum it up for you.Pros:1) Looks nice! Yes it's a bit thick but it looks decent.2) Plays music well. I go online and listen to some cool online radio stations.3) At&t; 3.5G lets you access the internet at amazing speeds. You can even use it as a wifi hotspot and access internet from your laptop/pc.4) It automatically checks my email every 15-30 mins and notifies if theres a new mail. ( coolest feature for me )5) Call voice quality is great.6) Nokia maps and turn by turn navigation is amazing! If you have internet access enabled, GPS works pretty fast. If you don't have internet access it still works ( yes, even voice navigation works! ) but you have to manually download maps for the country/state/city where you are using your phone. Even google maps works great.7) Skype and youtube works great too!8) Main camera picture/video quality is decent. I won't say it's too good or too bad but personally its acceptable to me.9) At&t; medianet costs only $15/month. (optional)Cons:1) Touch screen is resistive. You need some time to get used to the touch screen.2) Software update issues- Yes, some updates like v50 are not available in my region. Personally, for me this is a downer because it means no kinetic scrolling in the main menu. Even when I bought an unlocked phone I can't update?!?3) Battery life is a real issue. If you use a lot of 3G it uses a lot of battery power and drains the battery. The phone heats up!So if you are a basic user who wants to upgrade, I think this phone is for you! I've used a lot of mobile phones and I think nokia makes good and sturdy handsets.Hope this helps.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "I recommend to buy this Phone.", "Author": "Michael J.

The touch screen is very good , as I never used an Iphone, but the sensor is good enough for you to use your finger on it.2. You can handwrite messages which is very convinient to compose a text message or send an email.3. Compare to Iphone, you can use Wifi to connect to the internet, without paying monthly data plan, but wifi can only be used in an area where have open wireless internet service.4. The talk quality is very good, clear, you can hear very well. and very easy to use hand-free speaker.5. You can save your favorite 4 phone number on the home screen and creat button with an image icon.I like this feature, because I can put my family members phone number on the home screen.6.Easy to use the USB wire to transfer music or pictures from PC to Phone.I like this very much.the phone I do not feel very happy with is :1. the battery do not last long, I charge it every 3 days, though I do not use text message or connect to internet, nor do I listen to music via it since I got a good Mp3. so I cannot imagine how can people listen music with it as a MP3.2. The camera quality isn't good with a 320Mp camera. take very poor quality pictures with it.3. some time it frozen the screen, you have to restart the phone to make it work. but this happens to a lot phone.over all, I think this phone worth of the price, it still a nice phone since no phone is perfect.

It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do.  I have AT&T; as my provider and receive a strong 3.5g signal.  The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus.  The reception/sound quality is crystal clear, also. The volume range is very good and the stereo speakers work surprisingly well.  The FM radio is a nice addition and I find I use it more than I thought I would.  The MP3 player is good; however, their is one thing to note about the Nokia software you use for transferring the files from your computer.  It offers an option to reduce the file size prior to downloading the music to the phone but it seems to greatly reduce the sound quality of the tracks, so I no longer use it.  The wifi/browser works fine and the zoom option helps to make all print readable.  The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots.  The manual options have proven to allow for much better quality results so it is best to become familiar with them.  This is true with the video recorder, too.  For example, indoors on auto mode the video recording is very grainy but when using low light option the results are great...In fact, better then I had expected.  The video player was a little disappointing because seems with most of the movie files I have played so far there is some drag periodically which is irritating, especially right after the video has started.  I wonder if a more powerful processor is needed or just a firmware update would solve the problem.  Despite this I still give the phone a 5 star because it excels in every other regard.  And finally, I downloaded the free flashlight software I found on the internet and now this phone can be used as a bright flashlight for times when I need to find something in the dark.  I am waiting for a DivX player software for this version of Symbian (which Samsung offers for their phones using the same Symbian operating system) so I can play this popular movie format.When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen.  So inspect the phone carefully right away for that or for any other defects.  Amazon customer service offered to replace the phone but I didn't want to wait for a new one to arrive.  I just wanted to mention it so you know that if you do find there is a problem Amazon is very good about offering support.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia 5800 XpressMusic", "Author": "S.

I tried everything, I really needed that calendar integration. I can't use it anymore, even after resetting the phone to factory defaults and erasing everything. To sync with exchange, it asks me every time if I want to accept the certificate. I click on \"accept the certificate and never ask again\". It shows a message saying that next time won't ask to accept certificate. But it keeps asking to accept the certificate. Doesn't sync anymore unless I ask the phone to do so. The email client for Gmail and other POP3 stopped working after some update, and I gave up on it. Nokia released a new version of Ovi maps, and my phone updated to it, but this the new version is too heavy for this phone. Every time after I enter the code to unlock the phone, it shows a stupid message that says that the phone has been unlocked, only to make me wait. If you're in a meeting and the alarm starts ringing, you need to enter the code to unlock the phone before turning it off, what I do instead is to take the battery off.

But couldnt find one that fit my needs. (Purchased a supposed basic unlocked Motorola off Ebay, different story, but lesson learnt, don't trust Ebay)I have a new Ipod touch, so did really want apps, wifi and media. But after being unsuccessful in a basic phone search, I thought about getting a full featured phone and eliminate my itouch. After reading all the reviews about this phone and seeing the price of an Iphone (well out of budget), I decided on this nokia.Once receiving this phone, setting it up and with playing some java games on the device. Upon using I immediatly realized that this phone is not even close to the same ballpark as apple products.Comparing this nokia to my itouch (pretty much a iphone), I began to notice that this phone is not as refined as apple options.1) The screen is a pain to use, even with the stylus, screen feels soft, not as sensitive and annoying. It gets scratched easily, my ipod is 12 months old and not a mark to be seen, this phone is now 2 weeks old and has a few deep marks. I have purchased protector to eliminate this.2) The apps and games available for this phone are terrible, I have downloaded 20-30 java games and apps for this phone and have deleted all but two. Graphics, game play and entertainment on all games is terrible. I have downloaded (not purchased) awful games from itunes, but then there are some great games. The graphics of these java games remind me of my first ever gameboy and I would prefer to use the gameboy as the on-screen function of the nokia is crap.3) This phone has issues, it freezes at times and you get a solid blue screen, shutting down and a minute later and the phone is fine (happened twice in two weeks).This phone is great as a phone (only as a phone), easy to use, great for contact detail, good battery life (3-4 days with minimal use, 1-3 with moderate)great sound for media/calls and acceptable Wifi. For the price I think this phone has great value, it was one of the cheapest I could find with wifi, great for music and movies (forget games and apps). I travel a bit and basic phone Wifi is great to check emails and facebook at free hotspots.In the end I will keep this phone it does what I require, but I will still be keeping my ipod touch, its just so much more enjoyable to use.

However, it does freeze and glitch if you open two or more applications, or listen to the radio and text at the same time. The screen has good resolution and display, but it could be bigger. Texting is not bad but is hard as the buttons don't respond right away, or if you turn the phone horizontally its nearly impossible to text. Sometimes the screen freezes as you are entering a text message and then picks up by dumping everything you've typed several seconds later. Again, needs bigger screen and buttons. Same with trying to dial a call- could be problematic. The camera quality is excellent and there are many different options for editing your pictures and videos. The call quality is good.

I wanted a reasonably priced smartphone that allowed access to the web, made phone calls, had gps, a decent camera, etc etc that was NOT an IPhone.  I'm just not buying the IPhone koolaid, having tried them a number of times, they don't excite me. I just wanted a practical high-tech phone at a good price (with no contract) and this seemed to be it.  But it's not.Problem #1 is phone call quality using AT&T; in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Your experience with another carrier in another area may differ, but this phone could not effectively make a phone call.  I'd dial out, get connected, and within seconds I'd lose the call, all while standing perfectly still. I'd receive a call, answer it, and within seconds the call was dropped, or it would be dropped while it was ringing. Out of a dozen calls that I made or received in the first day, I only had a satisfactory phone call 3 times.  Of those 3 times, the person at the other end said that always, every time, the sound was horrible and they could barely understand me, though I heard them well.  And just to prove that it is this phone, I took out the sim, put it into a cheap GSM phone I own, and I have great call quality, no dropped calls, and it works like a charm.  It's the phone (perhaps in conjunction with AT&T;, but other phones work).Problem #2 is dealing with WIFI.  I set up the wifi connection for the wifi in my house, putting in the passcode (which stupidly you need to do with a phone-pad keyboard).  Then I'd go to the web browser and it would be using AT&T.;  So, I found that there are 3(I think, maybe more) places you can set up this wifi connection, did them all, and somehow after quite a number of hours, I got it to use my wifi connection.  But....a few minutes later, I tried it again, and it asked me for my passcode for that network. So I put it in again, laboriously.  Then an hour later I tried again, and it couldn't see the wifi network, even though I was 5 feet from the wireless router.  So, I turned off the phone, turned it back on again, and sure enough it finds the network, but it needs my passcode again.  This is not convenient. In fact, it is not even usable. I was never able to get this phone to retain the passcode to my wireless network for any length of time more than a few minutes over 2 days of trying.The new phone I received needed to have it's software updated. I highly recommend you do that right away, as the new software is a vast improvement over the software that ships with the phone.  That said, it takes a long time to update.  And even though it is a vast improvement, the new software still has plenty of oddities, irrational quirks, and just plain weirdnesses that are too numerous to detail.  Their software development team badly needs a consistency control department.  Each application, or portion of an application works differently, with no consistency among them as to user interface and interaction. It's a frustrating experience. And although they improved the scrolling tremendously from the software in the device out of the box, it still isn't a good scrolling experience.The GPS was not nearly as accurate as my friends' IPhones.  I don't know why but my friends' IPhoness get me standing in front of my house as just that, me standing in front of my house. This phone has me about 1/2 block down and across the street (or around the corner, or on the next street over).  If GPS that is accurate to within 1 city block +/- is good enough for you, that's great, I don't think it will work for me.I've sent my phone back.  I can tell after just a few days that I'll never be happy with this phone.  It's a shame really, because by specification it is exactly what I want.

I don't have a 3G plan, so I was very attracted to the GPS navigation that works without it, and WiFi connectivity.  But I have been completely disappointed with this phone.  Here's my take.Pros====-Good camera for a cellphone: 3.2 MP with LED flash.-GPS navigation works without 3G plan (at least in theory).-WiFi connectivity lets you get online without 3G plan.-Decent battery life: usually goes a few days per charge.  It helps that I never use any smart phone features because they're such a PITA.)-Good network reception (at least compared to my ancient Motorola V188).-Nokia is regularly updating their Ovi Suite software.  Maybe they'll fix this stuff someday?Cons====-BUGGY OS and apps.  Web browser and GPS navigation are virtually unusable.-HORRIBLE user interface all around.  Doing anything other than making calls is simply not worth the trouble on this phone.  Plan on using the stylus a lot.-GPS takes too long to get position fix.  Very spotty GPS reception inside vehicles, where you need it the most.  Despite downloading latest maps, navigation consistently gives WRONG directions.-Screen is difficult to read in bright light.  Auto brightness control does not seem to work correctly.-Confusing WiFi setup.-Only 4 shortcuts allowed on home screen, even though there's plenty of room for more.-Included USB cable is only 7 inches long.  Really?!?-Software updates from the phone did not work out of the box.  I had to hunt down some obscure server settings to check for updates.  You can also update through Ovi Suite on your PC.)-Accompanying Ovi Suite PC software is bloated and buggy, although they have been making improvements recently.-Included 4 GB MicroSD card is probably not enough for all your maps and music.-No letters shown on dialing pad.Bottom Line===========NOT recommended!", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "screen cracked", "Author": "Muneesh Sharma \"MS\"", "ReviewID": "R21ZFFRV480SWY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "one year of fun.. n the screen cracked while in my pocket.. they ask 150 bucks to repair it.. for a phone worth 275 almost 15 months ago.. who would repair this brick now..? not much impressed with nokia any more..", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the worst smart phones", "Author": "RK", "ReviewID": "R2DQSF77C3K78Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I highly recommend not to buy this product.

I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $30 data plan with At&t; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product.  First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls  :  10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception, compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market.  I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera (stills) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors, but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy.  Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera (video) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent, I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video, stills, front & rear camera: Switching from a video to still and back to video.  Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive.  I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender, Memo... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer, but cannot sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers.  Which means, everytime, you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good, lacks a audio book player.  It does not playback divx movies (sorry torrent folks :)Youtube playback: 2/10================Ok, I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving.  I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks, made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version & try it on wifi - But even on Wifi, while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as  new mail  <href image= ....>This phone does not even support html emails, no images either.  Other than that, the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail & Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard  : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard, full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting.  I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps  : 2/10====Yes, there is an app store, but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity, but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen: 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen, means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work, unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia's resistive touch screen works, but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio, but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna.  Even after plugging in the antenna, it picks up a few strong signals, but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors, nor outdoors.GPS  ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia.  Oh oh, big mistake.  The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS (means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location, it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions.  It works, but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly, I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone.  We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At&t; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you.

It has most of the stuff you would get in an iPhone for 1/5 the price. Lots of apps, all the bells and whistles you'd expect on a modern cell phone like a camera and Bluetooth, etc. Now for the bad.Either this phone or the software that runs it is extremely shoddy. I can't tell you how often the phone gets completely locked up and the battery has to be removed in order to \"reboot\" it. Since I bought my daughter's a week after my own, I have two of these devices to compare, and both have similar problems. We have done firmware updates and factory resets. One particular annoyance happens while you are typing a text message.In the middle of typing, the keyboard screen will momentarily disappear and then reappear. Unfortunately, if you had been typing on the right-hand side of the keyboard at that time, you will have accidentally pressed a button such as the \"send\" button. It happens about every 20 seconds, although it comes and goes. I can't tell you how many times I have sent half messages because of this glitch, and it is the same glitch on both phones. I don't have a single 3rd party app installed (although my daughter does), so it's not like anything is interfering. I don't have it connecting to a WiFi network or any funny stuff. Just plain texting. My daughter does use all those other features, and they all seem to work OK, but what good is a smart phone that can do everything but text?The freezing problem has gotten so bad and I have needlessly missed so many important calls and messages that I am now shopping for a new phone.

This phone is perfect for someone who does not want to pay $30/month for a data plan, and has not yet been converted to use the iPhone interface (which I agree is more intuitive if you are into using your fingers). Make sure you upgrade to the latest v40 firmware. The feature set is awesome and is better than the iPhone imho - offline GPS (i.e. the gps can be used without data plan), expandable memory, multitasking, replaceable battery (essential in my opinion as batteries are usually the first component to fail in a phone), handwriting recognition, stereo speakers with surround sound (music from the built-in speakers is also the best I have seen).I love the fact that it has a built-in stylus. When my fingers are dirty/sweaty I can avoid touching the screen. The wifi works very well - though I suggest you don't use the Nokia Browser. I have downloaded Opera Mobile and Skyfire for free and those browsers are awesome. Webpages are rendered as if I am on my desktop! I can even watch Flash videos, unlike on the iPhone. The camera could be better when compared with other phones on the market, but it's no big deal given I prefer to use a real digital camera for taking pics anyway. Picture quality on a phone can never match high-end digital cameras, due to the small size of the sensor and lens on a phone. However, it is still the best phone camera I have ever owned. Love the dual led flash. I can even use it as a bright flashlight using a free app available on the Ovi Store!Another feature I love is that the phone has two cameras. The second one can be used for video chats. This is again impossible on the iPhone given the latter has only one camera. The phone size is thicker, lighter and narrower than the iphone, hence easier to hold onto.The major con I see with the phone is that it does not support asian languages, so my chinese song titles do not show up properly. Nokia refuses to provide language packs for US customers. The other pet-peeve I have is that the calendar alarm cannot be stopped using the hard buttons.

I have been using it for 5 months now.This phone may take you a little while to get used to. There are some configuration that you have to do to make the most out of this phone.Internet - My carrier is T-mobile. It doesn't support 3G for this phone. That's disappointing. I use edge for internet for $10 a month when I am not close to any WiFi network. I am OK with that. For most part I am close to WiFi networks and this phone works great over WiFi network be it in the airport or pizza place or at home.Ovi maps - Ovi map was not free when I purchased this phone. Nokia since made it free for several phone. I updated the firmware and ovi map and now GPS works great.Calls - No problem so far.Music - This is a music phone or so they say. I have paired it with both normal headset and Bluetooth ones. The Bluetooth stereo headset (from Nokia) skips once in every 3-4 minutes when playing music but never for calls. Not sure if it's the phone problem or the headset problem. So far I am OK with it.Photos and video - Best suited for day light. In build flash is useful but doesn't improve picture indoors. It's really not meant for low lights. Video outside is very nice. Again, low light is a show stopper...Touchscreen - Not as responsive as you would like. This is no iphone. This is not an iphone killer.Radio - Biggest dissappointment... won't play without a headset and doesn't recognize Bluetooth headset. Weird. I checked the nokia forums and there are tons of complaints about it.Battery - I charge it every other day. I talk about say 20 minutes a day. I browse for like  an hour and music not too often. The battery does not drain much. On occasions I use the GPS or google map. BTW, google map is really awesome.Installed softwares - Handwriting recognition is nice to have although not useful. Speech recognition is nice. Browser is good. Installed facebook and youtube from [...]. It's nice and handy and quite good for quick checking. Installed Opera, google maps and some tit bits from [...]. Opera always tries to connect to t-mobile despite being near to WiFi hot spots. Annoying.This phone serves it purpose for me. On occasions I do switch off the phone, remove the battery, remove the SD card, dust off and put them back again. Nokia recommends that you do so every so often.Being unlocked is one of the reasons I bought this phone. Another thing is the removable micro SD card. I does look a little cheap. I got it for $200 and I am not complaining. This phone may not suit everyone. So I tried to lay out how I use it. I also think you should review a product after owning it for sometimes.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Question", "Author": "Kuo Yu Chieh \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R1LXKUCHN4ULFV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Can I use this's phone's GPS w/o through Internet nor pay any service charges through telecom service monthly?

It also gets stuck frequently, some times for a few seconds - some times I need to take out the battery and power up the phone all over again.The features listed here and on Nokia's website speak for themselves.  The sound quality was better than 5 mp3 players ranging from $90-$400 (iPod Touch 3G, Samsung P3 & Q2, few others..) that I tested it against and this was a main selling point for me.  It was basically a Samsung P3 with better sound and video while being a phone at the same time - all for the same price - with free movies, gift card, and accessories thrown in.Main point for my review is to let you know it's got some nice features for the money indeed, but be prepared for the possibility that it might not last so long.  Hopefully you are lucky in this regard more so than I was.  Jacked up screen and all, I still use my 5800 daily as an mp3 player - and of course as a cell-phone.

Years of numbers they lost.I have wasted so much of my time having people try to repair this phone and what did Nokia do: replace the internal workings of the phone. The phone company I bought it from quietly said there are problems with this phone. Oh, really?Avoid this cell phone. I am DEAD serious.

About 2 or 3 times a week, it would lock up--if it was on, you could do nothing no matter which key you hit.  I had to remove the battery and reinstall it and then it would work.  If it was off, I had to remove the battery and reinstall it before it would turn on.  Last week we went to Vegas, and the phone would not access the WiFi spots at any WiFi spot we went to. It would go into a loop and recognize the WiFi spot(like the airport), but you could not access the internet.  It would say that it was logging on, and show a full bar, but it would then say \"connecting\", and go into a loop and get stuck there.  When we got back yesterday, I contacted Nokia, and the lady I spoke with ran me thru a zillion scenarios before she agreed that there was a problem, and she sent me a return label for UPS so I could send it back for repair. I took it to a local UPS location today to return it.  You have to remove the battery, sims card, and memory card before you send it back. Let's hope it works when I get it back.The GPS on this phone is really slow and only works part of the time.

Until a few weeks ago I thought it was a decent phone, a cost effective alternative to a 2-year iphone contract and iphone data.  It's a very capable phone, the GPS works great, and once you download another browser (I used Opera Mobile [not Opera Mini]) it's a good little internet phone.  The camera's great.  Call quality and reception generally were better than my friends' iphones.  Because it's an unlocked phone, there were a handful of useful things I could that iphone users couldn't, like download an app that allowed me to take my 3G connection and make a WIFI hotspot...tethering, basically. I also made much use of the vast array of podcasts available for download directly to the phone.  My main complaint when it was working was that there just weren't that many desirable apps, at least not compared to iphone, blackberry, or android.  Streaming data was possible, for example, but whereas many sources of streaming data (like CSPAN or NPR) have apps for more popular phones, I had to seek out links at great length.Anyway, about a week ago I started having minor software glitches.  The phone wouldn't interact properly with hands free headsets, certain menu options were unavailable.  Basic ones, like bringing up the dial pad to make a phone call.  So I call Nokia.  They tell me to reset it, which is a no brainer, but when that didn't work, they were useless.  I visit their \"support\" site, which is equally useless, except for the forum of users who offer each other advice based on what they've been able to dig up in spite of Nokia.  I send an email to ask a specific question.  Nokia did not answer my email, other that an auto-response message saying that they would get back to me \"promptly\".  That was a week ago.  During this process I discover (no thanks to Nokia) that I cannot update my firmware over the air (direct to the phone) or with my computer, which happens to be a Mac.  I need Windows.  Okay, so I get Windows, back the phone up using Nokia's OVI Suite and then begin the update.  OVI Suite crashes, Windows closes it, and my phone is now a paper weight.  The only option left to me is to mail the phone in and do without for \"7-10 days\".  We'll see about that.  Not holding my breath.If I had the decision to make over I would probably buy an iphone.

Dec.14,2009 When I switched the sim card from my old phone, found that there wasn't one in this new phone, didn't bother to raise it. So far working well. One tip; if you install a protective skin over the face, cut away top mill of the film before installing, so the light sensor isn't covered.  This prevents the screen from going into screen save mode(black) when you are trying to key additional numbers ie; pin numbers to retrieve voicemail or keying a phone extension number etc. When the light sensor senses darkness such as your cheek against the phone as you talk, or in your pocket it will go dark so anything touching the screen won't activate something. Any protective skin will cause the same effect, so cut it away around the sensor first.Also if you take videos or pictures and you want to save them on your computer, take them in the horizontal position only, because if you take pics/videos in the upright position, when they 'view' on your computer they load only in the horizontal and I can't find a way to 'rotate' them. I can move the  pictures into one of my many photo venues to rotate, but can't find a way to do it in any of the video viewers ie: Real or Windows Media Player. In other words I have to view my 'videos' with a crooked neck!..so take videos only in horizontal.I don't use all of the apps so can't report on them.  Also we live in a rural areal in SW Ontario and have no connection , dropped calls or poor audio issues at all. I acknowledge that has a lot to do with the carrier .No major software issues as some buyers have reported, but I do notice that the clock is 5 minutes slow, I am perplexed on that one as the time should be coming from the server, this shouldn't take rocket science to solve.Otherwise phone is solid performer so far.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia XpressMusic 5800; not worth", "Author": "MP", "ReviewID": "R2F6RD0F8TBW95", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "JANUARY 2010 UPDATE:  After having used the Nokia for a week, decided on returning it because of the short battery life and then even with an updated firmware, the screen became unresponsive needing turning off and on again the device in order to use the phone features.  As much as I like Nokia, they still have a long way to go with touch screens.INITIAL REVIEW: After one year using a Nokia E-71 which I dropped and stopped working, I searched for a replacement and found this XpressMusic5800 for $219.00 OnLine.  Ordered it from the blue computer store and have been \"playing with it\" for only 24 hours.  Nevertheless, being a recently introduced device in the US, thought on sharing my first impression for those who are considering it.Users familiar with Nokia products will love how user friendly this phone is.  Those unfamiliar with Nokia, might have a hard time setting up the many phone's features but it's worth your time.  Once you open the box, will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be.  The most attractive thing is how narrow it is.  Slightly shorter than an I-Phone and E-71, much narrower than both but somewhat thicker; a tad more than half inch.  Included is a wired remote control for the player, mic/headphones, the wall charger, strap, MicroSD card and a mini disk for installing the Nokia features.On the upper part of the device there is a micro USB dock, the port for the regular headset, the charging port and the on/off switch. On the right side there is a volume switch, the unlocking switch and a separate camera switch.  The left side houses an 8GB MicroSD card (included) and the SIM Card from your phone carrier.  The expected Nokia strap hooks on the lower left side of the phone.  The battery is on the back, facing downwards and to access it you need to remove the whole back cover.  The phone comes in shiny black which is a fingerprints magnet.When you turn it on it vibrates, shows the usual Nokia welcome and then allows you to program it.  I was able to configure my two main e-mails but guess you can do several more.  On my E-71 I had four different mail accounts constantly receiving messages.  The native wallpaper is black with some waves but you can easily change it to your favorite photo.  I downloaded several screens from the Apple website since the screen is somewhat similar to the I-Phone and I-Pod in shape and dimensions.On a very T-Mobile way, you can have your \"four favorite people\" on the main screen and once you touch their corresponding picture/icon, the phone shows a history of calls made, received, text messages and e-mails; quite innovative.  On the lower area you have an icon for phone dialing and another for your contacts.  The phone dialing keyboard works only in the vertical position but the font keyboard is accessed also while the device is horizontal.  Making a call trough the contact list is very easy the device is loaded with features.Call quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion.  The touch sensing screen is not as fast and accurate as the Apple devices but good enough for not needing the stylus that is housed on the rear of the phone.  As a music player it is outstanding.  Playback is trough the two micro speakers on the lower sides and sound quality as well as stereo separation are very good.  Nokia offers on this device all the goodies that make them unique such as saying the caller's name/ID, unique caller ringtones & photos and several customizable user modes. There are many features that I have not yet tried but will do during the next week or so.  My service is with ATT and works in both frequencies; EDGE & 3-G,Now, the limitations of the Nokia 5800:First; the battery life.  Nokia products have been famous for their extended batteries.  My E-71 could be used without recharging up to three days.  On the 5800, the battery drains in six hours. The stated four hours of talk time and two weeks of standby time are far from reasonable.What I did to prolong battery life was disable the vibrations when the screen gets a command, disable the 3-G (use EDGE only) and made the Bluetooth available for search for only one minute.  As of today, with regular calls, internet use, e-mails and music, after 15 hours of nonstop use, the battery still has like 40% charge.Second and quite disappointing, the installation mini disk as well as the software upgrades on the Nokia Website is not compatible with Windows 7.  After downloading all the suites, OVI, and ancillary software, many of these do not work with Win-7. Then tried these with a NetBook running Win-XP and no problem with the updates.Having stated all this, I consider that for the price paid ($219.00), the Nokia 5800 is a bargain when compared with their 51XX and 53XX series, mostly because of its music playing capabilities, awesome call features and quality.  But in my case, the battery issue might make me consider other alternate phones.  Let's see what I decide and meanwhile, I hope that this initial review helps you to decide if the Nokia 5800 is the phone for you.  In case that you are considering an I-Phone, you should wait.

The touch screen is just right, too much but tolerable garbage programs on it by Nokia that you cannot remove. Decent but not great call quality. I thought I would not like stylus but really like its accuracy. Surfing the web (on ATT) is great with this phone. Its biggest problem is dropping calls, shutting down, acting like \"memory overflow\" when browsing the web and shutting down the browser. These problems cured temporarily by removing battery. The more you use it the more often you must pull battery to reboot. Mine is going back to Nokia for warranty repair tomorrow. Hope that helps. It came with V20  software, upgraded to V21, but Nokia won't release the V30 software in US yet. Who knows, that may cure problem, but first they will have to spend their factory dollars to investigate since they won't give U.S. new software. Last Nokia I will ever buy. There must be a company that can make a phone with good hardware and/or software??? I wish it worked......  UPDATE 9-3-09: ZPhone was having so many problems, sent it in to their REPAIR depot. It came back in ONLY 6 DAYS and has worked PERFECTLY since. They noted they \"replaced crystal filter\". I really like this phone and feel it is perfect now.

And overall I'm happy with the purchase.  [Update 2011: I wish this piece of crap would die already]  The reception is good, the battery life is good, and it seems to be very solidly built.  [Update 2011: still true]  Synchronization with Outlook is easy once it is debugged.But it is a very difficult phone to operate in many ways.  The single-click to open an application and double-click to select at item is counter-intuitive to any user of any computer, and will never feel right.  It is very difficult to figure out how to change settings, and the manual is no help.  Actually, the manual is no help for anything-- it has almost nothing on troubleshooting (nor does the Nokia website) and seems to have a lot of factual inaccuracies, such as which commands are on which menu.  You would think that you could find commands intuitively, like with a real operating system--  but no.  Even the few applications that work well on this phone (music player, calendar, voice recorder) become enormous pains to use at times.  Just adding a \"back\" button would be enormously helpful. Never going to happen with Symbian.Also, there are a fair number of bugs.  I like to use the QWERTY keyboard, but it randomly reverts to T9.  Wifi connections disconnect for no apparent reason (no error message, and the phone never passed out of range).  Unlocking it may take eight or ten yanks on the little slider.  When you do unlock it, it often asks you to set an alarm rather than going to the home screen.  Bizarre.It has great trouble syncing with computers.  The Ovi software is a known scandal (search any Nokia forum), and simply doesn't work.  The Nokia PC Suite works most of the time, but every time they update it you face an hour or two of debugging. [Update 2011:  Fortunately, Nokia has stopped supporting this phone, so no more software or firmware disasters.  It says a lot about a company that life gets better when they stop supporting the product.]The GPS is a sad joke--  it gives my current location as a place I stayed a week ago, which is 200 miles away. In other words, it hasn't picked up a GPS signal between Boston and New York. maybe it only takes a GPS signals when you turn on the GPS. Who knows? The manual doesn't care to inform you of this. But, oddly, I did not turn on the GPS when I was in Boston, so *if* it only receives a signal when the GPS is turned on (and, again, there is no way to know whether this is the case), the GPS turned itself on when I was in Boston. Really, who can deal with an erratic piece of software like this? It's like having a phone that is a substance abuser.And there really aren't many apps for Symbian 5th Edition, and at the Ovi store (the Nokia house store)the cupboard is all but bare.  The one at that I thought was simple enough that even Symbian could run it was one that turned the camera flash into a flashlight. That worked for about a week before it started crashing the phone every time I used it.

You have to enter in the full contact menu to see the phone number.(Still a defect also found in N81, you have to enter in the contacts to do that)2.- GPS has very low reception, so even a tinted window of the car can block the signal3.- Battery life does not seem to last as much as Nokia claims.4.- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link.5.- Plastic feels like the shell of an egg (but I guess that's the only way to get small but technologically complex devices)6.- Does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7.- Terrible image organizer and editing. In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in!!8.- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder kids, forget about the great engage!So then, why is that I am giving this hot toy 3 1/2 stars?Because it is still dragging some few defects coming from the N81, and considering that I am reviewing a cell phone, beyond the nice extras, after all...The calling experience might not be so fluent...When you call someone, you cannot see their phone number if you need it quickly. I have to go back over the more than 600 contacts to find the phone number I just called... those of you who have a Nokia know how this can bother big time... (based on the same Symbian platform as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate? Same for ending a phone call.The missing 4 way button (from N81) would have been great to navigate the nice extras of the phone without \"aiming\" well with the tip of your finger. But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too.Overall, I recommend (barely) this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated!UPDATE June 17, 2009.Cons... Regarding webmail....1.- If you are answering a message on the webmail (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) say you wrote a paragraph of 10 lines and you need to add something to the 4th line of the paragraph, you CANNOT place the cursor in between, you have to delete all previous 6 lines to get to the position where you can edit your response. Now, if you don't mind that it is fine, I tend to review what I write and often add or rewrite an idea.2.- Since you cannot place the cursor wherever you want to to write webmail, if you are answering an email and you want to include the original senders message (what is normal) your message will start at the end and not the beginning (as normal) In order to start at the beginning you would have to delete the sender's original message!Regarding crashing...3.- In several occasions it has crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery off and put it back.4.- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects... anyone with that problem? I has happened to me 1 in every 10 times or so.I am starting to think that Nokia could read my review to consider these annoying issues on future updates! :))", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "simply the best phone", "Author": "qw", "ReviewID": "R2QVML9RI2CYX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "bought two Nokia 5800 xm phones, one for my wife the other for my daught. they love it no more. best built quality plus basement price, buy if you haven't yet.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a Good Phone", "Author": "R. Lange", "ReviewID": "R354T2T262IZF0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before I purchased this phone, as I always do. Of the unlocked phones that were reasonably priced, this one seemed very promising. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. If you want a phone for its camera/video and audio playback, this would be a decent choice. If you plan on using the phone for sending text messages and you expect quality, stay away! The problems I experienced were as follows:\u00b7 The phone would just lock up and become unresponsive. The only cure for this was removal of the battery. Which, if your phone was in a case like mine, was a huge pain.\u00b7 The screen when in keyboard mode would get tiny pixels (green in color) that would not go away unit you closed the application. The more I used the phone the more frequently this happened.\u00b7 The message light would start blinking at random times, most of the time after I had checked/read a text. Sometimes it would blink once, sometimes twice but very inconsistent in its operation. This is minor but goes toward my thinking that this phone will not last.\u00b7 This phone doesn't support HTML browsing, not a flaw in the phone, but when you go to the Internet you realize what you are missing.\u00b7 When in text mode, you can only see one side of the conversation. Again, not a problem with the phone, but bothersome nonetheless. I had a Blackberry Curve and you don't realize what you have till it's gone.\u00b7 Some of the other reviewers mentioned multiple steps to navigate through the phone, they're right. I think with a little refinement this could be a nice phone.\u00b7 When sending texts there is not support for spell checking, it's just not user friendly. No predictive text, no auto capitalization, all things you miss once your phone doesn't have them.All in all, I would not recommend this phone. I sent it back and purchased the MyTouch Google phone made by HTC and spent $100 less.

Now i feel that I made a huge mistake. I shouldn't have paid [...] for this piece of crap.1. The phone died the first day. Yes.. after couple of hours of use the phone just went black and couldn't reboot after. So had to sent it back to dell and they sent me a new one.2. The touch screen is not responsive at times. You sometimes have to use your nails and press so hard.3. Scrolling on this phone sucks. It is so frustrating when the scroll is so slow and doesn't respond at all sometimes.4. THIS PHONE FREEZES. Yes.. When you are in the middle of a conversation, the phone can go all black. You will be able to talk but won't be able to disconnect the call or do anything else. None of the buttons work, neither do the touch screen. Not even the on/off switch works at this point. You have to manually remove the battery to reboot it. Someday this happens 2 or 3 times. I did read about this problem but didn't believe it will be true for every unit, but it is.5. The dial pad doesn't have alphabets, it has only numbers. So if you want to dial 1-800-amazon or something like that, you have to search for another phone with alphabets and numbers or remember it all.6. Bluetooth is not compactable with my BMW car kit. It connects and disconnects all the time. Nokia asked me to call BMW to get a fix on this. I would rather keep my car than this piece of junk.7. Making a call or getting contact details is sometimes a lengthy process. Contacts and logs are not easily accessible while you are on a call.The phone is not worth the money.

For the first try at a touch phone, it's pretty good but there are just too many other touch phones that have already got the OS right.The Ovi store is still not worth going to.  Only a few of the apps are even made for the 5800.  And most of those were just ported over from the original app to be used with the 5800.The camera should be better.  There is no excuse why a 3.2mp Nokia can't take a decent looking picture indoors.Overall I would say its a nice phone for the price but there are just too many phones out this summer to settle on this one.  However if you are buying a phone for your kids, this wouldn't be a bad choice.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst phone ever", "Author": "iDude", "ReviewID": "R1WS0QFFFRWX12", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst phone I've ever come across, even worse than my other cheap $20 Nokia. I bought this as a gift for my wife and she's only had problems since then (5+ months). Here's the how and the why.- The phone frequently shuts down without warning, sometimes in the middle of calls but most often of its own accord. The only way to \"reboot\" it is to remove the battery. Just recently it refused to start even after the battery was removed and we had to plug into the charger to get it working again, even though the battery had been fully charged the previous day.- It misses calls quite frequently (and no, it's not a network problem because all my other phones have no such issues). For example, I call my wife several times in a row, I can hear the phone ringing on my end but on hers, the 5800 doesn't ring or give the slightest hint that a call is coming through.- The alarm feature is worthless. It never goes off in the morning when my wife sets it but occasionally goes off randomly during the day.- The resistive screen is bad. I realize it's no iPhone but still... a fair amount of pressure is required to operate it and sometimes you need to perform an action twice because it doesn't register.- Scrolling is pretty bad. Don't think iPhone but instead try to imagine a very thin scroll bar on the right side of the screen that you have to target in order to scroll.- The \"web browser\" is pathetic. I had a hard time figuring out how it works (with wifi). It's not really a browser but more like a search box where you enter the web address. There are no classic back, forward, stop, reload buttons but instead a menu that you have to access for these functions. Only browse online if it's a matter of life or death, otherwise the \"experience\" is an exercise in frustration. I'll give it this much though: connecting to a wireless network was fairly painless.- The radio feature is clunky and counter-intuitive, at least compared to my $20 Nokia.- The back cover is a thin and flimsy bit of plastic. That wouldn't be such a big issue if my wife didn't have to remove the battery daily in order to reset the phone.- The SIM card holder has to be the most idiotic system I've ever seen. Inserting it requires the removal of a very flimsy plastic tag. The SIM mechanism isn't spring loaded so in order to remove it you need to remove the back cover, remove the battery, extract the stylus and then push the SIM out using the tip of the stylus.- The GPS is useless. I bought this phone largely because of the GPS, happy that I could get a GPS \"smartphone\" that doesn't require a contract. I still regret it to this day. To get the GPS working you have to be in an open field or perhaps in a desert with nary a tree in sight. Even then, it takes at least 15 minutes (!!) for it to locate a satellite. Once it finds one, it has trouble keeping it locked and it seems to have a hard time updating your position on the screen while moving. If you have a death wish or perhaps masochistic tendencies, try using this feature while driving.- The virtual keyboard is a pain to use. Luckily the other functions (like web browsing and navigation) don't work well enough to require a keyboard so we can get by without one.These are the major issues that bother my wife and I. One redeeming quality is that the map application that comes with the phone is fluid and responsive. Too bad the GPS doesn't work. Good thing we know how to read a map without a GPS.In conclusion, I would advise anyone to stay away from this phone. For what I paid ($270), this is a major ripoff. Honestly I wouldn't even pay $100 for the 5800. $50 or less is a more realistic price, provided you are willing to deal with all its shortcomings and software bugs. Too bad I didn't pay closer attention to the bad reviews before I bought it. I realize that I could probably get this exchanged or repaired under warranty but that's such a big hassle (not to mention being without a phone for the duration) that I'm not willing to put up with it.At least I can claim that I've learned from past experiences and this is the last Nokia phone I'll ever buy. Thanks Nokia! I used to be a big Nokia fan and always had the best opinion for their products but they've lost me as a customer and I'll make sure to inform everyone I can about their poor products.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "\"stuck\" in offline mode", "Author": "Pax Romana", "ReviewID": "R10Y4LM0FOMGPZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Power off your NokiaBefore removing your tiny memory card, take note of the orientation as you are removing it, if you forget RTFM (Read The Find Manual)Power on your NokiaA screen will show up asking if you want to get out of the offline modeSelect \"YES\", thank God!If you select \"NO\", you Idiot!, repeat this instruction from the beginning.Good Luck mate!.....................................Source (Thanks to Nigel):I have a nokia N80 smartphone with the latest firmware (v5).

Without a data plan, these providers automatically charge transferring data per kilobyte as a basic included feature. In addition, any Nokia applications should link directly to the main browser of service network on the phone as a default without any exchange. As a result, a charge should be counted on the phone bill when starting an up-to-date of a firmware or downloading a new application over-the-air.Final words, using Wi-Fi without any charge is only when I already controlled it with the following steps (while I do not need a data plan):1. select Connectivity,2. select Wi-Fi/WLAN (on second line because the default network is on the first line),3. select and connect an IP name (already knowing its WEP),4. select Starting Browser within the above IP to surf the web by hitting it after connected. The data transferring onto the phone at this time is not through the phone Network.(If going out of this path in order to select an internet global icon on menu, this action will turn OFF the already connected Wi-Fi instead of turning ON the default network with an automatic charge).5. ALWAYS make sure to select Disconect WI-Fi (on the same path). Indeed, on the Network browser is a must.One more thing, a GPS device unit is the best, and it is completely free for any things.
