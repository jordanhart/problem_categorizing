{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone!", "Author": "Garret Albertson \"GD\"", "ReviewID": "R38JM7XMPHZYR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my LG 900g from Net10. And while it has more features, it may not necessarily be the best upgrade from a lower end phone. So here are some pros and cons to help you decide.Pros:+ Muve Music- my favorite feature about this phone as $55 dollars not only gets you 1000 talk mins, and unlimited texts and 3g Web/Data, it gets you unlimited music downloaded. Granted, it has it's faults like songs don't download sometimes I just re-download and it's fine. It has Shazam (which is the only thing in Muve that works over wi-fi) its a awesome feature nonetheless+ 3G speed- now where I live (30 miles east of Washington DC) I get pretty good 3G service (sometimes down in the basement) so this is a great thing to have since Foursquare, Facebook, & Twitter all work and update pretty quick, I do get a couple of very brief dead zones (where I don't get signal) I still have good service overall. I haven't tried the partner service yet but will when I go on vacation to the beach in a few weeks.+ Full Google Play Store- Another thing I like is that this phone has the full (for the most part) Google Play store. So if you want to download your favorite sports, music, or social apps, its all there. I could find Shazam and Soundhound as standalone apps, but again just use Shazam inside of the Muve Music app.Now on to the cons:- Storage- One of my biggest gripes with this phone is the internal (and even the SD card that came with this phone) has very little storage space. After installing all of my favorite apps (Foursquare, Tweetdeck, JuiceDefender, ESPN, among others) I only had 15MB internally! That kind of disappoints me as I thought a smartphone would have more storage, and even the SD card which claimed to be 4GB only had 1GB available (I knew about Muve taking up 3GB), seems like the only solution is to root and remove bloatware (which I will do one I get a good USB cable) and then get a larger SD card.- Random shutoffs- This may be a bug but this phone randomly shuts off while in sleep mode. For example, if i'm at work and I use the phone and then put it in my pocket and then go to use it later, I press the power button and its off!! Now I just turn it back on and ignore it but if your turn it back on 4-5 times a day it gets annoying. So be prepared.- Camera- Ok, i'll be flat out honest on this one, the camera sucks. Even using a burst camera app doesn't help it. So if you want a phone with a good camera looks elsewhereNeutrals, could go either way:+/- Battery life- Out of the box the battery life is horrible, but a way to improve the battery life is to download JuiceDefender and put it in \"aggressive\" mode, it really extended my battery from 5-6 hours (if that) to 9-10 hours (no joke!) so i'm leaning to towards positive but we will seeFinal thoughts:The Score is my first Android smartphone and my first Cricket phone and while Cricket's service is not so great for some, it is for me. And it is the cheapest phone, which is obvious by some bugs. Good phone overall and 4 stars. Also, if you head over to Kmart this phone is only $39 until 6/17. So you only pay around $100! Great deal!EDIT 7/18: Since I wrote my review I have rooted the phone and removed the bloatware, and I am currently sitting at around 35 MB of internal memory, also I put in a 8GB SD card. These things have made storage issues nonexistent. As for the random shutoffs they are still there and still annoying, I have been looking at other phones just in case, but all is well now.EDIT 8/6: I have found out that by putting the phone in airplane mode, the phone would not shut off in airplane mode (which also saves battery TREMENDOUSLY!), just make sure you have a WiFi and airplane toggle widget.EDIT 8/18: I have now flashed a custom ROM (exile kitchen) and partitioned the SD card and now have 111 MB of free space internally, along with Adobe Flash (paired with an older version of Dolphin Browser), the phone is now a sure fire winner for anyone wanting a cheap Android phone that (with a few modifications) could be great.

The battery life is absurd! Even if you don't use the phone, it dies within a few short hours. I had the phone less than 60 days and it would no longer hold a charge. I exchanged the phone under the manufacturer warranty and then Cricket wanted to charge me $15 to activate the phone under my existing phone number. I argued with them and they waived the fee. I'm now about 60 days out from having the second phone and it's no longer holding a charge. I purchased an extended warranty through Best Buy when I originally purchased the phone, but I'm not even sure I'm going to exchange it. I'll just end up needing a new phone in another 60 days. Don't waste your time, go with Virgin Mobile or T-mobile. The only thing positive about this phone was the navigation feature... but you can get that on any phone.

The phone is about $25-45 bucks cheaper and has a Muve music plan.  However I stayed with original Android plan since the app market has several options where I can download music for free.  As for the overall performance of the phone, the sound is not as good as the LG Optimus C.  The sound passage is in the back of this unit where the Optimus has the sound come through the earpiece.  The weight of the phone feels lighter than the Optimus.  If you like such than great, personally I like my phones with a little weight in case of damage.  The market though is a 2.3.4 gingerbread which is good but if you looking for certain apps (i.e. on tumblr and go sms) that you may have used on a 2.2 model it won't be found since these apps are not yet supported.  The data memory is awful.  Even using a 16gb card to transfer apps the internal memory fills up quicker than it would the Optimus.  Pros -- like any Droid device if you are familiar with it you won't have a problem.  The screen and browser speed runs crisp despite its 600 mhz versus the 1ghz on the Optimus.  In terms of height, weight and ounces compared to the iphone 4:  4.4 inches x 2.5 inches x 0.5 inches; 4.5 oz (zte); 4.5 inches, 2.31 inches x 0.37 inches; 4.9 oz (iphone).", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life", "Author": "not a happy camper", "ReviewID": "RD9A7AF8XHTC4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even after turning off all battery draining apps the phone will not last a full day on standby.

I don't think I've EVER spent 40 bucks more wisely.MUSIC - MOVIES - APPS - NEWS - WEATHER - CLOCK  -40 bucks....C'mon!I'm not using this \"phone\" as an actual phone, nor do I plan to.I'm going to give it to my daughter so she'll stop borrowing my Android phone to play games, watch movies and listen to music.After setting it up last night (which was pretty simple as I just linked it to MY Google/android account) I couldn't be happier.It has a few quirks, but I found most of the negative reviews on this phone to be way off the mark or just completely wrong.A few things I noticed immediately:Screen resolution was better than I had expected and the viewing angle is quite good and will only blur/darken if you're way off axis.The contrast ratio is very good (but not as good as the AMOLED screen on my Galaxy)The responsiveness of the touch screen was very good - quick and accurate.The screens scroll naturally without lag.The side buttons are a little tough to push for me, but will probably be fine for my daughterApp loading and running is quick for a 533 Mhz processor.I haven't had any issues with any of the apps yet.The Audio chip is not the greatest, but I doubt my daughter will be able to tell the difference between this and her Sansa E240.I downloaded the PowerAmp app and it seems to run just fine.  PowerAmp's great eq settings allowed me to increase the fidelity quite a bit.I am not using the built in Music service or player app.I had absolutely no troubles just dragging and dropping files into a folder I named \"Music\" on the ZTE.  PowerAmp saw it right away after a reboot.Netflix streaming works extremely well and Angry birds is smooth without choppy play.Auto screen rotation doesn't seem to work on all apps, or the main 'desktop' screen itself.  That may be an OS thing - I'm not sure?The camera is ok if you're outside in the daytime or inside with a lot of light - other than that, don't bother (but once again MORE than enough for a kid to love).For the 4GB micro SD card installed, it appears I only have 1GB of 'free' space to put stuff (mp3, apps, etc.) the other 3 gigs is dedicated for music you'd need to download through Cricket's phone plan.  Once again, I don't plan on doing that. I know there are issues with formatting a larger micro SD card and I may end up rooting this thing if I can't just stick a larger one in and have it format.  I've seen several blogs, Youtube video's and user groups that show how to do this.All in all, I think this is a fantastic PMP for a kid.  It runs android well and seems to be fairly well built. And did I mention 40 BUCKS!I'll try to upload a video of the ZTE Score (x500) in action - it should prove many of the naysayers wrong.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "WHY DID THE TEXT MESSAGING STOP WORKING?

The phone is being discontinued, so like I said the price is right. I was looking for a replacment for my zio. First thing I noticed was that my OLD phone had better graphics, I let it go. First off, it drops calls like it's a day job. I don't think I've actually held a conversation on this phone for more than 10 minutes, but I assume it would still be dookie. Facebook runs pretty well, text messaging goes about as well as it could, being cricket afterall. However, the phone does what androids advertise. You do get unlimited free music downloads, internet is pretty good, I'm not too big on apps and games but i assume it'd run pretty well. I read books off of it, my only complaint is the battery when it comes to reading. Also, the phone likes to take naps, as I like to joke. It wont be dead, but I've notice if I don't touch the phone for a while, occasionally it will just shut off. Also, when you buy the phone you already need to update google play & muve music, taking up more space. It comes with a bunch of demos of apps that you can't delete. I have about two apps that i downloaded out of my own will before it runs out of space. I'm paying for the muve music plan, but I had to uninstall it so I could use facebook! It's a cheap phone, it functions as an android just fine, but when I have the pocket change, I will be kicking this phone to the curb. I suggest this phone for the younger generation, if you have children dying for an android. Definitely not something for a busy adult who needs the phone to reliable. Also, I don't find the phone bill worth it, either. You pay an extra 10-15 bucks a month to have the unlimited downloads - but you can't transfer it to any other devices. Not to mention - listening to music off of your phone will kill it in 40 minutes. For another 20 dollars I could have an IPhone from at&t; & actually have service more than 50% of the time.

It comes with headphones, a 4GB microSD card, and a wordldwide 100-240V charger with non-proprietary micro-usb connector. It has a pretty responsive camera with dedicated hardware button!Android 2.3 is pretty nice, with widgets for weather, news etc. Google Play has tons of apps & games, just installed Angry Birds Space and some other stuff which play great. The touchscreen is very responsive as well, it's capacitive with 2-point-multitouch.Another surprise is the rich variety of sensors on this phone: GPS, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer (compass), orientation sensor (gyroscope), proximity, gravity, linear acceleration and rotation vector sensor.Only problem I found with this phone is that certain apps like FIFA 12 and Adobe Flash Player 11 are not supported it seems, not sure why.

The $55 a month isn't so bad when you compare it to other plans out there, but if you can afford it, I'd go with a better phone and a better plan.What I do like about this phone, besides the fact that it's cheap, is the simple fact that it's an android phone and it's my first one.. I've only been using flip phones until now.  It has some nice backgrounds and being able to have apps is cool, but that's about it.What I don't like about this phone is the fact that the battery dies SO quickly.  If you're playing a game or using an app, you should probably have your charger nearby.. It seems to take forever to charge and doesn't last very long once it is charged.Also, there is very little memory and I can't seem to be able to move ANYTHING to my SD card.. I guess the SD card which is included is exclusively for the muve music thing.. It seems to hold roughly 100 megs, which is NOT a lot... Now when I download an app, I have to make room by deleting other apps.The Gmail syncing is atrocious. When I click on my Gmail it's not at all updated.  I've taken the recommended steps to have it synced properly, to no avail. It also notes, however, that if internal memory is low, Gmail will not auto-sync.. Since I have about 10 apps installed, my internal memory is low.. I uninstalled a few of them, and nothing changed.Like I said, if you're on a tight budget and unwilling to commit to a contract as I am, this phone may be for you but I personally have found it to be a bit useless.

You call up, you listen to menus, none of the choices cover what you called for.  When I finally got a guy in the billing department he said he couldn't help me and I should call customer service. They can't transfer you.  The customer service number, when I got through, told me I should call billing. When I asked for a supervisor I was put on indefinite hold, so I called back again and again until they realized they'd better actually let me speak to someone. The supervisor told me that when you port your number the computer automatically cancels your enrollment in automatic payment. It's a known problem, but they don't notify the customer for some reason. OK, so they set me up again, supposedly.  Next day my phone still isn't working. A half hour of menus and sitting on hold and they tell me that it won't work for another thirty days, but I can call another department to make an emergency payment, for which there will be a $5 \"convenience\" fee.  Why didn't the supervisor tell me when she set me up that it would be thirty days and I would also have to make an emergency payment?

I have had several annoyances with this phone. When I first set up the phone, I called in and had them activate it. Well, \"they\" (Cricket support) did not put me on the $55 monthly MUVE music plan. Instead, they put me on a $55 plan that is compatible with all of their phones, not only MUVE ones. So the first month I could not use the MUVE music feature, I wasn't thrilled. The next month I got on the right plan. I really like the application, it does have it's faults though. I noticed that if I download a whole album, it takes a loooooong time for it to download (an hour or more to complete all the songs sometimes). So if you're planning on downloading a bunch of music when you first get it, I would do it at night right before you go to sleep so that way it's done in the morning when you get up. I also noticed that about a week and a half to a week before my service was up, it would take SEVERAL attempts to open the application. It would go to the opening screen, wait, say the application was starting up, and then go back to the main screen. I wondered if maybe I was close to my data limit. My boyfriend who I also bought the same phone for at the same time has said his does the same thing. So I decided to upgrade my plan since I do listen to the music a lot to the $65 plan which is unlimited everything. It still does the same thing, about a week and a half before the service is up it will take me 15 trys to open up the application. I looked online and a Cricket rep said to dial *228 (SEND) on the phone and if it doesn't open and start working after that to take it to the local cricket store. Well, I'm not anywhere near a Cricket store unfortunately for the summer and that didn't work. Finally I did a factory reset and it seems to be working fine since then, but another months of service hasn't rolled around since I did it either. The battery life is nothing to brag about. I always keep an extra charger in my purse and a car charger with me, because the battery doesn't last long. I usually have to charge it twice a day, I am on my phone and using apps a lot so I know that eats into the battery too. Maybe if you don't use the phone constantly it will work perfectly. The speaker when talking to someone is not as loud as it could be either. Don't plan on talking to someone in a busy place with this phone because you won't be able to hear them, even on \"speaker phone\". One last thing I have had a problem with is sometimes (once a week or so) when I am doing something on it the phone completely shuts off and restarts again. I don't do anything too important on my phone though so nothing has been lost in it doing that. Overall, for the price I paid of $50 at Christmas 11 it is not a terrible phone. It does have several problems, but since it's not a contract phone and there are way way more applications available than on my old Verizon Blackberry, I'm going to stick with it.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cricket Will Not Activate Phone", "Author": "No7JackDaniels", "ReviewID": "R3PTX74VCG1DTR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a gift, luckily I was impatient and gave it to them early.  When trying to transfer their existing accout to the new phone Cricket would not allow the transfer.  Next thinking it was something wrong with the automotion, went to the retailer and they appologized, it can be transferred but theis phone did not have unlimited usage, the only available rate plan was a per minute.  This does not meet the advertising Cricket makes availabel for unlimited pricing plans.The problem I had was with the service carrier Cricket.

Cricket is known for issues and I have been with them a couple years now. the price is manageable for me right now and the no-contract is key for me so altho I have had equipment and service issues. I can deal with them because of my reasons for being with Cricket in the first place.Anyhooot.
