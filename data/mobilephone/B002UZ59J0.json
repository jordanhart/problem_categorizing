I was looking for an inexpensive smartphone on which I could view pictures and listen to music. Windows 6.5 is a definite upgrade over the older version, and I am really happy with this phone. The phone looks great and the screen resolution is pretty good for a device in this price range. I also like that the phones displays message data even while the screen is locked. Nifty phone for the price.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC Pure Worse Phone", "Author": "AgentX", "ReviewID": "R1MOEAK75BMK6T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "IT'S JUST BEEN ALL HELL RIGHT FROM DAY 1 OF OWNING THIS PHONE. I read a couple of reviews before buying this phone. There were disappointing comments which I should have paid attention to but I ignored them. But please this is the worse phone you're about to buy. It is stylish and has some cool features but you're just minutes away from the biggest mistake in your life if you buy it. Plainly state, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. AGAIN DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. Some of the things you should know if you still want to buy this phone:1.Expect very low battery capacity. After 30mins - 1hr of talk time, you should charge phone immediately or it'll go off cos of low battery.2.Phone heats up considerable during phone talk times.3.Be prepared for unnecessary power off. That is, the phone can go off by itself even if battery is fully charged.4.Few apps compatibility, I couldn't even run skype on it.5.Freezes at least 5 times a day. Only solution is to remove battery to restart phone. It can even freeze when you're on call or picking up a call.6.Phone hands free device is very bulky.7.THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD KNOW!!!!!!!!!! SCREEN SECURITY CODE!!!!!!! DON'T PUT A SECRET CODE ON YOUR SCREEN. IT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I MADE EVER USING THIS PHONE. IT WORKED PERFECT FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND ONE DAY, IT WON'T ACCEPT MY CODE EVEN THOUGH IT'S CORRECT. I WENT ONLINE ONLY TO READ COMMENTS THAT IT'S A PROBLEM FEATURE OF THE HTC PURE PHONE.  THE ONLY WAY I COULD CLEAR THE SCREEN WAS TO DO A HARD RESET. I LOST ALL MY CONTACTS AND THE APPS THAT I BOUGHT.GOOD LUCK IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN BUYING THIS PHONE.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dumb Smart Phone", "Author": "S. Jacobi", "ReviewID": "R32UNMYPRY7TC6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate this Phone. I've had it for a year and a half now and it doesn't fail in disappointing me. The Processing power is terrible and is always freezing up on me. Reception for this phone is also bad. When it comes to text messaging, you have to go through 3 different displays of the same message before actually typing out your desired message.The phone likes to switch time zones on me too. It switched to California time on me once. And I live in Michigan!! And don't count on the alarm waking you up. It's failed me numerous times.I've taken great care of this phone. But I'm afraid it's below every standard that the market has to offer.I got this phone because I did not want an iPhone.

The latest versions of Windows phones cannot do this. These days the newer versions of software are missing important features.

Do not recommend buying the HTC Pure because it is a terrible phone.  If you wear glasses like I do, this phone is too small visually.  Horrible product and one star is too many to give credit for such a horrible device.  Do not waste your money on this phone.
