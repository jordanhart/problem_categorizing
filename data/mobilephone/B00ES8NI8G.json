Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. 4.3\" Super LCD 2, 720x1280 resolution, 342 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, 16 GB internal flash, 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__ 8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Matthew Kirby", "ReviewID": "RR2ZNE8VXZXG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I ever had, will no longer go back to android or ios.

So far no complaints with the phone, its super fast, camera quality is great, it is super thin though, which is not a bad thing but I feel like its so fragile it might break if I drop it. It came in its retail packing, along with a verizon sim card, manuals, some htc stickers etc. If your thinking of buying this phone, buy it from USA-Tel they offer fast shipping, and the packaging is the best, they sent my phone inside two boxes haha, ensuring my phone get to me in good conditions and protecting it as well.3/9/14 ALRIGHT SO I ORIGINALLY GAVE THIS 5 STARS BUT CHANGED IT TO 3 BECAUSE, THE PHONE WONT SEND MESSAGES. I CAN RECEIVE THEM AND TEXT BACK WITHOUT A \"CAN'T SEND MESSAGE TRY AGAIN\", APPARENTLY MY TEXTS AREN'T RECEIVED, AT FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE ITS THEIR PHONE OR MY SIM CARD. I PUT THE SIM CARD IN A DIFFERENT PHONE AND WORKED FINE.

The phone I received was not in retail package. It was a generic htc package and the phone did not even have the plastic wrap. There was a sticker in the back of the phone. NB 08/13. Research on the internet comes up as New Breed Refurbished Phone inspected on 08/13. There is no warranty information nor user manual. I opted to buy this phone as the order was fulfilled by Amazon. The phone did not have any visible damage and so far in the past 4 days I did not have issues and the windows update went well. This is why I'm keeping this phone. There is always a disappointment when you receive the product not per the description. So buyers keep this in mind while ordering.

Check if your seller is an authorized retailer", "Author": "S. Wen \"sunnysmom\"", "ReviewID": "R10UR3EANRSH5B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my HTC 8x new from a retail seller on Amazon. It was new and unopened. However, after 4 months, the three buttons on the bottom stopped functioning. I have never dropped it and always take great care of it. I thought HTC has good quality, but this happened within 4 months! So I sent it back to HTC and provided all receipts to proof that I only had this for 4 months, HTC still wants to charge me since HTC does not cover phones not purchased from Amazon. Be aware of it!

I bought the phone with high hopes because my iPhone was taking a crap. When I ordered this phone, I was expecting to get a package in the mail containing a brand new, in the box phone ready to be activated with the books that would normally come with it. But that's not what I got. The phone came wrapped in a plastic bag placed inside a plastic container containing simply just the phone, a charger, and a sticker with the order number and such on it. I was very disappointed. But that's not the only thing that upset me. When it came time to activate the phone, I was on the phone with Verizon for an hour and 19 minutes trying to activate it. The Verizon representative told me that the phone was not registered with Verizon. I was furious. We did however get it registered and activated and I've been using it for about a week. I like the phone itself overall but this specific phone has glitches when I'm in a call. It will randomly end calls, or when I'm in a call the screen won't shut off like its supposed to when I hold it to my ear, causing me to press buttons with my face. I could ramble on and on about the phone  but I'm going to leave it at that and just say that I would not recommend anybody to buy this specific phone from this specific seller.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE", "Author": "T Gilham", "ReviewID": "R1A1WL8OILJ3RS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not only did i have to wait a long time for the product it has already malfunctioned.
