The quality is a strong appearance and a strong feel. The only ONE problem is the battery. It has to constantly be recharged. Send 10 text messages and the phone shuts down. Talk for 10 minutes or less the it will turn off right in the middle of a conversation.

It locks up and freezes the entire phone.  LG Customer support website is so bad that it won't allow a repair order to be generated.  I have alos filed a customer support ticket has resulted in no response so far as well.  Might be a great phone except the music player.

It is not a smart phone, but it works very well. The battery leaves something to be desired, but you can pick up an extra for about $5 so that's not really a big deal for me at all. Why did I give it four stars tho? Because you can use it to tether. I have the $50 a month unlimited prepaid plan from AT&T; and so far I have been able to use the tethered connection perfectly well. It's only 3g speeds so it's nothing exceptional, but it's certainly useful. If you want a cheap way to tether, you should consider this phone.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Things are never what they seem (in pictures)", "Author": "L.C.R", "ReviewID": "RZKTRG66RM8KZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not much of a phone snob, and i don't like \"smart phones\".  A simple, quality cell phone is good enough for me. This is why i decided to purchase the LG Shine Cf360.  I have had an LG Shine before, but in a different model.  In any case, the LG phone i used before was a great phone.  Good quality.  This phone? It was worse than a \"play phone\" you get for your child at Toys-R-Us.  Aside from the poor quality of the phone, it did not even work!  I charged it fully and the phone would not turn on.All in all... a bad purchase.  Don't buy this phone unless you want a disposable cell phone (in which case, you can just get yourself a Go Phone).", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LG SHINE CF360 BLUE 3G AT&T; GSM UNLOCKED\nLG SHINE CF360 BLUE 3G AT&T; GSM UNLOCKED LG SHINE CF360 BLUE 3G AT&T; GSM UNLOCKED", "Name": "LG CF360 Unlocked GSM Slider Phone with GPS, 1.3MP Camera, Bluetooth, Music Player and microSD Slot - Blue/Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41abZQbmYsL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005GMRAXW"}}
