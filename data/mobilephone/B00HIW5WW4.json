They've implemented something I thought was missing in the stock Android mail client in swiping to move an email instead of only being able to delete it.The camera is by far one of the best I've ever used on a phone. Low light photos are consistently better than on coworkers phones probably due to the larger sensor and ability to collect more light with a shorter exposure.One of the best phones I've ever had (I've had a lot).I did take away one star due to the glass that is used to make the front and rear of the device. It is the most easily scratched glass I've ever seen used on a mobile device. If you get one make sure to order your screen protector IMMEDIATELY so you can have it on the device as soon as it comes out of the box.Another small gripe is that the device is designed such that it attracts a lot of dust, you can wash it off though since it's waterproof.Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "The right phone for me", "Author": "JJSomeDude", "ReviewID": "R2CO9YC1X7B8E6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is top of the line. It doesn't crash it doesn't have any compatibility problems with anything, blazing fast and waterproof. it got soft corners and slides into my pocket with ease. the interface is easy, and for music and media lovers I recomend it, sony has always been ahead in that department. the screen looks awesome for its size, the colors are ridiculously bright  with the Xperia Xreality engine turned on. side buttons are easier to operate than top buttons.  you can turn on the phone and zoom in out with the volume buttons, and the camera button is dual action, you can focus with soft press, then shoot with full press. for underwater shots.I ride scooters and motorcycles so I don't have time to move my phone a lot, if it starts raining I no longer have to worry. I also went to a Disney world vacation and it was raining, I was glad to take all the pics under the rain with no problems.Some people complain that the glass attracts fingerprints and dirts etc. if you're a germophobe, or a person wtih a cleanliness OCD, maybe its not for you? a quick wipe away is all I need. The speaker is in the bottom so you have to hold your hand in a cup position to direct the sound to you.Camera shots are great, comes with many photo useful apps, and no bloatware. Expandable memory and whatnot. This phone is blazing fast. I recommend you get the magnetic charger adapter so you dont have to open the usb port every time, and order all covers and glas protectors before you guy the the phone, you can't find anything in the US for it anywhere!!the only glitch i found was the audio would go away after 5 seconds into a call.

I've heard problems with different brands from friends who had used their phones for at least 3 months. I did a lot of research before buying this phone. Understanding the pros and cons of the product really helps and I have no buyer's regret after 2 months of heavy usage.Pros:- Great camera (on the back) quality. Check out the \"time-shfit\" shots. I also downloaded the \"defocus\" camera app.- Speedy phone with lots of ram (2GB) comparing to other phones of similar size. This helps when you play graphical intensive games or doing a lot of multi tasking. Extra ram also gives you faster web browsing.- Great batter life. At the end of the day like midnight, usually it's around 30% battery level. That's with 1 hour of gaming and another hour of web browsing, texting, talk, etc. I enabled \"stamina\" mode to achieve this.- Reliability. Usually web reviews won't or couldn't tell you if the phone is reliable or not.... like phone crashes, LTE went dead (i.e. you get no data when you KNOW for sure you are in a LTE zone), drop calls, screen don't turn on after phone call, GPS drains your battery like hell. With this phone, I only have one LTE went dead scenario but that's when I'm riding a moving subway train.- Front and back glass design really gives a premium feel, not something cheap. This reminds me of 3rd gen APPL phone.- Optional expandable 64GB storage- Waterproof, if you care... there's no headphone plug cover so you don't have to worry about removing the cover every time you listen to music.- KitKat 4.4 is already out and so far I haven't experience any bugs with this version.Cons:- USB plug cover. You need to remove the cover every time you charge. This is the draw back of waterproof feature. I got around this by buying the docking station. The docking station charging speed meets my expectation... like other phones I had before.- Speaker quality not so great. If you use a headphone to listen to music, then it's not a big deal. Phone calls (putting on speaker) is good enough for me.- Front and back glass is vulnerable to scratches.Well, there you have it. I give it a 5 star because I just want a phone that looks and feels good in the hands, not too thick, battery last 24hrs, and speedy gaming and web browsing experience. And most importantly, reliability! No crash, no drop calls, no audio issues!", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best in its class!", "Author": "Besh", "ReviewID": "R22AN5K4ERU7IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Long story short, if you are searching for a top notch phone with high end specs with a compact form then the only choice you have is this phone! Yes this phone and nothing else even comes close, at least until the time of this review.Most phone nowadays are getting bigger because apparently the majority nowadays thinks that bigger is always better, well maybe at other things but not always. Anyway that's not our main subject is it now? Bottom line the competitors are the HTC one mini and the Galaxy S4 mini which both have mediocre specs at best compared to this beast which offers everything the top dogs have and more.Here is a list of the pros and cons:Pros:1- A bright 4.3 inch IPS display panel that's razor sharp and reflects vivid colors. One of the best I've seen on any smartphone.2- The phone fits very well in hands because of Sony's omni balance design.3- The phone is upgraded to 4.3 Android and will soon receive Kitkat!4- loud and clear speakers! This applies for both internal and external speakers.5- A 20 MP shooter which beats the competition hands down.6- A water and dust resistant phone! Now how awesome is that?!7- expanded SD card memory option.Cons:1- The volume buttons could be easier to press but I promise you nothing to be concerned about.2- Since it's a water and dust resistant phone all ports need to be covered with the exemption of the 3.5 mm jack.Would I recommend it? Yes Definitely in a heart beat!

Couldn't understand why consumers with good eye-sight want these huge devices. Enjoying using Sony's UI. They've been very good on updates. Just got KitKat a week ago, & just received update from Sony to fix bugs on this device from that update. \"Sony is on it!\" regarding support for this device, so far. Camera is okay; dedicated camera button is VERY convenient, u can open camera app by holding button anytime, and it's fast to respond.  Dropped from 3-4ft & got a little ding on side; it has a solid quality feel. It comes with this ASF on front&back; that is another complete discussion; I'm leaving mine on for now since it's still new to me.  Been underwater w/video 1.5ft in kiddie-pool w/kids; no issue other than it takes 1-2minutes to get water out of speaker & mic for clear audio after being submerged. Software is nice and haven't had a reason to root, yet? Still learning device. The camera software is particularly interesting; a lot to offer. External speaker rating: Poor; seems as if there is 1 small speaker on bottom left; u can actually cover it up (while holding it) & hear nothing, but it's 'alright' loud just not impressive.  Main Reason For Purchase was it's the only 2GB RAM, QuadCore, +5MP, phone out that's comfortable to hold. I've been happy with this purchase!

I knew about any and all issues before buying. That said this device actually exceeded my expectations. Its a compact flagship device with pretty great look and feel. Reminds me of the old Sony Ericsson candy bar phones I used to have. The OS is ever so slightly modified and I actually don't mind it. Being a stock/CM fan, I was surprised that any modifications made Android better, not worse. The only reason I would root is to get App Ops permissions working on 4.4. The process is more involved than just about any other device I've had and still requires a Windows machine to do it. Needless to say, I don't expect much modder community support on this one, but it does look like there is a small, passionate group.Pros:- Compact, quality build, with great specs.- Water proof, dust proof.- Great battery life. I've been seeing 24hrs+. Nexus 5 was about 12hrs.- Camera and auto camera setting are just plain awesome.- Works on TMobile USACons:- All buttons (power, volume, camera) as small and hard to press.- Lint and grease is worse than I imagined.

Problem is, all of the reasonably sized android phones are severely underpowered. Until this phone - finally someone has made a decent sized phone with incredible specs - this thing is blazing fast, never hesitates. I would actually prefer the phone to be a bit smaller, but I'm not expecting any smaller phone with similar specs to be released anytime soon.I've been using the phone for almost 3 weeks now. I haven't had any issues or bugs come up in the stock Sony 4.3 ROM. I read a few complaints about this phone on sony forums and XDA before I bought it, but I haven't experienced any of them. The Sony 4.3 ROM is incredibly stable - probably the most stable I've used on an Android phone. I didn't upgrade to Kit Kat because of the bugs reported, but Sony has reportedly released an improved Kit Kat build. I'm not eager to upgrade to that because of Kit Kat's limitations with sdcard. Eventually I'll probably end up on CM11 (which is also reportedly very stable for this phone), but I'm happy with 4.3 for now. Rooting 4.3 is a pretty complex process which I have not attempted yet, but will try to do so soon.Overall, I'm very pleased with this phone and its size/performance combination. Hopefully this will sell well and other manufacturers will take note that there are consumers out there looking for small, high powered phones.edit: forgot to mention that I'm using on T-Mobile USA and both H+ and LTE work fine.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lived up to my expectations", "Author": "Alexander M.

I had seen some unboxing videos but those were feature and size oriented.  I am an early adopter and have owned the Galaxy Note 2 and 3 respectively as well as the Galaxy Gear watch.  I have found that the Samsung products were glitchy.  Constant crashing of apps.  Bluetooth that won't stay connected.  Plastic cases. Fragile glass.  Ridiculously overpriced out of plan.Sony has produced the finest Droid phone I have ever used.  Stabile.  No errors.  The glass, according to specs, is not Gorilla but on close inspection is something similar and drop test videos show virtually unbreakable. Loaded with features this \"compact\" easily offers all the top sellers do but never crashes.  The Bluetooth is amazing.  Streaming high quality audio with either the Walkman app or the Droid/Google Play store music player is seamless and powerful.  There are even some Sony Specific perks that aren't offered by any Us carrier like Xperia Privilege.  Finally the camera.  I could buy this device just for the camera. 20+ Mp of juicy feature rich still and video ability.  Easily accessible with the dedicated shutter button, grabbing quick video is a second away.And finally the thing I was most worried about.  Using the Unlocked Sony Xperia Z1 Compact on the ATT Network.  I slid my Sim.card in with trepidation.  Nowhere online could I find anything positive about that.  I was astonished when 2 minutes after turning on my device, not only was it speeding along in 4glte, but ALL MY APPS, SETTINGS AND DATA AUTOMATICALLY  DOWNLOADED FROM GOOGLES CLOUD.

Kroesen", "ReviewID": "R1UWK95ESDAIW3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Once my flip phone died after a good 6 year life, I decided to finally upgrade to a smart phone. I work in medicine, so had previously purchased an iPod touch 5 (really an iPhone 5 w/o the phone) o that I'd have access to medical reference apps. Rather than carry two objects around (cellphone+iPod touch) it made sense to me to consolidate into one device.My iPod touch is awesome, first off. Excellent camera, excellent display, thin, and well designed. I wanted an android phone though, because i liked the idea of a having a little more freedom, having the android file management system (I need to store a lot of documents on my phone), not being locked into the apple world, and significantly, wanted something I could get wet. After reading around about various android phones (w/ my irrational dislike of samsung), the xperia seemed like the best choice for t-mobile. Same size as an iPhone5, not too fat, and apparently good specs.First impressions: (don't just read the bads)BADS:1. display colors are ... a little jarring. Blues aren't as vibrant or deep, reds are a little offensive, and shades of white and off-white blend together more than they should. When I look at the same photo of a sunny hawaii beach on the sony and iPod, it looks much better on the iPod.2. Camera is worse than the iPod touch, for more or less the same reasons, plus more noise and less sharp. Photos actually look pretty good, but not iPhone/iPod good.3. Design is clunky. Things aren't nearly as beautiful or stylish as in iOS. I hadn't used an android phone before, but expected it to work much the same way as iOS. Unfortunately, the phone comes preloaded with a gazillion apps, including both a sony version (I guess) and a google version. Mail vs Gmail? Messages vs Hangouts? Maps vs Google Maps? Facebook vs Xperia Facebook? Photo album vs Google Photos? Office Suite vs play books vs Google Drive vs Quickoffice. Initially each time you open something, it asks which app you want to use. Then it has other weird, nonfunctional programs like xperia privilege, sony select, movies. Not elegant. None of pdf reader apps (it comes preinstalled w/ like 3) let you preview 10 pages at a time, unlike iBooks, but Adobe reader seems to work the best.4. A little buggy/not intuitive: For photos, both apps are clunky compared to iPhoto, and both like to dim the screen once you've selected a photo to look at, making it impossible to see them. I figure I'm doing sth wrong there, because I'm certain they aren't supposed to work like that. Screen brightness is a constant battle with this phone. When selecting brightness, the preview isn't what you get (reality is darker.)Xperia on an apple computer: the phone installs some application on your computer to transfer files between computer and the xperia. It works pretty well if you don't care about organization so much. I have some beloved iTunes playlists on my computer and iPod, but you can't transfer playlists. You can transfer all the playlist songs easily, but have to manually recreate the playlist on the xperia. Pain in the ass. Photos transfer easily from iPhoto, but do not arrive in as organized a fashion. Besides these gripes, it works really well.GOODS:1. Android file commander is so much nicer to use than a 3rd party documents app on iOS. For someone who uses a lot of pdfs, it's very handy.2. Radio app is awesome. Now I can listen to NPR anywhere!3. V. customizable! There are a lot of themes you can download, which are fun and change the appearance of android. You can remove all the hideous large applets covering your display (no I don't want a flip book of movies on my desktop), and make your screen look pretty clean. Android is pretty easy to navigate once you figure it out.4. All the initial headaches from changing from iOS to android are mostly over, and I use the device easily now.5. Sony walkman is a cool music app. I just wish it preserved my playlists.6. Waterproof? So handy..7. External speaker is pretty good!8. Battery life: as someone who doesn't have the phone out all day, I charge it every other day w/o worrying about it dying. It does a good job preserving battery life as it nears empty.9. Attractive, solid feeling device. I played with my friends Galaxy, and that thing felt like a cheap POS.Conclusion: I probably would have been happier buying an iPhone 4s, or waiting for the new iPhone to buy an iPhone 5, (largely because I didn't realize iPhones have a proprietary messaging system, which doesn't communicate great w/ android phones, and most of my friends/family have iPhones) but I'm pretty happy with this, and don't regret the purchase.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Mike H.", "ReviewID": "R2024HVT95CWA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The box did not have the factory seal on, but there was no indication that the phone was not new.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a 4.0\" phone, with horrible LCD and handling. Bad Camera software.", "Author": "uzevla", "ReviewID": "RE2S2X9KILNCQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My biggest concern with this phone are the soft buttons that are enabled on the screen even in Chrome, PDF and so on. Even more, they don't rotate. So if you are reading some text horizontally what you get is some 4.0\" of usable space. This is very bad as other devices I used (e.g. Nexus 7) always put the soft buttons on the bottom of the screen so if I am to read something I do have the whole width of screen. Howerver, youtube does use the whole screen so there is at least one good thing.Usually I don't care about the top notch LCD quality - I had an LG L9 and was perfectly happy with its screen, knowing that its lower quality helps with the battery life. And it's not that it was that bad. Actually it was brighter than e.g. Samsung SG3 while having similar sharpness. The only thing that was missing were fake punchy colors amoled does.When I heard about this special Sony LCD I said great - I don't need HD and amoled gimmicks, just give me something decent that is not a power hog. However, this Sony has the worst screen I've ever seen, from the first days of android. For example, the colors are all messed-up -  it's like having an 8-bit picture and then you try to expand its dynamic range, colors, contrast etc. to make it punchy- that just doesn't work... Also, yet to see some nice black letters - they are all just gray and not so sharp.To conclude about the LCD: when I put this phone next to a dirty cheap LG L9, it's screen looks way to small and ugly.About the handling: When I take this phone into my hand it just feels wrong. LG L9 is some 1.5mm wider but also much thinner, resulting in the body that is much easier to handle - whenever I take LG L9 it fits right. Z1 never feels right. Actually,  I was ready to accept this bulk because I need a sturdy phone but this one is just a way too big for a 4.0\" phone.Although I break phones easily, do need big battery, do need SD card and do want a smaller phone I finally sold it - would rather risk breaking another phone, or diving with it, than carrying this one with me anymore.A note about the camera: It's just too crappy in the dim light due to the pixel size (Exmor RS BSI just can't help it as the pixel size is a way too small). Also, the camera software is very bad and full of useless gimmicks. Essentially, it fails to properly expose and properly use the flash.
