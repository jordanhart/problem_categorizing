It has a sleek dynamic appeal and it's loaded with features and apps.There's just isn't much you can NOT do with this phone.Unlike any BlackBerry, it is a REAL smart phone thanks to the ANDROID OS.I went shopping for a GOOD phone at a reasonable price and came out with the Samsung GT-9100 Galaxy S II phone, what a wonder. This is actually a \"PALM PC\" that makes calls!TEN star rating from ME! * * * * * * * * * *", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a fraud", "Author": "Eva Carolina Godoy Contreras", "ReviewID": "R1IIBILXNV3RKO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At the beginning I had no problems with the phone, but now the screen turns off for no reason and will  not turn. I have neither dropped nor wetted  the phone. I took it to an authorized dealer of the Samsung and they told me that the phone is not original but refurbished with electronic parts that are not original samsung . That being the cause for its malfunctioning. This is a fraud.Don't buy it!", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Randoll", "ReviewID": "R15PV5S9LE6F84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's very fast, very nice, I bought this phone for my girlfriend and she is fascinated, she love it .", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive Chinese fake: DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Gal Kaminka", "ReviewID": "R3DPS3ISL8L2IT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Despite coming in a Samsung box, with the right logo and everything you'd expect,this is a cheap (in the sense of quality, not in price) Chinese fake.
