{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good 4G LTE Phone With Limited Apps Storage", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2E09A49HQ3O1X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG F3 is Virgin's first 4G LTE phone with both a light and compact body and an affordable price. It is sometimes discounted to under $100, making it a bargain.A MAJOR flaw: a tiny 1.2gb of internal memory for apps and app updates. If you are willing to learn how to overcome this flaw, the F3 is a terrific phone. The LG Optimus F3 is half the price of some much larger, much heavier 4G LTE phones.A MINOR flaw:  Wi-Fi connections can be flaky.  Half a web page downloads and then Wi-Fi disconnects.  I must reset my home router several times a day.The F3 provides up to 24 hours per battery charge compared with 10 hours for many 4G LTE Android phones. Weak points include a mediocre camera and average rear speaker for music, and a processor too slow for some demanding games.You can add a 16gb or 32gb SD card to store your music and videos but the limited internal memory will block the installation of some very large games. I was able to move some of my larger apps to the external SD card, but Google apps, such as Maps and Navigation must remain in internal memory.FREEING INTERNAL MEMORY: You can free a ton of internal memory in \"settings\" by going to the \"all apps\" tab. Next, look at every app using more than 1 meg of memory. If you don't use an app, uninstall its updates, uncheck notifications, then select delete or disable.Apps most people can delete or disable include Google+, Google Books, Google Magazines, Google TV, Google Books, and the Chrome browser app. Be sure to uninstall all updates before disabling an app. You can re-enable an app in the future.CASE WARNING: The Sprint/Virgin Mobile LS720 model has different body contours and microphone placment compared with the T-Mobile/MetroPCS MS659 version. Wedging your phone into the wrong size case may damage your phone. When you buy a case, make sure the vendor is selling you the correct case.This is a  good phone if your neighborhood has strong Sprint/Virgin coverage. The coverage map at the Virgin Mobile website enables you to zoom in to see the signal strength on your block.If you live in an area not served by the Virgin Mobile 4G LTE network, you can buy the GSM version of the LG F3 from T-Mobile or for a lower price from MetroPCS.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 4G Value from Virgin Mobile", "Author": "Dr. Gary E. RAFE", "ReviewID": "RFDGVFKQASKKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will be my 4th Android smartphone & 3rd from LG.  After 2 years with the LG Optimus V on Virgin Mobile (VM), I get T-Mobile prepaid a try when I found their LG Optimus L9 at a good price earlier this year.  Too bad T-Mobile's prepaid plans aren't as good as VM's, neither is their mobile data network in this part of NW Ohio.  So after a month of limping along with a serious Android device, I went back to VM with their Samsung Galaxy S II 4G (as in WiMax).  The build quality of the Samsung is quite good, but I never got used to holding the thing, it's a little to large for my liking (see my review elsewhere on Amazon).  I did get to like the size of the display (very little squinting needed), and the speakerphone in the car was good enough I didn't need my Bluetooth speakerphone (much).  And of course, WiMax is doomed, so the 4G on that device was useless.  So when I saw that VM was offering the LG Optimus F3 with 4G LTE, I got one, although Sprint doesn't have much 4G in OH yet.My first impression of the hardware was favorable: I like the physical Home button, and the build quality is acceptable (I don't think it's as cheap as other reviewers).  The size is about right for me, especially the thickness (same as the Samsung).Other reviewers' complaints/concerns about the internal memory (1.2 GB) are unfounded, in my opinion.  I installed all the apps I was using on the Samsung, and still have 600+ MB remaining (that's way more than the ancient Optimus V had to begin with).  Worried about space for music, ringtones, photos, etc. ?  Get a fast microSD card and put those things there.  And VM/LG didn't add too much bloat to the phone; at least they give ways to remove much of it.Swapping from the Samsung to the LG was smooth enough, though VM's instructions could be a little clearer (how often do they think the average VM customer swaps their phones, anyway?).The 4.0in, 800x480 display is small compared to the 4.7in display on the Samsung, but the resolution is the same, so we're not missing anything (it's just smaller).  For this resolution, the 4.0in screen is just fine.  Screen brightness in outdoor ambient light is OK, too.  I like the Screen Brightness control in the Notification bar Quick Settings: tap for low, half, full, & a custom setting - who needs more than that ?This phone comes with Android 4.1.2 without too much LG modification.  I like that LG didn't mess with the stock Call Reject feature; Samsung either hid or disabled it, so a 3rd party app was needed to have the phone reject calls from a black list, also on 4.1.2.Connectivity is decent enough on 3G  & good on WiFi - I get a 19Mbps connection from my home office on the 3rd floor of our late 20s frame house with the router in the basement.  And while 4G LTE continues to roll-out (none in NW Ohio yet), throughput is impressive when I can find a 4G signal in SE Michigan (around Detroit Metro Airport) - 350kbps vs 17,000kbps.  The GPS receiver seems to perform well, too (look out Garmin).The 5MP camera is fine for a smartphone camera -- remember, it's (mostly) a phone, not a camera.  It's very fast, and has decent resolution.The speakerphone is on the anemic side, so unless you're driving an Audi S8 with an active sound isolation system, best to pair the F3 with a Bluetooth device.  And while I'm on the topic, voice calls to both land-line & mobile phones sound fine (on both ends).And I shouldn't forget to mention the battery life with the stock 2,460 mAh battery -- it is astounding.  The Samsung Galaxy S II needed to be charged constantly as soon as any data connectivity was involved (WiFi or G3).  As other reviewers have suggested, I fully expect that the F3 could go days between charges if one only used the phone or SMS text messages.  But what would be the point of that ?I don't mind that the phone doesn't have a mobile WiFi Hotspot.  For as little use as that would get, I don't plan on paying extra for that, anyway.Bottom line: the LG Optimus F3 is a great 4G value if you can take advantage of it.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A nice phone that that should have been great", "Author": "chickenscrawl", "ReviewID": "R195DVAPCITJU5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Most of the reviews on this phone are pretty accurate. The F3 is relatively compact and comfy in hand. The screen resolution is far from the sharpest available but photos and text and images seem especially vibrant on this phone compared to most in the same price range on Virgin. Build quality though, while super plistic-y, seems solidly made. 4G speed is as good as promised, it's rather sad storage limitations mean you can't make the best use of heftier apps and games in your library.The LG skin slid over the Android OS (4.1) is not especially exciting, in fact, it's rather text heavy, yet, very clear and easy to navigate through. It's unlikely you'll get confused locating your apps and the various features of the F3 using it. Speaking of apps, LG must be seriously penalized for shipping a phone with only 1.2GB of useable memory and then blocking users from installing apps on a (up to 32GB!) memory card. Many have blamed the version of Android for this horrific problem- it ain't true. The blame falls squarely in LG for this this terrible design choice as there is no reason for any current Android phone to not be able to store and run apps from a card with ease. Sure, storing music, video and other media on the card is nice. But with so, so many apps available that can easily be run from the space of a SD card, intentionally crippling a good product like this is both insulting and infuriating.For instance, the F3 comes with Polaris' document viewer. A decent enough program. However, if you should want to want to edit or create such docs in the bus depot- you'll need an app like Polaris Office or QuickOffice. These are comparatively large programs, so, you'll chew up lots of system RAM. Many games and podcast libraries that should play generally well on this phone, because of their size, will not be able to entertain you with this limitation. A shame really. This issue can be addressed in a firmware update, but, don't hold your breath waiting for VM to open the gates for such a needed bit of code.The F3's speaker isn't exactly a strong point either. Overall, while it gets adequate volume for conversations or music, at higher levels all audio becomes startlingly sharp. There's some odd distortion was heard during conversations with the volume cranked up. The speaker should scare away music fans, but, it will get the job done in a pinch. It's best to stick with earbuds as often as possible.The four-inch screen sports an exceptionally standard resolution of 480x800. It's far fron the highest resolution but, pictures and text seem somewhat clearer compared to most other similarly priced VM phones. The battery life is the true stunner here. With up to 16 hours of continuous power available, many users should last almost all day even with pretty heavy wi-fi use.The Optimus F3 is a good phone. Performance is passable and the screen is quite nice. The speaker is rather disappointing. Still, it's the blocking of access for apps to sd card that kills off much functionality. This 'feature' really brings the phone down to a level of mediocrity it should have easily avoided.The F3 is a solid and potentially speedy phone that should have been a real contender.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectations for an entry-level Android device", "Author": "Mike Frerkes \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "RTF8LL66TCC5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With Virgin Mobile's ever-expanding roster of Android (and now iOS) phones, it's safe to say the Optimus F3 is somewhere between an entry-level and mid-range device in the world of prepaid mobile.  The dual-core processor is powerful enough to handle most apps, with the exception of some demanding 3D titles.  The 4\" screen is certainly above average for a phone in this category, but it might disappoint those hoping for an S3/iPhone 5 experience.  Probably the most enticing aspect of the F3 is its battery life.  This is one of the few Virgin Mobile Android phones I've had (and I've had many) that can easily go a full day on a complete charge.  With the Moto Triumph and EVO 4G, you were lucky to make it to mid-afternoon before the low battery notifications began firing off.Being a entry-level/mid-range device, you'll find most of the hardware to be entirely  acceptable but not incredible.  The camera does a serviceable job at 5MP and has a very quick response.  It also shoots HD video fluidly enough to share with your social circle without having to apologize for the quality.  The touch screen and buttons also respond in a way that most people would find sufficient.The two biggest complaints I've seen -- speaker quality and internal memory  -- are certainly merited.  However, this is a sub-$200 phone, so not everything is going to be the absolute best.  The speaker will probably be annoyance for anyone who listens to music or uses speakerphone.  It is pretty weak and distorts at higher volumes.  Bluetooth and/or a good pair of headphones can solve that problem easily, however.  The lack of memory (1 GB internal) isn't a huge problem for me personally, but if you're an app-aholic who simply can't let go of your more infrequently used titles, the F3's minimal storage could pose a logistical hurdle.For a phone under $200, the Optimus is definitely a good value.  It has some nice features, like NFC, 4G LTE capability, and Corning Gorilla Glass 2, you wouldn't normally expect in this price tier.  If the speaker was a little better, and it had more internal memory, there's no doubt this phone would be the best value in all of prepaid mobile.  As it is, the F3 certainly deserves the four-star rating I gave it in this review.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my new Optimus F3", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RY3KARON4MXN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I love my new Optimus F3.

Best parts I like about the Optimus F3 is that it have a  more powerful  processor, more RAM memory, a larger screen, a newer version of jellybean and a front and rear camera.  All these new feature gave me no regrets about dropping my Elite for the F3. The Optimus F3 have given me a totally new smartphone experience.

I am 58 yrs old so this review is for the older crowd, less about how many apps you can use, more about how intuitive and easy this phone is to use. The well thought out home screen can hold all of your pertinent short cuts. A quick swipe from the top, gives you quick access to, sound, wifi, sync, and quick memo. Email setup is easy, with plenty of settings to increase or limit the number of emails stored on the phone. I sync my contacts with Google, fast and easy. Searching contacts is simplified by tapping one of the alphabet letters running down the screen on the right. No more flicking endlessly to get to contacts starting with \"y\"Placing and receiving calls is seamless. Battery life is excellent and the \"%\" of battery life remaining can be displayed next to the battery icon. I talked 5hrs on a Bluetooth head set yesterday and still had 38% remaining. last but not least, the screen is crisp and clear with touch inputs responding exactly as you intend, hard to \"fat finger\" a text. The voice to text option is the most accurate I have ever used. Words appear almost as fast as I speak.

My gripes are the terrible speaker on the back, 3G data performance, and the rear 5MP camera.  Otherwise, the phone screams for the price.  I upgraded from the HTC One V, and this phone is so much better, especially if you can get LTE in your area (as this phone is LTE capable).More about the cons:1)Terrible speakerphone performance.  When you raise the speaker on the back to more than 25% of max volume, your calls are heavily distorted and barely understandable.  Since I perform most of my calls on speakerphone, this is a big negative for me.2)3G data on Sprint network.  If you are unlucky like me and have very few LTE towers in your area, 3G data is a huge problem on Sprint.  On most days, daytime 3G data is intermittent at best.  e.g. if I try to stream a 32k TuneIn Radio stream, I often get data flow problems so many times I give up on listening.  However, I have two LTE towers a couple of towns away from my house and LTE works flawlessly on this phone.  I regularly get less than 50ms pings and 20Mbps+ down / 5Mbps+ up on LTE.3)Rear 5MP camera.  The rear camera is mediocre at best.  Don't expect anything close to excellent shots with this one.I hope this helps.  The phone starts up fast, Android 4.1 is smooth, and the F3 is an overall excellent value.

On Apps to SD card I know for sure every cell has this problem but its ONLY BECAUSE GOOGLE CHANGED IT and never a manufacturer.It also specs in most areas just like the Iphone 4S too but you get more features and PRICE LOL!!!!!!! Worse thing about LG F3 is the User Interface is very busy and too much in my opinion.OK so you get a great performer with Huge battery and lots of good features just like Samsung Touchwiz but I don't really like the White Interface in Settings and elsewhere (BIG Deal).

This is my third Optimus, I started off with with V, then upgraded switched to the Elite, now I'm with the F3.

I can't tell everyone how the 4G is because Virgin Mobile told me they didn't have 4G in my area, but the 3G works great. The only small issue is the little internal memory you get, and even when you but a sd card, you still cant transfer the apps to it, like you could do on the Elite. But you can put music, pics, etc on the sd card. So the best thing to do for internal memory is to delete the uninstallable preloaded apps, all of them cant be deleted but a majority of them can.

Which makes me kinda afraid a little that I might drop the phone on the ground. The back cover on the phone does have some texture to it but it does feel a little slippery. Best bet is to buy a nice case that has a good feel and offers good grip as well.The LG Optimus F3 comes with a 2460mAh Li-ion battery which is big for a phone of this size. The most enticing aspect of the F3 is the battery life without a doubt. You can go the full day without having to worry about recharging the phone which is nice.Being a mid-range device you'll find most of the hardware specs to be entirely acceptable. The camera which is 5MP does take nice video's and photo's. Which you can share on your favorite social site and don't have to apologize for the quality of it.The only issue I see with the phone is the speaker quality and internal storage. When playing music using the speaker it will distort at higher volume. But most people will use a headset anyways so that's not really a issue.The phone comes with 1.24 GB of usable internal storage. But once you update the default apps on the phone you will be left around 600 - 700MB of internal storage for installing your own apps. While the phone does support upto 32GB micro SD card's you can't install apps on the micro SD card.This is not the fault of Virgin Mobile OR the maker of the phone. This is the fault of Google for not allowing people to install apps on the micro SD card. Google stop allowing people do it in 'Jellybean' Android version due to piracy/security.But you can get around this issue by rooting the phone and installing couple apps.

Now the trend is to have bigger and bigger phones.  I have a Galaxy Note 3 (5.7\") that I absolutely love.  This phone bucks that trend with a high resolution, crystal clear, and vibrantly colored 4\" screen.  The phone really feels small in my hand and back pocket.  (I use it for my business line).  But that's not a detractor.  It's actually perfect as a second phone or a phone for a kid (just don't forget the microsd card for their games).  The phone has a toned down version of LG's android \"skin\" and it is zippy fast, especially for a phone that goes for $80 on amazon.  If you don't mind the screen size I would buy it in a minute.  Just don't forget the case, this little bugger is SLIPPERY.  I love it and a lot of times when I put my Galaxy Note 3 'to bed\" I will continue to surf on this phone while watching tv.  Dual 1.2 ghz processors aren't the best specs, but they get the job done.  I had a Samsung Galaxy Victory LTE before it, and it felt really sluggish and laborious to even swipe screens.  The f3 does a great job at everything I throw at it.  And did I mention the display was great?  Battery power is excellent too as its battery is way bigger than any other prepaid phone I've seen.  Hope this was helpful, just remember when you order a case make sure it's compatible with the VM720 because the t-mobile and metropcs versions are flat on the top and the virgin mobile is rounded, making some cases incompatible.

I just need a smart phone that I can use messaging apps like Whatsapp and browse the Internet and maybe use for social media and this phone performs this very well. Quite honestly the speed when I'm browsing using the Chrome browser is surprisingly fast and I feel like I'm connected to a wireless connection with with Nexus 7 tablet.What I'm really impressed with is the battery life of this phone. As a smart phone noob a couple years ago I couldn't believe that my brand new Slider phone only lasted me 5 hrs until a friend schooled me on the use of an app \"killer\". Even with the requisite app killer that I apply after each use but I had that on my Optimus Slider I didn't get anywhere quite like the performance that I'm getting with this F3. The battery life doesn't ebb away like with my Slider which I would get maybe a day out of that battery and then would need to top it off at night and then in the morning to start the day. With the F3, I top it off at night, wake up the next morning and the battery is showing 100%. It seems like the battery only drains away noticeably when I'm actually using it which is a really pleasant surprise!There are a couple things I'm not too fond with about this phone and that's the super slick feel of the back of the phone and the speaker. The phone is nice and stream lined and coupled with a really slick back it almost makes it slippery. I've gone and ordered myself a rubberized cover to take care of that issue. As for the speaker, I'm not someone who likes having the phone up by their ear so I always put my calls on speaker or use a headset but prefer using the speaker. The speaker is not very loud and when you crank it up just so you can hear, the distortion is a bit painful especially if the person on the other line laughs or ups the tone of their voice.All in all I highly recommend this phone.

Its not a big deal breaker for me yet because ill be able to hold off til years to get a new phone again.

Unless your device has version 3, which probably isn't on the F3.-Screen protector and extra outer case still required for max protection.I bought this phone to replace a Kyocera Event. While that phone still works relatively well, it had begun to look slow to me, even when doing some basic tasks like reading web pages and e-mails. I've had that one for about six months, but if it's combined with the Kyocera Rise I boot looped, that's about 1 1/2 years on the same basic hardware. The Rise has the tiny rubberized keyboard, which was kind of sticky to work with.The first thing I noticed from the Event was that the layout of the side buttons are identical, along with the headphone jack. The one difference was the micro USB port. It's at the bottom, under three keys for back, home and menu. Having a physical home key, with a colorful LED to frame it, is a nice touch for this phone.The body itself is a slim design, with a metallic frame outlining the screen. The textured back is pretty to look at, but doesn't have much grip to it. As great as the design is, all of that takes a back seat once it's got a case on it.At first, I ran the phone without activating it. This gave me an idea on how well it connects to WiFi, and allowed me to evaluate the audio and video quality. Coming from an Event, I was pleased with the speed of the interface. I didn't experience any lag, and the games I ran on it were as fast as I'd ever seen on a budget phone. I was glad to see that at least some apps could be disabled (if not removed).Though I knew I'd eventually root the phone, I could see myself being satisfied decently even if I didn't. The fact that I could effectively use a card larger than 32 GB was awesome to behold. A great thing, as it's not too expensive to get a 64 GB card these days. The Transcend Class 10 I chose was $35 at B&H; Photo in New York City (plus a few bucks for one day USPS Priority Mail).Once activated, a few of the Virgin Mobile apps downloaded onto my phone. Thankfully, only three apps were loaded. Two of them can be disabled, so you can avoid having them run in the background.About four days into running the phone unrooted (and two weeks of research on rooting), I finally did the deed. I rooted the phone, divided the external SD card to expand the small bit of internal memory, and used a couple of linking apps to also help with expanding memory. I loaded a bunch of apps I was using with my Kyocera Event onto the phone. Based on a short list that I found on vmroms.com, I removed a few apps from the phone. I now have something that really does feel like a tiny PC with a phone attached to it. All for around $130! It's not exactly a Samsung S3 or S4, but whatever. I'm still not sure I'll use the overclock kernel that one user created on androidforums (for now). No serious problems have been reported with using it. The overclock kernel raises the speed of both the main CPU, and the graphics processor beyond stock speeds.I can say I would recommend this phone for anyone that wants a powerhouse on a small budget, if you don't mind the rooting process. I've rooted every Android device I've owned since 2011 (four in total), but only after at least a few weeks of asking questions, researching the issues, and making up my own mind about it.Even if you don't root it, you can still do well with this phone. There are several good alternatives to the official apps of most social sites that won't take your RAM out for a late, fattening dinner. If you don't care for large, possibly addictive games, you'll do fine. Anyway, if you don't root, I'd bet you can enjoy this phone for the amount of video and music that can be stored on it. The dual core CPU and fast graphics are just fine for entertaining. Plus, now you can video chat with your pals on Skype... a lot can be done without rooting. Not to mention the upcoming update to KitKat! I'd say that alone is worth getting this phone now.If you made it this far, awesome! I'm done for now.

I do encourage using an SD card, so you don't use up all your space for photos, downloads, etc etc etc.  If you're looking to find a 4G LTE phone with more internal storage, you'll also be looking for a phone that is at LEAST twice the price.Voice and Data reception is going to be about the same as you're getting now, maybe just a bit better.  Where I have strong Voice and Data reception, I can pick up 4G as well.  However, don't expect this phone (or for that matter most any phone) to improve quality of reception.  When I do pick up 4G, the speeds are out of this world, as high as 16Mbps to an average of 6Mbps download, this really is a pleasant surprise.  Call quality is clear and constant.After giving this phone a hard workout for the last 5 days, I have nothing but praise!  No glitches, no shut offs, no freezes...

It has tremendous features, that I had not seen in a phone anywhere close to this price range. The most important feature to me is the 4G LTE access.  It's now available even out in the country where I live (about 3 miles from a major US highway) in the middle of rural northTexas  60 miles from a major city.  It works great and is very fast.  The phone has a very sharp 4\" screen with brilliant colors. It also includes a fast dual core (or is it quad, I forget) processor.  It seems well built, and generally does everything I ask of it (even including phone calls!).  Some have criticized the phone because it has relatively less memory than other phones with similar features.  That is true, but those other phones will cost 3 or 4 times as much as the LG F3.  Also, it seems to have plenty of memory to do what I need.  I have apps for keeping up with the news, weather, & stock market, plus some like Wikipedia, Pandora, Youtube, IMDB, office software, some card games and an assortment of others, plus the phone came with quite a few apps preinstalled.  Some of the preinstalled apps are quite useful, others not so much.  The only games I use are card games, which may help in keeping from exceeding the phone's memory.My previous phone was an LG Optimus Elite, which I was satisfied with, but it pales in comparison to the F3.In summary, the F3 meets all my expectations and exceeds in some.  I think the most surprising was the visual quality of the screen, which also is Gorilla glass btw.However, if you want to get something quickly, I would advise you to avoid Amazon's free shipping.

Elite's standby  time was less than 6 hours at best if you used it very little, and the F3's will go all day with use, and with light use, almost 2 days. The Elite was 3G, the F3 is 4G, and the processor's time is faster. The display is brighter and clearer. It does have a few extra bells and whistles that are nice.Now for the let down. Internal memory is ridiculously small, but since I was able to put any apps I downloaded onto the Elite's external SD card, I figured: no big deal. BIG deal. F3 not only won't let that happen, it also has decided you can't uninstall the many factory installed apps that are completely useless to me, so the internal memory is already depleted when you buy it. With less than a third of the apps I had in the Elite in the F3, I can't install any more.Here's another not so important but really annoying none the less, maps. No more Google Earth. Elite had it. No more Street View. Elite had it. Think you can use a functioning compass? Complete fail. Tried many apps  to calibrate it. Complete fail. This is important to me for my job as well as personal use.

First world problems, people.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Overall Value", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "RBJ9ZJGGA6WHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A few months ago I upgraded to the LG Optimus F3 from Virgin Mobile's own Kyocera Event. This has proved to be a good decision on my part. It's an entry level phone for sure, but for the asking price (about a third of what you'd pay for the similarly-spec'd Samsung Galaxy S3, as of my writing this) you're unlikely to find a better 4G phone.The F3 boasts a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor and 1 GB of RAM, as well as 4G network access. These specs, while not fantastic, have been more than enough to suit my (admittedly modest) needs. You'll be able to switch between various tasks and open widgets on the fly with barely any noticeable lag. The F3 also runs on Android 4.1.2, which includes a great deal of the advancements found in later iterations of the OS. These specs are all well and good, but this brings me to the phone's one major flaw, and the reason I didn't give it five stars: the on-board memory. Supposedly the F3 has 4 GB on on-board memory, but in practice most of that will be irreversibly occupied with pre-installed software before you even open the box. This leaves you with just under a 1.25 GB budget for installing your own desired apps. Note that this does not include apps that are automatically installed, such as the Google Play Apps and various on-board LG software. Normally I'd recommend moving apps to a Micro SD card, but this phone's OS has blocked that for some reason. You will have to budget memory very carefully to be able to fit your desired apps onto this phone; If gaming is a make-or-break aspect for you, I'd recommend skipping the F3 for that reason alone. However, if your needs are relatively minor, then the on-board memory should suffice, albeit barely. But it would have been nice to have a few extra gigs on there. Supposedly there is a workaround for this via rooting your phone, but I have yet to try that, so I can't verify if it actually works.The good news here is that the F3 has great battery life. During times when I've used my phone sparingly, I've been able to go for upwards of two full days without needing to charge it, and I have yet to have it die on me at an inopportune time. Even with heavy use, you're unlikely to run out of juice in the middle of the day. The OS also allows you to set up an automatic battery level at which to put the phone into power-saving mode, so even if your battery does run low you'll be able to stretch its life a bit longer.The F3's physical build is what you'd expect for the price - it feels light without feeling cheap or flimsy, with a grooved back plate that can be a bit tricky to pry off if you need to access the battery or replace the Micro SD card. It boasts a four-inch screen whose resolution, while not amazing, is more than bright and clear enough for navigating through menus, texting, playing the occasional game, and even watching the videos. The speaker on the back is of low quality, but that won't matter if you plug in some headphones or external speakers. Given that the build is so light, I'd recommend buying a case for it, as I don't think I'd trust it not to break if I dropped it on a hard surface. Connectivity will largely depend on where you are geographically, but my experience in that regard has been good; I haven't had any calls dropped thus far, and the call quality has been acceptable. The F3 is also good about switching back and forth between 3G and 4G, depending on where you are.If you're looking for a decent, reliable smartphone on a Virgin Mobile plan, look no further. It doesn't boast the specs of the Samsung Galaxy S line, or the physical build quality of HTC phones, but for the price you'd be hard pressed to find a better, more fully-featured smartphone.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone!", "Author": "Cindy Evans", "ReviewID": "R2XPVX2YC8PV9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its cheap and a good phone no lag with great quality.

I have never \"rooted\" any of my Android gadgets (Optimus V, Optimus Elite, Nexus 7, Optimus F3), but I am already seriously considering doing it to the F3 and I've only had it for a few days -- just to be able to delete the Virgin Mobile bloatware and be able to move apps to my SD card.

Virgin Mobile is rather lackluster, but for the price, it's not bad. They claim that they will give you unlimited data, but that's crap.

For its price range it was decently equipped and handled games and movie apps without a hitch. Unfortunately, much like the \"afforable\" Android phones I've owned in the past it began a steady decline before turning into a malfunctioning plastic brick.The Pros:The battery! If there was one shining quality about this was it's battery life. If use was normal it could easily stretch for an entire day. Even with heavy use you'd still get 12 hours on average. The textured backplate was great as it increased grip in your hand compared to the polished-bodied competitor phones.The Cons:Internal storage for a modern smartphone is small. Only 4GB to use and you can't even transfer apps to the SD card. After Google updated everything and you install a few favorite apps, you're bothered with constant low memory warnings. If you only do light activity such as email, occasional Facebook, Twitter and Netflix you'll get by. But heavy use; and you're always emptying the cache to keep the warnings at bay.My personal experience was only 6 months long before the phone simply, just decided to not function anymore. One day the phone app, factory installed disappeared. No matter what remedy we tried even a hard reset would not reveal the app. I know there are rooting options and other methods but I look at it this way. The phone app is one of the most basic, staple apps that should be working without question on EVERY phone. If I have to burn time to get such a basic function to work then there is simply either bad design or poor execution on part of Android and/or LG. I like many people don't have the time to waste tinkering with our phones to the point of geekdom. We just want it to work.The handset used to get very warm sometimes during use.

The main thing about this phone (like no other) is battery life.  If I manage to not leave GPS on constantly, I can go a couple days without charging; I usually don't wait that long though.As for apps.  I learned from reading those reviews written by those in the know, NOT to add tons of apps all at once.  There clearly isn't enough internal memory to swat a fly with.  Knowing that, I navigated that obstacle by adding and subtracting apps until I got a good mix.  Then I tried some of them out and got rid of some, added more and learned to use the restart (soft reboot) to clear the way for updating.Yes, it's tedious, but no one has a battery that lasts like mine does, hands down. The only issue that I'm having with the phone is to try to add my playlists (to the memory card).  I didn't like the amount of memory that was being eaten up by the player app, so deleted it.  I prefer how the phone behaves without that type of app.  If I want music, I guess I'll have to get a separate player.I also like that there were otter cases for it right away, so I ordered some.  Recently, I found a pretty good case too that allows for the slimline otter.  I can finally carry it in my pocket.  Not a big fan of the less than solid charger hook up.  A common complaint for cell phones, I guess.  I didn't get this for the camera, but I may as well say, I wish it were better.  It's hard to get a good photo, especially if you are using it to make deposits with other website's programs, if you know what I mean.I think that I'll be using this phone until it dies or they come up with a good HTC that I can afford.  Come on Virgin Mobile!4/7/14 EDIT: I noticed the other day, that Virgin was offering this phone for about 50 bucks and I can see why.  It turns out, in my case, that my music WAS on the memory card. I found this out when my phone crashed, booted back up and told me that the external memory card might be corrupted.  I had to wipe the card, then found out that my tunes were gone from the phone.  What a way to find out. There just is no way to tell the phone to switch content over to the external card (like I had before with my LG Optimus Elite).

That said, this is a quality phone for those who don't want to spend over $100. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is an issue I had with it out of the box, along with a couple other minor annoyances.First issue...when I initially activated the phone, I had a difficult time picking up a data signal...and I live in an area where this shouldn't be an issue. I had to apply some tweaks via a few different apps (one of them requiring root access) and the problem was solved. Now my data speeds are great.The minor annoyances include the internal storage space. It's adequate as is, if you don't use a lot of apps. If you do, you'll want to root the phone and use the Link2SD app or something similar to move some of your app data to your SD card. Moving to the SD is not available out of the box.Another (very minor) annoyance is an app shortcut widget called Qslide that LG locks into your notification area. For me, it just takes up space, because it doesn't give you a whole lot of options as to what shortcuts you can place there.

The power button on the side sets it apart from most phones, but it turns out there's a very good reason all the other phones have it there: it's more comfortable and convenient. I thought I would get used to it, but after about 4 months I still fumble it all the time. For some reason it refuses to display the names of certain contacts, only their numbers. I haven't been able to figure out why. Also like most (all?) Android phones it does not play nice with iPhone messaging, but it responds in more inconsistent ways than my Optimus V. One more thing which, though minor, was very disappointing to me: it has a color LED behind the Home button, but you can't really customize it to have different colors for contacts or alerts, which is a feature I had in flip phones 10 years ago. I also read a lot of reviews praising the battery life of this phone, and mine will last about a day and a half with normal use (texting, occasional email/wifi use).It's not terribly expensive and I won't be replacing it unless I have to, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably get something else.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lightweight, fast and the battery lasts for days!", "Author": "Teresa M", "ReviewID": "R1W3BSUOP4DJ8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new phone!

Having used it I give it about a 3.5-4 stars because the claims and reviews I've read didn't totally pan.  Of course we realize user-experience can differ from person to person.On the whole the LG Optimus F3 appears to work pretty well.  At about $150 (currently) for a duo-core latest-tech phone it's a pretty good deal.  The F3 is thin and light-weight (about 1/2 the weight of my HTC Evo V) which means it's much more comfortable to carry.  It has a very visible decent-size screen (4\").However, there are some minor, itchy little drawbacks.  Prominent is the HOME button, which is an actual requires-pressure pushbutton rather than a touch key.  On the one hand it's not as easy to accidentally hit, which is a plus.  On the other hand, it's not as easy to intentionally press, which is a minus.  Coin toss on that one.The user interface is not as intuitive and user-friendly as I would like.  There's a bunch of stuff at the top of the screen that I'm not used to being on Android... and it seems standard things I use daily that I had to search and find.  Probably a matter of just getting used to it, but minorly annoying since I own 3 other Android devices and they all work similarly to one another.Most annoying was the disappointing battery life.  The phone advertises \"16 hours of talk time\" compared to the standard 7-8 on most phones.  This was difficult to believe since it has a smaller battery than some.  That hard to believe turned out to be true.  I ran some significant and extensive tests (stand-by tests, Netflix tests, screen-always on tests, and an \"overnight see how much battery it retains just sitting there\" test)... and found it was about neck and neck with my EVO-V, which is known to have poor battery life.  In reality, most Android phones I've seen have horrible battery life-- especially if one turns on WiFi or Bluetooth.  This phone discharged from 100% to 75% just sitting idle overnight... same as my HTC.  Thus my primary reason for buying it-- the vaunted huge battery life-- turned out to be groundless hype.Also to be factored in is VM's service.  If you live in an area with good reception, you'll have little problem. If you live on a \"fringe area\"... you will grow to hate Virgin Mobile.  Their \"coverage map\" is significantly overrated in quality (as people will verify in hundreds of net reviews).  That's a drawback for all their phones, not just this one, but it does detract from the attraction of the LG Optimus.All that considered, responding to a couple of misconceptions:Several folks have commented on the \"very low memory\" (about 1 gig) and \"can't install apps on the SD card\".The HTC Evo V has the same internal memory... as do a lot of Android phones.  Many Android tablets have only 512 megs or 1 gig of core RAM.  That's nothing unusual.  I've put a ton of apps on my phone and never run out of memory.If one does run out of memory... it may be time to clear out some non-essential apps.  Move high-level games to the SD card (if possible)-- or limit your phone to lower-level games and save the big ones for your tablet or PC.  One shouldn't really run out of memory on a 1 gig phone.  If that happens, you may need to examine app use levels and research how Android handles app storage.  I've included a bit on that below.  In general, a gig should be plenty if you add a microSD card (which is pretty much a given essential these days.  Be sure to use a \"class 10\" card).Some phones have higher internal memory... but they cost a whole lot more (for example the Samsung S3 has 16 gigs, but is $400).  The Apple iPhone has 8 gigs (or more)... but is expensive and can't be expanded.  This phone can take up to a 32 gig chip.Some folks have complained apps can't be placed on the microSD.  That's simply not correct.  Some have claimed LG has crippled the phone.  I've seen no evidence of such.  It uses standard Android 4.1.1 Jellybean... and has a lot less \"garbage\" on the phone than others I've seen.Be aware that with Android, not all apps can be transferred to an SD card; they have to be specifically written to allow transferring.  There are apps on the market specifically designed to let you know whether an app can be transferred or not-- and that perform that transfer if it's possible.  I'd highly recommend buying a 16 or 32 gig mSD card and transferring as many as possible.  I've loaded lots of apps without resorting to the SD card and still had about 1/3 of my RAM free.  Never even came close to filling a gig.The plus of course is an inexpensive full-blown Android phone and plans starting at $35 a month.  I don't think one can buy a better phone for the money, which is why I give it 4 stars.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Limitations that can be corrected", "Author": "Chris Levoy", "ReviewID": "R1H8RQNUI014DD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sound quality - great.4G speeds in Tampa Bay area - sub-par.Quality of phone - good, but better after fixing issues.There is a flaw in the OS that does not allow apps to be installed to the memory card.

Which reminds me the MobileID pack is probably the most annoying part of Virgin Mobile. As soon as you turn it on this does a mandatory install of package of apps that just takes up the RAM and internal storage, which is why the available RAM and storage is so low for what was advertised.

I use my phone often for back up and mobile internet access and hoped the improved Android 4 OS would make my life easier. Instead I found that it needs at least 3G or wireless network to function. In this small, hick town I rarely have either. I opened many of the apps and almost nothing works. This seems to be a limitation of Android and not the phone, but since the OS is an integral part of the phone, it effects my opinion of the phone itself. My old POS phone never had a problem with data connections anywhere I had the Virgin Mobile network.The phone itself feels solid and looks great. It is very easy to use - what actually works. I have had it only a short time and cannot report on reliability, but will update in the future. The Navigation app seemed to be trying to work, although it never could find my location. The camera works well in good light, but the flash does little except maybe fill in shadows. It is noticeably faster than my old phone and the home screen is very attractive.I don't know if the limitations are placed there by Android or the cell phone carrier, but what I have is a very nice phone that does little else. I could have paid a lot less for that. Since other Android 4 phones apparently work in the same manner there is no point of returning the phone for another, but my next phone will not be an Android. I give the phone hardware 5 stars, but I give the latest Android only 2 stars.

I can't keep more than one or two text messages at a time, and I have to clear out my cache every time I receive one.

Basically all I do is I check a few emails, I send some texts and make some calls. I figured I could do without the big fancy Samsung Galaxy II.I locked myself into a 2 year contract with Sprint and started to try and use this phone. Like many users reported here I was happy at first. Battery life was good and it was smaller, lighter and worked essentially the same way as the Samsung. Three months in the problems started. I downloaded - 1 yes ONE app (evernote) and all of sudden all my updates could not update as there was no memory. I bought a memory card (quite a large one) and that is when I found out all the apps on the phone can't be moved to the memory card.So I took evernote off and thought things would return to normal. They never did and only got worse. Finally the screen went blank and the phone ceased working 6 months into my contract.Sprint won't help - Lg says I bent the motherboard? and won't honor my warranty. Plus their phone people are really rude.What is the mother board? How could I bend it when I don't even know what it is? I put this phone in a tough rubberized case the day it came out of the box and I can't recall ever dropping it or having any mishap with it ( on the other hand my galaxy was so large and did not fit in my pocket so I dropped it many times and it kept right on working)This phone and LG are both horrible and you will be far better off spending a little more money and going with a Samsung product.On the upside of my fiasco I was able to downgrade my phone plan with Sprint to almost nothing and move on to another carrier. This is a change since the last time I checked the rules. So I have a cheap spare phone to make calls on or lend to friends while I ride out the sprint contract.
