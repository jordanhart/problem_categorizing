{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Starter Smart Phone that does what it says", "Author": "Sp Darren \"spdarren\"", "ReviewID": "R2VILPLVVLQN7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is no knockoff, unlike what the other reviewer states.  High quality sound, all the features of your standard smart phone.  QWERTY slide out keyboard is what sold me on this phone, and it works very well.  Phone feels rugged in your hand, albeit somewhat slippery like most smartphones.  It comes with a lot of AT&T; apps, some you can use, some not.  If you do not use them, they do not get in the way.Pleasantly surprised by the swiftness of the touch screen.  Since the phone is an entry level smartphone, it is not the fastest device on the block.  It will crash on you if you try to go faster than the phone's operating system will allow.  However, if you let it takes its time (which is overall pretty good), it works very well.Camera leaves something to be desired.  It is a 3MP camera, which is not the greatest these days, and the camera does not have a flash.  However, it does take pictures, and videos, when you hit the button.Bluetooth works really well, too, at up to 40 feet away in my home.  This may or may not be different depending on the layout of where you use the phone.The operating system is Android Gingerbread 2.3.6.  This earlier release version of Android has not posed any problem for me with the APPS that I have installed on the phone.  In one area, it is a plus.  My wife's phone has Android Jellybean, the latest version of Android - which does not support Flash.  This older release of Android does support Flash - very pleased about that.For techies, I have read from other owners of this phone that they have not been able to root it.  This has not been a problem for me personally.  And again, as a first smart phone for someone, that will likely not be an issue.I would definitely buy this phone again as my very first smart phone, and/or recommend it to someone who is looking for a decent priced Android phone with good capability.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a great phone", "Author": "Marshalee Rolle", "ReviewID": "R3VUWDN5X4L981", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just really like the phone, when I purchase the phone it came unlocked as it promise all I did just put my SIM card in and I was ready to  go.

It functions fast and smooth, no operating problems at all. This phone is seemingly a mini version of the Samsung Stratosphere (which I had before). Arrived on time, and in perfect condition.It has just about everything I was looking for: * Samsung * Unlocked * Smart-phone * WiFi * Slider keyboard * Under $100 (wow)Negatives: * No camera flash * No front facing camera * Very small * Battery doesn't last long * Ridiculously difficult to find much of a selection of accessories (cases) for it.For the price and great quality, I will recommend this phone to all.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than expected.", "Author": "Deborah Bowell \"Debbie B.\"", "ReviewID": "RRSCOP6G2PTXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently ordered a new version of this phone for my husband because he didn't want a used phone.  However, when I received this used phone you couldn't tell that it had ever been used!

The phone arrived a day before my son was supposed to receive it, so there was no time for a return. I paid the market price for the ace not the appeal.

It is in fact the \"Appeal\" i827.What is not to like about this phone.It does everything it is advertised to do. It is logical and easy to set up. The OS is the Android Gingerbread 2.3.6. It accesses the internet quickly over my Verizon fiber optics wifi connection ( I have the slowest broadband.that Verizon offers.)It is compatible with Talkatone, a free phone calling app via Google Voice. (I had to return a LG Thrive because it was not compatible with Talkatone.) (A note about Talkatone that is true on any phones I have used: there is a delay of a few seconds when talking with others that is unnerving to some. Talkatone routes your calls through a California number.)The voice quality on the Appeal is good.I don't use the camera. I understand that it may not have a flash and is 3 megapixel. There is no front camera.Most statistics sites list the phone as having mini SIM but it looks like a SIM size to me.The cover, SIM and micro SD slots are all easy to operate (not true of many smart phones).The Appeal has a QWERTY keyboard that is easy to operate in addition to on screen and keyboards. Touchscreen is 3.2 inches. The phone is compact despite having sliding QWERTY. It is attractively designed.The phone was under $100 on Amazon which seems a great price for all the phone does.The only concern I have is that the phone seems to get hot (at least very warm) when charging.I love this phone.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "beware", "Author": "connie m davis", "ReviewID": "RCN5AMUYY9K1M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think this was a knock off, no internet access, battery only lasted a few hours and misspelled words in the contents.  that explains why there was no guide included", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AUA0K8W"}}
