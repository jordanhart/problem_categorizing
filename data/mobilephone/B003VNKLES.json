Home screen panels let you put shortcuts and content all in one place.  You can use it as a mobile hotspot with the JoikuSpot app. Ovisotre has a good amount of additional apps, and there are a lot of Symbian applications that can be installed from the PC or directly in the phone. The full qwerty keyboard is very nice and the battery life is good even with moderate to heavy browsing gps navigation.  you can also carry a spare battery. the camera is good by smartphone camera standards.Cons: I have not been able to hook yahoo, hotmail or gmail account with the built in email program, I had to use a third party app called Emoze.  Too bad the built in app can't be used as a regular pop3 / imap client.  The built in sms messaging app does not support threaded views, you'll have to buy an additional app for that (ThreadSMS - at least it is cheap). You'll want to replace the included 2Gb micro sd card (almost filled with OviMaps files) with a bigger 4Gb or 8Gb one if you are planning on uploading many music files / videos, etc. you cannot charge the phone via the usb port. The phone does not include a stylus, you can get the job done with your fingers or nails, but for some operations it would be nice to have the extra precision.In summary this is a nicely priced phone given the specs and features it has, and most shortcomings can be solved with additional apps, memory.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "AA Misra", "ReviewID": "RC48TZWGVYO9S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Nokia phone and as usual I am very satisfied with this phone.I brought this phone when it had no reviews. Just after buying the phone, I saw some negative reviews after I purchased but still thought of giving it a try. I am happy I did not return it without trying it myself.The basic features of this phone are really great. It has excellent signal strength and sound clarity. Also touch screen works quite fast and it is very easy to use just like other Nokia phones. The only issue with the phone is the memory which is 2GB but can be extensible up to 16GB. If you use maps, your memory will get exhausted very fast. The camera and music players are also very good.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "A mini super portable computer.", "Author": "Eternal Howl", "ReviewID": "R3RTVOSACBRTE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone. In the past, I've always opted for cheap and typically prepaid, but after finding I could not call an international cellphone with my cheap Tracfone, and a major disaster had occurred in the country I was flying to, I decided that having a phone that would not work in the country I was heading to, nor the ability to make cellular contact, if I chose, it was time to upgrade.I can now make international calls to cell phones and landlines. Because the phone was unlocked, it gave me the option to choose what phone I wanted in my price range and to choose between the GSM cell providers. The wireless works great. I can use the wireless feature to access my email and other web functions without having to get charged by a wounded bull (ATT) for traffic. The qwerty keyboard is better than many I have ever seen. The keys are a lot bigger, but the phone is still smaller than the latest HTC models.Some people have complained about the touch screen not being sensitive enough and that it's better to use a stylus. I find that it is just fine with my fingers. Yes, it doesn't seem completely solid when it's in a closed state (when the keyboard isn't in the slide-out mode), but it does feel solid when you are using the qwerty.Also, I love the fact that I don't have to use the qwerty keyboard to dial a number - the onscreen touch numerical keyboard works fine. There are some features that I haven't explored yet, but it has great sound when you're playing music and while it's loaded with some applications I didn't care for (Myspace, Friendster etc), you don't have to keep them.While it comes with a 2gig chip, I upgraded to an 8 gig and you can go up to 16gig, which is a nice option if you want to use it as an MP3 player.Update August 2011: Extremely happy with my purchase. Flew back to New Zealand and picked up a 2degrees SIM card at the duty free shop, before clearing customs. By the time my luggage was checked for my next flight, I had a working phone and a New Zealand cell phone number - without the nasty international roaming charges.

I've been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn't need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a \"white screen\" lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a \"workhorse\" of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a 'smart phone.' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A 'WHOLE DAY' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a \"white screen\") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a \"Music\" folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then \"Options\" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can't beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE \"WHITE SCREEN\" BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my \"Kingmonkey\" ID). The C6 . . . I couldn't decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it's fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory \"screen protector\" and since this is a new phone and you can't buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that's about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don't travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don't actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the \"Gmail\" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don't use it, maybe I'll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for \"messaging\"--it's called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit \"cartoonish\" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it's fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them. C6 works with ATT 3G so since I have an existing ATT SIM card it works great, the N900 I signed up for a T-Mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the N900 3G only works with TMobile 3G, So I am set here; if I used the ATT SIM card the ATT 3G does not work with Nokia N900 and would have to settle for EDGE (non 3G).

Night pictures are a little off, but during the day, you don't really need your camera with you.* The quick contacts widget display is just one of the best things about this phone.

It is impressive how Nokia made a the phone operation even easier than before, the menus are very intuitive and when in doubt, just click the help option for instant access to the user manual.I was familiar with the PC Suite software but the new Ovi software is a step ahead for seamless integration with MS Outlook and PC communication. It is also worth to mention that the Nokia C6 can be used as a modem, connecting your notebook PC to the internet enywhere there is a GSM or 3G network available.The battery life is much better than other touch screen phones out in the market, such as iPhone. My wife has a Motorola Dext Blur and the battery life gets nowhere near the C6!This model is highly reccommended for people over 45 like me that is having trouble reading texts in small screens, that was one of the reasons for replacing my E72 for the C6.A warning for Nokia users of E-Series phones: don't expect the battery of touch screen phones to last as much as that of your phones, this is a price to pay to have a bigger screen.I bought this smart phone for professional use so it was good to see that configuring the e-mail accounts were fast and easy.For those who like to listen music on the cell phone a piece of advice: use a good quality ear buds instead of the of the headset that comes with the phone. You will be surprised with the high quality of the sound of the Nokia C6.The 5MP camera takes great pictures and there is even a built in LED flash that does a good job when the ambient light is weak.Possibly the only downside that I have experienced so far is that the screen is easy to scratch, apparently Nokia saved money using a low quality material there. I advise the purchase of plastic skins along with this phone, this will provide protection aginst scratching.

Which I used for a phone and heavily used media player. Where the 5530 fell short, this one picks up. Anyone that had the 5530 or probably even the 5800, can tell very well of the bugs they had (shutting off when you tried to pick up a call, random freeze ups, very limited interface, the constantly disconnecting wifi, etc.).INTERFACE:The interface is much cleaner, smoother and a better tactile touch response. Compared to the 5530/5800 even with the SPB Mobile Shell customization, the c6 is a better performer. The wifi pickup is much improved as it will retain the wifi connection and quickly pick it back up if it is dropped.Response is much faster than the predecessors, yet still minimally sluggish. The improved audio is complimented by the larger screen. When playing movies the battery doesn't drain nearly as fast as the 5530 did due to it's larger capacity battery.BODY:It's size is a bit bulkier. But I prefer this one's larger size compared to the 5530 as it was just a bit too small for my hands. The side buttons for volume control, slide lock and camera button are a little difficult to press as the slide out keyboard causes a bit of an obsticle because it tries to slide out when pressure is applied.However, the slide out qwerty keyboard is a great gain. The buttons are a bit small for my large fingers, but typing on it produces significantly less errors than when I had to deal with the touch screen of the 5530.The Nokia tech support has been good to me thus far when I've had issues. I didn't have to deal with a bunch of beurocracy when they needed to cover my warranty. All in all, I'm glad I bought this phone.

Before I make any comments about the phone itself, I just want everyone to know that, based on my experiences with Nokia Technical Support, that you can be confident that Nokia will treat you like a VIP and stand behind the phone.First off, the few times I have called Nokia support number for assistance, I was totally delighted with the knowledgeable representatives who always spent whatever time I required to ensure my complete satisfaction and that all my questions were answered to my satisfaction.But best of all I have been in the Philippines since June 2011. In September 2011 the slider started to develop a little sloppiness which was slowly becoming progressively sloppier. I went to the local Nokia phone store here in Manila and the Nokia representative assured me this was not typical. I was advised that since I had purchased the phone in the USA, that I should contact Nokia's Support Center in the USA to determine how to best get my issue resolved.When I called Nokia, the agent wasn't sure how to best accommodate my request to get the phone serviced locally here in the Philippines and had my case escalated for management resolution. Being that the phone was fully functional and that my request was not urgent I was more than happy with the suggested process offered by the agent.Needless to say, I was quickly assigned a personal case manager named Macy, who treated me like a VIP. Macy took the time to fully understand my concern in getting the phone serviced locally. Where my phone is a USA variant Macy using her words assured me that her and Nokia's resolution to my case \"will have a smile on my face\".Macy asked if my request was urgent or if I could give her some time to work with the Nokia team to come up with the absolute best resolution. Again, like I told my original agent, I told Macy that my request was not urgent and that the phone was fully functional but I am sure at some point the slider will become too loose to be useable.Within a few days Macy contacted me and offered to ship me a brand new phone here in the Philippines at Nokia's expense to ensure my complete satisfaction. I now have my new Nokia C6-00 and to say I am delighted with Nokia is truly an understatement. Macy and Nokia definitely have, to use Macy's words \"put a smile on my face\" and then some, as promised.As a result of how I was treated by Nokia, especially in this age of companies looking to cut costs wherever they can, I will never own another brand phone.Now getting to the phone itself. I understand that Nokia's direction is to be soon offering Windows phones replacing the Symbian operating system. Yes, at some point when I am ready to upgrade to a new phone, based on my experience with Nokia, a Nokia Windows phone will be in my future.I did a lot of research before purchasing my Nokia C6-00 Smartphone and felt for my purposes this unlocked GSM phone that works on both AT&T;'s and T-Mobile's networks in the USA and virtually everywhere in the world was the best value. Plus, being an unlocked phone that is affordable you do NOT need to commit to an expensive phone contract to have a fully functional quality Smartphone.The reality is the phone is rock solid and does everything well and simply works. There are a lot of applications available for it from the Nokia store, and the interface is very intuitive and straightforward to use. It may not be as glitzy an interface as some of the newer interfaces, but again the phone really is very intuitive to use, it just works and is loaded with features, which are all implemented very well.The hardware is also rock solid and I get a lot of complements on the phone wherever I go both when I was in the USA and here in the Philippines. The quality of both the materials and the workmanship are very obvious.In summary, whether the Nokia C6-00 is the right Nokia phone for you or not, I am sure that you can find a Nokia model that meets your needs.If you are not in an urgent rush to get a Windows phone, based on my experiences with Nokia, you would do well to wait for the new Nokia Windows models before making an investment in a new Windows phone.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia C6 excellent", "Author": "C\u00e9sar", "ReviewID": "R2QUWRHR9IZD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is very comfortable with its Qwerty keyboard and its screen is very sensitive to touch provides ease of use.

Like the apps, but wished there were more like what the iPod and iPhone has.  Love the Map, I can download just about any country and it actually shows you where you are without been online and it talks to you while you drive when you put in where you want to go. I had to go away, so I tried it outside of the USA and it still shows you where you actually are. If you need to download the entire USA, you'll need a larger capacity Micro SD card...the USA is large, but you could download which state you need or just search for the address...as I said you don't need to be online to do this.Sometimes when you are at a particular screen it freezes and you have to turn off the phone or the phone turns off without you doing it, otherwise it's okay. For the price, it has a little of everything and some extras that other phones don't have.  WIFI is great, I can pick up WIFI virtually anywhere.I had one problem, I could not find any cover and screen protective films except in the UK or China, so now I have to wait for the package.

It has a nice touch screen, although, it sometimes took too long to realize whether I had the phone sideways and to change accordingly. Wasn't too impressed with the camera quality and there is a lower grade secondary camera if you want a personal picture. If you try to take a picture of yourself using the main camera, you'll have a hard time finding the button because there is not one on the side so you can easily snap a picture. I'm not very literate to the smart phone world, so bear with me. The QWERTY pad is great, I liked it. Overall the phone was okay, I could have stuck with it. But 4 days after purchase, the deal breaker came when I was losing calls because the ringtones preloaded to the phone stopped working.

The product seems brand-new. Keyboard, screen, sound quality , video quality, call quality, camera are all great.My main complaint is with the Symbian OS. Certain applications like Web Browsers, or WAZE GPS program don't run properly - I get an \"out of memory\" message with instructions to close applications. I upgraded the firmware to the latest version available, but the problem still remains. The phone runs slower (downloads, web browsing) than I would like.Email works Ok (I connect to my hotmail, yahoo and work email); that said, often there are synchronization problems. If I reset the phone, the email does return to synchronize properly. There's an annoying issue of downloading multiple copies of the same mails to the phone; certain multiple copies contain the email text, others don't.I find that I need to reset the phone a couple of times a day to keep the many applications I try to run happy.I used a BlackBerry Curve 9300 before this Nokia C6 phone. Much, much better OS, much better handling of email, much faster page loading and task switching. I would end up resetting the Blackberry only once every couple of weeks.I do like the abundant availability of applications from the OVI store. Not as many as for iPhone or Android, but more than for Blackberry.To summarize: a full featured phone that provides good value; however the poor Symbian software platform makes what could be a great product into a mediocre and barely tolerable phone.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME UNLOKE PHONE", "Author": "Makussz0r \"Makussz0r\"", "ReviewID": "RH69T406ZX55Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm simply loving this phone. The only drawback I have, and the reason I did not give it a 5 star rating, is that yes, the OS is a bit laggy when opening screens and you get the white screen for a second or two and I had some apps close on me without any apparent reason or any error message (specially true with the Opera Mobile app).The Nokia C6 looks and feels like a poor man's N97, or more accurately N97 mini, except it's not actually that cheap. The C6 suffers from the worst excesses of the N97's software, without the saving grace of its solid hardware, resulting in a phone that's disappointing at any price.he C6 doesn't look too bad on paper. It's got Wi-Fi and 3.2Mbps HSDPA connectivity for fast Web surfing over wireless or 3G. But Web pages don't look great on the 81mm (3.2-inch) resistive touchscreen. It isn't as bright or sharp as the competition, and we found the Web browser slow and clunky to use. There's also no multi-touch zoom, and there's no other quick method of zooming into the text on a page either. Double tapping the screen does zoom in, but it doesn't reformat the text to fit the screen, which would have been a welcome touch.If the Nokia C6 was selling for a song, we could forgive its cheap-looking case and sluggish performance. But, for a contract price that's up there with that of the HTC Desire, one of the best phones of the year, we expect much more. The touchscreen version of the C6's Symbian OS already felt dated when it came out.

I also like the keyboard to be easier typing. Speaker is better than the headphone that the package provided.The most function I like the phone is the build-in GPS. It is much better my 3-year-old GPS. And no internet connection required. Map can be update lifetime.Negative:Screen is small.To slide out the keyboard, I have to use both hands.

The Media syn app also doesn't recognize the phone and so I could't upload music to this device.It is a resistive screen and touch response for me is adequate.  It may be deemed slow or trash, but hey touch screen response is very subjective.

WACKfeatures i wanted...#1 - description made the gps look awesome! in fact it SUCKS. takes way too long to locate and is WAY off almost every time. basically useless, because when you are lost you need to know exactly where you are, fast. when i saw how ios or android serve gps i felt very ripped off.#2 - camera quality is much like any 5mp. a lot of phones (and cameras) have these heavy megapixel ratings to trick stupid people like me. we assume more indicates more performance. how did i fall for that again? the flash is ugly as hell, makes color horrid. the first thing i noticed using it was how if i don't like a picture, hit delete, get an error message that memory is full, close apps and yadda yadda... you have to kind of wait and be tricky with it to get it to work... sigh. i need to be able to delete quick at work so i don't have a bunch of extra pics to go through. camera functionality blows. video is ok but needs super bright light to work at all, so not any better than a childs toy camera or crappy webcam.#3 - wifi? yeh i knew wireless G was going to be slow, but combined with this crap browser and buggy phone i felt like i was dialing up to AOL. except that back with AOL i would actually use webpages, with this thing i never could, especially my work website. i got burned pretty bad there, should have had lower expectations.#4 - touchscreen functionality was slow, bugged out, ugly animations (should i say lack of animations). i found myself repeatedly tapping or pressing harder, as a person is prone to do when the crap simply don't work right. i installed a small stack of games on it, all ugly 2d versions of real games. LAME#5 - slide out keyboard? hurt my fingers when pushing upper keys as other reviewers have said. oh and by the way 2 months after warranty expired the screen started to bug out while sliding - i researched to find that is now COMMON among these phones and LAUGHED HEARTILY watching a youtube guide on how to \"fix\" it (cost of parts and tools + time involved means i won't).#6 - FM radio, i basically used two maybe three times. not sure why i thought that would be cool. bluetooth, slow - never ended up using it. software? a joke obviously, digital poison for your pc. the thing has a headphone jack but since the battery is so crappy i never even put any music on it. all these little extra features seemed cool until i found real life usage was a huge pain. - in conclusion, i foolishly defended this phone and convinced myself that despite it's bugs and quirks that i had somehow gotten the best deal i could afford. now i already need to replace it with another $200 phone, plus the $30 backup i had to get just so i could at least get calls till then... i failed at buying a good phone apparently.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "slow phone", "Author": "jiahong", "ReviewID": "REWX5EJQT23JP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "very low battery life, two day is the max. ugly phone, and it cost 300 when i bought it. very dont like this phone, slow as hell. dont buy this phone. buy a better phone", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Muy \u00fatil y divertido", "Author": "Arturo", "ReviewID": "RPA2MOMAFIG9E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Realmente es un tel\u00e9fono muy \u00fatil y divertido para quienes necesitamos un tlf tipo PDA (sin necesitar de muchas aplicaciones tontas de juegos y otras que los ni\u00f1os u otros mas j\u00f3venes estar\u00edan interesados). Se conecta a las wi-fi de manera muy r\u00e1pida y f\u00e1cil y ademas con una conexi\u00f3n de datos bastante r\u00e1pida tambi\u00e9n. Sin embargo uso el FB, el Whatsapp, ESPNsoccernet y otros de manera habitual y satisfactoriamente.Es de notar, que al ser un tlf de pantalla t\u00e1ctil no es para ser usado por quienes andamos apurados pues a la hora de buscar un contacto o un numero de la agenda resulta algo incomodo(pero esto sucede con todos los tel\u00e9fonos de la categor\u00eda).  El tel\u00e9fono tiene un teclado qwerty muy pr\u00e1ctico que permite escribir de manera muy eficiente. La c\u00e1mara es buena para los espacios abiertos y soleados, regular para los entornos cerrados y con luz artificial a pesar de los m\u00faltiples intentos por configurarla correctamente.En otros aspectos, hay ciertos detalles que deber\u00edan poder ser cambiados (pero al menos, hasta ahora no he logrado). Uno de ellos y muy importante es poder ver los n\u00fameros de tlf de cada contacto al momento de ver los registros y de hacer una llamada. Esto es practico porque por lo general, siempre interesa verlo para identificar la operadora a la que haremos la llamada (porque para quienes usamos planes prepagados puede resultar en un gasto mayor al llamar una operadora diferente a la que estamos afiliados).Por otra parte, si les interesa pueden hacer algunos ajustes para evitar consumir bater\u00eda in\u00fatilmente. Entre ellos, desactivar el sensor de movimiento (que hace rotar la pantalla de manera autom\u00e1tica y aun cuando no lo queremos). Tambi\u00e9n pueden cambiar el tiempo que dura la pantalla encendida despu\u00e9s de dejar el tlf en standby (dura unos 60 segundos de manera predeterminada y pueden reducirlo hasta 5 segundos). La conexi\u00f3n de datos tambi\u00e9n debe colocarse en la opci\u00f3n \"cuando es necesario) de otra forma siempre estar\u00e1 conectado.Del resto, creo que no se sentir\u00e1n decepcionados.

I stay with Nokia because of their attention to detail and their quality products. The only reason why I rated the C6 with 3 out of 5 stars is because of my own personal bias. Over all this was an excellent phone but because of my personal biases it just was not for me. I do not like touch screen phones and I unfortunately had to try one out to know I do not like them.The Good: The small design for a full QWERTY slide phone. The ability to customize the home page of your phone allows you to have everything you need just a click away. The applications that are free on the Ovi store that can be used for the phone are nice and easily used such as games, phone battery time remaining, weather, etc. The ability to have a regular sized headphone jack is wonderful; I could listen to my Pink Floyd on the bus or tune into a local radio station to pass the time in between classes.The Bad: transition time from upright to sideways mode can be a bit annoying; this is especially for when you have applied a large theme to your phone. But for me even having to waste one second on anything is annoying. The lag time is about 1 second or less, and for a large theme it can be up to 2 maybe 3 seconds. The touch screen is not capacitive (like iPhone), instead it is a touch screen that embraces some type of stylus i.e. fingernail or fine tipped plastic pen.The Ugly: Not being able to text with one hand (my bias), it is nearly impossible to text with one hand. Also the phone was designed for right handed people. I am a lefty (this is where my bias comes in).

It's not really the fault of the phone (except for the keyboard issue), but of the operating system. Symbian is horrible. Completely unintitutive with layers of \"junk\" to sift through before being able to accomplish the simplest of tasks.  I finally had to print out the entire operating instructions and read them page-by-page before I could go much beyond the \"phone\" function.  The touch screen also leaves a lot to be desired.  It's extremely un-responsive and doesn't even register a touch at the edges when one is playing games. The slide-out qwerty keyboard is a disaster.  I don't have particularily large fingers and had minimal trouble typing on my old Palm Treo keyboard, but I cannot EVER type a message of any kind on this thing without pressing adjacent or incorrect keys! After using the wonderful PalmOS for so many years I just can't get over how awkward using this phone is and can't wait to get rid of it. For using as a \"plain-vanilla\" phone it's perfectly fine, which is why I gave it two stars instead of only one, but then it's overkill to pay even this much.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente tel\u00e9fono por el bajo costo", "Author": "Mayrimp", "ReviewID": "R9H0DB26N6V0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Desde el momento que recib\u00ed mi tel\u00e9fono comence a utilizarlo y de verdad que ha sido excelente... no tuve problemas para configuraci\u00f3n de la linea en mi pais (Venezuela) ni de la conectividad a internet.  me parece que el espacio en la memoria es poco, incluso con la memoria externa ya que con pocas aplicaciones y algunas fotos se lleno la memoria, sin embargo le elimin\u00e9 algunas aplicaciones que no necesitaba y se corrigi\u00f3 el problema, aunque creo que voy a tener que comprar una memoria mayor.Con respecto a la pantalla tactil, es muy c\u00f3moda ya que no es tan sensible por lo que puedes tocarla sin marcar algo con facilidad (eso es algo que encuentro positivo ya que mi tel\u00e9fono anterior se colgaban las llamadas y se cerraban las aplicaciones con solo rozar la pantalla) hasta ahora no he podido utilizar el GPS pero me dijeron que le instalara el Garmin para mejores resultados... el software es amigable como todos los Nokia.

The operating software is very outdated and going from screen to screen you will see nothing but a black or white screen for at least 1 second a piece, but most times it will likely be longer.  Quite often I have counted ten seconds or more between the time I hit reply to a text message and when the actual \"write message\" screen pops up.  Changing the stance of the phone (horizontal to vertical or vice versa) always gives a delay of a few seconds.At first this doesn't sound like too much of a bother but when you have to wait 15 seconds to reply to a text message or call, ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME, it becomes very annoying and can make you quite irritable.  The browser is shotty at best, it crashes often, the phone often claims it has no memory to run applications.This phone is truly crap.
