I had the Envy before that and would have kept it, if it hadn't fallen apart on me.  I love, love, love the Octane.  Unfortunately, mine had a run-in with an unsupervised child.  Long story short, my keypad was torn out.  I ordered one from Ebay because Verizon said that was the only place they knew of to get them.  Apparentely Verizon doesn't manufacture them anymore.  The phone I got from Ebay was scratched all over, the battery would not charge, and the charger that came with it wasn't the right one.  It was my first time using Ebay and I didn't realize that not everybody does returns.  This seller didn't.  So on a whim I decided to try my faithful Amazon.  The phone was a little more expensive, but when I got it I felt vindicated.  It looks brand new.  There's not a scratch or smudge on it.  It was fully charged when it arrived.  The charger was the right one.  The buttons all work just fine.  I was ecstatic.  I don't want a smart phone or touch screen phone, which is inevitable I'm afraid, but for now Amazon has my back.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best phone I have ever Owned", "Author": "M. Baca", "ReviewID": "R1MRZ3I0LTQ4IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After my past phone expired I searched all over Verizon for a new \"non smart phone\". Much to my dismay , I noticed that Verizon gives \"dumb phone\" users about 4 choice, all of which are pieces of junk. A relative showed me their Octane and the 1st thing I noticed was that the buttons are big. My fingers are big so I can't text on keys the size of pin heads.After reading some reviews and noticing the price of a \"used\" phone on ebay and Amazon, this caught my attention.The phone is basically a smart phone without the $220 per year upgrade fee, mandatory data package etc.In one phrase, it is awesome. By far the best phone I have ever used. Tons of features, big keys, cool pad, flip open features on and on.If you're buying a used one, be careful. Don't buy on Ebay, which is about the worst place you can buy electronics. The return policies are shady and the vendors are straight up theives, protected by Ebay, who is also one big thief. With Amazon, if you buy a used one and it is \"too used\", you can return it with no hassle. You won't find that on Ebay.I \"moderately used\" LG Octane can be interpreted as \"beat to heck and back\".I had to return my 1st phone because it was heavily used, and then the vendor sent me an awesome one. So in short, if you want a good one, pay for it, or get ready to play the return game.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Tronicshopper", "ReviewID": "R7T8MG4L6CDTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No more butt dialing yay.

If you just want a great basic phone for texting & making calls this is your phone. The full flip Qwerty keyboard is great plus great camera and super long battery life. My original LG Octane got crushed and I was so bummed to learn that Verizon no longer carried it. They said my only hope was to find one for sale on the secondary market. I was glad to find one here on Amazon and gladly paid the $134 price to get it. I was a little worried buying one from an unknown seller due to a bad experience w/a phone purchase off ebay in the past but so far, so good. My only complaint is the protective film covering that comes on a new phone from the manufacturer was really scuffed up. The phone wasn't scratched or scuffed but the film was so scufffed up I had to peel it off in order to use the phone. My old phone still had its original film covers. I like to leave them on as long as possible for added protection. Otherwise it arrived on time and no problems with the phone itself. Again, this is a great phone.

Tutherow Jr \"Paul D Tutherow Jr\"", "ReviewID": "R3EV364WC4Z172", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG Octane features a large external display along with comfortably sized keypad. The phone flips open from the side to reveal a full keyboard, dual speakers and a slightly larger widescreen display. While closed the phone can be access many of its major functions like playing music, selecting ringtones, sending and receiving calls or text messages. Advanced configurations are available once the phone is flipped open.Because the LG Octane was discontinued it not a standard choice when purchasing a new contract, but it can still be purchased from an overstock dealer. This may be an advantage since it could be used on Verizon\u2019s own prepaid services or activated with a current plan as a replacement or new device.The LG Octane was replaced by the LG Extravert which slides to reveal its keyboard eliminating the necessity of an internal screen. The Extravert also lacks the external keypad using a touch screen instead for placing calls.The LG Octane is a solid basic feature phone with a rare side-flip form factor that really lets the owner push the boundaries of what is available on a basic service contact without an additional data plan.

I left it in the pocket of my pants when I did the laundry. Since, I had to have a phone right away, I bought a Samsung u380 Brightside. The Octane nor any full keyboard flip phone was sold anymore at the store I shop at.The Octane was so easy to use and very rugged(except for it is not waterproof :-( ). I don't like smartphones cuz I can't type on the things; I fat finger them or have to repeatly touch the same 'key' to input. The Octane flips right open and the real keyboard is easy to use. Plus a flip phone screen angle can be adjusted where this Samsung slider is either open or closed. the Samsung keyboard limits the typing on the top row because fingers hit the top half of the phone.No worries about 'butt typing' with the Octane; the Samsung has a mind of its own! The Samsung won't stay off in my pocket when I want it off(eg. the theater, church, etc.). The Samsung voicemail button is too easier to hit; why did Samsung require 2 key touch for voicemail rather than one?The Octane camera is great. It has a flash(Samsung - not), easy to point and the camera features are easy to understand.So maybe this is more a negative review of the Samsung u380 Brightside. Why did I spent $200 for it, when I could have bought one here for $80-90? What am I going to do when I am force to get a smart phone with no real keyboard?", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "great for my mother", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RJ3VDJX288B5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone was perfect for my mother who is not so technologically savy and at a good price. good buy for an easy to use phone for every aspect", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good phone for the basics", "Author": "CrittrLovrRae", "ReviewID": "R3N3WOSNHPL89E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my husband's 2nd Octane.

Battery life is great, messaging is efficient, internet is lightning fast for a 3G phone. Sound quality is excellent as is the durability and all-around convenience of all the features this phone has to offer. Partial multitasking is awesome too (can send texts/info when in phone calls, etc.)Cons: If anything, and maybe a stretch, there is no external speakerphone for calls when the phone is flipped shut. I can't think of anything else undesirable about this phone.As for the service, it was amazing as well. Item arrived almost a week ahead of the given range, and for a \"refurbished\" phone, it was undescribably new and I was unable to tell it was ever used.

The main reason I chose this phone when my last one bit the dust was I loved it had no touch screen. Me and touch screens do not get along. This was the only one at the time that was a flip phone (which I prefer) and had a physical keyboard. The keyboard is very easy to use and there are no hindrances when texting.The battery life is definitely very good. I can go at least 4 days without charging, unless I talk a lot, then it will need charged in about 2 days. I mainly text so I can go quite awhile without charging. Usually by now my battery has started to drain more quickly with over a year use, but this one is still holding pretty strong.The camera is average. It's not one with all the features.
