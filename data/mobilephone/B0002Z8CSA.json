I wasn't disappointed - keypad and controls were similar, audio was great in a thinner package. While battery capacity was limited it made for a slimmer phone I could tuck in a belt holster without it getting caught in doors and narrow passageways. I don't use the camera much.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "sturdiest phone ever!", "Author": "A. Le", "ReviewID": "R3OQ19ODTC5UVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy from this seller, but I owned this phone when it first came out.  It is by far one of the best cell phones I've ever owned.  It has great reception, the sound quality is superb, and is very very sturdy.  My phone was dropped down the stairs, dropped in a puddle, left out in the sun at the beach where little grains of sand got everywhere and it functioned just fine.  The material it's made of is really tough and doesn't scratch easily if you take care not to drop it often.  The only problem I found with this phone is that it has a really poor camera and tiny screen.  Everything else was above par.  Hope this helps!  :)", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "motorola from freehasslecell.com", "Author": "Leonila Romualdo", "ReviewID": "RROGB641YHR9B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "order took 2 weeks because the package came back to them from the post office damaged. at least they upgraded it to a slightly better phone for it, but it still shouldnt have happened in the first place", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
