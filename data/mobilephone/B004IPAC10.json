{"Reviews": [{"Title": "...you say 'cheapskate', I say 'frugal'", "Author": "Darth Tesla", "ReviewID": "R19JJZTU7VXG3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was about to return this phone because Verizon wanted a $45 data plan just to activate it; then I read the brilliant comments by Chuck Homic.Opening the package, I saw the ESN/MEID HEX printed on the box. I held down the power button until the PALM light lit up on-screen. It took a while for it to boot up. The phone tried twice to call Verizon and activate itself, to no avail.On another phone, I called the Page Plus Cellular toll-free number and gave them the Pixi's MEID and the phone number that I wanted ported from my active, prepaid Verizon phone. They gave me a 'Premier Package' 6-digit activation code to dial from Pixi, and said that Verizon is usually quick to release your old number and to call back when they have done so.It took about an hour or so that the old cell number stopped ringing the old phone, indicating that it had been ported.In order to dial the activation code on the Pixi, you first press the little phone symbol on the screen and press Emergency Call. When the dialpad shows, hit the backspace three times to erase the 911 off the screen. Enter the six-digit code and hit the Call button. The phone will take a while to activate and will need to be rebooted when it's finished.After you reboot the phone, you'll have to do the Phone Symbol- Emergency Call- erase 911- thing again. Now on the dialpad, try to call a phone number near you to test, like a home number or something. When the phone near you rings, hang up and listen for the confirmation on the phone that it's working.IMPORTANT: Page Plus Cellular gives your account about $2 worth of phone/ text/ data to start your service. Because the Palm Pixi Plus requires a data connection to set up the Palm Profile and activate FIRST, you cannot use WiFi yet to do this. The $2 credit should be plenty to just set up your profile; if not, then call them from another phone and make sure you get the full-on Premier activation code.When I was told this, and since I only use the Voice feature for rare 'emergency' and 'notice' calls, then I opted for the Standard Plan of $10 for 100 minutes that expire after 120 days ($30/year).After the Palm Profile was set up, a brief video tutorial ensued. I then immediately tapped on the Signal Bars symbols to turn on the WiFi, and entered my router's WPA security code for access to my home WiFi network.Now using my own WiFi, I felt FREE to import/ associate the Pixi with my Google contacts, emails, and calendar. Sweet.Here are my notes on this - [Amazon took away the link to my SpringPad notes - [...] ]UPDATE: I've put 380+ songs on it, plus the Pandora App, and I still have 5gb of space.The 'Amazon MP3' app is already built in. The music sounds so good that I ordered the Palm headset as well. I also like the AccuWeather app and about 16 others.UPDATE: I got the dedicated Palm stereo headset for about $3 and discovered that double-clicking the Mic Mute button will advance to the next song (FF) - see review: Palm Stereo Headset for Palm Pixi and Palm Pre . At that price, I try to keep a pair in the car, work, etc.UPDATE: I got a deal on the Belkin Bluetooth dongle for Home Stereo - NEW Version Belkin F8Z492-P Bluetooth Music Receiver and so that I could play my music on the Pixi over my full system; I really like that.UPDATE: plugging and unplugging the charge cord was starting to be a chore, so I bought the TouchStone inductive charger from Palm where you just lay the phone on top of the thing - Palm Touchstone Charging Dock for Palm Pre and Palm Pixi. You have to use a special jacket w/ the TouchStone, and I chose one in bright orange - Palm Pixi Touchstone Cover (orange)UPDATE: THE HOLY GRAIL FOUND -- 'Mark' commented on Chuck Homic's post on Jun 16, 2011 - how to keep voice calls coming in while shutting off cellular data usage but still allowing for WiFi data flow:Mark says -\"Mobile hotspot is *not* the only way to consume data. The phone will try to use data silently in the background for you. But you can make it so that it won't do it via carrier data. Open up the phone app (the green phone handset icon), swipe down on the upper left hand menu and select \"Preferences and Accounts\". A new card will come up. Scroll to the bottom and you should see something labled \"Data Usage\". Set that to \"OFF\". This will also extend your battery life on the phone by quite a bit.\"\"If you really want to use the background data features of the phone - called \"Synergy\" - enable wifi and connect to your home wifi network.\"Thanks, Mark", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Entry Smartphone, Not good for intense users.", "Author": "Brewski", "ReviewID": "R21VBLOZTQI8A6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Palm Pixi Plus to replace a failing Palm Pre Plus. My biggest complaint about the Pre Plus was its keyboard, it was hard to use, and keys often failed.  It was my third Pre, and I still have time on my contract, so even though I want to switch to an Android based phone, I chose to go with this because the price (where as an Android phone would be much more expensive).Positives:So far, my experience with the Palm Pixi Plus has been much better than the Palm Pre Plus.  The hardware seems to be built a little better (no sliding moving parts), the keyboard is much easier to use and is responsive (however, my \"R\" key needs to be pushed a little harder than the others to respond.  Even though it \"clicks\", it won't type until you press just a little bit more.  Still MUCH better than my Pre.)  I like the size of the Pixi better than the Pre as I'm not a fan of having a huge smart phone.I only really use the device to receive e-mail, check social networking sites, and look up information on the go.  I do not play games on it, and would not recommend it to those looking for a smartphone to play games.  Music sounds fine, as do calls.  Mobile hotspot is a nice feature and works well (it even passes on GPS information to my iPod Touch)The GPS is a little frustrating to use due to Verizon's ability to lock out parts of a device you own, until you buy the monthly subscription fee.  (Although, if you open the VZNav App, and don't click anything, then open a GPS enabled App, it'll work fine.)I love Synergy, importing contacts from your e-mail, social networking sites, syncing your calendars, etc.  Notifications don't get in the way and are easy to manage.  Gestures work REALLY well, once you get the hang of it.You have more customization available to you than an iOS device, wallpapers, ringtones, notification tones, etc.Negatives:Coming from a Palm Pre Plus, I have to say that this is a slower device.  Apps take longer to load, and transitions don't seem as fluid.  It has a smaller screen than the Pre, but still readable.  Being that it's a Palm device, your choice of Apps is very limited (in comparison to the iOS App Store, or Android Market), so if you are looking for something with a large number of cool apps, look elsewhere.  It has the basics, but outside of that its nothing too special.  On top of it all, most apps are written for the Pre and are not compatible with the Pixi.  So, some of the better apps out there won't even work with this device.The camera is something to be desired.  I wouldn't ever buy this device for taking photos, but nice to have for random shots.There is no voice command for the phone.  Hands free is not possible with this device because this feature is missing.  Be careful out there!The charging door is a real pain to use, with the door constantly flipping back because of the strong magnetic pull.  A touchstone back really should have been included in this device.For those using Google Voice, your options are pretty limited in comparison to other platforms.You are limited to webOS 1.4.5.  HP said they will not support the current Pre's and Pixi's.  Real bummer since they did tell us we would be getting webOS 2.0.I've had lots of trouble with my Palm Pre Plus in the past due to hardware issues.  My hope is that this device lasts.  However, these Palm device are KNOWN for having hardware build quality issues.  Be warned!WARNING:Verizon REQUIRES you to have a smartphone plan if you use this device, meaning your plan could increase by 30 dollars a month, even if you won't be using the data on 3G (and using purely WiFi).  I don't agree with this mentality at all.  Also, this is NOT a world class phone, and will only work on USA CDMA networks.Tips:Install Preware to get some more functionality off the device.  I would also classify this between a true smartphone, and a feature phone.  It works well for what it can do, but don't expect anything beyond that.  It's a communication tool that can also play music, videos, check appointments, and surf the internet.

The last Palm device I bought at Amazon with paying full freight, was the Palm TX, a big disappointment. Taught me a great lesson, never pay full retail for electronics again, the price will drop even if it's older technology. As a result Palm lost me for many years as a customer after being a long time user. Until now. Could not resist this device at $56,which AT&T; sells unlocked for hundreds. Web OS is one of the slickest OS's ever encountered outside iPhone/touch, having no experience with Androids can't comment. Hardware is good, resolution very good, ringer volume on the low side but acceptable for me.  If you follow previous comments on how to activate the phone sans Verizon(see Chuck Homic,he is the reason I went for it(the method described worked superbly), it's the best bargain out there in the world of smartphones.

With Kitty wireless you can get good deals on pins and texting, good small company to deal in tandem with Pageplus, with all your cell phone needs. $30 dollars a year to keep the phone active, is a huge message to the big carriers that there are cheap alternatives, if you are willing to deal with not having the latest rage device, this is one heck of a phone, in a class of it's own.  Not a big gabber on the phone, so the low volume on incoming calls didn't bother me too much, you can always wear a headset, no mic needed. Lots of complaints over screen size, it's no bigger or smaller than most BlackBerry's out there I believe, when navigating web sites you do have to really pinch and zoom and double tap a lot.  You can use iTunes or windows media to sort of organize your stuff on the phone itself. Just drag iTunes music directly in to the device, you can use Windows Media Player, or in my case, Windows explorer drag and drop. Options galore.  The only minor complaint I have is the the ringer and speaker volume could be louder. I basically use this as my MP3 player and hearing the ringer with a headset is plenty loud, but being in a loud environment trying to hear a ringer might be a bit difficult, vibrate only works with one pulse and it's over. But the phone portion is not that critical for me, remember Verizon network has the least amount of dropped calls, which is comforting.

I have been struggling with a barely-working smartphone for months. Though I'm eligible for an upgrade, I've been holding out for continually delayed releases of LTE4G phones, or maybe the new iphone. I didn't want to upgrade to an old-tech 3G phone that I would be stuck with for two years. My old phone was so bad, I began looking at used droids, but then I stumbled on a blog comment claiming you could buy a new palm pixi online with no contract for less than $60! I was very skeptical but decided to check it out.IT'S TRUE! I ordered a pixi for about $52 including shipping and it was brand new still sealed in the box. I had a little trouble activating it so I called Verizon, who walked me through the activation process step by step. Then I noticed the pixi couldn't sync with my data on Microsoft Exchange so I called the Palm help line. An extremely knowledgeable young woman spent about an hour on a landline phone helping me load my calendar and contacts onto the pixi and giving me a tutorial on the most useful and impressive features of my new phone. I have never had such thorough customer suppport for any product from any company--ever!Now to the phone itself. I wasn't expecting much at this price, but I was and continue to be in total awe of this phone and its operating system. To be fair, I am moving to webOS from Windows Mobile, which wins my vote for the worst OS in history. Anything would have been a vast improvement. But I also have some experience with iOS because my mom got an iphone that I had to learn how to use so I could teach her. WebOS is similar to iOS, but arguably better in its approach to multi-tasking.I was surprised at how the small screen and small keyboard don't seem to bother me, though I must admit, I don't have the biggest fingers around. The keyboard seems to know which key you mean to press when your fingers accidentally press two keys at once. The screen is smaller than my old phone but the better resolution makes up for it.The only negatives I've encountered are the signal strength, which isn't as good in my office as my old phone had, and Palm's PDF viewer, which doesn't work for about half the PDFs I've tried. I'm going to call Palm to try to resolve those problems. In areas where the pixi struggles to pick up a signal, the battery drains quickly. So I ordered a couple of spare chargers, including the incredibly cool touchstone inductive charger. You can order a touchstone and the special battery cover for less than $25 total.I originally got this phone to hold me over for a few months till Verizon's new phone offerings are released, but now I'm thinking it's such a great phone, I can wait for the second-generation LTE phones when they arrive next year!", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Faulty and Already Registered.

Our family bought 3 Pixi Plus phones, so this review covers all 3 of them - not just a single lemon.Out of the box, plus accessories: I bought the Touchstone charging base and magnetic phone charging battery cover for dirt cheap from Verizon's store. The real deals. I tried to charge the phone out of the box using these accessories, but 2 of our 3 phones wouldn't charge on the Touchstone.  The third phone charged just fine with the Touchstone for about 2 weeks, then ceased charging on it.  We've never figured out why, unless we coincidentally got 3 nonworking Touchstones, battery covers or phones.  However it charges just fine with the accompanying cord and wall adaptor, or via the usb cable (same cable as the wall plug in, minus adaptor) and a computer.  We set up all of our phones using PagePlus and that all went fine (if a sort of long process). The phones each take between 5 and 10 minutes to start up when you turn them on, which I find excessive, especially as these phones are prone to sudden and unexpected shut downs and power ups.  More on that later.The physical phone itself:- Yes the buttons are super tiny. I knew that in advance and was prepared to spend a lot of time erasing misspelled texts. However what I didn't anticipate is that Palm has placed tiny buttons that you will be pushing all the time *right next to* tiny buttons that you do not want to push at all.  Why?  Who knows.  The back space for instance is right next to the \"enter/send\" button.  So if you accidentally misspell a word in a text, you're very likely to attempt to backspace and instead send a misspelled, half finished text by hitting the enter button (incidentally, aside from the enter and backspace being directly adjacent, they have nearly identical symbols on them...).  There are also a few mysterious symbols (like a large white blobby rectangle) that are for function buttons... not very intuitive at all, but we're all getting used to \"blob A\" being the \"&\" etc.- Beyond that, the touch screen is fine, if small, and has a neat little demo that shows you how to back up, fling something off the screen (very satisfying) and minimize windows.  The software... meh... I'm getting used to it, but it's very limited and it takes a lot more work and screen stabbing/stroking to get to oft-used commands than I think it should.  Personal preference.  Conversely, it's very, very easy to accidentally call someone.  If you miss a call while away from the phone there is a light bar indication, but no audible signal.  When you check your missed calls, if you touch the bar that says \"missed call!\" it will automatically dial that person's number. We have all repeatedly called each other, our doctor, etc. accidentally in the last several months.  Again - user error, but a very easy one to make even after knowing how the error is made.- The ringer. There is a solid clicking button on the side that turns your ringer sound on or off.  However, all of our phones regularly cycle through turning their own ringers on and off at random.  For instance while I've been typing my review with my phone on the table next to me, untouched, my phone has emitted 3 separate buzzing sounds to alert me that the sound was now ON, then OFF, and now ON again.  All while just sitting there chilling out on my table.  The button is still technically set to ON and I haven't touched it.  So who knows.- The software.  There is something called Preware that we've installed on our phones and it gives us the ability to add different homebrew aps, which was nice.  I've added three, two of which work REALLY well and have been wonderful to use (like file manager - love it!), and the third ap (for Twitter) constantly crashes my phone.  So it's a toss up if these aps will work well.- Weirdly shutting down for no reason.  All 3 of our phones do this about once a week, on average.  For no reason while sitting there, mid-text, during a call or while checking email, the phone will just go black, then power itself up again excruciatingly slowly.  Sometimes it just shuts off and does not power back on, and only plugging it in and monkeying with the power button will help it (this is while fully charged... not an empty battery issue).- Holding a charge.  My phone gets used moderately - about maybe 2 hours of calls a day, maybe 20 texts on average, no data use unless checking for texts with attachments (below), limited internet use (about 10 minutes a day) and my charge usually lasts until bed time if it's fully charged in the morning.  Phone #2 is used by a text intensive teen, no internet, little phone calls, and lasts for about a full day plus a half day.  Oh - and the phone batteries all get VERY hot.- Picture messages.  I've read a ton of forum posts about this subject.  NONE of our phones can send or receive picture messages or any attachments unless we turn our Data on.  It won't send them via phone. It doesn't want to use the wifi to send them either.  I don't know why.  And since you'll probably want to have your data turned off until you need it unless you have an unlimited data plan, it makes it tough for spontaneous \"hey look at this!\" texts to arrive on time.  We've all gotten in the habit of twice a day cycling our data ON... any pictures coming in, dum de dum... and then turning it back OFF.- Camera.  One of our cameras is terrible, the other 2 take decent pictures.  Not outstanding, but recognizable and sharp.- Sound quality.  Weeeeell, it's good if you have the phone in the right position, but if you like to tilt your head to trap the phone between shoulder & ear, you have a high likelihood of covering the mic and your caller won't hear you.  A head set would solve this, or just holding the phone to your ear old school, but for those of us who like to multitask, it's just a piddling kind of problem.  I do hear from folks that my voice \"cuts out\" quite a bit.  Also I drop calls like the dickens, but that may be my new phone service and not the Pixi's fault.- Speaker phone. This is the first phone I have ever owned that it's possible to have an entire conversation over speaker phone without all the \"whaaat??\" or distorted robot voice.  And when I have it on speaker, the other person can hear me (and I them) from across the room.  It's the one feature this phone has that I would rank as outstanding.Okay, that's the majority of my thoughts on this phone.  If you can get it for forty bucks, consider it a forty dollar phone.  You aren't getting a two or three hundred dollar phone for forty bucks.  It's essentially a cheap smartphone with a lot of bugs, tics, quirks and hiccups - however you'll be able to call your friends (often without trying!) and text and stuff with only limited hassle.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweet Value with many features", "Author": "Keng", "ReviewID": "R1Q70ALM3ZUSN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I couldn't believe that this phone was on sale for $48.00 brand new!

Carl \"Matt C\"", "ReviewID": "R1KBLBBV4VU0QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently I lost my iPhone. I went to the Verizon store and was told it would cost me well over $500 for a replacement iPhone since I had not bought insurance nor was I eligible for an upgrade yet (just another 3 1/2 months to go). Even the other \"cheaper\" brand models of smart phones cost several hundred without the discount of being a new subscriber or being eligible for a phone upgrade by having fulfilled 20 months of my obligated 2 year contract. What to do? Welcome to the Palm Pixi (or as I like to call it the Poor Mans iPhone).The Palm Pixel only costs about $40 brand new! That being said I had very low expectations for this thing, after all I really only need this thing to get me through the next 3 months until I am eligible for a new phone through Verizon again. Sometimes I get a little annoyed that the touch screen isn't super responsive, that the operating system can seem a bit sluggish, that the camera is only 2 megapixels, or that apps periodically crash, and then I remind myself that this thing ONLY COST $40! The fact that this thing can do anything more than make phone calls ought to blow your mind away! I also love that it has an 8gb hard drive to hold my music and I can use it as an mp3 player when I commute to/from work. Heck, just a couple years ago an 8gb touch screen iPod cost over 6 times the amount of this and it still couldn't do nearly as much.On a side note involving Phone insurance, DO NOT GET IT! I say this as someone who lost his phone and could have benefited from having it. Phone insurance through Verizon costs about $7/mo. Over the course of a 2 year contract that will cost you about $168 whether you lose your phone or not. If you do happen to lose your phone it will cost you an additional $100 deposit (basically you are paying upwards of $300 for a \"Free\" replacement phone). With the extremely low prices of cheaper model smart phones like this Palm Pixi you are much better off to forgo their insurance route and if worse comes to worse you pick up one of these cheapo models to hold you over until your contract expires/ you are eligible for an upgrade.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone for the price", "Author": "robtheman", "ReviewID": "RQQ656GP2LFE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So i was looking for a good small cheap smart phone to use that had wifi, and some pep told me about the palm pixi plus, and i use pageplus its cheap so i got a link to amazon from a friend,n where i see the price for it was 37$ free sh i was like wow nice, but why so cheep? thought maybe used or something or they suck, but o well bought 2 of them one for me and my mom , got them n they where new in box, never used, we got service on them with pageplus  and i love it facebook  and all full web and 2mp with falsh n more,  all for 37$ battery life is good. cant beat that price for a smart phone, atttt alllll , so if your looking for a good cheap smart phone or a back up get it,PS; I had to wait a month to do this review to see if there where any problems with the cell and battery life and more, but nope still works great.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely The Best!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R35OJC7RMZZQUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this phone!

Viewing its features and its failures through the lense of its very low price, I give it five stars.  If it cost 10 times as much as many smart phones do, my affection would be more limited.  It is not without problems, but they are manageable. I feel I got more than I paid for.  I like how small it is, and it's easy to hold; I've never dropped it.  It looks good. Feels well made too.The WiFi feature works well for me, since both my home and workplace have WiFi. Thus I rarely need to use over-the-air data. Getting email on the Pixi is therefore convenient almost anytime for essentially free.The telephone app works well enough when I don't accidentally dial a number when simply attempting to view those calls I've missed. No one complains about the audio quality they hear, nor would I.  With monthly service plans of as low as 2.50/mo. or 12.00/mo. at Kitty Wireless/Page Plus, this smart phone is even more affordable.  Incredibly affordable for as low as $30/year! I imagine this phone would serve well for limited purposes for kids who didn't text very much.Watching YouTube videos on the Pixi is very easy.  The Pixi's little speaker inside is loud enough to be clearly heard. Thus the Pixi is even useful for playing music with apps such as Pandora or \"Slacker Radio\" or \"TuneIn by Radio Time\" or \"Internet Radio.\" The Pixi earphones are also pleasant sounding even if not very comfortable; maybe you need bigger earlobes?I like the GPS apps too such as Mapping Tool (Pro) which allows saving aerial photo base maps to the Pixi's memory and from then on not needing WiFi or over-the-air access to locate the position and drawing a track during travels. These other apps are fine too:  BFG Maps, Trip Advisor and \"Where's My Car.\"  On the other hand I hate the HP Maps/Bing app that requires downloading and reinstallation every time; what was HP thinking when it dumped this poor excuse for a map app on us? Well, even Apple's iPhone 5 has a bad gps mapping problem. Fortunately we have other partial choices if we don't want to download the native mapping app that HP switched us to. For most travels, I still use my Tom Tom GPS.My only problem with Angry Birds Lite is that it is somewhat addicting. But there are times a few minutes with it are delightful.I've had to replace two Touchstone-adapter backs due to delamination problems that are annoying and can't easily be remedied by any glue I tried. But that's a small price to pay since replacement back covers are affordable.  The Touchstone wireless chargers are very cool, instant and easy to use.  I bought more than one so they're convenient and I never run out of power each day.Yes, the Pixi is slow. And it needs to be turned off and back on every few days to prevent it from complaining that there are too many apps open at once, even when only one is open. That's easy enough to do though.  And the keyboard is a delight for something so small.  So, one year later and I'm still happy with this phone.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible Bargain", "Author": "Mark Burmeister", "ReviewID": "R2NFGYDBGFRTGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: - good build quality and design - small, light, and thin - WebOS is very slick and works well - good quality standard apps cover basic functions - cheap accessories readily available - cheap service from Page Plus - unbelievable low priceCons: - uses an old version of WebOS, 1.4.X and can't be easily upgraded to v2 - there is no voice dialing function available. I can't believe Palm shipped a phone without this. My cheap function phones have had this capability for years. - end-of-line product with HP ending Palm hardware production and making WebOS open source - screen smaller than Palm Pre and most other smart phones - WebOS has a very limited app selection compared to iOS and Android. This may improve depending on how  WebOS does in the market now, but most new apps will probably not run on the old hardware - of the limited selection of commerical apps and 3D games out there, many only run on the Pre and not the Pixi Plus. This is a shame given that the Pixi Plus is very capable of handling any apps the Pre runs, but I understand developers had to take extra steps to build versions for the Pre and Pixi, and the development kit was late for the Pixi.Tip: - there is only one rear speaker. I read one review where a user returned his phone because one of the rear speakers wasn't working. I did some research, and only one of the grills on the back is a speaker and the other one is just there for design symetry. The volume is okay, even with only one speaker.  I have been looking for a while for a way to get an inexpensive smart phone with no contract and not incur large service charges. Last year I got my wife an old Palm Treo 650 for easier texting. Even with that 2004 vintage phone, it was a big hassle to get Verizon to disable data service and not charge us $40/month. A little investigation found that the Pixi Plus was available at a very low price, not much more than used Palm Treos or standard cell phones, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews. This peaked my interest, but I needed to determine how I could get it connected to low cost service. I just switched my wife's Verizon number to the Page Plus $12/mo plan with no issues, so I checked to make sure the Pixi Plus could be used with Page Plus as well. I found extensive information on-line, including in other reviews here, detailing the process for activating the phone with Page Plus. My mother-in-law, who is on my Verizon plan, expressed an interest in the Pixi Plus, so I let her be the first to try it out.  I ordered the phone from Amazon with the benefit of 2-day Prime shipping, and it arrived yesterday. First impressions were that Palm must have put a lot of focus on aesthetics, since the phone, packaging, and accessories were all well designed and gave an impression of quality. The Pixi Plus is slightly smaller than I expected, and it is very thin for a smartphone. I went through the setup and activation procedure detailed in other reviews. The Palm profile setup is mandatory and requires cellular data service, but once that is done, all data requirements can use wifi. I had to make two calls to Page Plus, one to port the number over from Verizon, and when that was done, a second to activate the phone on Page Plus. The wait on hold was about 10 minutes each time, and the Page Plus customer service people were both polite and helpful. There is no charge from Page Plus if you are porting an existing number. Once that was completed, I went in the phone preferences menu, disabled data, and connected to my wifi. I got a $12 plan at Page Plus, which provides 250 minutes, 250 texts, and 10MB data for a month, and the phone was good to go. If you plan to have mobile data enabled, you'll want to choose a plan with much more data included (the $30 plan includes 100MB).  While I have limited experience with iOS and Android, I have to say that WebOS, even the older version on the Palm Pixi, is very slick. The touchscreen is a little small but very clear, and gestures work smoothly. The keyboard is small but very usable with good feedback. I was amazed at how well multi-tasking works on a fairly low-powered device. I ended up playing with the phone for several hours, trying out the various functions, and downloading a few apps. Everything worked smoothly and was intuitive. There were no errors or crashes. Loading most webpages took around 10 seconds. I had been worried about the lack of apps, but the basics are well-covered with a good browser, YouTube, messaging, Pandora, and a great streaming radio app called TuneIn. You can even stream MPEG-4 movies from Archive.org. This morning we delivered the phone to my mother-in-law, so I'll see how she likes it. She is non-technical, but I don't think she should have any trouble with it.

I decided to get the Pixi since I had always seen WebOS as a great smartphone OS undeservedly overshadowed by Palm (and subsequently HP's) odd hardware design decisions. After hearing about HP's decision to abandon smartphone hardware development, I couldn't refuse the opportunity to pick one of these up at such a low price. I figured it could at least serve as a backup phone without extending my contract should my Droid ever decide to malfunction.One week later and I am floored by the fluid, no-hassle design of WebOS, the respectable battery life (it will easily get me through a day with what I subjectively consider to be heavy usage with no less than 20% charge left), the excellent hardware keyboard, and the crystal-clear call quality. Is it a Droid X? No. That's comparing apples to oranges. Is it a great smartphone? Yes.This isn't meant to be a comprehensive review - I'll leave that to the e-blogs and websites - but those who want to write off WebOS without giving it the hardware platform it deserves to shine and capture a wider audience should reconsider.

I got the best phone on Verizon's Network and honestly I liked my enV more. Now my reasons for not liking the Droid X had nothing to do with hardware, it had the best hardware HD camera, 1ghz processor, slim, and fantastic storage and on board memory. I hated Android. It was clunky and things that should be easily changed couldn't be. All keyboards suck on Android. I bought many, tried swype none of them were over 75% accurate. I liked the Pixi Plus since one no one has one I like to be unique. Another plus over droid X is its small like half the size which is good atleast in my eyes. Before I bought this I was like it could be too small the keys wont be any different than on the touchscreen but the keys are pretty much perfect a little bigger would be better but they work. They are back lit as well which I worried about since it didnt say it anywhere but I could find people talking about the pre's back lit keyboard so I was worried but they are so nbd. Onto WebOS. Its nice pretty easy to use and a lot easier to get used to than Android. Contacts are neat as they merge everything into the one app. Emails, facebook, I.M., and home work and cell phones into one contact. The only thing I dont like is I have emails from people that I dont talk to really but dont want them deleted so they show up in my contacts (as in you cant remove them from contacts) And really my only other problem is the Pixi is slow out the gate if the Pixi had the innards of the Droid X it would be a tremendous winner. Good news about the WebOS devices is there is a great homebrew community which I was skeptical about but it real is practical and pretty official. They have a store that you download a real easy process and you get neat things like plugins and you can overclock your phone. Which is a necessity for the Pixi. You dont have to overclock much its stock is 600mhz and 740mhz is the lowest overclock available and is fine. It doesnt get any warmer or drain the battery like a fiend. Speaking of which, the battery can last all day if your not doing real heavy use. Another plus is on Verizon you get the 5GB Mobile Hotspot free which is usually an additional $50 a month. You dont have to hack phone or anything like on android. The phone is really good and accessories are dirt cheap I mean batteries $4? Yeah grab a few of those.

The login fields were pre populated with a previous username. I decided to try to activate the phone anyways since it was in a like new condition.I called Page Plus and went through all the steps to activate it but nothing was working. The problem was that the phone could not get a signal from any cell towers. It just said searching... The Page Plus rep suggested that maybe the phone was defective because it seemed like the radio in the phone was not functioning properly. I was a little discouraged to hear that but he did have a point. But I dont give things up easily. So I decided to try and trouble shot the problem myself  with success.When I did was I typed in ##786# into the phone dialer. This brings up a screen with logistics support information. I then scrolled all the way down and at the bottom of that screen is a reset button. When you press this button a dialog box appears called \"Mastery Subsidy Lock\" asking for a password. I did some searching and found that the pasword is simply 000000. This will reset your phone to the condition it was in before it left the factory. So it erased the phone memory including any previous user settings. It also rests all radios and so forth and then the phone rebooted. After the phone turned back on it immediately found the nearest cell tower and was receiving its signal. I was then able to activate the phone with Page Plus without any issue.So in summery... If you have any problems activating and/or receiving any signal just open your dialer and:type ##786# in the dialerscroll down to the bottom of the next screen that openshit the rest button and enter the passord 000000 in the dialod boxconfirm the reset and wait for your phone to rebootThat should hopefully fix the problem.Update 1: I forgot to mention that this phone did not have any recondition date.

At first glance, one might think that the Palm Pixi Plus would be a bad choice for an older person because it is so small and light, and the keys are so small. HOWEVER, the keys are very easy to hit with your fingernails, and since they are very elevated there is little risk of hitting the wrong key. PLUS the layout on the home screen is very nicely simple and straightforward. Very friendly to the technically challenged.

Since her current Blackberry phone is under contract for more than an additional year, what a great option!Two thumbs up!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Money saving little phone!", "Author": "M. Owens", "ReviewID": "R93U5H7VXVE37", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because my LG EnV kept turning itself off and I didn't want to extend my contract with Verizon. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before buying it and this one seemed to be the best choice for the price. If you will notice, most of the negative reviews about this phone are directed at the OEM shop and not the phone itself.I recived the phone and activated it on Verizon. Of course my bill went up by $30 a month and I was unhappy about that. I waited out the rest of my contract and as soon as it was up, I transferred all three of my lines from Verizon to PagePlus via Kittywireless. This process took me about 3 hours. The important thing to remember is not to transfer the parent line first (call Verizon and ask which line is the parent line). All of my phones ported over with absolutely no glitches! There are forms to fill out online for the porting process on Kittywireless and each port costs $15.Once the phones ported over I got e-mails saying that I was now a PagePlus customer. I was able to quickly set up the phones by following the instructions in the e-mail. Then I went to KittyWireless and put all of the phones on their TNT 1200 auto-pay plan. So each of the phones gets 100mb of data, 1200 minutes and 3000 texts (I ran reports on Verizon.com before switching to be sure this was enough to cover our usage of the phones). This costs me 29.95 per line. I was paying 180.00 a month for my phones on Verizon.So anyway... back to the Pixi. The data on this phone is super-easy to turn off. You tap on the phone icon, tap on the top left tab that says \"Verizon Wireless\", tap on preferences and then scroll down and turn data off. This way you aren't using data when you don't need to. I turn my data on once a day to get my MMS messages. And if that's not easy enough, there is an ap you can download (if you put preware on your phone) that toggles your data on and off. I haven't seen anything like this on an android phone.The phone connects to WiFi without a giltch. You tap on the right top corner, it shows a list of options, you click on wifi and tell it to connect. It will then ask for a password if your wifi is password connected. To save on battery, when you are out of range you can simply turn off wifi AND data.The battery on the phone can last two days. You just have to make sure to turn WiFi off when it's not in range because it expends a lot of battery power to search for available WiFi.E-mail sets up easily and if you are connected to 3g or to WiFi it pops up in the bottom part of your phone, you can click on it or slide it off and not see the notification.The gestures on the phone make it very easy to use. WebOS actually encourages people to develop apps so you can download all kinds of apps for free using preware. I did a youtube search on how to put preware on my phone and a 12 year old kid on the video explained the process easily enough! LOL!Pandora works well using the WiFi on this phone so I'm not using up all my data to stream music. The phone can do basic web searches and some videos without a problem.The touchstone charging dock and cover are kind of a nice addition. You just set your phone down and it charges. The phone charges rather quickly compared to androids too. The nicest part about it is that these items cost very little on Amazon. I also got a few covers for just 2 or 3 dollars.The phone is super slim and I like that a lot. I don't like carrying a brick in my pocket! It's light and small and you can barely notice it in your pocket. There's a silent button on the side of the phone that will put it on vibrate without going through dumb menus or unlocking the phone to try and get it to be silent during meetings and such.Now here are my gripes:I have small hands (wedding ring size 5) and it took me a while to get used to the small buttons for texting. There isn't an option for a touchscreen key-board so you are stuck with what you get. Now that I'm used to it, texting is just as quick as it was on the large keypad of my EnV. When I'm texting quckly, for some reason instead of an X, C or V sometimes it inserts a space. So saying live looks more like li e. That's annoying but if I slow down I can take care of it easily enough.Every once in a while no matter what I try to do with the phone I get a message \"too many cards open\". All I have to do is push the top power button while turning the volume down. This pops a menu up and gives me the option to restart the phone. After restarting, the phone doesn't give that annoying message anymore. It hasn't happened for about five months now though.The phone can get glitchy if you have too many things going at once. Like if you are looking at email and running pandora in the back ground and texting it can get slow. Re-starting it the same way I described earlier is helpful and so is cutting down on mulit-tasking.Taking the cover off is a pain in the behind. I always feel like I'm going to break the back cover but I haven't yet.Another downside is the fact that there really isn't any new software being developed for the phone. You can get angry-birds and certain games or books on the phone but you aren't going to be the coolest kid on the block with the newest apps.Overall this phone has helped me save a lot of money. It's capable of doing some things that basic phones can't do. It's still pretty cool but not top of the line which is perfect for me because 100 mb of data can last me a whole month. KittyWireless' coverage has been the exact same as what I had with Verizon. If the TNT 1200 plan isn't enough I can always upgrade to unlimited for $40 or $55. Heck... I want to buy a couple more just to have for back-ups at this price!!**Update: I've had this phone for a year now and I've gone through 3 back covers for it. Two touchstone covers as well as the original cover. They start peeling apart where the power button is and I can't stand it so I mess with it and the rubber part comes off the back. Also the little magnetic strip for the battery cover falls off quite easily.

I've never owned a smart phone, and so I can't compare it to any others.A couple of months ago, I lost my LG chocolate that I got for free when I renewed my Verizon contract, which expires in 12/11. I considered renewing my contract for another 2 years, but the options were very different from 2 yrs ago when I last renewed my contract. Then, you could get most any state-of-the-art phones for free with a contract renewal. Now, there are only 1-2 free non-smart phone options for free with a contract, and the state-of-the-art smart phones cost hundreds of dollars WITH A 2 YEAR CONTRACT RENEWAL. Without a contract, non-smart phones start at over $200, and smart phones can be over $700. I was in sticker shock. After just losing a phone that I really liked (perhaps stolen?) I worried about having an expensive phone, having it be vulnerable to theft, and trying to replace it again with the prices ever increasing.And so...I was delighted and incredulous when I saw the Palm Pixie for sale at $39. With a price like that, I felt there wasn't that much to lose to give it a try. I was also drawn by the fact that it is a no contract phone, as I don't get cell coverage where I live, and figured getting a prepaid plan when my contract runs out would save money (.95/day for days you use the phone + .05 per minute).I have been blown away by the phone's capabilities. The sound is clearer than my old phone, the tiny QWERTY keyboard and the touch screen take some getting used to for an older technology user like myself, but are very useable once you get used to them. I love the smart phone screens, and actually enjoy their ease of use. I've never had a smart phone before, so I don't know how it compares to others, but I love it!I feel like I wasn't clever enough to talk Verizon out of forcing me to have a data plan ($30/mo) with this phone. I can see many other people have had luck with this, and I'd love to get some pointers. In the meantime, I'm really enjoying the Internet connection, and listen to music frequently. The little speakers are okay, and it has a standard earphone plug (I used one I got on an airplane).I plan to go \"no contract\" when my contract expires, and save $$$. Fees and prices of cell phones continue to rise, and more elaborate and expensive services get added all the time. I'm grateful to Palm for offering a product with such amazing value. I notice that the cost of it has increased from $39 to $44 just in the month since I bought it, so if you're considering buying one, do so soon.

One tip to add to other great tips given on this product site would be to make sure when you add minutes through the toll free number for PagePlus or if you call customer service that you turn your phone off first or the minutes won't load.

Swope", "ReviewID": "R1POA2DSAVFB8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review just after purchasing my second palm pixi (for my daughter) and am thinking quite seriously about a 3rd & 4th.  It is a terrific phone for what I paid: $36 from the OEM shop (notated as there are several different marketplace sellers).  My experience was very good, phone arrived fast, and new (other reviewers commented on having trouble activating used phones).  The package included a wall charger and usb charger.I'd like to thank many reviewers who pointed to pageplus!  what a fantastic deal, and very nice people too.  Regards activation, it took a bit more time as the msin # was not on the box and had to be retrieved from inside the phone, under the battery (not a huge issue, just took a bit of extra time).  I will also note that the 12 cents left after activation is *before you put any money in*.  After activation I had just over 100 minutes, ample time to check the phone/ service/ coverage; all very good.Back to the phone itself: as one with many (too many) cell phones... mostly from bad experience; poor service/ coverage etc  I would compare this favorably to every other phone I have bought in this price range (e.g. the lg620g  LG 620G Prepaid Phone (Net10) which is an adequate phone, but nowhere near as nice or fully featured as this phone.  I would also compare it favorably to the motorola razor (not a very smart or solid phone) as well as several basic Nokias.  The pixi is an early  smart phone (as in pre-android).  It has PDA features (contacts, task list) implemented as cards (basically ap icons) an MP3 & video player, which unlike on some other phones/ services, you can add your own music to my dragging & dropping.  It also has a button to connect to Amazon's MP3 store.  The phone has \"synchrony\" to  connect to google, MS outlook and palm's website, which brings me to one important feature I *really dislike* : Your info will be stored on Palm's server.  I personally hate the intrusion on privacy and am hoping for legislation to contain it. But, this is something you should know.  It will limit how I use my phone! There are friends who also value their privacy... I can not will not put them in my contact list, so that cripples the phone somewhat for me.  I also will not use an organizer function which posts my appointments to any web site.  I am a psychologist, (there are real ethical issues here). I am hoping this is not a trend.  If it is, I will be buying up last gen phones rather than succumb to the intrusion.The phone also has a web browser (verizon's implementation) email connects, as well as popular social networking sites.My complaints with this phone are few and mostly related to Verizon; the documentation is minimal at best (e.g. to transfer music, drag & drop... it does not say where.  I put different songs in the phone window, and created a music folder within it, both were picked up by the MP3 player).  I have not yet figured out if I can create ringtones on it, but know, at least that I can import them (some phones block this, forcing you to buy from the service).  The user guide has more information on how to use gestures, unique to this platform, than other aps. or even the physical phone (when I needed to remove the battery to activate, there was no info on how to open the phone...) It was fairly simple, and info available out on the web, but why was it not included in the user manual?  It seems the manuals (3 included) are more about disclainmers & safety warnings (don't listen to your music too loud, throw your battery in a  fire: good one, submerge in water... so it is a process of discovery, finding out what all of the features are.  It is not a complicated phone to figure out or use, but reasonable documentation is nice.  Some of us *do* read the manual ;)In brief: This is a great phone for what it is currently selling for.  You can use it as a prepaid phone on cdma networks. It is a smart (not android) phone with PDA functions, a browser, MP3 and video player, a camera (which I forgot to mention earlier) which also shoots video (not very high quality, but then none of them are) and some features which can make set up etc easier for some as it uses synchronicity to pull down your contacts, to do lists... from other sites (if you give it permission).  It also has aps and google maps on board (you have to enable google snoop to use them).cons:Poor documantation/ user manuals, no memory expansion (but a good amount on board), have to agree to Palm's terms of use which will pick up information you enter. (Note: other \"features\" require giving permission to various services, but those can be denied, Palm's can not).  I personally do not like being tracked or having my personal info distributed, sold... and will always opt-out.  Fortunately most of these decisions are put in your hands (so you can opt to use google maps if you permit google, e.g.  I have several of these features turned off or crippled on my phone, but still think it is a terrific phone for what it costs; best I have found so far.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why you must buy this phone", "Author": "Customer", "ReviewID": "R2NU5AZEP5U89P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Reasons you must buy this phone.....1.

I called Verizon's customer service and sorted things out but not before I mailed in (yes, by snail mail) a copy of my Amazon invoice and packaging to prove that I indeed bought a no-contract phone from Amazon. The customer agent told me that when their employee registered with the phone with Verizon, it showed up as a subsidized phone on the system (meaning that the vendor has already received a kickback from Verizon). I do not know whether this was true or the Verizon guy who activated my phone simply made some type of mistake while he was activating it. (To Verizon's credit, they not only undid my 2-year extension to my existing contract, they actually completely wiped off my contract (that had three more months left in it) and offered me a $50 upgrade credit and a waiver of my phone bill for one full month instead of the $30 upgrade that I had previously as part of new-every-two-years deal.)

It is very capable and does pretty much everything I need it to do. The Facebook integration is top notch, I browse the web, balance my checkbook, take quick memos, chat on Google Talk, manage my schedules, read and write e-mail, look up addresses on Google Maps, use online banking, watch Youtube videos, and play online chess occasionally. WebOS is simply amazing. At around $50 without contract for a very capable smartphone, there simply is no excuse to be buying a feature phone at this moment. I actually wanted a Pre 3 from HP and was going to use Pixi Plus as my interim smartphone and a primer to webOS, but I can definitely see myself using this device for a year or two without having to upgrade. Very happy with my purchase. Make sure you pick up a Touchstone or two and a Touchstone-enabled back cover as well. Oh, and instaling Preware and overclocking with UberKernel and Govnah will make the operation so much smoother.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "great product, not perfect", "Author": "Travis Hubble", "ReviewID": "R1RHDJ2NOMDG1Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Several reviews have noted that the magnet for the charger flap quickly comes unglued and makes charging awkward. I have now owned the phone for 9 months, and have zero problems with that.I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.I bought my palm pixi plus in July 2011.  I loved it so much I bought another one for my wife.  I have been a palm or handspring user since the early days.  There are many things I love about the palm pixi, and a few things I can't stand.  But overall, I think it's a great product.First, the catch: you should know that the reason it is so heavily discounted is that HP, which bought palm, recently announced it is getting out of the consumer electronics business altogether. But then the board sacked their CEO, and nobody really knows what the future of palm or webos will be, but it doesn't look bright.  That said, I would not hesitate to snap these up.The uncatch--like many reviewers have said, you don't have to be a Verizon customer or pay their enormous data plans to use this phone.  There are ways I understand people can activate it and use wifi with absolutely no cell phone plan.  I wanted some cell phone use, so I went to kittywireless.com and followed their instructions for activating it on the Pageplus network.  You can get a prepaid plan for as little as $30 a year, and it's still under 10 cents a minute.I bought this phone because my Palm Zire 31 was dying, and I was getting tired of carrying around a PDA and a cell phone.  I also wanted something with a camera, and I wanted to browse the internet and check my email using Wifi, and, in a pinch, using 3G.  I am not at all interested in paying for an unlocked iphone, and have zero interest in an iphone plan.  That leaves basically Android and webos.  Since the pixi plus costs a fraction of an Android device, I bought the pixi plus.  I will discuss the PIM, the OS, the phone, the camera, the web browsing, and the hardware.1. PIM. The PDA/PIM functionality is adequate, but disappointing.  I find it ironic that Palm's personal information management software has progressively gotten worse through the years.  The notepad application is pathetic, it takes several different clicks to add a new contact after making a call, it has no basic expense app, it doesn't have things that Handspring had years ago, like floating tasks (nor did the Zire), and it lacks a basic hotsync ability.  That said, there are workarounds for almost all of these issues.  Note-taking/journaling is one of the primary reasons I use a PDA.  I found the app store has plenty of good notepad replacements (including with sync, such as Noted with simplenotes for $2).  If you need syncing of contacts and calendar (I don't), it will sync to the cloud with things like google and yahoo, or with palm if you desire.  You can also pay something like $40 for the Missing Sync, which will allow you to sync to your computer and also allow you to run previous palm software.  I was tempted, but have chosen not to buy it.  There are plenty of expense programs for cheap.  And I am satisfied with the organic tasks app. I love the LDS Gospel Library.That said, it still lags far behind the Zire in this aspect.  I timed how long it takes me to pull up today's calendar events and then my current tasks on my zire 31 and on my palm pixi.  The Zire took 1.5 seconds, the pixi took 10.5 seconds.  Here's to progress. I also miss several of the free apps that have been developed over the years for previous palm platforms. The webos app store is good, but it's not what palm used to have, nor (to be fair) is it anything like Android or Apple's.2. Webos.  Overall, the webos experience is great. It feels very much like an apple iOS ripoff with a few extras, and works great. I have had it hang up twice in the last 3 months, but it resolved with a simple soft reset.  Every once in a while it will say that I have too many cards open when there is only one open, so it seems like there is some kind of glitch there, but it's not a big deal.3. Phone.  The phone works fine.  I am a bit disappointed at the software.  For instance, when scrolling through contacts to make a call, if you notice a contact that needs to be edited, it is very difficult to do that without accidentally calling the number. I made a number of accidental phone calls when I first bought the phone.  But I think I have got the hang of it now.4. Camera.  The camera is nothing to write home about, but it works fine.  It has a small LED flash that is basically worthless.  I think once it has actually improved the picture--usually it just washes it out.  The video camera is nice.  The camera loads up a bit slow, but the picture quality is pretty good for a 2MP.  I have really enjoyed having a camera in my pocket all the time.5. Web browsing and email.  The web browser is intuitive and easy to use.  You pinch to zoom out and so forth just like with apple.  The screen is a bit small if you like to do this all the time, but I personally prefer having the smaller form factor.  Email works beautifully. You can set it to sync with whatever email provider you have and how often to update, and it gives you little notifications of new email.6. Hardware. I LOVE the small form factor.  That is one of my favorite things about this device.  It is so small I can carry it everywhere and forget about it.  And the rubberized backing is clever.  I was a bit concerned about how small the keyboard was, since I have pretty big fingers and I do a lot of note typing, but I LOVE the external keyboard.  I rarely make a mistake, and it is so much faster than typing on my wife's old itouch.  The phone has a standard headphone jack, and music quality is great.  It has 8GB of storage, which is adequate, but I wish it had expansion SD cards.  It could use more RAM, but I just have to keep to a minimum how many apps I have open.  I like having a simple external switch for silencing the ringer.  The battery can be swapped out fairly easily (but not as easily as I would like, given the rubber backing), and they only cost $4!  Battery life is adequate, but by no means great.  On average use, I can go about 2 days on a single charge. My biggest gripe is you have to pry open a little plastic thing to insert the charging cable.  I don't know who thought of that, but it is ridiculous.

It looked used. The back cover was dirty, not in plastic, had greasy smudges on it from fingers, and the part above the USB port was broken.Now on to the phone review:The initial boot-up took a few minutes which is ypical of most smartphones, especially old ones with slow processors. Once it booted up, I was prompted to activate the phone with Verizon Wireless. I shut the phone off, went to my account page on Verizon's website, activated the phone, then started over again.After activation, I was prompted to create a Palm account. The first thing I noticed was how cramped and sludgy feeling, yet clicky the keyboard is. The second thing I noticed was how slow this thing is. But I wasn't expecting much from a smartphone with a 600mhz processor. Seriously though, when I tried to change my ringtone, it took 5-10 seconds for the phone to gather and display the ringtones. \"Seconds\" doesn't usually indicate a long time, but compare it to any smartphone released in the past year and it'll seem slow.Once initial setup was completed, a walkthrough began to play which demonstrated how to use the phone's gestures. What looks like dead space/useless bezel between the keyboard and the screen is actually a touch panel for back, forward, and up gestures which feeds back with a soothing, glowing strip of light.Web OS is pretty nice though. I like the way multitasking works and it's fairly simple to use with little learning curve. If you want to search for an installed app, search the web, or search for an address or business, just start typing and a card will appear which lets you choose Google, Google Maps, Wikipedia or Twitter. Adding custom ringtones and wallpapers is refreshingly easy; Similar to Android devices, you can plug the phone in, choose \"USB Storage\" and just drag your wallpaper images into the \"Wallpapers\" folder, and ringtones and notification sounds into the \"Ringtones\" folder.Overall, the phone looks cute and fits nicely in the pocket. The soft back cover is nice (I prefer soft touch to glossy plastic or even glass). It's a functional device that will provide you with entertainment, information and communication on the go. There is an app store and some widely used apps are available (Evernote, Pandora, Accuweather, a Twitter app, Facebook, Angry Birds, etc). And even though pretty much every smartphone has it, the mobile hotspot functionality comes in handy (if you pay for it).Despite it's crappy 2MP camera, fixed 8GB of storage (that's right, no MicroSD card slot) tiny, low quality screen (but at least it's glass and capacitive) and tiny keys, it's worth buying since it's only $40 off-contract here on Amazon. If HP didn't give up on WebOS and Palm devices, it would probably cost at least $250. So, it's not a bad deal. The only reason I bought it was for the price. I sold my iPhone 4 months ago and have been using a basic cell phone. I missed having an mp3 player, map, camera, casual game player and web browser on me. I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another year, I can't spend $500+ on a new phone at full retail, and I'm sick of sketchy Craigslist sales and used phones with scratched displays, caked up skin flakes and dirt in the crevices, and lingering cologne/perfume odors. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with WebOS. But the OS and the device itself are lacking - A LOT - and if there was a faster, better WebOS phone available for a typical smartphone retail price, I wouldn't buy it.Most people replace their smartphones within a year or two, so the fact that HP gave up on WebOS isn't that big of a deal. Just don't expect a ton of updates and support. The phone has 3-4 year old hardware anyway. If you're in a similar situation as I am (i.e., too poor to buy a new phone off contract, but not too poor to pay your share of a family account) or want a pre-paid phone, it's not a bad purchase. I could also see this being useful for someone who has an expensive smartphone but wants a second device when there may be a risk of losing or damaging their good phone.Too bad I couldn't get a Touchpad when the liquidation happened. That would have been nice. It's cool how they transfer links and other data. I ordered one from OnSale through Amazon. They took way more orders than they could fill and cancelled a ton of them after holding everyone's money for a few days.

I purchased this as a backup to my Droid X, which needed to be shipped in to my warranty provider to fix some issues. Initially, I was thinking I had made a mistake and wasted my money on this backup because it was extremely slow, has an extremely small screen, and a keyboard that is made for 13 year olds (aka people with really small fingers).However, after running the updater and settling into how webOS operates, it really isn't that bad of a phone and the keyboard/screen take some getting used to, but don't expect this to come even close to the experience provided by Android, iOS, or Windows phone (there's a reason Palm went under).Phone/Call Quality - 2/5 - I like the form factor as it really fits nice in the hand & pocket, but it weighs virtually nothing and has a terrible audio speaker (literally the worst I have ever heard on a cell phone from the past decade). Additionally, the \"Silencer/Vibrate\" button constantly slips down so basically I'll never be able to hear a ringtone or noise from it which is pretty annoying.webOS - 3/5 - for a virtually dead OS (it's open sourced), it runs decently and has some interesting ways of handling apps / gestures. However, I didn't realize this phone didn't get the webOS 2.0 update; therefore, it's two years old and less face it, outdated when compared to the current competitors. It still blows away any \"feature/gimmick\" phone that the major carriers offer and that alone makes it worth purchasing.Apps - 1/5 - Application support is minimal so don't expect to do much other than surf the web, check your Gmail, and maybe use a really cool Twitter app - that's all I've found literally. Google Maps has been replaced by HP/Bing and it's absolutely terrible, and all social networking apps outside of Twitter are terrible.Backup Potential - 5/5 - It's cheap, a smartphone with data connectivity, and some okay apps.Hey, for under $50 bucks, I can survive with this for a month or so and use it in case my primary phone breaks.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warning: Requires Data Package", "Author": "Texaport", "ReviewID": "RMTUQ0FLDGCGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TO THOSE LOOKING TO REPLACE THEIR FEATURE PHONE: DATA PLAN IS REQUIRED.I purchased the Palm Pixi Plus as a replacement Verizon phone for a younger sibling.

To make a long explanation simple, it's a mini-computer.  Wonderful upgrade from my last phone but............The activation process was a nightmare.  The Page Plus customer services reps were rude, semi-hostile and unable to spell my billing address or able to interpret what I was saying.  And yes, they spoke English and so did I. It's ridiculous how many times I had to repeat myself, and slowly read out serial numbers, phone numbers, credit card numbers and addresses.  Last I checked, customer service reps were not supposed to address customers with bad attitudes.  I had to call them like three times after doing like 100 other things to figure out how to complete the aggravating activation phase.  Anyway, I guess you can't win both.  A great phone with great service is just too much to ask I guess.  The price is out of this world for a device like this, but I guess bad service is a part of that price.***UPDATE***After two months of using this product and service, I can say that the phone is great but the service is garbage.  I hate Page Plus.  Every time I want to add text or talk time, there's some kind of issue that requires me to contact them by phone to resolve.  I'm honestly thinking about going back to my crappy old flip phone, or seeing if Verizon will offer a prepay service for this phone.  Everything was clear and crisp with Verizon prepay service, because you would get exactly what you pay for.  This is not the case with Page Plus service.  They are very questionable, and you never know what to expect when you pay for their service.  I'm tired of these issues.  They will not let your additional minutes or text time roll over after expiration, they will not let you add on to your current plan and to have to deal with them so frequently is just unneeded stress.  One way or another, I will go back to Verizon even if I do have to pay extra for the data plan.  At least I'll know what I'm getting for my money with Verizon.

WebOS is a wonderful, open platform, and the way the card system works is pretty intuitive. The notifications system was way ahead of its time, and I miss the gestures whenever I'm using someone else's non-WebOS phone. The gesture area has a cool glowing slit whenever new notifications appear on your phone. The keyboard is nice and clicky, though I often end up using my finger nails to operate it (and I'm a guy). The available Touchstone cover and puck make a great charging station; why don't all phones do this? (probably some patent devilry) It doesn't have all the apps that iOS and Android users have available to them, but WebOS has a great open-source community with a non-official app store through \"Preware.\" It's definitely a tinkerer's phone.The Bad: Google Maps seems not to work at all when on a 3G connection. I don't know why, but it's frustrating as hell when trying to find something on the go. I wish the home screen had all my apps on it rather than having to \"Swipe up\" to get the app screen. Worst of all, the hardware in this phone is just too underpowered to deliver a smooth experience in the OS. Why should the phone choke when trying to switch from the Texting card to the Mail card? I've never had a \"too many cards\" warning, yet it seems like it can barely keep up with some basic functions. That's not to say it's unusable, just frustrating. Overclocking the processor has not seemed to help any. The camera is nothing to write home about, although it's usable enough to share mobile pictures.Overall, I'll stick with my plan to go on Page Plus with this phone, but I'll still be keeping my eyes peeled for a cheap Android or WebOS device with some more \"oomph\" to it.

I have been pleased with this phone since I received it. It was a perfect beginning choice as a smart phone user. The phone is small, but after a months use I was able to get used to the size. The screen is very sensitive to your touch. even with a screen protector on it. The mutli touch was a great little add on to the Pixi, it made games a little more interesting on it.Now of course, there are always a few cons with a phone. To least my major ones, the phone has an issue if you try to do way to much stuff at once. For instance, if you have a window open for a game, then one for facebook, and another for texting. Your going to get lag SOMEWHERE, that or your phone will not let you open any more cards. With that issue I have found that exiting at least one card, and then waiting a moment the phone will then be back to normal.The only other issue I have had was with the phones service. For me, I keep my phone on all day and all night.

Definitely a great deal. Cute little phone for 55 dollars! The keyboard is small yes but the way it's set up, I find it very easy to use and hardly ever fat finger a typo. It's pretty easy to navigate and while the screen is small, it looks nice and the only time I have an issue is with viewing websites. But I really only wanted it for texting and talking anyway which it does well. The processor makes it relatively sluggish and lock up at times but my main complaint is that when I get a notification (eg an incoming text or reminder that pops up on the screen), the person I'm talking to flickers and cuts out for a little while and MY GOD, I can hear myself and whatever noises are on my side through the earpiece. Wind and traffic easily drown out the caller where my older phones didn't have that problem. Basically hearing myself and bg noises in real-time echo. Luckily using a bluetooth headset fixes the noise leak problem since you're not using the pixi's phone hardware so I will deal for now. This is why I knock it down to 3 stars. Talking on my phone is the most important thing to me and it should work well without the need to buy a headset. This phone doesn't and I've found other people on google search who've had the same issue. Otherwise, I love the keyboard, I love the size and how it fits in my hand, love the look, love the price, love the OS, and the many customizations for the OS.

It's honestly one of the worst phones I've ever used.  Not even in the same class as the iPhone, or even Android phones.The good:- It's small, really small- Feels good in your hand- WebOS has a nice way of letting you know when you have new events (e.g. new email, calendar, facebook)- WebOS's user interaction is pretty nice in terms of managing cards/apps- Email client goes back to message list when you delete a message instead of going to the next messageThe bad:- Screen is too small, keyboard is cramped.  Often end up hitting buttons I didn't intend to hit.  When notifications come up, it takes up half the screen if you have more than one.- Calendar app doesn't let you scroll around so text is often cut off for location and other details.- Battery life is terrible.  Often does not last a full day if you use it for anything at all- IMAP email does not update on the server right away like iPhone does, so sometimes I get home and the email I deleted is still there- Not a lot of quality apps, or any that would be worth spending money on at allThe ugly:- So slow that sometimes when dialing numbers, the digits don't show up until a second or two after you press the number- Interface freezes frequently- Often runs out of memory and you get the \"too many cards\" error, especially when you have the browser open.- Sometimes even when you quit all cards you get the out of memory problem, and have to restart- Rebooting takes forever, like 10 minutes, which is a problem when...- The phone reboots randomly (Verizon says may be due to a loose back cover, but I had never taken off the cover before!)- The case starts peeling away at the edges, looks like the rubber loses its shape and starts expanding in certain spots.  This is my second Pixi so this is not an isolated thing, it happened with both Pixis!There are many more issues with this phone but this is what comes to mind right now.  Compared to an iPhone, this phone is downright embarrassing.  Nothing to do even with how WebOS looks or works, it's just an overall terrible user experience.  And the worst part: all the things that make it unreliable as a basic phone (battery life, freezing, random rebooting), and the case peeling away distracts greatly from the otherwise nice aesthetics.I really wanted to like this phone, but can't recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent deal for a no contract phone", "Author": "mgk71", "ReviewID": "R1H3UY9MG6Y462", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my wife to replace her aging Palm Centro.

The built in Wi-Fi is a very nice feature to have on a phone of this price.One word of caution, however.  My wife has used palm products for many years and she LOVES, LOVES the old Palm calendar.  The WebOS calendar on the Pixi is quite different and is missing some of the features she really liked, such as color-coded events.  If you are a fan of the older Palm phones and PDAs, you might be slightly disappointed with some of the changes to the calendar.

For that purpose, it works fine. I followed another reviewer's tips on getting it set up on their network (setup tips through Kittywireless I think), and it was pretty straightforward.Physically, the phone is very good.  It feels nice in the hand and the buttons are good.  They feel a little rubbery and although give good tactile response, they do feel a little light or cheap.  I could believe another reviewer's response that their buttons failed after extreme amounts of texting.  I only send a few hundred a month so I am not too worried.  I feel as though the touchscreen is exceptional, offering adequate resolution with excellent touch feedback compared to many of the other cheap phones that I have tried with touch screens.  Its no Iphone or Android phone, but for what it is it excels.  The case of the phone is rubberized so it doesn't slip around too easily, which is nice.  The charge/USB connection is a little tricky to access, but its no dealbreaker.  There is supposed to be a single switch on the outside of the case to be used to silence the ringer without going through menu's, but on my phone it seems to get temperamental sometimes, switching between the two modes unless we really set the switch to either side in an assertive way.The software and interface take a little bit of getting used to but after a few days it feels really nice, intuitive and easy to use.  The wifi option makes it quick and easy to access apps.  Speaking of apps, some of the apps that are preloaded on the phone won't work because they require internet access, but upon accessing the internet they say the version is no longer supported.  Looking through the apps catalog yields a few thousand apps (a far cry from the hundreds of thousands or even millions available for Android or iOS).  Many of them seem worth while, but the reviews are all generally poor because most people complain that they wont install  I researched it for a little while, and found out how to get around this common problem.  There is an app in the catalog with a name like \"app store update\" or something to that effect, published by Palm.  This app is the key to getting any other apps to work, download, or update.  To get this app update to work, however, you need to go through the phone clock settings and turn off network time, turn off network time-zone, set the time manually to June 1 2013, then turn the phone to airplane mode and back to regular mode for the time to set.  After that, download the app update, install, and after it installs properly, go through the time set procedure and turn the network time and timezone back on.  After that, all the apps in the appstore seem to install normally.Overall a nice enough phone, good voice quality, nice interface, cheap, and works on Page Plus [CDMA/Verizon] network.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broken phone", "Author": "Shia", "ReviewID": "R1Z9RSW23KST6R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone on amazon. because i was looking for a page plus phone i tried to activate it i wasn't able to do that they sand me to authorized dealer he told me that the phone is a broken phone he said that he had this experience with others. so be smart before you buy this phone from this seller.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for Page Plus if it works", "Author": "GoodMom", "ReviewID": "R109SDDCM5T5O3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered two, one works fine, one doesn't.

The palm pixi plus is definitely a good solution.  I now have two of these and use prepaid service with Page Plus Cellular.  I will say that there is a steep learning curve.  I am new to palms and smartphones.  I had intended to just get a phone that would work for voice and text and would handle my calendar and contacts.  I was immediately swept into the many smartphone features offered with this device.  Hurtles that I surmounted with perseverance included: activation with page plus by calling their customer service rather than doing it all online; getting used to the sensitive touchscreen; thoroughly reading the online manual for the palm pixi plus; putting the phone on wifi and airplane mode while at home to reduce data costs; getting a touchstone and touchstone back cover for charging; and management of the USB connection.Know that this phone is extremely sensitive to any transmissions while plugged into a USB cable.  My phone would go bananas with the touchscreen looking like a carbonated beverage when I tried to plug it into a USB connection.  The work around is to eliminate transmissions as best you can when you want to plug in your palm.  I moved the wireless house phone handset away from the pc, turned off wifi and bluetooth connections at my pc, and turned off the wireless printer.  Then to use the USB connection, begin by turning off all connections on phone and putting it into airplane mode, plug small end of cable first then plug large end of cable into the pc while holding down three buttons on the palm: the white square, Sym, and \"u.\"  This will get you into USB mode on the palm so that you can transfer any files that you might desire.  To charge with the USB charger follow the same connection steps without pressing the buttons on the phone and find a quiet outlet.  If your screen starts showing \"touches\" everywhere, try another outlet.  It's trial and error but patience will prevail.  Charging in the car or on the touchstone eliminates this hassle.I know it sounds like a lot of trouble but I hope that it won't be for you because now that I know these things, I love the phone and am very happy that I didn't throw it in the backyard while I was trying to figure all of this out!", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "hollyrenae", "ReviewID": "R4HCIRZS3RPBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my brother and he really likes it.

Text is easy to read and colors are vibrant.-Keys on the keyboard are very easy to use, and are spaced relatively far apart.-Excellent 3G signal strength (Verizon Network).-Phone is very easy to navigate around, and changing from one app to another is very simple.-Handles multi-tasking very well.-Plenty of internal memory.-Camera is average, takes fairly decent pictures.-Very lightweight and virtually unnoticeable in pocket.-Internet browser is very fast, and loads virtually every page correctly.-Effortless set-up of E-mail accounts; E-mail platform is very reliable.-Phone has fast software and everything opens and loads very quickly.-Very responsive.-Gesture area is very convenient and works with no problems.-Convenient vibrate only switch-Comes with very useful software such as a PDF Viewer and Document viewer which allows opening of Microsoft word attachments from E-mail's.Cons:-Smaller screen than an iPhone (not really a big deal as clarity is impeccable).-Takes a long time to power on and re-start.-No SD Card slot.-No Auto Correct while text messaging-App Catalogue is somewhat lacking when compared to Apple or Android.-Battery Cover is hard to remove.Overall I highly recommend this phone. As you can see, the Pro's outweigh the Con's. The battery cover may be hard to remove, but it is actually very handy because the battery cover covers the back and sides of the phone, which eliminates the need for a phone case because battery covers are only around 5$ on Amazon. The phone comes with mainly useful software, eliminating the need to delete a ton of unnecessary App's upon purchase. Another cool feature for this phone is that you can order (for a total of around $10.00 on Amazon)a special battery cover and charging dock, both made by touchstone that offer truly wireless charging. You simply remove your current battery cover, place on the new one, plug in the dock, and set your phone on it to charge. Changing from one App to another is a snap, and closing app's to save battery life is also very easy. Simply flick the app upwards and it \"flies\" off the screen and instantly closes the app.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good (albeit discontinued) smartphone", "Author": "Lou V.", "ReviewID": "R1LJ3Q81W6VDPA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Oakland Wireless answered my pre-purchase questions VERY quickly, reassuring me the phone could be activated on PagePlus.

I wanted something a little simpler, but not too simple like a basic phone.Count me as another \"new, accidental\" user who previously gave little thought to WebOS, now a little disappointed that it's barely hanging on. I only picked up the Pixi+ because of my situation, and I thought it would just be neat to try something different for the time being. Wow, it has a neat and intuitive interface. While the phone obviously can't do what the DroidX does by way of features and apps, I really like the card-and-swipe UI (disclaimer: the Homebrew patches help to make it much better).I really like the launcher and icons (better than what I've seen on the iPhone). And I finally realize that I need a \"real\" keyboard. I had to correct almost every individual word on the touch-screen keyboard of my Android, which was probably the most frustrating thing of all for me (I realize some Android phones have keyboards). And I did try other keyboard apps.I never would have gotten the Pixi had my phone not broken because it looks a little cheap and ugly (to me) in the pictures. But now that I have it, the keyboard and form factor are great, other than maybe the smallish screen.There are a few things I can't get to work as I'd like. The AIM simply won't log in (it's probably outdated). The music skips a little too frequently due to the slow processor (even overclocked). And I can't get Navi to work for me. You're not going to get Google Sky Maps on here. But for the basics, some things are better than what I had on the DroidX (IMO). The email works way better (even Gmail). the notifications banners are really nice. I like the browser experience simply because of the swipe and bookmark list -- it's just easy. The calendar is nicer and works better. List/note apps and other things are more convenient. Everything is \"right there\" with no complications swiping apps open, closed, and between several running apps at once. YouMail is better. Deleting things like email, vmail messages, bookmarks, etc is all swipe-easy. Even my Gmail contacts seem to link better. With the Homebrew patches, this thing holds its own even on an old OS / phone. So even with an older phone and less features, I find that I really like it better overall.Lastly, the Pixi+ transitions seamlessly between Wifi and 3G. I've had no issues so far (after several weeks) unlike with my Android phone.It's too bad WebOS wasn't bought by a company that could support it, or at least incorporate it into its current ecosystem.

Tsiang", "ReviewID": "R2B0EB6UTK40XA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After considering for quite sometime on purchasing my first smartphone, I ended up choosing the Palm Pixi Plus because of three main reasons, size and physical keyboard and the operating system. I spent many months researching the wide variety of phones available since this would be my first smartphone. Initially, I looked at the iPhone and looked at my friend's iPhone. Though it is easy to use accompanied with many Apps, I didn't like the feel of the phone itself as it was a tad too heavy. I also wasn't particularly fond of the virtual keyboard. Though my fingers are small, I still had some difficulty using the virtual keyboard on the iPod Touch. Next I looked into the phones with Android OS and the phones didn't appeal to my taste either as many of the phones were quite bulky. I was't fond of the Android OS after playing with it for a while. Lastly I looked at Palm's line of Pixi and Pre. What attracted me to the Pixi Plus is the physical keyboard which makes typing much easier. The phone itself is small and light with rounded bottom edges which makes it comfortable to hold. After playing with one of my co-worker's Pixi Plus I was drawn to the uniqueness of the WebOS design. There isn't a lot of icons littering the screen as they can be tucked away. However, with the Pixi Plus, the main draw back is the 1.4.5 version of the operating system. It is not as refined as the WebOS 2.0. So there are some bugs which hasn't worked out yet in this older OS version. However, you can install many patches created by other users. Another drawback is the battery life as other users have commented and complained about. If you make calls frequently daily and use data, you need to charge this phone daily. This is something I am not used to do as my previous clamshell phone can hold a charge for days. Finally, another uniqueness of this phone is you can purchase the wireless Touchstone charging system allowing you to do wireless charging. So overall in my book, though this phone isn't perfect, it is quite adequate for my needs as a first smartphone.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "i like this phone", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R1MBKK8MJE0OAU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Someday I browsed CellPhone category on Amazon, trying to find something new and interesting, I came across Pixi Plus no contract and unlocked phone, I am surprised with the price as listed, darely not believe it.

I must say that for a cheap little device it's pretty useful and well worth the price.Yes the OS seems clunky and the processor is slow, kinda like you took Windows ME running on a Pentium II and shrank it down to the size of a feature phone. But for ~$50 what's the problem? I bought a dell with Win ME in 1999 for over $2,000 (w/o monitor)- that was a true crime. Still, it's like Palm took a 3G wifi modem and mp3 player and they had a love child, then taught it how to make phone calls, take memos, and do some other stuff in its free timePros: easy to learn and use, lot of functionality, wifi hotspot, and accessories are currently at clearance prices. keyboard is small but tactile material makes it surprisingly easy to type even with large fingers. good for 1-handed typing. acts as USB drive when plugged in, no BS sync program neededCons: slow, tiny keyboard(but see above), can freeze up easily, web OS 1.4.5 is quirky, webOS 2.0 not supported on this phone. NO MICRO SD SLOT!!!so why buy this phone? let's crunch some numbers:- if you use a mobile hotspot or tethering: 1. you can buy a 3G hotspot for $50 from Verizon and pay $60 per MONTH in data fees, or 2. buy another phone and pay $20/mo for 2GB/month hotspot(on top of data plan), OR 3. buy this phone and pay ZERO for I believe 5GB/mo mobile hotspot. This was a special deal Palm made with Verizon to get this thing off the shelves; essentially if you buy for $50 it pays for itself within 3 months, and a 3G hotspot modem costs $50 anyway. I hope this benefit remains for the life of the phone, but I have no clue- you can get a simple subscription from PagePlus, so for $10 per 4 months ($30/yr) you can use this phone for emergencies or a good, cheap travel phone that you won't really mind losing, breaking, or getting stolen. Only a moron would steal this phone anyway. I don't know if the hotspot feature is available unless you get the data plan from PagePlus, anyone know about this? PagePlus with $30/mo data plan not bad- buy phone for $50, extra batteries $4ea, I found the touchstone back for $3, touchstone dock is ~$15. you get a 8GB mp3 player, phone, free 3G mobile hotspot, 'nuff said.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not cracked up to be what it seems", "Author": "QueenB", "ReviewID": "RESMVGLX54ZUP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, I disliked the fact that the phone powered off by itself on the first night of me having the phone.

I was able to download apps, play games, synch my emails from Google and Outlook, as well as my calendars all onto one view. The internet is very quick, and it has WIFI!! Of course with Verizon, a data plan is required and they only offered one plan on my Family Plan, so it costs an extra $29.99 for me for unlimited data.This also comes with a mobile hotspot that you can connect up to 5 devices with, but I thought Verizon charged an extra $40 to activate the hotspot on top of your $30 data plan, plus it only goes up to 5 GB, and it counts all the data usage from any device connected to it. BUT, after speaking to the Verizon rep, for THIS PHONE ONLY, the 3G mobile hotspot is FREE up to 5GB.

However, since the most prominent review here specifically recommends connecting this phone thru Kitty Wireless, I feel compelled to warn everybody to watch out for their \"honest and upright\" pretense and seeming dedication to customer service.That's because, as soon as they get your credit card number, that niceness comes to a halt.  That is what happened to me and it has now cost me $55 and a whole day waiting in vain for them to start my service.For two days they were indeed very, very helpful.  They explained my phone, responded rapidly to every email inquiry and (tellingly) walked me thru a very long \"application\" process which demanded not just a lot of extra, personal information, but required me to fine tune my bank debit card records to satisfy their secret formula for \"preventing fraud\".  If you check their website, you'll see they spend quite some time on their high horse about their commitment to honesty and preventing fraud.  And they are ever so helpful...At one point I got busy and didn't get back to the application for part of a day, so they sent me an e-mail reminding me I was nearly done, even providing a link to take me directly to the step where I had left off.  I was quite impressed.  When I had completed everything, their rapid, efficient system processed my card in less than one second, took my money, issued me a receipt ... and that was the last I heard from them.  I waited all day for the phone to be turned on or to hear something from the company.It was not until I'd sent 3 emails, at 11 o'clock at night, hours after they closed and even longer since they promised to activate my phone that I got a boilerplate response from Kitty Wireless informing me that they had cancelled my order because something in my *application* seemed suspicious.  They would refund my money, but it would be 4-5 business days or longer and no guarantees.  This wasn't their fault, it said, but didn't say whose fault it was or what I could do about it.And that was that.  If I had any questions, tough, don't waste your time asking questions, the email said, as it is Kitty Wireless policy not to discuss these decisions AT ALL with anyone, especially not with anyone who triggered their fraud suspicions.  If and when you ever get your money back you are welcome to spend it elsewhere.God knows what they are really up to, but they couldn't be more wrong in my case.  I did send them an email asking them to clarify how long the wait would be for my refund and  I got an amazingly rude reply that was definitely not machine-generated.  I'll give them this, even when they're abusing you, they do it with a personal touch -- unless they're ignoring you after they've got your money.There you go.  This really happened to me.  I don't know why they accepted my money if there was something wrong with my application anymore than I know why they require such an intrusive \"application\" or why it supposedly takes them a week to give a refund that Page Plus and the credit card company will provide in a few minutes.

Here is what happened so far:Received phone in new condition after 72 hours from OEM Shop.My intended use: $30/yr emergency usage plan. ($10/120 day pin x 3)Activation of phone for free from PagePlus went smoothly. Purchased $10 PIN.Enabled wifi by clicking in upper right corner of phone app and clicking appropriate choice.Immediately turned off data connection by clicking Verizon in upper left corner of phone card and clicking preference (data off) immediately after activation.Was HORRIFIED when I got message saying my $10 credit was exhausted within a half hour of activating my advice, though I had not placed any calls or texts or downloaded content while on 3G.Called PagePlus to try to get them to reapply my $10 credit.They refused claiming that Palm Pixie is unauthorized and unsupported device.Requested to speak with supervisor and told I had to request a service ticket to do so and then a manager would call back within 24 hrs.After 22 hours with no callback, I called customer service and was connected with a friendly but ignorant customer service supervisor who informed me that she encounters this problem very frequently with Palm Pixie and that it will download data even with data is disabled.I questioned her intently about this (since it made no sense to me) and she repeated that even with wifi many of the apps in the phone, such as weather, will somehow use 3G data even when data is disabled. She said it is like a little computer and needs data.She suggested that if I wanted to use Palm Pixie I had better disable all Apps that came with the phone. Otherwise, her recommendation was to buy a standard supported cell phone (not smartphone) through PagePlus.I thanked her and planned to return Pixie to OEM Shop.Decided to call Palm support at 1-866-770-PALM to corroborate/verify Page Plus' information before returning device.After asking for details of my phone including serial number and phone number, Palm listened to what happened and what I was told by PagePlus.Palm emphatically and categorically denied that with data disabled the phone or any of its apps would still consume 3G data.As I had two conflicting opinions, I next called Kitty Wireless. Spoke with very polite and knowledgeable rep (Caleb) who confirmed what Palm told me and suggested that probably what had happened is that as soon as activation was complete and PIN was loaded, phone updated its system software and this used the $10 PIN I had purchased.Caleb assured me this is a very common problem and that it should not reoccur now that data is disabled and wifi is set-up.Said that he has heard of Android phones sometimes consuming data while in data disabled mode, but never with Palm Pixie.Suggested buying another $10 PIN, instead of more expensive PIN, just as a precaution.Asked him what is the main difference between Kitty Wireless and PagePlus.Caleb told me that Kitty is an authorized dealer of PagePlus and that biggest difference is the service.Kitty Wireless only has two employees, Kitty and Caleb, so customers get knowledgeable personal service.I thanked him and placed the order online for $10 PIN with auto refilling from Kitty Wireless.Assuming all goes well, I will not update this review. If it does not, and I continue to have problems of spurious data download while in data disabled mode, I will edit this review if possible, or find a way of entering a new one.****EDIT**** RATING REVISED TO 4 STARSReceived very helpful e-mail from Kitty at Kitty Wireless suggesting further measures to make 100% sure that phone does not consume data that I have not requested:\"If you know, for a fact, that you will NOT be using data on your device - CALL 800-550-2436 and say this: \"I would like for you to disable the web data and the picture messaging features on my standard plan phone so that I do not mistakenly use my cash balance for data.\" Give them your cellular number, and have them disable your data & picture messaging services.

Contact integration and auto-updating. If any of my LinkedIn or Facebook contacts changes their information, this phone's address book will be updated automatically.  If I edit a contact on the phone or in my GMail address book, the change appears in the other place and vice versa.  Same with my appointments, synchronized with Google Calendar.2. Not having to buy a data plan. Over the past year, I've bought this phone twice and used the Page Plus Cellular $80 refills to get $0.04 minute and SMS rates with the Verizon network, and all in, it has been $400 (including equipment, activation, and airtime). If the equipment holds up, I'm looking at about $300 next year.  I don't use mobile data or roaming.3. Battery life without a data plan is excellent. I have the Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Prefs -> menu -> Sleep Settings) turn off when the phone is sleeping (locked), and I can go almost a week without charging if I'm not reading too much e-mail on the device.4. Case can survive minor splashes.5. I can listen to streaming NPR.Things I find frustrating:Slow performance opening e-mail: it takes 7-10 seconds to open the list of messages, and 3-5 seconds more to display the body of very simple messages.  When checking e-mail, it downloads all headers and then all bodies, consuming more data (and time) than an Android GMail app, which only downloads bodies on an as-needed or background basis.  If you try to delete e-mail while messages are coming in, you can sometimes delete the wrong message.  If you delete a message whose headers but not body have been received, the message will appear again after the body is received.Slow graphics transitions: when I answer the phone, it takes at least 3 seconds before I can see the buttons to put the call on speakerphone or mute.  Sometimes, it's not clear that the speakerphone button has registered my tap, and I tap again. Contrast almost every Blackberry, with a dedicated key, allowing the switch to occur in a fraction of a second.Camera is extremely slow.  It can take as much as 10 seconds to open and show a gray image before the app is ready to let you take a picture.Web browser runs out of memory on moderately complex pages.Minor user interface problems: in typing a text message, the \"send\" button is at the end of the line. This makes it difficult to reposition the cursor there if you jump back to edit something and then want to resume at the end, because you could accidentally hit the send button.  (On the iPhone, the send button is away from the text. That couldn't be covered by a patent, could it?)When you set an alarm for a given time, if your phone has locked when the alarm rings, you need to unlock the phone in order to dismiss the alarm notification --- which can take a while if you have a security code.  Once you have snoozed an alarm, there is no way to cancel that.Palm profile backup/restore needs cellular data and does not work over Wi-Fi.When mobile data is enabled, the phone is particularly data-hungry: 300 MB in one night, for no apparent reason.Why I bought a second phone (both from UnlockedCellPhoneKings): the screen cracked once when I dropped the first. And then, I found the keyboard was completely useless!

After about one month, the audio no longer worked on my Palm Pixi Plus.  I contacted Palm/HP chat help and they diagnosed that it was a hardware issue with the device not detecting the toggling up and down of the right-side audio switch.  Palm/HP stated that the device was still under warranty so I could go through that process, but since it had been such a short time since purchase, I decided to return to Amazon.  I contacted Amazon on chat and this was no problem to return it for a full refund.  I did not see anywhere any contact information for this third-party seller (in comparison, I can find contact information with other third-party sellers just fine) so I believe they have chosen to have Amazon take care of all contact.  I purchased a second device to replace the defective one.  Once second device was received, I entered ##786# (as another reviewer suggested) on the phone and saw that it was indeed a new device.I use this Palm Pixi Plus with Page Plus, but I go through a master dealer called Kitty Wireless.

So far, I still have it with me. I finally figured out how to use it, and add prepaid minutes. I am not the kind of person who uses a wireless phone every day. I only talk about 30 min. a month on a wireless phone. That's because I am self employed, and live/work in a very rural area. So, if your not wireless phone educated like me, maybe I can help you figure out your phone.I bought prepaid minutes online with kittywireless.com. They provided a new phone number for my phone, and two dollars of free phone time to set up the phone account.Unfortunately, they will not sell me any prepaid minutes unless they can verify who I am, and talk to me on my land line first. Since I leave for work very early in the morning, and don't get home until past 5PM PST, and they are located in a different time zone, they have not called when I'm home, and I have not found time to call them.I found another prepaid minutes provider, mysupplyworld.com, and they have similar plans available.  I just purchase the pin, and then call pageplus cellular to apply it. Very cool.The most difficult problem I have encountered with the service plan so far, is that although the verizon emblem is on my phone screen, I actually have a pageplus account, not a verizon account.I had to call the verizon service number in an attempt to apply prepaid minutes to figure out what was going on. They said the phone number I have was not a verizon number, and they thought it was a straighttalk number, so they connected me with straighttalk. Then I found out it is not one of their numbers either. So duh, I checked the two prepaid minute providers I had been trying to set up my phone with, and realized they are both pageplus account providers.That's when I realized that I have a pageplus account and phone number. I told you I'm not wireless phone educated. But I'm figurin things out, just kinda slow, that's all.As for the phone, it is very cool. It has all the app. capabilities that all the new phones have, and takes pictures, downloads music, etc.My concern about wireless phones is that young people these days spend so much time staring at them. It's like an old comedy television episode I saw years ago. Everyone in America was glued to their TV, just staring at the screen, and a group of crooks went house to house stealing whatever they could get their hands on.Kind of ironic, considering we were all fleeced just a couple of years ago, while we all stared at our screens.Look out Twilight Zone, here we come!", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "poor product", "Author": "mcinco", "ReviewID": "R2UVKMZ05D4PV5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter ordered this for her birthday and it didn't work within a week.

I think it is more so for women than men because of its size so it is perfect for me. You may need to look at videos on YouTube to figure out how to use it if you are new to the Palm interface but once you figure it out it is easy to use and very convenient. This phone is NOT for power users -- stick with Blackberry or something like a Droid X or iPhone for this. This phone is not as fast and is great if you just need a great looking, easy to operate smartphone for light to intermediate use. This is mainly because of the processing speed. And I would strongly suggest that you get the charging docking station and the Touchstone back cover (to use with the charging station) because the wall charger compartment on the phone is made kind of funny and the plug comes out easily if you're like me and charge your phone up but still try to use it! Oh, the sound is GREAT -- I played a YT video on it and it sounded better than my husband's laptop speakers! And having owned an iPhone before, it easily tops their sound quality as well. All in all, great phone for a super cheap price -- all the booklets were included EXCEPT the manual (which you can find on the web anyway). You can use this phone with Page Plus Wireless too so my bill is only like $39.99 (or you can choose the $55 plan) and I still have the quality service that I would have with Verizon -- hooray for me --and hooray for you, too -- if go and buy this phone and use Page Plus -- double the savings!!!!UPDATE: 12.12.2012I have since purchased a new phone because I had android app withdrawal! Also, the back covers start coming apart pretty easily which means you would have to keep replacing them -- kind of annoying.

Very durable and well constructed, long battery life (like five times that of an android), small and really tuff, this phone is hard to beat.Unlike it's big brother, the Pre, the Pixi is small and easy to use.  While the buttons are small, they are well laid out, and they are REAL BUTTONS.You can modify it to do or look like almost anything you want with apps and mods available free online.And tough! I am very hard on phones.  One of my Pixi's survived the washer and dryer with the battery still in.  I think this will be my sixth phone.  Interfacing email and contacts with Google couldn't be easier, and while the CPU is no speed demon, WebOS is tons faster than Android so it still runs fast.On the con side, many mobile sites no longer support WebOS, and there is no Flash support.  Also there is no alternate browser for the unit out there so your stuck with what Palm developed four years ago.  Also there is no GPS software available, so although its built in, it does not work.

I'm still trying to learn all the features on it, but it's fairly simple to figure out. If anything goes wrong with it, I will update this review.

It even had the plastic around it to protect it when you first buy a new item. It included a manual, charger, battery and the phone of course. I was so surprised to get a brand new phone.This phone can get a little slow if you open to many applications but overall its a pretty nice phone. It's very slim and small, which I love. The keypad is smaller than regular phones, but you can get use to it very fast. I love the fact that it's a touch screen(which responds very well). The camera is okay- but it does include a flash, which is a huge plus. So far the battery life is pretty good. I am an intense texter myself and i rarely dies on me during the day. This phone does require a data package which start around 30 $ but that is expected since it is a smart phone.The one thing I don't like about this phone is the fact that you cannot personalize it like other phones may offer. You can't change the dial fonts, calling screen color(which is a green), and it does not include as many apps as the droid and iphone offers.Overall, this is a very nice phone for the price.

Two things that need getting used to: I use memo a lot. To move character by character you have to press and hold down the solid white button that is normally used for numbers and swipe right or left. That moves things character by character. The other is that name lookup in Contacts and for dialing doesn't work like the old Palm Treo did. The speed dial function helps a bunch for this. Just go to contact, select the one desired, open the menu and choose add to speed dial. Finally, a little getting used to for navigation mostly to touch from actual keys.

I quickly overcame the size of the keyboard and was able to tap out texts as fast as I can now on my Droid.  The touchscreen was very impressive and responsive, as was the gesture bar.  While holding in one hand.. every operation was very accessible with that one hand.  The only item that I feel has a learning curve is the Palm OS.  I have not had a Palm since the VII days, so it took me a day or two of thoroughly exploring and researching the features to get the hang of it.  The phone itself is VERY solid feeling, and satisfying to use and hold.I suggest you immediately turn on \"Developer Mode\" and install \"Preware\".  Google the instructions.... this allows you to customize darn near every aspect of the phone to your liking, including on screen information, and change system behaviors as well, including OVERCLOCKING the already 600 Mhz processor.  Thank you to HP for allowing this access to this device, if only every manufacturer would be so open to us controlling our own devices.The ONLY downfall... is if you compare the Palm app store to the beefier Android and Apple stores... there's not TOO much of a selection, but definitely enough to please the average user.  This utilizes .jar files for games and apps, so don't expect a whole lot of detailed 3D games to appear on it.EXCELLENT buy.. even at the price I paid, $48.

It is probably a good deal on Page Plus, which I may switch to. I bought this phone on the spur of the moment because I dropped and broke my old phone. I am thinking of keeping the Pixi for at least a few months, probably on Verizon, where I am currently off contract. I will then decide whether to buy a flashy new phone. On the other hand, I am still mulling over the idea of just switching to Page Plus. The bottom line is that if one is going to spring for a 30 dollar per month data plan with Verizon, at least for more than a few months, one should also shell out for a phone with all the latest bells and whistles and do the two year contract. But as a Page Plus phone, it is probably great. In the five days that I have had the phone so far, I have had minimal need to use the Verizon data features of the phone. The Pixi Plus is perfectly suitable using WiFi. Besides, many people are getting WiFi enabled tablets now, so what is the big deal about smart phones?Here is a follow up about two months later: The phone is ridiculous.

Unlocked Cell Phone Kings of Miami, FLA,finally said in December 2012 that they would replace my completely locked up phone with a refurbished phone.  It took a lot of conversation to get to this point of a refurb phone.  Initially they said they did not have any NEW phones although they were still advertising NEW phones on Amazon and I was able to put a new phone in my \"cart.\"  When questioned why they still showed new phones on Amazon they got very nasty and said they would not help me.  So I sent the phone back and it was returned later that week.  IT WAS MY SAME BROKEN PHONE.  UCPK said that I had sent in a different phone, that I had switched phones, that I did not send in the phone that was purchased from Amazon, that the phone had a different serial number that the one originally sent.  NOT TRUE.  I purchased 1 phone online and have the shipping statement and the box it was sent to me in.  UCPK refused to fix the phone or replace it as they had promised because they said I voided the warranty since I switched phones on them. I have the paper trail of where, when, and who ported my service from my previous phone to the Palm Pixi phone purchased from UCPK.  Obviously they required the serial number at time of porting service so there is a trail of evidence and I am not the one lying.  DO NOT BUY FROM UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS of MIAMI, FL.

After several unanswered emails thru Amazon to UK, I received a response from UK saying that my email would be \"processed\" soon. Unknown what \"process\" means. So until I get a response, I am without a phone which is not a great situation for a senior citizen living alone or anyone else!! The original purchase experience with UK was good. Phone arrived in a timely manner. Depending on how this is handled will determine if I purchase from UK again.

For the most part it doesn't bother me. I only notice it if the background on the screen is black, against light colors it is not noticeable.Pro: When I activated the Pixi on my Verizon account I noticed that I got the Wifi Hotspot free (up to 5GB). I chatted w/a VZW rep prior to purchasing this phone and they told me I would not get the free Wifi Hotspot if I activatd the Palm Pixi Plus, but I think because of the unlimited data I have, it made the difference.Con: The keyboard keys are very small. My small girly fingers still have trouble sometimes when doing a lot of typing. You can install a virual keyboard but the screen on this phone is so small that the vitual keyboad takes up half the screen, and doesn't leave much room to see what you are typing out.The apps available through Palm are lame. I miss all the apps I was able to get from the Android Market :(The battery life is ok. If I use my phone to listen to a lot of music or if I use the Wifi Hotspot, I notice it drains the battery. I have to charge it by 5pm if I've been using it throught out the day. If I use it only for a few calls and a lot of messaging, then I can get by the whole day and only have to charge it at night before I go to bed.Overall this is an ok phone.

I basically didnt want to activate it on verizon because their prices are to high. I took it to a revol store and unfortunately they couldn't do it either. then i took it to comstation and they took my phone for 3 days and when i came back it was ready. they had to flash my phone ( take verzon info out) and then they activated it to my revol acount.the phone is very easy to use and if you get this phone make sure you have internet on it or you will not be able to enjoy most of the features this phones provides. it is great for a first smartphone but is not the best smartphone out these days i would recommend this to othersTIPS:touchstone charger is a good choice because the charger plug is hard to take out of the phone.case for your phone is also good because the phone is very thin a silicone case suggestedthankyou and hope this comment was helpful in any way", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!", "Author": "palmpixilover", "ReviewID": "RDOWC1MZO4FAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is so amazing!

I have never encounter such rude sellers either. I returned a phone because it was not what I needed and asked for a refund. I was certain that everything was in the box because I had only open it for ten minutes and realized my mistake. So I put everything back in and sent it off to wherever it came from. I received an response a few days later, saying that there was no battery cord. I sent them a polite message insisting that I did not have the charger and distinctly remember putting everything back in. The distributor sent me back a rude short message about returning the missing item or I would have to pay some fee. I wrote them back to tell them to keep the phone and bother me no more. I could already tell by the way the seller wrote his or her message that he or she was going to be a pain in the ass to deal with. You can always tell how people are by their writing. His or her style of writing screams: \"I am a douchebag and I will be a pain in the ass to you.\" I do associate with such people, so I decided to end the contact with the sellers even if it meant losing some money. I think customer service should be top priority when you are selling products. Sellers shouldn't send them back sarcastic and condescending response, it rude and unprofessional to treat your customers like they are kids or beneath. Perhaps they should teach their sellers some manner and how to deal with customer complaints with more tact. I will not be purchasing  anything from these distributor again.

So I was constantly having to ask people, \"who is this?\" and feeling dumb.6) Apps are so slow I don't even bother.

Bluetooth feature ONLY support pair with COMPATIBLE headset.[...]3.) the compatible headset list is very short.  my Kensington headset does not work, so are some of my newer motorola headset.  WTH.I guess, Windows Mobile's compatibility still better than webOS .BT transfer is such an useful tool, how can they let this feature slip away?  Also, I confirmed that with Palm tech support.  It is true for the Palm Pre 2 also!!Update: Ok. I also found out that you cannot delete downloaded or transfer file on the device itself.  You have to use USB cable to connect to computer, THEN delete the file!  There is no \"window explorer\" or anything similar to go the the proper file directory to delete the file.  WTH!?!!!  even BB and Windows mobile 5 and 6 can do it back in 2007.  Can Palm do any better?Update #2: Somehow my hotspot didn't work anymore.  The only thing that I hadn't done is hard-resting.  On the Backup menu, it stated that \"Your data is backup automatically every day.\"  So, I took it that it really does that.  However, I am SO wrong about it.  It is NOT.  I hard reset per VZ representative instructed.  Yes, I got the hotspot working again.  However, the data is not backed up!!  I am talking just the contact info, not even the memo and txt.

I am a very light phone and internet user, may be only get online for 15-30 min, and talk 30-45 min per day.  The battery will last only 8-12 hours, sometimes even less.

The message \"too many cards have been open\" become more frequent.  I have to do restart the phone every time.  Another thing is that I think the is a \"bug\" when receiving CJK txt messages.  First, the phone doesn't support CJK (Chinese Japanes Korean) language on TXT meg.  However, view CJK web site has no problem.

I only have surfed on the internet when I have connected to a wifi at home, library, etc. However, Page Plus has kept charged me for data usage although I connected to wifi before surfing internet. I contacted Page Plus's supervisor yesterday and she said Page Plus charged me the data usage as my Palm Pixi updated itself and nothing was charged when I connected to wifi to surf. After she said that I double checked my phone record and the time and dates that Page plus charged me were the time and dates I connected to wifi to surf. Therefore, her statement was not true. Thus, please review my account and refund what Page Plus charged me for data usage, which I connected to wifi to for data usage and I didn't use Page Plus's service for any data usage. Also, I gave the supervisor an example of my son's Palm Pixi. I have not added any wireless providers to his phone and he has used it to surf on the internet as much as he wants when he connects to a wifi.
