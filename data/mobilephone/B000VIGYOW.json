I did not find that it drained the battery too quick, ive never had to replace the battery all of this time. Its durable too, i take it to work with me and I am a builder so you can imagine the abuse it takes.  I didnt give it a 5 star raiting because I want to give Moto the insentive to make their phones even better. I like basic phones without cameras this is a practical phone for economic non advanced uses. best of luck to you all.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Motorola V188", "Author": "William Edwin Palmer", "ReviewID": "RGNBNCS7QLBVY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a nice inexpensive phone that the church mouse would love.
