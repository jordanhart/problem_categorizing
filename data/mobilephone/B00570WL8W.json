{"Reviews": [{"Title": "3 years on the market and still faulty", "Author": "Mother Teresa", "ReviewID": "R37ULKQ1C0C1KC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is really anazing that this item has not been withdrawn from sale long ago, but then again at least it doesn't set fire to your office....Bought this scamphone in the UK and what I first thought to be a minor problem turned into my worst nightmare, with both Honeywell and the seller trying to avoid taking respnsibility.It all started off when I noticed that the product kept changing timezones on it's own accord, insisting that we are in 'WCentral Africa'. I also noticed that the scamphone would switch itself off at random but put that initially down to me probably pushing a button accidentally...I never dreamed that a product that's on the market for 3 years could be so unfit for use!Anyways, after an initial request for help was ignored by the seller I mailed Honeywell, who tried to help. Initially without any success, the engineer did after some six weeks a one hour remote session on the product, and I need to give him credit for sorting out the timezone problem. Ever since the remote session the phone has finally accepted that we are in London, UK, and has stopped sabotaging my appointments by switching time and timezones, making me think it was an hour earlier.The joy about this improvement did not last long: The phone did now switch itself off even more frequently and most other functions were impaired! The GSM phone was no longer working...well, it was 'sort of working': In order to receive a phonecall I'd need to reboot the item. Then it would allow calls to come in for about one minute. A reboot is also now required in order to make phone calls. SMS messages no longer come in. The power tools section can usually only be accessed after a reboot...and you may well have just scannned some 50 barcodes when the item decides to freeze and need a reboot...As the engineer told me this was to do with the software or kernel version (sorry, got no clue what these things are) I suggested for him to simply provide me with older versions to eliminate the problem. The reply was that there were only 3 versions ever released and that the problem on the unit has to do with the GSM radio, and that the software around the GSM radio is the same in all vrsions, which obviously means that currently all units are faulty!Under these circumstances I would have expected that a company like Honmeywell would offer either an alternate product or refund, or at least take care that the seller would take the item back, yet all Honeywell are prepared to do is to ask me to go through the sellers returns process...despite being told that the seller does not answer emails.So if you want to spend a few hundred bucks on a brick then this is your item. If you need a scanner and a mobile computer - go elsewhere, this isn't what you're looking for! Worse, you'll probably end up getting stuck with the brick, just like I did!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$835.00", "Features": "DOLPHIN 6000 BT BSM GPS CAMERA 8GB MSD\n416 MHz - 256 MB RAM - 512 MB Flash - 2.8\" QVGA 29\n0", "Name": "Dolphin 6000 Wireless Scanphone (802.11b-g, Bluetooth, GSM US, Numeric GPS, CAM, Laser, 8GB, WEH6.5, Battery)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-uhAJthyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00570WL8W"}}
