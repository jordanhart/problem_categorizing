True it has no bluetooth but the infared works just as well. Only fault is that the back case is a little loose but still stays on other than that, this one is a keeper!!!!!!!!", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Daughters B-Day Gift", "Author": "Burt Engle \"Burt\"", "ReviewID": "REPQYH0XBGUBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this and it has been extremely useful to my daughter", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "SEXY Mobile ???? I dont think so", "Author": "Ahmed Elkenany", "ReviewID": "R2MCLKJIY4P791", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nokia released 3 (ONLY 3, the 7610 is NOT a part of the group) Art deco mobiles which are all about looks.7260: The Smallest and cheapest7270: The Mediam clamshell7280: The Expensive masterpiece  Since these phones are only made for looks, I give the 7270 one star. I had the phone for a month, very ugly and looks very cheap, also it has the worst assembly which makes look more of a cheap imitation toy rather than a $500 mobile.  As for the functionality, the phone works great, great display, great features, no bluetooth though.  So if you seek envy, crank up your wallet and get the 7280, if you seek envy and functionality, crank up your wallet ALOT and get the $1000 Nokia 8800. But If u seek supremety, get ready to max out a lot of plastic for the $40,000 Nokia Vertu Signature series.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GSM unlocked\nAlmost no Scratches\nComes with a charger\nComes with a original retail box", "Name": "Nokia 7270 - Cellular phone - GSM - folder (flip)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41H3S0GZ03L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007SNYYO"}}
