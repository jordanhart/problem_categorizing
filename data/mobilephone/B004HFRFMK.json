I load $25 every 3 months and still have most of the money rolled over for the next period. It has lots of useful features, like E-mail, Windows Live Messenger connection, etc. The keyboard is very easy to use. The display is easy to read. It has music player, Bluetooth(which makes it easier to load music, photos, text, etc. from my computer, and to print photos directly). I'm very happy with it. Only thing I regret is not having bought the 4GB card, It's worthy if you plan to use it as an MP3 player, since the 2GB original card doesn't have much space left to store files. I think the bigger card should come standard with the phone. It's  impossible to find accesories for this phone on regular stores, you have to do it through the internet only. Other than that, I strongly recommend it.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "The right choice for the right price", "Author": "Louis L.

I may just take advantage as I have learned over the weeks since the purchase how easy it is to use as well as convenient beyond belief to have a dependable solid phone. I purchased this as I did not want to enter into a new contract with AT&T; but I needed to replace my phone.

The only problem I have ever had with it was every once in a blue moon my service won't work so I simply turn it off anf back on and it's fixed. This phone in indestructable! I dropped it on my concrete driveway which is a slope since I live on a hill, slid the whole way down, only a few scratches. I have dropped it many other times, usually on concrete. My dog chewed it up and bent the back from his teeth, and went to the fair and had it thrown out of my pocket on a ride. Found my phone in one spot, battery in another, and the back in yet another place. Put it together and still works great!

Cute, light weight, and great functions. I do have two things I didn't like at all about this phone. When I used the internet for a while, anywhere for 5-30 minutes, it liked to shut itself down and restart randomly. And the buttons while texting are more flush than I like, I like bubbled to I can tell when I hit a key. Otherwise it was a fun little phone and I was sad  to see it go when I switched to a new phone.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone is make out of tank medal!", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R2M8VJMIJ9K0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I love it! It is not the highest tech phone out there, but it works like charm. My battery life can last about 2 to 3 days just depending on how much time I talk to someone. This phone can take a beating! One time I have dropped this phone off three flights of stairs and it was like nothing happen to it, other than some minor scratches! The last phone I had fell off the couch and the screen went black and broke.However it does have its problems. The buttons to text are very small and my thumbs are wide, so I can only text with one hand. If you want a phone that can do internet, apps, etc. go for another phone. Internet on this phone sucks. Also, sometimes calls will not go threw, this doesn't happen very much, but it does happen. All in all, good phone if you just want the basics: talk, text, take pictures, and picture texts.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the basic user", "Author": "Bar Rag", "ReviewID": "R3A3IL62O6JHGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The perfect phone for a basic user.

I loved it. The customer reviews on it said it was good and I missed having a full keyboard so I decided to buy it to replace my full touch screen. I've had it less than 3 months, and last night it gave out. It acts like it wants to turn on, then kicks off and does the same thing. It doesn't stop either. I tried charging it and putting it in rice because I thought it was humidity and heat. Neither worked. With this I am losing over 100 pictures because I haven't bought a memory card yet. I do text a lot, so that may be it, but I'm not sure. Other people say it's great so maybe I just got the bad one of the bunch. Either way for me, it was not worth the $80 that I paid for it. Overall, it's a good phone if you like replacing it every 3 months.

It is a piece of crap!  I can't keep too many messages in the archives, the camera feature leaves much to be desired and the battery life is nothing compared to other 'go' phones I had.  The worst part about this phone is that it keeps randomly shutting off and restarting itself!  I will be in the middle of a text and it will decide to shut off and then 2 seconds later restart without even saving what I had for a text.  This is the same no matter what function I am using at the time.  It's 'reboot' action will interrupt everything you are doing and delete any progress that you are having.Completely frustrating!  On top of that, the continuous rebooting keeps burning the battery.  I had it 'reboot' itself 9 tiimes in a 15 minute period!  I needed to make a work necessary call and it was unusable during that time!  I am definitely getting a different phone and this one will go into a phone recycle bin- maybe they can use the parts for a remote control toy truck someplace instead as a communication device.Don't buy this product!

I have delicate hands, so texting is very easy for me. Probably would be much harder for bigger hands, though. I text a lot, so which the inbox fills much faster then I'd like, I just delete older texts and it's fine.  I'm not that picky.  I just want a reliable phone that works, and that's exactly what this does.  Some of the other reviews made me nervous about buying this phone again.
