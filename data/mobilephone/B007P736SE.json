I understand it was a used product, but it could've at least gone throughfactory reset prior to arrival. Needless to say, I had to do it all. I'm a strong advocate for the android system, but this Windows phone is not so bad. It gets what I need done. This product did not come with a charger , which I foolishly assumed was automatic. Yeah, NOT! Be 100% sure your product description says charger included. Fortunately, Amazon customer service swiftly handled that problem. I will say the phone arrived in pretty good condition.Not a bad purchase.Other notes:*battery life-it's a smartphone, so don't expect much*speaker-just as loud as, maybe even louder than, my sister's galaxy s3*camera-5 mp not so bad, flash great , image stabilization okay, video quality only good in youtube 720 hd mode*no security lock for apps/text messages, threaded messaging(great feature)*3G connectivityMore updates later***", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Focus Phone", "Author": "Kari Bartels", "ReviewID": "R16SUKI5NEWHHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect phone!

I went to the at&t; store because I was having complications with the phone reacting with my at&t; sim card, and they informed me that I was given a phone with a defective sim card reader. Maybe check your products before you send them next time, just a suggestion", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!!", "Author": "Ltwitty", "ReviewID": "RPG7DJ21EIXQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything I wanted in a phone and more.
