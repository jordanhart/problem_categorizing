{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great all around phone if you don't want a smart phone", "Author": "Dave Marshall", "ReviewID": "R1NXRS132JM5A0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've used this phone for almost 3 years and still don't have a strong desire to replace it.What I use it for:  I wanted a phone that was good at being a phone (novel, I know) and good for texting.  It's my primary alarm clock and the occasional calculator.Pros: The two way hinge works great and still feels the same after years of use.  I love the physical keyboard for texting.  You can bring up your call log (both incoming and outgoing) just by hitting the send button, something I use all the time.  At the rate I use it (about 200 minutes a month) the battery lasts almost a week before I have to charge it.  The clamshell design protects the main screen and prevents \"butt dialing\".Cons: My biggest complaint by far is that it only holds 50 texts in you inbox before you have to clear out your inbox.  This is ridiculous when it can hold plenty of pictures (not to mention that I have a 2 GB flash card in it).  This is more of an annoyance than a real problem.  The camera is... functional.  1.3 MP is good enough for a background on the phone, but it doesn't look good on a computer.It can hold and play mp3's if you want to but you're better off just using an iPod or similar.Overall it's a great phone if what you want is a phone.  If you want a media center/smartphone/game playing/social networking device, look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "BAD SHAPE", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R2NJW65AFVRJ5V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Girlfriend loves this type of phone, when hers broke down I was going to buy her a replacement from eBay.  Someone said I should check on amazon for the phone which I wound up doing. Phone was described as in great shape, when we received the phone one of the buttons was missing, the old owners music and messages full of profanity and some pictures were still on the phone. The seller I guess took offense to my rating and called my girlfriend up wanting to know why I rated the experience the way I did and she told him.  I don't want a new phone or anything like that just please as a seller double check the items you are shipping out to your customers and make sure they are what you say.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "isc11", "ReviewID": "R10P0D876FG90L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok this phone is one of the phones i had in the past that i loved and all that came to a end but when i was looking on amazon i found one and for a good price which was good but imma tell you the pros and conspros:just about everythingcons: the camera flash its pretty dimbut other than that pretty good deal ...... :]", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Nancy", "ReviewID": "RM9FSMKXZFU5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great little phone with a keyboard.
