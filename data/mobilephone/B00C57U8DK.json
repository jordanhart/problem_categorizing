All the reviews talked about the Sony SP having a long battery life (using their standard bench tests), but in real life the unit often runs for 3-5 days without charging (Note: I am not a heavy phone user ... a typical day would include ... reading and replying to emails, answering a couple of calls, taking a few photos, catching up with Facebook friends and sending a couple of text messages).I downloaded a high resolution graphics game to test the battery life and the processor speed ... the unit performed flawlessly with no game stutter or delays and not surprisingly the battery life fell away significantly during game play.The camera is listed as 8.0MP but lacks clarity on occasions and is definitely not as consistent as the 8.0MP camera in the old Xperia X10A, which is a little confusing given Sony's camera expertise. There is talk on the internet about Sony releasing a software upgrade for the camera, let's hope it comes to pass.Sound is terrific, both from a music listening perspective and from a telephone call perspective.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "powerful smart device!", "Author": "Brunello", "ReviewID": "R8UVX5DJ36PC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Eeasy powerful smart!

I though that its time to move on so i went to sony and i researched what where the new phones they released, i was amazed on how many pphones there where. I dont know why but i liked the SP phone better, when i found out that the price for it is only 270 i bought it right away i also bout a book flip case, and a SD card for 32GB and it all together costed me 300 buck, so thats nice. Now lets get to a phone, unlike the most people i understand that phone isnt a PS3 or a PSP and its not ment for gaming no matter how good it is, i never play games, (when i played games on a phone last time it was when i was 13 in Belarus and we all had Cimense C65) i only read books, and sometimes watching videos cause i have an MP3 player for a music. Battary life- set up to a stamina mode, it says that i can live about 4 days and 8 hours in a standby, ive charged my phone about 3 years ago, i used texting, calling, red a book couple of times and i still got 75% AMAZING because with stamina mode it only kills 1% of battary during the night. The screen- the screen is really good, i like all the details about it. Performance is good too its not lagging and it fast, sometimes might freeze the internet cause my wi-fe is bad. Overall look of the phone is very good, i liked that little plastic bar at the bottom that glows with different colors no matter what you do is it music, photos, sms, or calling. The phone is great and id recommend to buy it.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "it doesn't work 3G, 4G or LTE with Tmobile", "Author": "TUONG LY", "ReviewID": "RUW1ANAZHBR57", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read very carefully the comments of this phone before deciding to buy this phone.

It's not too heavy and it's the right size for me (XPeria Z is too large with its 5\"). I like the \"light effect\" at the bottom while receiving a call, charging, listening to music or watching pictures. .But while using it, it was all different. It discharges faster, even if nothing is running.Worst, it's freezing all the time.

I highly recommend Sony phones, far better designed and manufactured than Motorola or Samsung. However, I give it only a 4 star because as a first time customer in buying an unlocked phone separately, none of the other reviews or description informed me that this is the worldwide version. It will work in the US, but only with at&t; networks if you want decent data speeds. I didn't realize that the sp comes in three different models that differ only in network compatibility. This phone is perfect if you are traveling abroad, but do your research before you buy it. One of the other 2 would be better for using strictly stateside. This phone does not accommodate the 1900 or 1700 spectrum for either 3g or 4g.
