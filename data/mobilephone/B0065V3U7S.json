Was suppose to be unlocked. I's not. Should have read all the reviews first. Talked to Apple, they said a report was already generated on this serial number. Therfore it must have been sold once and was a refurbish. This isn't advertized either. So buy at your own risk.Update:I contacted Suppier about the product. They provide me with the instructions to unlock the phone. After several failed attempts they recommended returning the product. They gave me the option of replacement or my money back, less stocking fee. I opted for refund. Although the phone did not work as advertize, Eve in the customers relations dept did her best to help me. She replied promptly to all my E-mails and did her best to make it work. So I have to say even though the product didn't perform as promised, the company did everything it could to satisfy me.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "there's a line on lcd", "Author": "kv magaoay", "ReviewID": "RF760JO1CWRWQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "no charger no headphone i though its a package with accessories so cant use it immediately and lcd have already 2lines on lcd", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery life only 8 hours...!!", "Author": "Kathy", "ReviewID": "R2EJ2D7MYOEZ4D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I changed by Blackberry for this iphone 4S, but the battery is maximum 8 hours life, compared to my ex bb, more than 24 hours.

You cannot set up the account without entering a valid Credit card, but if you use a itunes card (min I've ever seen is $15) you don't need to enter a Credit card. Happy with the product.
