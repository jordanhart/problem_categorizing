It takes care of all my needs (phoning, scheduling, keeping track of people & data, etc.) while traveling around the world. It's sturdy and doesn't damage easily or initiate functions by accident. Easy to use and fun to use.I love it, and this is the second Razr V3 that I've owned.My only complaint is that it creates a completely different entry in the phone book for different phone numbers for the same contact. My old Razr V3t kept them all in the same line.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Happy Homemaker \"Helen\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z5SZTH4WZEWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was purchased for my husband who doesn't want anything that's difficult to operate.

Fenner", "ReviewID": "R1HVDLZUX9HCC0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost a year and really did like it in the beginning. The sound was excellent, the button placement and size made dialing and texting fairly easy. I was very happy with it. Then it started to fall apart... the connections from the screen to the \"base\" started to go wonky. The screen just randomly goes black and seems to like to stay that way. If I squeeze and push the screen in just the right way I can get the picture to return, but that seems to be working less and less. Most of the time I am unable to see who is calling, what a text message says and I can't hardly use it to text to anyone. The rest of the phone is in great condition, but what good is all that when you can't even see it... :(", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "razr v3 silver", "Author": "Michael B.

It was unlocked for sure! It has worked with my SIM card as soon as I put it in. It has been the same case, for my father in India as well, after I gifted it to him. He is quite happy with the phone's functionality. He was noticing that the batteries need charging every two to three days, which apprently is unlike his previous phone (a Nokia I think!).

The phone that arrived was not working. The screen inside and out was dead.I was given a return address and had to ship the thing back myself.I can understand if I just didn't want the phone, but to eat the return shipping fees to return an obviously defective item is somethingthe seller needs to cover.I feel completely used and will never do business with this company again.This is the reason that I normally only deal with Amazon shipping the gear, as they will do the right thing and cover return shipping fordefective merchandise.

We occassionaly travel outside the US and this phone has worked great elsewhere in the world.  We got tired of jockeying SIM cards so will leave one set for the US and the other will be our travel phone when we need it.  The phone arrived promptly but I orded black and got silver.  The box and instruction book were labled for a black phone and the CD had obviously been used (envelope wrinkled, CD scratched) so I think the box may have been \"cheery-picked\" over time.
