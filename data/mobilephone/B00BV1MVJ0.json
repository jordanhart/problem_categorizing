I had purchased online, so it was international i9500. Battery bulged and had standard issue that is widely reported in the press. I called Samsung USA. They refuse to change the battery and say that it is international. The phone is British EU based. I checked with IMEI number also. Samsung US claims the phone is from Syria! and refuse to replace the battery. Well that's it for customer Service. So warning that the international phones have no warranty!UPDATE: 10/8/2013:An updated NFC Tag from Whiztags is just awesome, has 450 bytes of memory and I use several of those in office and home with my Samsung Galaxy S4 NFC tags - Topaz 512 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writeable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 3 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee!I have been using TechMatteTM Qi-compatible Wireless Charger for the Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 (With AC Adapter and Micro USB Cable). and TechMatteTM Qi-standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV for wireless charging and they are very convenient for charging by placing on the mat.UPDATE 9/15/2013:I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL REVIEWGalaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvTriggerGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

One of the first things that amazed me was that after 1 day, 6 hours and 56 minutes of use the phone said I still had 17% left on my battery. This was after heavy use setting up the screens, adding apps, texting, talking, browsing and more. Our power went out for a while and I even used the flashlight and an app to read a book for 25 minutes. Hands down, the S4 is the winner over the iPhone.Phone was easy to set up for email and apps. Changing screen layouts was also a breeze. It was also great that I could just pull the memory chip out of my last phone, slide it in to the S4 and had all my contacts, music, photos and everything else in seconds. Didn't have to worry about uploading from the old phone and than downloading to the new.Used the 13mp camera and pictures were sharp and clear. Also liked the panorama function. Took some video and was equally impressed.I use this phone a lot for business and the clarity of the phone was great. Others even mentioned without asking how clear my voice was.I was showing the phone to a friend who is a big supporter of the main competitor and he tried to challenge the navigation. He spoke his address really fast from a distance and was surprised when it showed up perfectly in a millisecond. Good luck with that one Seri.Last, but not least, it's fast. Scrolling through screens, apps, on the browser and everything else this phone is fast. Perhaps the quad core processor and 2 GB of ram compared to a dual core and 1 GB for the iPhone made the difference.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone on all accounts. I did have one concern prior to purchasing. I thought the phone my just be too big. It isn't. I checked, put the phone in a belt clip, put it on and couldn't tell the difference from my Droid. The larger higher resolution screen is great. I also like the fact that you're not stuck buying only Apple products for the phone. My car charger from my Droid worked find and the same charger charges my Kindle. Three different, products, three different companies and they all work together. Not with Apple. Sorry iPhone, but the hype has got tiring. It doesn't seem to do anything as well as the S4 and you're still stuck with the short battery life with an iPhone.Final ScoreGalaxy S4 10iPhone  0Buy it!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone! Super responsive, reliable, quality. Cosmetically poor.", "Author": "Heavy Reader", "ReviewID": "R3O5QAI4KJGKG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've done a *ton* of reading on phones and had narrowed it down to the S4, the HTC One, and the iPhone 5.I wanted to comment on a few things you don't read in reviews. My two big worries about the device after pre-purchase research were: the ugly exterior and TouchWiz.Regarding the exterior, personally, I think the HTC One looks the most attractive, but after you put a case on it, they all look roughly the same. Secondly, I actually prefer the feather light weight of the plastic S4 over the prettier but heavier premium metal finishes.Regarding TouchWiz: I was worried it would slow the phone down, and that definitely is not a problem. This phone is *extremely* responsive and fast. Obviously, the speed is due to the internal hardware not the skin, but the TouchWiz skin isn't getting in the way. Also, TouchWiz has a variety of minor additions that are more practical than the stock Android counterparts. I didn't expect that. For example, I like the TouchWiz keyboard and dialer and incoming call GUI better the alternatives. They let me do what I want to do more easily. The one big downside of TouchWiz is that much of it is cosmetically ugly. Stock Android and iOS both have a much cleaner/elegant look to them.Two other plusses: the LTE reception seems to work *way* better than my last Evo 4G LTE phone did. And, while on my home WiFi, my S4 streams YouTube with much less buffering than my Nexus 7 tablet, which surprised me because I would have thought that was strictly a network issue.Also, the camera, and specs, and feature list is quite amazing, and you can read about that stuff everywhere.Bottom line: this is the happiest I've been with a new phone.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am returning it", "Author": "CARL HUDSON", "ReviewID": "R3C552I8284REF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not sure how this happen, but this company (Bavaro phones) is trying to sell fake phones for original price, and it's not right.

For those who do not want to read the complete detailed review, you may skip to the last paragraph at the bottom for a summary.So after having this phone for about three months, I will say I love many of the features of this phone as well as of Android.  However, there are drawbacks.  The drawbacks you will notice are minor things but there are so many minor things that they eventually become a major thing in my opinion.Lets go item by item:Screen Size: Love the large display and the sharp screen.  Although I was hesitant about it at first, I have grown to love it.  But no, it isnt all good. The screen is too large to reach all corners with one hand.  This does not help when you are using the phone while driving but i guess ur not supposed to do that anyways so I cant complain.  Also, even though the phone is quite large in ur pocket, it isnt quite as large and annoying as i thought it was going to be - unless u wear skinny jeans i guess.  Now, when I look at other peoples iPhone's, I feel like how did i ever live with such a small screen.  Yes, it feels that small after using this for a little while.  Even though the large screen has its small drawbacks, I love it and idk if i would be able to go back to a small iPhone 4 size screen.Camera: Camera is amazing.  I love all the different options you have to pick what quality and size you want your pictures and videos to be so you can save space on your phone.  I love all the different modes the camera has and overall it takes very good pics.  I have mine set for 6MP so it takes less space and so i can message the pictures easier and the pictures come out great!  No con here excpet for the fact that there should be a way to open the camera without unlocking the phone like iPhone has it so if you want to take a picture of something right away you can.  I'm hoping Android adds that to a recent upgrade.Battery Life: Battery life is good but nothing great.  If i dont use it much throughout the day, I will have 30% or so still left by the end of the day.  If i use it alot, i might run out of charge by 6-7PM.  Moderate use, i usually am at 15% or so by 11PM and my day usually starts at around 730AM. The good thing is that when ur battery gets old and can barely hold a charge, u can simply get a replacement and switch it out which isnt as easy on the iPhone.SD car Slot:  Love it.  On my iPhone, i kept running out of space, granted i had the 16GB, but i love that you dont have to get the higher GB one for this phone and just expand the memory with SD card slot.  I put a 32GB one in mine and i put all my music and movies/videos and pictures on there.Headphones: Good in ear headphones. Stay in my ear at the gym.  Sound great. Cant complain.  I tested them against the new iPhone 5 headphones and they both pretty much sounds the same.  The iPhone headphones might be marginally better.Apps/Widgets: Plethora of apps.  Apps for everything.  So MANY FREE APPS! I also love widgets.  Something i was not farmiliar with with my iPhone but they are very helpful.Out of Box experience: HORRIBLE.  This phone comes with so much bloatware and is doing so much in the background that it was giving me anxiety.  There is all this unwanted samsung/google/At&t; software.  I wish the phone came with a clean version of android without all this other crap.  A few hours of messing around and customization, i have it exaclty how i want it.  But for someone that was new to Android, all the crap that came on here stressed me out.New Features:-Eye Scrolling thing: I tried it, it was annoying, and so i turned it off.  BTW it doesnt detect ur eye, you have to move ur head.  Who moves their head when reading a 5inch screen?!-Smart Pause: keeps pausing my video even when im looking at it.  Useless annoying i turned it off.-IR Blaster: This is pretty cool if i am very very lazy to get up and get my remote.  Tho i prefer my normal remote but its pretty cool.-SHealth: I thought I'd use it but I havent...didn't seem useful when I first tried it out but it may be so dont take my word for itOther Things I love:-I love you can dload music and torrents straight to this phone-I love the LED alert light for messages, I missed this feature when I left my Blackberry for my iPhone. U can also chose the color for different types of notifications-4G LTE is fast! Obv iPhone 5 has that too but i still thought id mention it.Little things that drive me crazy:-Speaker: Why is it on the back?! when u are listening to a video or something ur looking at the screen.  Why is this projecting the audio the other direction.  Very annoying.-Lock Screen button: When u go to press the lock button, u press against the other side also, but guess what's on the other side?! the volume buttons! so now u may have put ur phone on silent when u didnt want to or made ur phone loud right before work.  Or maybe u noticed but now u have to unlock ur screen and change the volume and lock ur screen again and make sure u dont accidentaly hit the volume key again.-Clock: you know how when u take ur phone out just to check the time for a split second and then put it back in ur pocket? Well guess what? there is a split second delay for your time to update so ur gonna have to take it out...wait a split second..look at the time...and put ur phone back..this needs to update faster.-Buttons: all the buttons have a cheap feel.  They dont have that bold (yes i pressed that MF button feeling) your always left wondering did i press that button? did that go through?-App Updates: I told my phone to only update apps on WIFI, but it does is on 4G also...wth stop!-Stuff: Stuff takes longer to do than on the iPhone.  It just does.  There are more options and more menus and more of everything.  Its the price u pay to be able to do more with ur phone i guess.-Emojis: My gf and I cannot communicate anymore.  We use Whatsapp because there are no emoji's on andorid except those crappy android only emojis which suck.Emergency Call: The emergency call option is right where ur thumb will hit it continuously when u go to unlock ur phone.  ANNOYING!-WIFI: it connects to random unsecured wifi networks around u without asking you..i dont like it...there are unsecured networks around my work that it will connect to but they dont have internet so ill have disable wifi so i can use my 4G and then when i get home i have to rememeber to turn my wifi on so i dont go over my 2GB data limit.-Email: I dont love the email on this phone..gets ur job done though-Saving Pictures: u know when u go on FB and u see a meme and u wanna save it...and if u have an iphone u can hold down the pictures and an option to save the picture will come up...well not here.  I think there is an app u can dload to do that but why should i have to dload an app for something so simple.  I just take a snapshot but then i have to crop out the sides and it takes from the quality of the picture as well.-Voicemail: why do i have to dload a visual voicemail app? why isnt it embedded in the phone? W/ESummary:I love this phone.  It has alot of cool features and things you can do that you cannot do with the iPhone.  Many of these features may just be Android though. It also has many drawbacks which tick me off.Would I make the Switch knowing what i know now? Yes, yes I would.  Although, I don't love it so much that I'd out rule the iPhone.  If Apple came out with an iPhone 6 with a bigger screen and some cool new features, I would consider switching back.  I love the build quality of the iPhone, something that the Galaxy simply does not have.  I also enjoy the ease of use on the iPhone, although, I hate that whole syncing with iTunes stuff (when i was trying to take my music off my iPhone so I could put it on my Galaxy it was, challenging, to say the least,  because i had to download a software which wasn't free to get my music off because Apple doesn't allow YOU to remove YOUR music that's on YOUR phone -_-)Hope you found this review helpful*UPDATE****After having this phone for almost a year, here is my update.  First off, why did Samsung delay Kit-kat to S4 users till just about a month ago.  It was very annoying that everyone was running kit-kat and I had Jelly-Bean. Secondly, along with the Kit-Kat update, Samsung decided to add more annoying apps that I didn't ask for. The phone also acts up quite a bit now and feels much slower.  Also, the plasticy quality of the phone is really getting to me. The trim scratches and peels way too easily.  Also, the battery life has significantly decreased since the update to Kit-Kat, it barely last me half a day now.  Also, as I have mentioned above, the power button on one side and the volume buttons on the other is a very stupid feature and so is the speaker on the back.  And i don't think they have fixed those on the S5 either.  Samsung needs to start listening to its customers and improve the things that most people complaining about such as the plastic etc.  Also, none of those cool features that Samsung advertises work well.  They are all useless.  Not to say there is nothing good about the phone.  Everything i mentioned above about the phone that i like is still there.  However, i have lowered my 4star to 3 star.  I am not going to upgrade to the S5. Going to, probably going to give the HTC One M8 a chance.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I was shipped a FAKE SAMSUNG S4 !!!!!", "Author": "ocimar lima", "ReviewID": "R1HLX006QXVGPF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The device that I was shipped looks like a Samsung S4 but when you start the phone you immediately can tell that its not a Samsung S4.Samsung did not build this phone!!!  the display is much much inferior, the camera in this is NOT the 13 Megapixel camera you would expect to find on an Samsung S4! this camera has only 5 mp at best and not to mention that many camera functions and also many other device functions are no where to be found in this device.

(the future looks less and less bright for Apple)", "Author": "S. W.", "ReviewID": "R4XGU6M0WM7OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the most impressive things about the phone is the fact the size hasn't changed from its predecessor - the Galaxy S4 comes in at 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 inches, meaning there's no extra heft to try and work with in your palm.However, despite this fact, the screen on the S4 has been increased once more, to a whopping 5-inch display with Full HD resolution. This means the same amount of pixels you'd have seen on a TV that cost well over $1500 four years ago is now riding around in your pocket.Let's not pretend that Samsung is a pioneer in this area though: like a great many features of the Galaxy S4, the phone borrows a lot from the other top smartphones of the moment. Both the Sony Xperia Z and the HTC One have screens that rock the same resolution, but neither of them have the jaw-dropping clout of the Super AMOLED HD screen on display here.On top of that, there's a much faster processor packed under the hood, ample storage space for media thanks to an expandable memory card slot, and the likes of 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and pretty much any other connection you care to mention on board.One thing that isn't mentioned in most literature is that the Galaxy S4 boasts OTG compatibility.  Use an OTG cable like this: Micro USB OTG Cable - LIFETIME WARRANTY and you can connect a myriad of devices (USB thumb drive, game pad, mouse/keyboard, DSLR camera and a lot more).  Why don't more phone manufactures promote this hardware tech?!?Samsung has tried to supplement this with a load of software upgrades too, meaning a more powerful camera, a better way to communicate with your friends and consume media, and, interestingly, a big push into personal health through dedicated apps.The Samsung Galaxy S4 costs a little more than the HTC One, well, it does for memory.  Same price for the 16GB S4 as the 32GB HTC (pay a $40 premium to get a 32GB Galaxy, when they're released).  Of course, the S4's removable storage option, which the One lacks, levels the playing field some, as SD cards aren't too pricey.The other notable addition to the design of the Galaxy S4 is the infra-red blaster on the top of the phone. This allows you to control your TV, satellite box, DVD player, amp and even air conditioner, according to the reviewer notes. Again, this isn't a new feature, but it works well in practice, and despite being small it's powerful enough indeed.I do implore you to get the phone in your hand before making a judgment though - while it doesn't have the best design on the market when it comes to materials, it's a big step forward compared to the Galaxy S3 and allows for a grippy and easy-to-hold phone, with a whopping screen inside.To just dismiss it for being plastic would be doing the S4 a disservice as it has so much more going for it than that, but it's worth remembering that to a lot of people, the way a phone looks is as important as how much RAM it's got on board and how fast the CPU is - if not more so.All in all, this is a phone worth reviewing.  It may not be for all users, but for the power users among us, there simply may be no equal.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung S4 now cream of crop", "Author": "G. Murphy \"Murdigs\"", "ReviewID": "R406VW7TJKHR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am one of a few select few people that can honestly say I currently own the Iphone 5 and Samsung S4. My company phone is the Iphone 5 and my personal is the S4. My thoughts on Apple are, they were the innovators of the smartphone and Tablet world. But now with that birth, we are at a maturing age within the industry, and fact is, Iphone cant just stick with what got them to the top, since phones like the Samsung S4 are the latest and greatest smartphones that leave Iphone in the dust.My points will be simple and straight forward. Im not a tech junkie, both phones perform well as far as software speed, though S4 takes the cake. Most of the points below refer to the user friendliness of the phone.1. Both are great phones, fast, seamless, beautiful screens, awesome video/pics2. S4 takes the cake with its screen, which is way bigger, and way easier to read articles, watch videos.3. People think initially that the S4 too big, well its really not since the phone itself is so thin, it fits easily into my pocket without feeling bulky or awkward. this may bother some people worried about durability, well I guess just get a good case.4. Keyboard, again way way better on the S4. All the keys I need are on one screen. With the iphone I need to go to another screen to access... commas, ?, !, numbers, @, or .com to name a few. I find that so annoying when writing emails and texts which I frequently do on my phone. S4 allows access to all on one screen5. Video and Pics, are a tie as far as quality, I mean you have to be really picky to pick one over the other....but seeing my pics on a 5 inch screen is a lot better than viewing them on a 4 inch screen. Video watching also way better on a 5 inch screen.There will be Apple fans and Droid fans, but for the people in between that just want the best phone on the market with all the bias BS thrown out...S4 takes the cake until Iphone changes their hardware to keep up.

Before I start the review, please keep in mind that I consider myself an average user who spends most of the time \"hands on\" doing tasks at work, or simply painting or doing graphics - in other words, I will most likely look at my phone every other hours, unless I receive a text or a phone call.Pros:- Beautiful 5in Screen. One of the best screens out there. Rich blacks and HD video playback.- Great 13MP camera! I usually take a lot of pictures when I'm outdoors, so its great to have a 13 MP stock camera in my pocket.- Expandable memory (Very useful when keeping a lot of pictures)Cons:- Phone calls tend to be not clear- Pre-loaded apps are very annoying and update every time you have wifi on (almost 3 times a month)Alright, alright. I know what you guys are thinking. \"That's not even 10% of the good content that the phone has to offer.\"Multi-window, Air view, Android market, S beam, Air Gesture, NFC, Smart Scroll, Smart Stay etc... To be honest, I only took a look at those the first day that I got the phone. It's a great addition, but most of them are useless when you have a steady schedule. Half of what they included is not for daily use, and it seems that it was mostly targeted for individuals who have time to actually use them. For me, I tend to use things that are straight to the point. The air gesture looks great, but half of the time I am eating, I wouldn't have my hands dirty like the guy in the commercial had to answer the call, lol! I gotta give it to them though, the screen is amazing! better than the iphone 5. Great for movies, but... when I want to watch a movie, I would rather watch it on my 55\" HDTV. I mean, in all seriousness, I personally think this phone is great. The specs are fantastic, but if you are like me who only needs a phone to answer calls or send messages or scroll to pictures (that usually have a thumbnail/ no need for airview), then almost 80% of all the new content that the s4 has to offer is not really for daily use. But then again, that's just my personality. I had an Iphone 5 before the s4 and after a month of having the s4, I'm already heading to the ATT store for a nano sim card for my Iphone 5 as it fits my basic needs. I'm not an apple fanboy, and I actually own other Samsung products as well as the S4, but it's just not for me!I'm giving this phone a 5 stars because it is a great phone for those who have the time to use it correctly.

Battery life is far superior to the S3 and previous phones. I really appreciate the fact that I can make it through 15 hour day, use 4 hours of on-screen time, and still manage to have 30% remaining. Never have I gotten such great battery life out of an Android device. I dont use many of the new samsung software features, however some people might. Most will find the new software features gimmicky.Expandable storage is another great feature and one that I look for in all of my phones. One can use up to a 64GB microSD card to store music and pictures or whatever else. Another consideration one should look at before purchasing this device that is 16 or 32 GB of memory is required for app storage. Apps are unable to be stored on the microSD card, and the Android operating system and Samsung software eat up a considerable amount of the base 16 or 32GB phone models.The camera on the S4 is fantastic. I am just floored sometimes at the level of detain in my pictures. Images come out looking just fantastic, and this camera also takes some of the best low light pictures I have seen.I added a Ringke SLIM case for a minimal protection and look.

The website doesn't say it has 4g(so that was my fault). The phone also will not be updated to 4.4.2(KitKat) due to the fact that the phone company mine was built for is in Peru and now that the S5 is coming out they will only support it(spoke with them). While the company never misled me it definitely did not say this version works well in the US.  The battery life is horrible.  The only good thing is the camera.

I can easily touch all corners of this screen without stretching too much and I have very average sized hands for a guy. Coming from a gamer, the S4 is a totally different breed from iPhone at least in the emulation area. It can run almost any N64/PSX game at 40-60fps constantly. The only thing I could complain about this phone is heating. Now it's a very powerful phone and it will run warm when gaming. I had a defect my first time around with this phone at was running at 120F. I replaced it and have had no problems since. I can't rave anymore about how everyone should at least give the S4 a chance.

Not great if you're trying to be silent because the vibration itself is actually pretty loud especially if you keep the phone on a hard surface.Other than that, haven't had any issues. It has a pretty huge display which is nice for apps and games, not actually necessary for a phone per se of course. The battery will mostly last a whole day (had phone for 3 months now) unless you're really using it a lot during the day, videos and games and such.I would give it four stars or even five if they managed to get the sound issues simplified. Also the volume is sometimes way too loud even on the lowest setting.

Side-by-side review below (I've owned both)***", "Author": "Steve Morty", "ReviewID": "R112R5IFTP7QZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review of the iPhone 5s versus the Galaxy s4 (in case any of you are upgrading phones and trying to decide). Side note: Like Coke and Pepsi, there will be folks that are biased toward one or the other, but my hope is to point out some key differences should it help others in their overall decision making process.iPhone 5s-Better native keyboard \u2013 more precise and predictive. More natural feel when typing. The auto correct is great on the 5s.-Siri \u2013 Smoother and better voice accuracy. More natural and intuitive. I provide commands (\u201cremind me about the 8am dentist appointment on December 31th\u201d) and Siri understands. If I issued the same command on the Galaxy S4, the voice recognition would be confused and misinterpret.-The overall Volume of speaker is louder on the 5s than on the Galaxy S4. I can hear the ringer from other rooms.-In my car and using the speakerphone on the 5s, others tell me the sound quality is night and day compared to the Galaxy S4 (Verizon). When I had my S4 (two different ones), they said I sounded garbled or as if I was talking through a tin can.-I have yet to experience an application crash on the 5s-The Camera is quick to snap shots and pictures are sharp-Availability of iMessage and Facetime. Makes communicating with other Apple users simple. I can see when they are typing a reply back to me, and I can even Facetime in the car or from anywhere without having to download an configure a 3rd party app such as Skype, and then hope the person on the other end had done the same (I have family who are not technology savvy, but easily use Facetime).-The iOS7 operating system is overall more refined and user friendly (i.e. \u2013 you can hold down and click X to delete an application on the iPhone rather than get confused trying to find the Settings/Application submenus on the Android/S4)-In my area, better overall signal quality / antenna strength. No dropped calls in the same spots I used my S4.Galaxy S4-I like having a \u2018Back\u2019 button (bottom left arrow)-The S4 has a larger screen / more real estate-The S4 camera can lag (would display \u2018Processing\u2019 message for 2-3 seconds while images save). Images were often blurry or not as sharp as I had hoped even after adjusting various settings.-I do like having a removable battery and accessories available with the S4 such as a wireless charger.-I don\u2019t like having to close various apps at least daily when they lock up/crash (Android Force Close / Process Stopped Unexpectedly errors). This may be more developer related than phone related, however, this does not happen with my iPhone 5s.-Larger variety of apps. Not as restrictive as Apple in how you can modify and customize your phone (could be both a pro and con). I also like being able to use the Amazon App Store, where you can get a free download each day.Overall impressions:For me personally, the iPhone 5s is the way to go.

Huge improvement over iPhone", "Author": "PSB", "ReviewID": "R1CKC5H8PKBEL3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the Galaxy S4, Samsung clinches its goal of global smartphone domination. The supercharged Android 4.2 Jelly Bean device may look like a toy compared with the stunning HTC One and the dapper iPhone 5 . But taken together, its blazing quad-core processor, colorful 5-inch HD screen, sharp-shooting 13-megapixel camera, and mile-high stack of software extras make the Galaxy S4 the most powerful super phone anywhere in the world.What does the Galaxy S4 have? A better question is: what doesn't it have? There's the 1080p screen, zippy processing speeds that are ideal for gaming , and an IR blaster that can control your TV. Then there's the parade of camera tricks that cram action shots into one scene, use both front and back cameras, and film a video in slow-mo. The GS4 can harness your eyeballs to pause video, and it can answer a phone call with the wave of your hand. Unlike the HTC One and the iPhone 5, it also piles on expandable storage space and a removable battery.It's true: most of the GS4's featurettes aren't essential -- and some aren't even very useful, like the camera's Eraser mode, which I never got to work, a sub par optical reader, and a translation tool that just duplicates what Google Translate already does. While none stands out as a must-have, cannot-possibly-live-without extra, these features do add up to a compelling testament that the Galaxy S4 is more than a step ahead of the pack.So, if you want a lovingly crafted statement phone that barely strays from Android's core offering, then buy the HTC One, which also has double the internal storage for about the same price. But if you're looking for a super phone that surpasses all other handsets on the features front, then you'll find in this deserving all-around flagship a strong mix of extremely competent hardware and inspirational software with very few major drawbacks.The GoodThe Samsung Galaxy S4 has Android 4.2.2, a fantastic camera, a powerful quad-core processor, and software solutions for just about every scenario -- including working as a TV/DVR remote. It's also comfortable in hand and has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot.The BadIts screen is dimmer than competitors', its plastic design gives it a cheaper look than its rivals, and we found the Galaxy S4's power button turned on at undesirable times. Not all camera modes work as promised, and a long list of software features can quickly overwhelm and confuse.The Bottom LineIts laundry list of features require time and effort to truly master, but the Galaxy S4 is the top choice for anyone looking for a big-screen, do-everything smartphone.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "Tina Merced", "ReviewID": "R3HSI8RAOA5RCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loving it!

Family mobile only offers a few gigs of 3G and then goes to 2G the rest of the month but this phone is lightning fast no matter what. Videos load with a quickness. Rarely lose signal. One thing I dislike, which may be my particular phone is glitched, but when making calls, the sensor  doesn't detect if my face is there or not. Unless I turn the sensor off it is black even when I take my face away. Annoying. Also, once in a while my screen flips out and then restarts the phone.

It has an impressive list of hardware specs easily making its way in the top 3. If you saw the release for this device you'll notice how Samsung didn't bring up anything about the hardware components (other than the Super AMOLED screen) and that's because they spent so much time displaying the software that comes on the phone. The phone has some pretty cool tricks but when it comes down to it they are just that, parlor tricks to show off to your friends or family. Granted they are pretty neat in reality most of us aren't going to use the software from day to day.Personally I have had some issues with the phone losing 3g service/wifi and have had to cycle it in airplane mode to make the phone reconnect but its just a minor issue that can easily be dealt with. After a base-band update (which may be needed out of the box) the call quality is wonderful. This phone is quick to load apps and home screen transition is smooth. It was a bit odd getting used to the home button coming from an S2 but I adapted quickly and Id have to say i like it better. Battery life for me is about 8-10 hours a day from what I consider mild usage (75% of that time I'm on 3g)  My biggest issue with this phone is the camera. When you cram so many pixels into such a small space it limits the amount of  light each pixel can take in therefore making the camera horrible in low light condition so pictures look a bit grainy. Most of our current tech can only display about 6 megapixel natively so the only true difference between a good 8MP and the 13MP on this phone are only noticeable during high zoom or if printing at huge sizes.Anyone purchasing this phone for use on an MVNO keep in mind that you will need a sim card for 3g service to work properly (yes this applies to CDMA phones as well)At the current date of this review this phones bootloader is locked (Unlocked for some carriers so check before buying) therefore no custom roms are available unless using an app called safestrap (in which selection is very limited)", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "The NFC signal is unstable and weak", "Author": "aioi", "ReviewID": "R3OSIQ375V4Q3R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to test our NFC forum type 3 smart tag with our Android app, and found it is so hard to communicate, most of the times failed. you have to touch the tag to a specific spot of the phone to make it work, but still not always work.

SOoooooo! I switched to the galaxy s4! I did a lot of research on this phone which I would highly recommend. There are a few minor problems that I found with the galaxy s4 which you will find listed on some of the websites if you research it, I was already aware of these problems when I got mine.The phone over heats, I live in a place where it's cold so that didn't really bother me but boy did that phone lose all of it's battery quickly, by lunch time I had to turn off my phone so I could still call my parents to get a ride home after practice. So far this has only happened once (today), so I can say very little on this topic.Even without overheating the he battery life isn't that long. I don't use my phone very much during school hours (DUH!) but I found that by the time practice ended I needed to recharge my phone, I've also found sometimes it takes a while for the phone to charge. I would recommend buying a case with an extra battery to help out with that, that's what I did.If you're a huge music person... well... all I have to say is you'll be disappointed with how loud the speaker is, cause it's not very loud, at least not compared to the Focus. Headphones are fine obviously.If you're just now switching to an Android like I did, have patience it take a little while to figure it out, but honestly the OS is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, even though old habits die hard hahaha I can almost promise you though that at first you are going to be completely lost and are gonna be asking yourself how you got to a certain window hahaOkay now for some positiveness!The camera is amazing!The images on the screen seam like they are gonna pop out, it's almost like your holding miniature actors in your hand while they do their thing!The app selection is amazing and don't be worried about using Google Play, it's brilliant and fast!You'll love the small little details that samsung put into that phone, but I'm not gonna give those away hehethey have a lot of features that you can use that are fun to use. I havent used all of that fancy eye stuff it has because well... I just didn't have a need for it.For you music people out there the music library is kinda really awesome and I love it, it's completely easy to use.I cant think of anything I was worrying about with phone before I got it that I can help you guys out with, I just know that I'm completely satisfied and happy with this phone and I'm pretty sure you will too! :) I was completely worth tht insane amount of money hehe", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!!", "Author": "LILIA", "ReviewID": "RFS8H148UOC8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply enjoyed.

Samsung surpassed iPhones back with the S2, but admittedly they fell just short in regards of being reliable and as usable. The S4 is the first Android phone I have used that seems to be the complete package.Gestures: The gestures seem gimmicky and I haven't yet used them much but I do enjoy that it detects my eyes because I read on my phone for long periods of time and can forget about whether the screen will go off.Camera: I love the camera, it works great much like the S3 but obviously a bit better. The only downfall is that the gallery app on this phone seems to be buggy compared to past versions, so hopefully that is pending an update.Device Feel: The S4 fits much more comfortably in my hands than previous Samsung or iPhone models. It has a squared off edge so it rests in your hand better without accidentally hitting the soft keys.The way I use it is with a T-mobile month to month plan and I seem to have much better coverage and network speed than I had with the S3. I have yet to test it Internationally.There is almost no comparison to the reliability and speed of this phone. I have had it crash after doing some serious application downloading and testing but it resets and is back to normal far faster than the screen-of-death freeze I had on previous phones.I've spent a lot of time researching this phone and others and I am very happy with my S4.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Saulo Wanderley", "ReviewID": "R1DCXZ92A6JTEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really recommend the phone and the seller, the phone is just amazing, does anything you could expect a phone does. the phone got here 2/3 days after i bought it!", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "FAKE", "Author": "Wangoo", "ReviewID": "RVZ7DWEHIV9VC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is not the authentic Samsung Galaxy S4.

Shortly after the S4 was released I decided to give android a shot. I had been a loyal IPhone customer, but the big beautiful screen was enough for me to take a gamble, and now I am paying for it.After about 1 month of use, somehow the phone developed an internal crack on the LCD. The phone had never been dropped, never had my 7 year old and my 3 year old play with it (side note: all of my IPhone have been thoroughly slobber/drop/sat on/thrown down stairs tested). There is no reasonable explanation for the internal, not external, screen to crack. But there it was, a tiny crack in the top right of the screen.Distressed I immediately ran to the store I bought the phone from. The girl at the store proceeds to tell me they see this ALL THE TIME. That she has seen someone that, while removing the 4S from the case, somehow managed to crack the internal LCD, just by removing it from the case. Basically that you just always have to be really careful and never put any kind of pressure anywhere on the phone. Wow, something that most people keep in their pocket and the store is telling me you can't ever put any pressure on the phone. She then tells me that she can't help me because even though it's an internal crack, they will still claim that it is damage and it won't be covered under warranty.I moved on to Samsung. After having the store switch my phone account back to my IPhone 4s, slobber, and everything, I called Samsung. I explained my problem to the girl and she said she can't help me, but that she would have someone call me back within 24 hours........25 hours later I called Samsung back. Needless to say I was annoyed. That fact that Samsung didn't even bother calling me back made me think they must be having major issues with their phones.  I asked the girl about this and she simply apologized, but couldn't explain why I hadn't been called back.  I again explained my situation to the girl on the phone. Her name was Octavia. Octavia explained to me that if the problem was in fact internal then Samsung would fix it for free. I was ecstatic. She emailed me a shipping label to send my phone in. (The email had the wrong address...sigh...I called back and talked to someone else, and he sent me the correct address.)I immediately sent the phone off to be fixed by Samsung.  After over a week Samsung calls me back to tell me that they can fix it, but it will cost me $200.00. I asked what they found and they said the LCD was broken. I asked so the \"internal\" LCD. They said yes. I asked about what Octavia had said about fixing any internal problems for free, they said that doesn't include the LCD............so basically. I told that guy he needed to find someone to explain how I go from anything internal will be fixed for free to now that we have your phone and have wasted over a week; we want to charge you another 200.00 for your plastic phone.I am currently waiting for someone else from Samsung to call me back. I am going to go out on a limb and say I am going to have to call them back. The bottom line is that the S4 is a terribly plastic design. Maybe the active is better, but I am thinking they probably made the active once they realized how incredibly fragile their standard design was.Avoid the S4 at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best phone in 2nd Q of 2013", "Author": "Andy P.
