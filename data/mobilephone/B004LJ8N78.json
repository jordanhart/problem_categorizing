{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome (and inexpensive) phone and plan(s)", "Author": "ajpd \"ajpd\"", "ReviewID": "R2MIRO2JEYWQXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to abandon my ATT family plan in favor of letting my youngest daughter get on it and enjoy the free family minutes and unlimited texting, etc., which I don't use so much (already had 5 lines and they won't let me add another one). So, I was looking for the cheapest alternative to getting a 6th line, at least comparable to what I would have paid for the 6th line on ATT. I looked all over and all the individual plans where $40+ or so, without including texting. Then I came across the Virgin Mobile $25 unlimited data, text, web + 300 minutes and it seemed that it would fit the bill.I got the phone on sale for $105 and it is just the best phone I have ever had, although I have not activated it yet (more on this later), at an awesome price. Why haven't I activated it yet? Well, it turns out, this android phone lets you install all kind of apps from the android market via wifi without activating the phone, you can pop in an 8Gb, 16Gb or 32Gb SDHC card and use this as a pretty awesome (and cheap) ipod/iphone substitute. I have installed apps for watching TV shows, read news (USA Today, NYTime, Bloomberg, etc), Pandora radio (sound through the speaker is very full for such a tiny device), GPS navigation/maps, calculators, MS Office documents viewer, a few games, GasBuddy to find cheap gas locally (pretty handy these days), etc. All FREE from the Android market. But, BY FAR, the best applications I installed are Google Voice, which together with SIPDroid (after signing up for a free GoogleVoice account and a free PBXes.org account) allows me to link them together and configure the phone to use VOIP to make my calls through the internet instead of using the limited 300 minutes I would get if I signed up with Virgin Mobile for $25/month, I can also use it to do unlimited free texting through my Google voice number.I wanted to do this to make sure I did not go over the 300 minutes and start racking up a huge bill with VM once I activated the phone, but as it turns out, this has worked out so well that I am still undecided as to weather I will need to activate the phone and sign up for the monthly service. Granted, I can only make/receive calls when I am within WIFI range, but, WIFI is so prevalent these days. Many of the establishments a person does business with have free internet access for their customers: Starbucks, Dennys, Mcdonalds, Barnes&nobles;, Homedepots, Panera bread, Hooters, highway rest stops, libraries, Krogers, Quiznos, Schlotzsky, FedEx offices, Hotels... the list goes on and on. I also installed a WIFI Analyzer App which shows if there is a free/open WIFI within range and its signal strength. You can get a nice directory of wifi spots in your area here-> [...] which of course does not list all the available ones.What happens when I'm outside WIFI range? Well, of course I can not make calls, inbound calls go to my GoogleVoice voice mail and as soon as I get into WIFI range and connect, my inbound text messages get delivered and/or I get a notification of a missed call which I can check right away. Obviously not something I would want to use as a business phone, but for personal use when you do not need to be available 24X7 this works great! You also get a great excuse when you don't want to answer someone, later you can say... \"Sorry, I was not in WIFI zone...\", you can even put that in your answering message. This setup would be great for students who live on campus where they have free access to the campus WIFI network (many of them provide free open WIFI all over campus). All these for $0 a month plus the cost of the phone.If you feel you need capability to make calls from anywhere in case of emergencies, or for 24X7 availability, then just activate the phone and pay the $25/month. You would get many other benefits which would make this device a very capable business phone. I've read that once activated, you can install an app to make the phone a WIFI hub for up to 4 or 5 devices (supposedly there is an app for that, :-) pun intended, in the android market). This would provide internet service to your WIFI based laptop anywhere. I will investigate this more if/when I activate the phone. I have to admit, it would be fun to be able to go on trips and have internet in the car for my kids ipod touches or laptops while we are on the road. The more they can entertain themselves, the less \"are we there yet?, are we there yet?\" questions we will get... :-)Summarizing, if you activate the phone, you get unlimited texting, phone web browsing, tv watching, internet radio, etc. + unlimited internet based calls using the provided unlimited data service + internet for your computer/ipod touches anytime/anywhere. All these for $25/month? Sweeeet! I don't think any carrier can beat that, the closer unlimited everything plan is cricket for $55/month for an android or blackberry phone. ATT, Verizon, etc? $70 and up... Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint 3G network, so, it's coverage (at least here in Houston) is pretty good.I hope you find this useful.Enjoy!Nov. 23th. 2011 - I finally activated the phone this summer which I spent away from the family working up North and they wanted 24X7 access... (great to be loved so much!). It is now even better. I have an app that shows how many minutes are left and when I'm getting close to using the 300 minutes, I can dial out using the internet and google voice through the data service from anywhere (where there is 3G signal). Came in handy to have Pandora on the phone when my car radio stopped working and it's great to be able to do everything I used to do only within WIFI range now everywhere. GPS worked great while I was traveling through the North East, except when cruising through the Adirondacks (no 3G service out in the sticks :-) ).Virgin has raised the price of the plan to $35 a month for newcomers, (previous users are grandfathered in at the $25 rate) but even at $35, it still the best deal around as far as I know. Finally, Target has the phone on sale for $50 for the next two days...", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone with cheap, solid, feature-rich service", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R11OJUO06KP81R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being a T-Mobile customer for 8 years I finally dumped them when I found the phone and plan I'd been waiting for: the Android 2.2, LG Optimus V with the Beyond Talk plan.The Phone:An Android 2.2 operating system powers the LG Optimus V (V stands for Virgin... the S is Sprint's phone, but both share the Sprint mobile network) and allows for zippy web surfing via the 3G network.  Apps open quickly and transitions from one thing to another are smooth. The processor seems up to multitasking and I had no problem downloading apps and emailing at the same time.The body of the phone is comfortable to hold with a slightly rubberized feel, and the screen is bright and clear.  I did note the back cover of the phone is a tad flimsy, so be careful pulling it off and on to put in the battery.  Bear in mind I'm used to a Nokia E71 phone, which has a metal back, so that may just be something that bothered me and won't phase anyone else about this phone.  The four navigation keys on the front of the phone are sturdy and responsive.The touchscreen doesn't seem to respond as easily as my iTouch does, but then again, it may be me and the way I was gingerly giving it an initial once over.  I have texted and emailed using Swype (a cool technology included on this phone that basically allows you the ability to move your finger over a keyboard and have it intuitively guess at what you're trying to type without you lifting your finger) on this phone, and it works well. I'm pretty slow at it, but practice will undoubtedly help.The camera is a 3.2mp without a flash.  I'm not overly impressed with the quality of the photos I've taken, but I don't use my phone-cam as my primary camera anyway.  You can also take video with this phone.Charging this phone can be done by two methods: USB or travel adapter.  The travel adapter (included in the package along with the USB to phone cord) attaches to the USB end of the cord that attaches to the base of the phone.  You can charge your phone via either AC or USB - AC seemed to do it a tad faster, but be prepared to have a full recharge take 1 to 2hrs.This takes us to the downside of this phone: the battery life.  If you are downloading or surfing the web, this phone sucks down the juice.  There is a free app called Juice Defender, which will prolong your battery life - I highly recommend it along with Hotspot Widget, which allows you to use Hotspots for Wi-fi.  Talk time on the battery is estimated at 6hrs, with up to 3 days of standby time.  This would only work if you never checked the web, emailed, texted or played with apps!The phone weighs 4.69 ounces and is a tad thick, but not much more than an iPhone with a hard case on it.  It ships with a 2GB micro SD card in it, but I recommend picking up at least an 8GB card or larger to replace it.  Adding apps will quickly diminish the 2GB.No flash player is yet available for this phone - or so I've heard, thus 'flash' doesn't play on it.  You can view YouTube videos and there are several TV apps, so not really an issue for me yet and probably something that will be fixed with firmware in the future.I suggest purchasing a case to protect it, as none is included in the phone package.  LG Optimus S and T cases will work with this phone. Deals with a case, charger, screen protector, etc... like this: LG Optimus S LS670 Full Diamond Bling Black Zebra Skin Hard Case Snap on Cover Phone Protector Sleeve + Mirror LCD Screen Guard Film w/Cleaning Cloth + Free Biodegradable Screen wipe are available on Amazon.The Beyond Talk Plans:No deal out there comes close to this one.  Yes, the phone is an initial chunk of change, but it's an Android phone that will offer excellent call quality on the Sprint network and data at 3G speeds - unlimited data, text and email - for $25 a month with 300 anytime minutes.  GREAT deal!  A bump up for $40 a month gives you 1200 anytime minutes a month and unlimited data, text and email, or for $60 a month you get unlimited everything.  NO CONTRACT.  You can pay via gift cards you purchase with cash, or have a debit or credit card on file with Virgin Mobile.  You can choose to have them take the plan fee out each month, or you can tell them you'll do it yourself via the online payment section.  Really, really easy and no taxes or hidden fees.  If you go over your minutes it's an additional 10 cents a minute, and minutes don't rollover to the next month.Virgin Mobile coverage maps are available on their website.  Check it with your address to see coverage in your area prior to buying the phone.  There's a way to check voice coverage and then click over to data coverage.'Porting' Your Number (Keeping Your Old Number):If you want to keep your same cellphone number (the one used by another carrier) you need to keep these things in mind.1. You have to be in the same area code to do it.2. You cannot cancel your previous service prior to calling Virgin Mobile to set up service.3. You cannot activate your LG Optimus V on Virgin Mobile's website, you must call them to tell them you want the same number.4. You need to have your old number, account number for the other provider, and a bit of time (up to 72hrs, although it took VM only 1hr to port my number...) to switch the old number to your new phone.5. You must have your LG Optimus V charged to be able to receive a text letting you know the number has been switched and your old service has been cancelled.6. Calling your old provider to make sure your service has been cancelled and to pay off any lingering debt with them is advised.Call to 'activate' your Virgin Mobile service after the number has been ported to your new phone.  They will ask you how you are paying for your service and have you do a test call.If you don't have an old number, you can either call Virgin Mobile to activate the phone or do it on their website.The LG Optimus V phone is my first android smartphone and so far, I'm very impressed. GPS, email, web, checking in on eBay and Amazon... all very exciting and something I thought I'd never be able to afford as I couldn't justify spending $70 a month for it with T-Mobile or ATT.In a few months the purchase of this phone will pay for itself and with no contract I'm sure I'll feel good about having the option to change, even if I never do.  If you don't want to be under contract, but want to enjoy the perks of new technology at a reasonable price per month - get this phone and the Beyond Talk plan. Heck, get them for the entire family!  You won't regret the purchase.UPDATE: March 13, 2011Found several FREE apps in the 'Market' of note.1. ShopSavy: uses scanner technology to scan items in the store and then give you the best price for that item online or locally.  Works very well!2. GasBuddy: gives you the current prices on fuel at different grades.  Type in a zip code or name of a place to get the listings.  You can also add a price as you see it to assist others using the app.3. Speed Test : gives you the current speeds of your internet upload and download.  Noted that my wifi is much, much faster than the 3G network, thus when home I switch my settings from mobile to wifi.4. Amazon Kindle: read all content on your Kindle, also on your phone.5. Radar Now: shows current weather maps as shown on your TV weather report (satellite maps) in real time, via GPS.6. HP Photo Print: found my home network printers and printed photos taken on my phone after uploading to the printer via this app.  Also can use Photoshop Express (also free) to tweak the photo prior to printing.7. SilentBoot: once downloaded an on, this allows you to turn your phone on and off without any noise.8. AVG free antivirus: still a good idea to run an antivirus whether it's on your PC or phone.9. Google Sky: really fun app that shows you the night sky (stars, constellations) and moves with you according to GPS location... play with this one!10. Quick Settings: very easy way to turn on and off wifi/gps/mobile... and a host of other things like uninstalling apps you no longer want.11. Zedge: lots n' lots of wallpapers and ringtones for free.12. Memory Booster lite: frees up unused memory to use by the processor.13. JuiceDefender: runs in the background to save your battery from draining too quickly.14. World Newspapers: just like the title implies, access to worldwide news via newspapers, but also magazines, webnews, social networking, etc... fun to browse and in many, many languages.15. Tune In Radio: allows you to pick up radio stations and podcasts by state. The 3.5mm headset jack (standard - like on iPods and other MP3 players) is great and this app plus your music library on a SD card means you can choose to leave your music player at home as it's all on your phone!Battery drops quickly with a lot of app use, but without it the phone holds a good charge for several days.  I simply keep topping the battery up whenever I'm home and near the charger. The manual says not to let the battery be completely discharged.Also on the subject of 'battery': The battery also is somewhat loose in my phone.  Not sure if that's all Optimus V's or just mine.  Sometimes my screen goes black and it's a loose battery.  A small bit of tape fixed the problem and is unseen under the back cover of the phone.The Voice Recognition software on this phone seems to be fabulous!  Both voice dialing and voice input for texting (instead of typing) seem to work great for me.  One suggestion for texting via voice: make your sentences short.  This seems to give me the most accurate input.Overall I love this phone and look forward to using it and Virgin Mobile for a long time!  Call clarity is great and so far the Android Experience is all I would have wished it to be.  I've watched lots of YouTube videos, emailed, msg'd, all with great ease.  The calls have been clear on both the sending and receiving end, and I've yet to find an area where I have not had service.  That's a pretty big deal considering I don't live in a major metropolitan area.  Great find, and happily discovering new things I like about the phone every day.UPDATE: 9/27/11Phone continues to give great service, but occasionally freezes when trying to dial.  I end up taking the battery out and reseating it, which seems to solve the problem. Did I mention you can't turn the phone off either? I'm considering a new battery for it...can get it off of Amazon for about $13. Anker 1600mAh Li-ion Battery for LG Optimus V VM670 (Virgin), LG Optimus S LS670(Sprint), Optimus One P500, Optimus T, Optimus U, Optimus C LW690, Optimus M MS690 Fits LGIP-400N - WhiteService for the phone has gone up in price from $25 a mo to $35 a mo for 300 minutes with unlimited talk and text.  Fortunately for me, as I got in with the $25 plan, my price DID NOT go up.  Thought that was darned nice of Virgin Mobile!  Hope it lasts.UPDATE: 1/25/12Received a text from Virgin Mobile today informing me that Internet speeds would be reduced for Beyond Talk customers if they go over 2.5GB of useage per month.  The Internet speeds for 3G with Virgin Mobile have been spotty lately, which makes me wonder if that's part of a transition to this new policy.  Time will tell if I will stay with Virgin Mobile or switch to something else. I don't use much data, but it bums me out that Virgin Mobile is going the way of several other providers and doing this now.  The phone is still a good one, and the plan is good for the money, but definitely not for those who don't want to wait too long for Facebook to load!UPDATE: 8/29/12Over the past two months or so the LG Optimus V has been acting fussy. The touchscreen became less responsive, sometimes the phone wouldn't turn off, and hanging up from a call became impossible without taking out the battery!  I have been very gentle with the phone and it's only been dropped twice, while wearing an Otterbox case.  3G speeds are excellent in the right location, but terrible in others.  I don't blame the phone for that one.I read a bunch of phone reviews and decided that for my budget, Virgin Mobile is still the best deal out there next to Tracfone which has such a poor phone offering I can't convince myself to jump ship.  Today I purchased the HTC One V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) and can activate it with my current number online, once I log in to my Virgin Mobile account.  I chose the One over the HTC EVO V 4G Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) because the EVO is $100 more and I don't have 4G coverage in my area, so paying for that option when I can't use it seemed wrong for me.I will update again when I activate (I'm waiting for Amazon to ship my OtterBox 77-20718 Commuter Series Hybrid Case for HTC One V - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black before I do so.  I'm optimistic that the LG issues will not be present on the HTC phone, and since the LG Optimus V has been replaced in the line-up with the LG Optimus Elite Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) which gets so-so reviews, I feel good about this new purchase.I'll also let you know if a phone call to Virgin Mobile won't help me keep my grandfathered in $25 a month with the new phone.  Fingers crossed!UPDATE: 12/2712Been using the HTC One V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) for about 4 months now - had to upgrade to $35 plan to get it to work - and I love it!  It's a huge step up from the LG Optimus in both speed and features.  The LG Optimus was good and I'm glad I bought it initially, but the HTC One V is great - and what I would recommend over this phone at this time for 3G users on Virgin Mobile's network.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus V - Virgin Mobile", "Author": "J. Corbett", "ReviewID": "R1CFOEJH3P2QAE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have never had a cell phone plan, and I don't plan on having one any time soon.  When I first started using cell phones, the curse of prepaid services were the phones.  Companies like Net10 had fantastic deals, but the phones were always cheap and disposable, which of course is the great part about prepaid service.  I'm not stuck with a phone for two years and if I need one, I'm not worrying about the price.Another great part about prepaid service is that I will never have to speak with a representative.  Virgin Mobile is an easy set up and upon start up, the phone was quick to activate and start my service.  This two reasons are high on my list for why prepaid trumps contract phone plans.When this phone was announced, I was a bit skeptical.  I was worried that it would be a watered down version of the LG Optimus S, but I am happy to report that it is essentially the same device.  The following will mention the look, feel, and speed of the device.The touch screen: Nimble! Going from screen to screen is fluid, transitions are visible.  For every single touch and swipe, the device is right there with you.  There is no lag to be found.  However, there are times when I'm playing Angry Birds, and there is considerable lag.  It usually happens for the first thirty seconds of the game.Screen resolution: High quality but with the plastic front, it cheapens the device.  However, I am not complaining.  Zooming in and out on a webpage, you might notice that it's a little pixelated when you get close to the text.3G capabilities: Testing this against my friend's iPhone, it's very fast.  I was incredibly surprised by the responsiveness and how quick I could go from webpage to webpage.  But, I will say that there are times there is absolutely no service.  After looking through forums, one easy way to fix this is by activating the phone again.  I did this once, and it helped tremendously.App store: Although it's not as big as Apple's app store, it has everything one would need.  The great thing about Android is that if there's something you don't like, you can change it.  Widgets are absolutely one of the best features about Android's app store.  You can even change the web browser if you don't like it!This phone does not support Flash, so don't be disappointed.Navigation: A dream.  It works better than my Garmin, the voice is loud and concise.  I will say that after plugging it into my auxillary connector that it does sound a little muffled.  But I'm not disappointed at all.  The maps are amazing.  There was one time the directions were a little funky and another that it was taking a while to acquire satellite.Camera quality: I have to say, the quality of the camera is amazing.  With auto focus, it's great.  And with the camera apps, you can create some great effects.Overall, this phone is a great value.  I talk a lot, so I use the unlimited everything plan for $60.00.  It's not a bad deal considering I would be paying well over $100.00 anywhere else.There are a lot of other prepaid services you might want to consider if you want to go prepaid.  If you aren't someone who talks a lot and just need a phone, Net10 is the perfect service.  But if you do talk a lot and browse the internet, then services like Boost Mobile, AT&T; GoPhone, Straight Talk, and Virgin Mobile are great alternatives to the high cost of contracts.The problem with prepaid still?  The phones need a lot of work, but this is the first I've seen to make a huge step toward a great future with prepaid service.Update:I love this phone. It has efficiently replaced my iPod and GPS Navigator.  Put in a 16gb micro sd card, and you're set.  Apps like Double Twist make music listening a great experience (and for $4.99, you can sync your music wirelessly, listen to radio stations, AND podcasts)If your car as an auxillary connector or even a tape adapter, connect your phone, and you can listen to Navigation WHILE listening to music.  I know it's a weird thing to obsess about, but I always thought it was one or the other.  Directions are precise, so I'm not constantly looking at my phone wondering where I am.Streaming on Pandora and NPR is great.  However, after a few hours, it completely stops and you have to get back into the app.  It's not terrible, but I like to listen while I'm at work.The Android App Market has everything you're looking for as long as you know how to search.  I would recommend joining forums, because that's how I found out about different apps.  One I love in particular is the WiFi Hotspot widget.  With a simple click, you can connect your laptop and computer to the phone's 3g network.  Other apps like Car Home allow you to travel and easily find navigation, music, and manage what apps you need on the go.Depending on where I am, Youtube can lag a little.  I expected this.  But for the price and the fact that I have completely replaced a few gadgets I own, this is totally worth it.FINAL UPDATE:I have had this phone for five months, and I thought I would give my final impressions of the device.First off, the battery life isn't amazing, but I've found that turning off data while I don't use it is really helpful.  The phone lasts for days.  If I need to check something online, I quickly go into my settings, turn it on, and check what I need to check.  Before I started doing that, I realized that the phone would last MAYBE six or seven hours.Web browsing has actually gotten a lot better.  I was a little worried after three months in.  There were times I couldn't get on a web page at all, but I feel that the problem has been resolved.GPS is still reliable and better than my Garmin.I actually no longer use this phone as an mp3 player.  Even with Double Tap, I felt that it lacked organization.I have experienced a few dropped calls.  One time in particular, I was calling a friend, and our call was dropped four or five times within the hour.  I'm not sure if it was his phone or mine, but it had never happened before, and it hasn't happened since.This phone is really your best bet if you're on a budget yet want to experience a midrange smart phone.  Does it have the capabilities of an iPhone or Droid?  It's actually pretty close and for the price, I can't complain.  $60.00 a month for unlimited everything and a quality phone is fantastic.  If I decide I never want to see this phone or this company again, I'm not forced to pay a fee for having a choice.  I can easily go online and cancel my services, and I'm not waiting on the phone to speak to a representative.  In the five years I've used prepaid phones, I've never had to speak to one person regarding my phone, terms of service, etc.  That alone is worth the price in saved time and frustration.A DEAD PHONE:So, my phone died after days of being unable to hold a charge.  I'm not sure what the problem was.  I had to keep it connected at all times, or it wouldn't turn on.  Then even while it was connected, it just died.  It's a shame, because I truly loved the phone and was sold on Android until I experienced numerous problems with the device.  Don't get me wrong.  I love Android and their innovation.  However, I seem to notice that while their phones are amazing devices at first, they cannot stand the test of time.  I was looking forward to keeping this phone for quite a while.Internet seemed to be incredibly slow as well as time progressed.  I generally like to use data if I'm lost or need to check my e-mail.  I found that it was faster finding someone polite enough to give me directions or just wait to go home.  This could just be a defect on my phone, but my raving reviews about it in the beginning are a thing of the past.This phone is great for someone just getting into the smart phone world.  That person was me.  I'm not sure if my demands or wants got higher, but I am switching over to a contract phone.  Yes.  Even after all of my talk about how much I hated contracts.  But if you look at it, you're paying either way.  Do I want to spend money on a new phone every few months with spotty service?  While I can't predict whether or not I will be left with a lemon is up to fate.

The performance of the phone is zippy, and it actually performed faster than the Samsung Intercept, which is also from Virgin Mobile, and has a faster processor. Also, the screen is much clearer and colorful than the screen on the Intercept. It's glass covered instead of plastic, unlike the Intercept.  The phone looks great, it seems to be built very well (especially considering the low price), and it looks like a more expensive phone.  Most apps on the Marketplace work, and there are some that really add to this handset's functionality.  The camera is great, takes awesome images for a 3MP shooter.

VirginMobile has a plan that can't be beat.  I wish I had switched over sooner!Here are some of the features I like about the LG Optimus V:Voice to text is awesome.You can speak an email or a text or a search on the internet and this phone almost always gets it right.  I never used texting before.  I don't have time, patience or skill to hunt and peck on a tiny keyboard.  Voice to text makes this so easy.  Just punch the microphone button on the keyboard.  I'll say it again, awesome.Use GoogleVoice and GrooVe IP for free minutes.With VirginMobiles Unlimited Text and Data with 300 minutes plan you can place and receive calls without using any minutes.  Set up a google gmail account and add google voice.  It is a really simple process.  Buy GrooVe IP from the Amazon App store for about $5.  Setup takes less than 5 minutes.  When you are near a good wifi connection, GrooVe is exceptionally clear.  You can make calls even in places where you are not able to get cell service.  Forget Sipdroid and all those other difficult apps.  GrooVe is simple to set up, simple to use and it works!Great price for VirginMobile plan.We were paying over $75 per month per phone.  Virgin mobile is cutting that by about half.  $35 per month for 300 minutes and unlimited text and data.  By the way, there are not a bunch of fees on top of that like other carriers.  My total is under $39 with all taxes and fees.Free 60 minutes when you sign up with a kickback code.As you set up your phone, you will burn through some minutes with you voice mail setup and trying it out.  When you activate your phone on the internet you can use a kickback code to get 60 extra minutes for free.  Here is a code you can use:  8TE0VXNQ (note, the 4th character is a zero)Tips:Download the pdf file for the LG Optimus User Guide from the VirginMobile site.  Along with the Basic Guide booklet that ships with it, this will help you get the most out of your new phone.My favorite apps besides GrooVe IP are Amazon Kindle, Gas Buddy, and ShopSavvy.  There are several apps preloaded on the phone.  GoogleMaps is my choice for best.  It gives spoken turn by turn instructions and a street view of the address you are looking for.  This is a lot better than my TomTom.All in all, this is a great phone with a great plan.If my review was helpful, please give it a click below as helpful.

I researched smart phones and was greatly deterred by the plan prices. I love Apple products, but $75 + a month for service is ridiculous. When I discovered VM's deal I was hooked. $25 monthly for unlimited data (text, web, etc.) and 300 minutes talk time. Beat that.Optimus is sleek, fast (Sprint 3G, android 2.2), and crisp in screen resolution. If you MUST have slide out keyboard go with Intercept. But, even then, I preferred using the screen keyboard because it suggests words for you as you type. I found the Intercept to be clunky, heavy, bulky, and a little sluggish. But for $25 a month service I could live with it. Then came Optimus for VM. It's not quite an iPhone, but it's darn close.. and WAY cheaper! Very impressed.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Went from an iPhone 3G to LG Optimus", "Author": "J. Haggard", "ReviewID": "RJIBPLIUZ46UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an apple user since the iPhone 3G came out. Loved that thing and in fact I still do. But over the years it's gotten slower and I'm not ready to re-commit to a 2 year contract. I wanted a smart phone with no contract and a reasonable monthly rate. After a lot of checking I opted for the Virgin Mobile prepaid, and the LG Optimus.From a value standpoint, I purchased this phone for $100 at bestbuy on sale. And the monthly plan is a mere $25 instead of the $50-$90 I was spending on the iphone 3G. You can't beat a $25 a month phone bill for unlimited data, text and 300 minutes. If you need more minutes you can switch to a $40 or $60 plan but for me $25 is enough.The phone itself is pretty darn fast compared to my iPhone 3G. Some people say you can't do angry birds on it, I haven't had any trouble. It does take a minute to load the game, but it's not an unreasonable amount of time.The animations on the phone are smooth and the call quality isn't great but is acceptable.The GPS is incredible. When using Google maps on my iphone (and ipad 3g) I am juust a little blue dot. When running the same app on this phone I'm an arrow and it knows what direction I'm facing, something iOS doesn't do. Plus I am loving Google Goggles and barcode scanner. The camera is decent quality and it's just really well done.The only downside to this phone is Virgin installs some crapware that you can't remove unless you root the device. I'm not going to do that but I will download pro launcher or something that will allow me to hide the extra apps I don't want.Oh and one more con, itunes sync on a mac. Pretty much non-existent. You can use an app called doubletwist and it does an ok job at syncing playlists, but unless your media is in a playlist it won't sync up. I'm still looking for an alternative tool.Overall I am just as happy with this entry level android phone running 2.2 as I was with my iPhone 3g running the latest apple iOS. In fact this phone is able to do MORE then my iphone 3G even after jailbreaking it.And I'm really loving VirginMobiles $25 a month plan, so much in fact that I don't think I would EVER go back to a 2 year contract apple phone with minimum plan price points upwards of $40-$90 or whatever it is these days.Here's a promo code when you sign up with Virgin Mobile, you can get 60 MINUTES FREE by entering RYnDPLOU in the kickbacks box when you activate your phone. Minimum of $20 is required. Note: Enter this code when you active NOT when you buy the phone--UPDATE--I am now using an app called iSyncr to sync my iTunes and Android phone. It does a MUCH better job in my opinion then DoubleTwist because it doesn't make it's own library of music. It instead syncs directly from your itunes library folders. I also paid the $0.99 for the WIFI addon which now lets me sync my music, tv shows, podcasts, etc without being connected to my computer. Now because the battery isn't all that wonderful I leave it plugged in on my nightstand when I sync wireless. But this means now when I go to bed I hit the wifi sync and go to sleep. When I wake up all my latest podcasts, etc are ready to go with me. Pretty nice and works very well!If anyone else has any recommendations please feel free to share!", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "You don't have to pay $80/month to be cool", "Author": "Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R20C1SKXVF8BAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start out by saying that I am, as the four stars above would indicate, very happy with my purchase of this phone.  I would not, however, buy it here. The price here is ridiculous.  I bought this phone yesterday for $90 less than the cheapest price that is available to be shipped by Amazon.  More on that near the end of the review.After holding out with my \"stupid phone\" and scoffing at smartphone users for years, a few months of playing with the iPod Touch 4th Gen that I received for Christmas convinced me that I needed to join the era of modern technology.  It wasn't entirely the desire to be cool that pushed me towards a smartphone.......but come now, who doesn't ALSO want to be cool?As I mentioned, it was the iPod touch that convinced me to join the smartphone revolution.  I live a very unconventional life -- I work from home via the Internet and travel as much as possible (30 countries and the majority of the US states in the past 2.5 years).  I am definitely someone who loves technology (heck.....I earn my living via the Internet and I use my laptop for everything).  However, I was a firm believer that I only needed my phone to make calls......that beyond \"being cool\", a smartphone wouldn't do much for me.  That was until I started playing with applications on my iPod and using FaceTime to talk with my parents (I had previously used Skype on my laptop, but FaceTime is so much clearer).  More and more I found myself wishing that my iPod was a phone that could always connect to the Internet so I could do things like scan bar codes in the store and compare prices with Amazon.  I bought a Virgin Mobile MiFi device so I could connect it to the Internet when I was away from home -- the unlimited plan on that was $40 a month at the time, but now I think it's $50 a month for that MiFi device.  Using that combo convinced me that I wanted an iPhone.  So I checked out Verizon and AT&T.........and; the plans were $75-$85 a month.  So I checked out the Virgin Mobile site........Now, I have to say -- ideally I wanted a GSM phone that I could unlock and then get SIM cards for when I travel.  It's so easy to buy a cheap SIM card and minutes pack in basically every country on Earth other than the US.  So that was pushing me towards AT&T; and T-Mobile even though Verizon has much better service in my area than either.  However, as I mentioned, the plans were $75-$85 a month.......So I went to the Virgin Mobile site out of curiosity.  I was curious about what kinds of phones they had and if there was something Android-based that looked attractive enough to steer me away from an iPhone.  They had two Android-based phones (the Samsung Intercept and this).  The Intercept was running Android 2.1 at the time (though I believe they have since updated to Android 2.2).  This phone was running the brand new Android 2.2 out of the box (no update necessary).  That sounded good to me as one of the main reasons to get a smartphone is to be able to download useful apps that can make life more convenient (and in my case, that can help me find good deals as I am a bargain-hunting addict).  A friend then mentioned Wal-Mart's mobile service (which I had forgotten about).  I checked out their options.  The best phone they had was a Motorla phone (I've never personally been happy with Motorola) that was running Android 1.5!!!!!  As I read reviews, one person after another complained about how they aren't able to download apps because most of the new apps are not compatible with the older version of Android on that phone.  Oh -- and wallyworld charges $214 for the phone!!!!!  CRAZY!  You would clearly be the antithesis of cool with the prepaid wallyworld phone.So I did some web searching on this LG Optimus V and found lots of great reviews.  Many people stated what I have found to be true -- it's a great mid-range phone.  It won't completely knock your socks off (for reasons that I'll get to), but the pros FAR outweigh the cons (which I will also get to).  Furthermore, I found info in plenty of Android forums about current deals and sales on this phone -- all of which have been far better than any price I've seen on something shipped by Amazon (I realize that these are third-party sellers with their own prices -- not Amazon's -- but WOW.  What gougers!)At this point, I should have already mentioned that this phone doesn't even get service where I live.  Virgin Mobile runs on Sprint's network and there is no Sprint service for 25 miles in any direction from my house.  But I travel a lot and I had a back-up plan for that with Skype.So the biggest \"pro\" on this phone is clearly the plan price.  At $25 per month for UNLIMITED Internet access and text messaging, it's an absolute no-brainer to go with Virgin's service.  My old Virgin Mi-Fi Internet HotSpot was double that price for just Internet!!  (By the way.....there are ways to do the same thing with this phone as long as you're reasonable with it).  Some people may be put off by only having 300 minutes of talk time per month -- however, the unlimited Internet makes that a moot point.  I pay $3 per month for unlimited calling to the US and Canada through Skype already (I use it often when I travel outside of the US to call friends and family back home).  You can install the Skype app on this phone and when you go to dial out using the dialpad, it gives you the option to use the phone dialer or Skype -- so you can just use Skype all the time and eliminate the need for any of the minutes!!  I will say that call quality occasionally suffers a bit using Skype if you don't have a strong connection -- so then the phone dialer is my backup in the rare chance that happens.  Since I just got the phone, I've been mixing up my use a bit......and 3 weeks into my service, I have used about 24 actual phone minutes -- the rest has been Skype.  So for $28 a month, I have a phone with unlimited calling, unlimited text messaging, AND unlimited Internet.  By contrast, I could have paid $75-$85 a month on a major carrier for a service that would have capped my Internet usage and capped my minutes.  At a difference of $45/month, we are talking about saving $540 a year over a major carrier (and that's a low estimate)!!!!!!!!  I wanted a GSM phone -- but with the $540 that I will save this year, I think I can just buy a cheap phone in EVERY COUNTRY I VISIT over the next year if I want one badly enough.  Game, set, match Virgin Mobile on plan price.  When your friends get angry about being locked into a contract that is 3 times the price for a phone that is only about 10% cooler than yours, they may not publicly agree with how cool your Virgin Mobile phone is.  But rest assured that they are going to envy you behind closed doors.  Who doesn't want to be envied?  Cool.Next up is service.  As I mentioned before, I do not get cell service where I live.  However, the phone still connects to Wi-Fi, so you can connect it to your home network and use it just as a regular phone.  It accepts incoming calls to my Skype number and makes outgoing calls with no problem.  In fact, I haven't even given my friends and family my \"official\" phone number -- just my Skype number to call on.  So it works just the same as a phone in my house.  The only inconvenience I hit is when I'm out and about in my immediate area.  For me this is not a big problem because I work from home.  Generally, when I leave the house, it's to go somewhere outside of that 25 mile radius where I do have service.  Now I won't lie -- Sprint's network just isn't as big as the others.  I live in upstate New York and the service is fine along major highways but terrible anywhere in the countryside.  That kind of stinks.  But if I lived in any kind of actual city, it wouldn't be a problem.  I've gotten 3G speeds as fast as I think anybody could want despite what some people say about speed.  I've been very pleasantly surprised.  Service gets sketchy when you get too deep into buildings in big cities -- but I think that's pretty common for everyone.  Maybe this phone gets touchy sooner.  I'm not a doctor or emergency responder of any sort, so this isn't a gamebreaker for me.  If it doesn't work fantastically well somewhere, my friends can leave a message and I'll call them back.  Maybe that's not acceptable for you -- or at least it has to be less cool than other phones.  So this phone loses a bit here perhaps depending upon how picky you are.As for the phone itself, I'd say that it is solidly mid-range.  I can't lie and say that I like it more than my iPod.  The truth is that I find the touchscreen more responsive and easier to read/see on the iPod (and therefore most likely on the iPhone) than on this LG Optimus V.  I find that I can scroll and zoom in and out significantly easier on my iPod.  However, that said, it's not HARD to do these things on the Optimus -- it just isn't the best.  It's certainly acceptable and decent and when I consider the $540 per year that I'm saving, I don't lose ANY sleep over this.  Like I said -- it's mid-range.  You're not going to use this phone and think it's the hottest phone you've ever imagined.  It's not.  But when your friends are talking about the cost of their plans and you're streaming away and texting away and downloading apps and it's only costing you $25 a month, I think you'll be just as OK as I am that their phones may be marginally cooler.  I must admit that I'm not much of a mobile-device gamer.  I can't comment on the gamability of this phone other than to say that I've downloaded a couple of games and they've been fine.  I'm more interested in deal-hunting and convenience (using things like GPS check-in services and barcode scanners) than I am in pure entertainment.  So if you're a heavy gamer, look to someone else's review.The on-screen keyboard is a bit of a pain to use.  I definitely commit a LOT more typos and can't type as fast as I can on my iPod.  HOWEVER, SWYPE IS AMAZING!!!!  I'm so happy that I took a minute to try the swype tutorial.  Thanks to the swype feature (which lets you swipe your finger across the keyboard from letter to letter and then figures out your words), I can now \"swype\" an email faster than I could ever type it on a mobile device.  It is SO convenient.  I don't care what phone you buy -- make sure it has that feature.  Wow.  SO cool.Now, as for price........it depends how hard you want to work for it.  This week, this phone can be had direct from the carrier as well as from most major retailers for $149.99 (or sixty bucks cheaper than the price here).  It is also on sale for the same price from the shack.  However, the best deal possible is through using FourSquare.  At almost any Shack, you can get 20% off by checking in on FourSquare for the first time at the Shack.  What I did was buy this phone at the Shack and then I activated it and downloaded the FourSquare app.  I then went and checked in one time somewhere else and then went directly to check in at the Shack and got a 20% off discount and I bought the phone again (for $120).  I'm returning the first phone.  If you know someone who already has a smartphone, you can do this is one trip by bringing them along to check in on FourSquare.  Of course, you don't need to use your real name and info.....I signed up for FourSquare with a name and info that will protect my identity as I don't like everyone in the world to know where I am all the time.  So anyway.....the phone is on sale at the Shack this week and the twenty percent discount is good through the end of this month.  I've read some stories about people having trouble getting the discount because store employees don't know about it, but I did it at a store in Philadelphia yesterday without any problem.  So.....I got it for ninety bucks less than the cheapest price available to be shipped directly via Amazon......and that's with a 30-day in-store return policy still.  Normally, I hate the Shack......I can't remember the last time I bought something there.....but this is a steal of a deal.  With the ninety bones you save by buying it elsewhere, you've got almost 4 months of service covered.Oh -- and this phone's MicroSD storage slot makes it instantly expandable up to 32GB. While 8GB or 16GB is probably plenty for most folks......even if you have the need to expand this to 32GB (those cards are a bit pricey), you can still have a phone that can hold as much music and as many apps as you could reasonable want in a mobile device for around $170.  If the 2GB included is enough, then you've got it for $120......and there are sufficient options in between.  All that makes this phone an easy purchase for me.Lastly, the battery life DOES suck just as everyone says it does.  I use TaskKiller and I still have trouble getting through the whole day on a charge.  Also, it does take a lot more time to fully charge than my iPod does.  However, with a wall/USB charger included and a USB car charger available on Amazon for $6 or less, it's okie dokie for me.  Again......not fantastic.  I would totally buy an extra battery or two (less than $15 from your favorite online auction site) if that was a big issue for me.  Again, the difference in plan price more than makes up for that in my mind.  But if battery life is important for you, buy spares or look elsewhere.  The battery life has to be the biggest downfall on this thing.The other major con for me is no front-facing camera.  I wish I could video conference with my phone.  It's lame that they left that feature out of this phone.  But if this were a dealbreaker for me, I'd use an app to make the phone a hotspot and FaceTime with my iPod.So overall, I think this is absolute bang for the buck.  At a hundred twenty bucks, it's cheaper than the Mi-Fi device out of the box while having more functionality and cheaper plans.  If you really want more minutes rather than using Skype, you can get 1200 minutes for $40 or unlimited minutes for like $60 or something (though, as I said, I use Skype and get those unlimited minutes for $3 more a month).  I didn't even mention the major pro of not having a contract......I can always decide whether or not I really need it this month.  If I'm going to be home a lot for a week or two at the beginning of the month, I just won't pay for the service again until I'm going to go out.  Wow.  MUCH better than being locked into a 1 or 2 year contract.  I'm not sure that any of the \"uncool\" features of this phone are even very relevant for most folks.  In fact, I think most people will be talking this up to their friends the same way that I have been -- to the same jealous stares when I explain how I'm getting more or less the same thing they are for a LOT less.  Do yourself a favor and buy this phone if you're thinking about it.  I think you'll be just as happy as I am.****************Edit*****************I mentioned in the review that I pay $3/month for Skype and one of the comments asked if it isn't more money for an online number.  I forgot about that -- I do pay more for that.  As you can see in the comments section, I pay $2.50 per month for unlimited calling and $2.50 per month for the online phone number (I pay for 12 months and maximize the discount).  So my grand total unlimited unlimited plan comes out to $30 a month.  Thanks!**************End Edit********************", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you're trying to decide between this and the Intercept...", "Author": "RS", "ReviewID": "R1E33QJKZ3R3ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...just get this one. The physical keyboard, glass screen and \"faster\" processor on the Intercept are not worth the money or the hassle. The Optimus works. The Intercept doesn't. Simple as that. Read on if you're not already convinced.The Samsung Intercept seemed like a great deal at the time. It was the only Android phone available through Virgin Mobile then, and I'm done with contracts and overpriced service. The Samsung worked OK at first, but as soon as I added any apps to it at all, it got bogged down QUICK. To the point where if I received a phone call and tried to answer it, it would lag so badly that the call would go to voicemail before the phone could answer it. Apart from that, the data connection (wireless AND wi-fi) would disappear frequently, and the only way I could get it back was to power-cycle the phone, which takes SEVERAL MINUTES just to boot back up. And then it would lose data connection again in less time than it look to reboot the stupid thing.A quick Google search proved that these problems were not just isolated incidents, so I decided to just get rid of it. I got an LG Optimus V, and I'm so much happier with it.So, what's better? Nearly everything. Here's the laundry list...* The price. Samsung has marked the Intercept down since I bought mine, but it's still wasted money if the phone won't work.* Froyo. The Optimus already has 2.2, an enormous step up from the Intercept's 2.1. An update to 2.2 is supposedly in the works for the Intercept, but there's also an update to 2.3 in the works for the Optimus.* The SPEED. The processor in the Intercept is nominally faster (800mhz vs. 600mhz in the Optimus), but that one processor is doing everything, and it's gonna lag like you wouldn't believe. The Optimus has two processors, one of which is a graphics processor. So your phone won't lag so much. HUGE difference.* The screen is bigger and is higher resolution. Plus, more Android apps work with the resolution of this phone than with that of the Intercept, since the latter's screen has weird dimensions.* When the Optimus vibrates, you can feel it just fine, but you can't hear it. When the Intercept vibrates, it rattles so loudly that you might as well have just left the ringer on. (If you lose the phone often and call it to find it, get the Where's My Droid app, which can take the phone out of silent mode when you call it.)* I get better reception, even when streaming audio. It's also capable of 3G speeds - I only ever got 1X with the Intercept.* The camera's better. Not amazing, and no flash, but if I want to take high-quality photos, I'll use my real camera, not my phone cam.What's not better?* Call quality - I've heard the Intercept's call quality is better, but I honestly don't notice a difference, and I don't see what difference better sound quality makes if you can't even answer the stupid call.* The screen is apparently plastic, instead of the glass used on the Intercept. A screen protector should fix this, though.* The Intercept has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. The Optimus does not. But using Swype on the Optimus is a breeze. Besides, I never used the physical keyboard on the Intercept anyway, because it was lousy.* Battery life is on par with the Intercept, which isn't great. Takes hours to fully charge, and only a day or two to run out, so you'll have to charge it almost every day.This phone lives up to Virgin Mobile's promise of unlimited texts and data for a dirt cheap $25 without the classic caveat that you get what you pay for. The Intercept wasn't even worth the $25 a month when it came right down to it.

Salazar", "ReviewID": "R25HKOF8KDZ2JZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I downgraded from an HTC Evo 4g to a Samsung Restore (switching from Sprint to Virgin Mobile) due to the outrageous service plan... Then I couldn't take not having a smart phone and the lack of connectivity to email, facebook, etc. so I got this phone. At first it exceeded my expectations, most of my Android apps purchased on my Evo transferred over, albeit the games being a severely downgraded version. However I didn't get this phone for a processing powerhouse, as everyone seems to mention.The touch screen is great (not iPhone great, but better than that blasted Samsung Instinct I had), GPS, wifi, camera and 3G... as far as functionality goes this phone has it. The basics of a smart phone and it does them more than adequately. Some things are a little slow, but meh, I paid $50 for this phone on sale. I was pleased.However this phone will randomly reboot.Maybe once a day to every other day, or up to 3 times a day... just out of the blue. Sometimes I will be in the middle of a text... other times it will just be sitting on the counter and BLAM start screen and \"Virgin Mobile\" will sound. One time it did it right after I hung up, luckily it's never done it in the middle of a phone call or I might have thrown the phone against the wall.It is this phone's Achilles Heel. Forum searching has brought up the possible solution of swapping the memory card for one that is faster. I took mine out for a few days and it made no difference (except that I couldn't take pictures). Luckily it is infrequent enough to not be too much of a problem, however it was bothersome enough to warrant this review to warn others.I will update this review if any sort of firmware update in the future solves this issue.I have had this phone since December 20th, 2011Edit March 26th 2012: So after people commented and said that the random rebooting is NOT a common issue with this phone I sent the phone in to LG for warranty repair. They kept the phone for a week and a half and when I got it back, it said:Symptom/Cause: Language errorRepair/Replacement: Download new softwareFirst of all I was upset because I was without a phone for a week and a half and could've updated the firmware myself, if that's all it took. Secondly, I've had the phone back for a week now and it is still doing it. Three random reboots so far, one in the middle of a call. I'm more than upset and will update this review again pending LG's response.Edit March 27th 2012: Two more, just in one day. Sorry, I just happened to be on Amazon, figured I'd update. I'll update again AFTER I contact LG.Edit July 8th 2012: Ended up sending it back in again, they sent it back saying they replaced the charging port (?). It worked okay for a month maybe (one or two reboots). Now it's back to 2 a day on average. This has been quite the frustrating experience. Especially dealing with the turdburglars at LG. This is obviously a known issue with this phone according to the message boards, and they still won't replace the phone. I've contacted them again and have yet to hear from them. Major fail. If I ever see anyone that works at LG I'm going to return this phone to them, suppository-style.Edit July 15th 2012: After LG customer service ignored my emails, I filed another warranty claim. It is restarting every. single. time. I check it for a text, or it rings or a gust of wind pushes a butterfly outside. I have never had to restrain myself from smashing a piece of technology with a cinderblock so much as right now. I have one last ounce of faith that LG will do the right thing and replace this defective unit.Aug 4th 2012: Got my old phone back with a note saying they replaced the main board. To top it off, Virgin had deactivated my account 3 days after my payment posted, put a lock on my phone and used up 40 minutes of my 300 while my phone was in the hands of LG technicians. Shady stuff. I'm so through with this.Aug 7th 2012: First reboot since I got the phone back for the third time, phone was sitting on the desk. I have lost all faith in LG products and their technical support based solely on this interaction and my experience with this untrustworthy piece of technology. I'm gonna see if I can activate my old Nokia brickphone....Aug 20th 2012: I can't believe I'm still writing in here, I doubt anyone is even reading this... So ever since I got my phone back from LG the 3G service stopped working. So 3 hours over a period of 3 days on the phone with Virgin support (who are way more helpful than LG support, btw) and after tons of troubleshooting I FINALLY got what I've been asking for this whole time... a replacement phone! Guess what it does too?! Yup, after 5 days with it, so far I've had 1 reboot yesterday and 2 today... just that I've noticed. I think I'm going to get a Blackberry Curve, I've always heard good things about Blackberry's and the Curve has excellent reviews.Further notes about the phone: sometimes the display stays on and doesn't auto-dim (the first one... not the replacement) which obviously had a devastating effect on battery life. The new one doesn't do this... yet.Also, another critical design flaw is the lack of an LED for message, missed call and other notifications. The ironic part is that the OS has options to turn on or off the LED notifications. Actually, that's not irony... it's more of a statement as to how much thought went into the design of this phone. I'm not updating this review anymore, even if the phone explodes in my hand... I think anyone reading this can come to the conclusion that something like that happening is only a logical extension of the nature of this phone.

It allows a user to play most Flash video clips without a plugin, while using less 3G bandwidth.To improve battery life, I've installed the free versions of Advanced Task Killer, and Green Power Free. GPFis great for turning off 3g/wifi when the phone is idle with the screen turned off, while still letting calls through.ATK carefully 'autokills' programs from the main memory as needed, which also improves battery life. I getabout 15% extra battery life with these apps, compared to going without them. If you do the steps that LGrecommends, it's possible to have at least 10% extra battery life before recharging. I get about 20% extra atthe end of my day, compared to doing nothing. There must be a higher yield battery out there that won't damagethe phone. If you like to run everything on full, you'll be lucky to get four to five hours out of the phone.I can get about 18 to 24 hours, depending on what I do with it, sometimes less. It's best to turn this phone offwhen you can.If you're looking for a great smartphone with a no-contract plan on a solid cell network, this is a great choice.Just pick a plan, add phone insurance or a service plan, and you're ready to go.EDIT (July 14, 2011): I've changed my task killer to Advanced Task Manager. It includes a regular kill mode, as well as the usual auto kill mode. Regular kill works at a specified interval, whether the phone is being used or not. I have mine set to 30 minutes. ATM even features a startup kill mode that shuts down some apps and system functions when booting up the phone. I do agree with some experts that say that task killers are unnecessary to use. However, I've found that careful adjustment of ATM in my case, along with green power, helps a lot in prolonging battery life, especially with the screen off while idling. ATM is more aggressive than ATK (because of the three kill modes), so sometimes the phone might respond a bit slowly after coming out of screen idle. But after a few seconds, the phone behaves normally.I tried 15 minutes for the regular kill mode at first. That killed too many processes earlier than needed. I find 30 minutes to be better. For one thing, it helps with game performance, as there's more memory available for them. ATM does help with battery life, with or without green power. If you still don't want a task killer, at least use something like green power to prolong battery life.Both apps are worth a few dollars to keep on your phone, but test the free versions first.EDIT 2 (Oct. 3, 2011): I don't even use ATK anymore or any task killer. I've also reduced the number of apps I have on the phone. The only extra apps (aside from what the system needs to run well) running in the background for me are Green Power, and the free version of Lookout. I just go to Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > Running to kill a few apps. No more automated stuff; task killers mostly take up too much CPU. At least they do with this phone, in the few months I've had it. As for Green Power, it controls the 3G data. I toggle Wifi manually.To be honest, I'm not sure how much longer I'll have this phone. The price for the Motorola Triumph ought to drop over the upcoming holiday season. I might change over to that phone then, as enough accessories are available for it (including some good screen protectors). It would be nice to have a phone with built-in flash for the camera. I kind of miss that. 5 megapixels isn't bad either, considering that most pics uploaded to fb, twitter, etc. from the phone have to go through a 3G connection. Not to mention, it should handle PDF's and e-books better than the Optimus. I'll wait and see.EDIT 3 (Nov. 23, 2011): No, I don't have the Triumph. I still haven't rooted the phone, though I'm still looking at that possibility. I considered getting either the HTC Wildfire S, and the LG Optimus Slider. The Slider would've been nice, but it's only slightly faster than the V. The Wildfire has memory and battery issues that would really bug me.I guess what I'm finding out is that because of the squabbles or whatever going on with phone makers and Google... Android users rarely get updates directly from the manufacturers or Google. The only way to get them is to root the phone, or buy a new one every few months it seems. I'm not against rooting. But for whatever reason, I feel less comfortable with that process on a smartphone than I do with adding an extra operating system on a PC. Maybe I'm just wimping out, but I honestly don't see much difference overall if I choose to root my phone or not. (I mean, rooting could help me remove some of the preloaded junk I don't care for, but at this point, it's not a big deal for me.) That's not to say I hate Android as a smartphone OS. At least I don't have a bricked phone. :)Even Linux (the PC/server OS that Android is heavily based on) is more upfront with updates IMHO...EDIT 4 (July 15, 2012): I have had this phone rooted since late November, shortly after I wrote the third edit. I've tried several Froyo and Gingerbread ROMs. The best I've used are from some developers known online as LeslieAnn, and MiRage_666. The mirage guy has the ROMs I use the most, as his packs are well-tuned and regularly maintained. Mirage is also very receptive to good fixes that interest him (and his loyal users). There are some developers that are experimenting with Ice Cream Sandwich builds, but I personally don't recommend them if you value stability. These devs have extended the life of this phone for me, even as I search for a replacement. I may keep this around as a spare phone/internet/music machine well after I retire it from regular use. That's how much I like my V... it's proven to be quite durable for me (and many other users, especially those who love rooting) :-)April 28, 2014 : I still have this phone in my possession. It still runs the original battery!As a rooted device, I've run at least ten different ROMs on it, ranging from Froyo, to Gingerbread (Cyanogenmod 7.2) ROMs, to even a KitKat ROM! I ran it briefly out of hibernation while waiting for the Kyocera Event (Oct. 2013), and LG Optimus F3 (April, 2014) to come to my doorstep from amazon. The current ROM I have for it is something called CyanMobile Experience. There are two versions floating around, but the one I have is made by an Android Central member named jduffield1. I'm currently hosting the file on my Google Drive account. If you want to try it for your V, go to the Android Central forums, and look for the rooting section for the Virgin Mobile Optimus V. My name there is daffy_duck_nj. I love the Jelly Bean like features duff put on this ROM! It has the reliability of the one made by mrg666, so it's very stable, even in its WIP form. The KitKat one was cool, but it kept on overheating my phone, even though I didn't push the overclocking much.

Now I'm paying $25 a month for basically the same thing. Awesome. Now a little about the phone. My droid with a 14 month old battery would do standby with normal use for just over 2 days. This phone with a brand new battery and a full charge won't make it 2 days, if even a full day, with normal use no matter how many apps and functions are killed. It takes a good 2-3 hours to charge. The Droid took about an hour. The camera is mediocre with no flash but I guess it works. There is no notification LED which my Droid had so that is a definite minus. Kinda miss that. The phone functions much smoother than my Droid but chokes playing games. Angry Birds plays but eventually slows down to a crawl. Robo Defense and Solitaire play ok i guess. The call quality is on par with my Droid and possibly better. The built in wifi works better than the Droid. It's slightly smaller than my Droid which is good, but the phone seems a little on the light side and cheap. I was able to put the 16g micro sd card out of my Droid and transfer my phone numbers, music, etc. which was cool. The screen is low res by todays standard but functional. Makes reading web pages more difficult. I like the swype text entry and texting is no more difficult than the Droid. Calling to activate my phone and transfer my cell number was a bad experience. There was definitely a language barrier. The phone says Virgin Mobile so people will possibly make fun of you.

So I'll take a shot at answering how to do this as of December 2011 (especially as I just spent two frustrating days accomplishing it, after buying the Optimus V onsale locally). So this is less a review, than it is a how-to addendum to ajpd's original post.To be sure, a lot of what you'll google on the web about \"how-to\" do this, simply isn't applicable anymore: as usual, Things Have Changed (since even earlier this year).My pre-suggestion is Don't do ANYTHING with your new phone until AFTER you read the instructions below. (Or keep this in mind if you've had yours awhile and want to try this.)To be able to use your LG Optimus to place VOIP calls via a WiFi connection, you must do these tasks *only* in the following order.1. Configure your wireless router, making a note of your SSID (and you need the logon password ...forgive me for stating the obvious, but \"you never know\").2. Desktop PC: If you don't already have Gmail, you should sign up for that first. (You'll want/need an account.)  NOTE: You don't want any \"strange\" characters in your Gmail account name (a \"period\" is a \"strange\" character).3. Desktop PC: Sign up for Google Voice [GV], and choose a new number. (You want their new phone number ...for this, and other reasons.)4. Desktop PC: Configure GV. Make sure Chat *is* enabled.5. Desktop PC: Add a current phone number where you can receive calls.  NOTE: I already had a verified phone number in GV ...use a friends' phone, for now, if you don't have a phone, so that Google can call to verify you ...you can remove the number later, when you add your phone's \"real\" number if or when you activate it.6. Buy a new Optimus V phone at Amazon :-) ...or open the phone package, charge it, and turn it on now. And no, don't worry about activating it yet ...this really does work, mostly). Ignore the popup \"Activate now\" message.7. Phone: Connect to your WiFi - or wireless - router. On the Optimus, this will turn off 3G btw (dunno why, just the way it works on mine & my wife's).8. Phone: Click the Market tool, Search for and download the Google Voice 'droid app, install it, and start it.  NOTE: You will *not* be able to get past the \"recognize this phone\" GV application setup btw (don't worry, it works anyways as you will be able to call out and receive calls over WiFi, sort of). You *must* sign in to Google Voice on the 'droid before the next step(s).9. Phone: Now - and ONLY now - search and download the SIPdroid tool with the Market app, install it, start it, and click the pbxes.org setup notice at the bottom of the first SIPdroid screen (if you don't see that little notice, you didn't install GV first, or you have a GV problem ...so uninstall SIPdroid, uninstall GV, check your Google Voice account, and start again).  NOTE: SIPdroid performs an initial automatic setup of a pbxes.org account *correctly* for you ...PBXes is tied into GV via SIPdroid (to the best of my understanding, pbxes.org is what makes this thing work).  NOTE: If you have any \"weird\" characters in your Google account username (and even a period is \"weird\"), you will have to change the pbxes.org username at the top of the setup screen; this problem is *not* obvious, as you will just get a failure message from setup until you change the pbex.org new account username in the SIPdroid setup.10. Desktop PC: Logon to pbxes.org (which is a German language website btw; don't worry, it will change to English automatically when you logon with your Google username and password)  NOTE: the pbxes.org account logon will use the same username and password as your Google account, and was set up by the SIPdroid tool on your LG Optimus ...I have *no* idea what you do if your username was already in use on pbxes.org btw: start over with a new Gmail account name I'd guess).11. Desktop PC: Click Extensions --> Add Extension --> SIP --> and fill in an Extension number (ex: 100), your Display Name (ex: My Name), and a *new* password (make a note of this password for later). From the drop down Voicemail and Directoy field, choose Enabled. Click the Submit button. And at the top, click the red bar to Apply. Your new extension will appear in the left column. Click it. Make a note of the dial box contents (ex:SIP\\yourgoogleaccountusername-100).  NOTE: PBXes is a non-trivial user environment. You are on your own if you have problems; I can't help you.12. Phone: Open the SIPdroid app again. Click the menu button (lower LH corner of phone), and choose settings. Click on SIP account --> Authorization Username ...and fill the popup in with the pbxes dial box name, leaving off the \"SIP\\\" prefix (from the example above, you would type in yourgoogleaccountusername-100). Click on the password, and enter in the \"extension\" password you created in Step 11 (i.e, don't use your Google account password). Place a checkmark by Use WLAN. Click the Home button to bring you back to the 'droid desktop.  NOTE: You shouldn't have to change any other parameters ...and don't muck around in there at all unless you're confident you know what's going on.At this point, you can place and recieve voice calls via WiFi. You may be able to text (I was able to do a couple of test texts, and then nothing ...though I didn't have any problems with calls, ever). As ajpd reported, you will now have a working cell phone that allows you to place calles using a form of VOIP through your WiFi connection, bypassing the cellular backbone (from your end).However, you *should* activate the phone now though, by purchasing at least the minimal Virgin Mobile [VM] smartphone package ($35 for 300 minutes). Because, well, the above technique can be problematical. I've no idea why texting worked, and then it didn't. I mean, *calls* seemed to be just fine (I made a couple of dozen plus calls, including fielding a support call from a client two states away, that spanned 45 minutes duration), but texting was flaky, and I was clueless about troubleshooting why texting had quit working after the first successful messages.All I know is that *after* I activated my wife's phone, and was able to add the new VM phone number to Google Voice (and verify it), everything on her new LG Optimus was shiny (Firefly reference btw). And after I activated my phone, ALL my earlier test emails & voicemails were delivered.It is quick & easy to change between WiFi and 3GS (Settings --> Wireless & Networks --> Wi-Fi ...check or uncheck Wi-Fi, 3GS will automatically come up) ...and I don't see how using WiFi would break the phone's service agreement.Caveat: YMMV.Nor should any provider be tracking such usage (or justify tracking it: I don't trust anyone about privacy matters anymore, hence the caveat) and counting such calls against your plan minutes. (Especially as at your end, technically you're not connected to the cellular data network at all.)After all, this is simply a form of software VOIP, courtesy of Google Voice, which rather artlessly bypasses the cellular network completely ...delivering packets via the usual Internet backbone ...and finally to the dialee, with the contrivance of Google, bless 'em.Oh. And do note that the Google Voice blog recently announced that for 2012, calls will continue to be free.I'm quite happy with the LG Optimus btw. I had to give up my iPhone 3GS when I moved to a new state several weeks back, and (other than memory), the LG Optimus is at least the 3GS' equal ...except in internal device memory (which lack is somewhat mitigated by the expandability of the micro SSD slot, with up to 32GB cards). It seems a bit smaller physically, and it's definitely nicer to hold (due to the rubberized plastic).And I rather like the Froyo interface *more* than iOS btw (I use LauncherPro instead of the default VM desktop: sweet).I haven't rooted the phone or anything, but I haven't seen a need (yet) to do that (I've only had it a few days).A solid four and a half stars ...the half point being off for the small memory space.When you factor in the price, the low monthly fee, AND the no-contract provider ...I paid less for this and a month of usage, then a Sprint iPhone 4 costs with discount (let alone the 2 year contract) ...and there's no penalty if I bail on VM ...so: I give it back the half star. Five stars. FTW.Oh. And one last observation: I had a backup VM phone for 10 years (while concurrent with Sprint data plan \"feature phones\", and with a work iPhone that was AT&T;). I never had any issues with Virgin Mobile (through lost phones, replacement phones, whatever): their customer service was always superb.VM uses the Sprint backbone, and so long as you have access to Sprint towers, the quality of voice calls was noticeably better than AT&T; (I used the iPhone weekdays for three years, while on most weekends I used an LG Elite clamshell phone through Sprint: the Sprint calls were noticeably more clear than AT&T; whether in a rural or urban location ...dunno why).

Farnham", "ReviewID": "R1UWTXAKTRY9GQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am coming from the background of being a loyal AT&T; wireless customer (over 8 years).  I finally got tired of spending so much per month and then having to pay extra for texting and extra for data!  My review is going to cover 1.LG Optimus V compared to the iPhone 4; 2.My purchase experience with shopcelldeals; and 3.Virgin Mobile service as compared to AT&T; in central Texas (Star rating does not include this category).1. Going from the iPhone to Android was not a terribly difficult transition.  All in all the phones are very similar.  Worst part is that all the apps that I purchased on iTunes are no longer useable.  I like how Android is much more customizable than iOS 4.0 (i.e. I was able to use any song for text notification!).  I love the auto sync with my google account - like mobileme for iPhone only free.  I love Amazon cloud player which is not yet available on iOS (Google is also currently beta testing a similar service!).  Music no longer has to take up storage space on my phone!  The LG Optimus is very fast.  It is arguable that my iPhone lagged more.  I have had issues installing certain Android apps on this LG Optimus (i.e. Jenga does not work on this phone - many other commented the same).  My biggest frustration is how small the internal phone memory is.  All apps have to store at least part of the program on the phone and some apps are not able to install on the SD card at all (must be completely installed on the phone). The only other negative so far is that if I use the phone like I did my iPhone, the battery dies in about 10-12 hrs whereas my iPhone would usually last about 16 hrs.  Bought an extra charger for at work to help cope with this issue.  Overall great phone for $130!2.  I was very happy with the service I received from shopcelldeals!  I received the phone 3 days after I purchased it.  It came in a durable shipping box with packing bubbles.  I felt very confidently about the safetly of the packaging.  I saved $20 plus $16 in tax as compared to the Virgin Mobile website.  Thank you very much for the great service!3.  The phone was so easy to activate! I spent 10 minutes on the phone getting my number transferred and my Virgin Mobile account set up (as compared to the 2 hrs I spent setting up a prepaid account on T-mobile!).  The service in Temple, TX has been great so far compared to AT&T.;  I used to drop a couple calls a week and so far, day 4 and no dropped calls and reception is good!  $25 for 300 minutes, unlimited data, and unlimited texting - WOW!  So here is THE CATCH - I knew of this before signing up but it is something that you want to know before you start.  There is no night/weekend minutes and no mobile to mobile thus you use your anytime minutes for absolutely every call.  Also there is no roaming period (you don't pay roaming charges but the Sprint network is limited; once you leave the service area, you simply have no service).  For me living on I35 it is not an issue, but examine the coverage map before you sign up.  Also, Virgin Mobile has this great program where when you refer a friend you and your friend both get free minutes!  If you are going to activate your knew phone online, enter this code in the \"Kickbacks\" box for 60 free anytime minutes: LDXFwH94Overall very happy with the purchase, and very happy to be free from AT&T;!", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great device, now that the bugs are worked out", "Author": "Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "ReviewID": "R12Z33C3ZKISDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a longtime Virgin Mobile customer that was also a Helio customer before and after VM acquired them. Over the space of the last decade or so, I've used everything from ultra-low end handsets that cost $20 and could barely place a call, to ultra-high end $200 handsets in Helio's contract lineup which could (at least in theory) do everything short of toasting bread. Generally speaking, I've found that Virgin's 'high end' devices weren't really worth the expense- their advanced features tended to be poorly suited to their pay-as-you-go billing system, no cheaper than contract phones on their monthly plans, and just plain buggy.VM's new monthly plans and handsets, however, made me shell it out for yet another try. The main reason was devices like the Optimus V, which have a proven track record on Sprint (which Virgin runs on), T-mobile, and others. I'd also been getting tired of being made fun of with my beat-up old Samsung M340 which had never been too great in the call quality department anyhow. The Optimus V is an entry-level Android smartphone with full touchscreen control and the ability to run most apps. Among other features (which you can look up here or on VM's site) it has an external SD card slot, 3.2 MP camera, motion sensor, and rear speakerphone. It also comes with a basic wired headset, which you can replace with most third party (including bluetooth) earpieces.The biggest draw for the Optimus V, and Virgin in general, is cost. Rates start at $25 a month for unlimited data, texting, and 300 minutes. You can restart this whenever you want, so if you run out of minutes before a month is up you can just start the next month (so to speak) by paying another $25. For those that spend way more time using mobile web/email and texting than talking, this is an insanely good deal. Furthermore- and probably best of all- you are under no contractual obligations, which means if you cancel your plan (essentially, stop paying) you don't get hit with an ETF. This does mean you have to pay the full price of the handset, but the flexibility is worth it.It's worth noting, before delving into the pros and cons of the device itself, that there has been a very serious- borderline dealbreaker- technical issue with the Optimus V. In many areas, including mine, the phone would randomly drop its 3G connection and fail to reconnect. When this happened it wouldn't give any indication that something was wrong- the only way you could tell was by trying to send or receive data, which would time out. This was a big problem because if you have background data on, it would be madly attempting to retry transfer, which would eat up the battery like crazy- sometimes in 2 hours from a full charge. You have to manually toggle the device's mobile network to restore it. This issue seems to have been resolved recently in my area, but be warned that others have reported still having it. Google \"optimus v 3g drops\" if you want to learn more.Pros:Call quality is excellent, much better than any previous Virgin device I've used.Screen is superb in resolution and clarity, decent even in sunlight, and very responsive to touch and gestures. Typing on the virtual keyboard is no problem.The device is quite powerful for an entry-level smartphone and can run most apps smoothly.The build and housing are well done with a nice, solid feel and rubberized grip. It feels like it can take a few licks, and it has in my possession.Standard Google apps, such as maps/navigation, gmail, calendar, news/weather all work seamlessly. I've found this is a worthy replacement for my old Garmin GPS and serves as a better scheduling reminder than desktop web versions of Google Apps. Contacts and events sync between both automatically, so you can enter information wherever you want.Between the installed apps and stuff you can download for free, you can use this phone for pretty much anything you'd care to. It has all the basic utility features as well: decent mp3 player, email, calculator, alarm clock, browser, and chat. While it's no iPhone killer, you can do every basic task that higher end smartphones can tackle.You can root it (at your own risk) and use 3rd party apps that enable things like the mobile hotspot, which works decently. While Sprint's EVDO network might not be the latest and greatest in speed, it's plenty fast enough for web browsing.Cons:Flash doesn't work on this handset, and as far as I know there's no way to hack it (at least not for free) yet.Since the speakerphone is rear-mounted, it can be hard to hear if you put the phone down with the screen facing upwards. This means you're forced to place it face down, which is somewhat awkward seeing as how all the controls are on the front.Battery life is so-so, even after the glitch with the 3G drops was resolved. I usually have to charge it every other day with only moderate use. If you use the phone frequently or take frequent calls, expect to have to charge it daily. A car charger is recommended, and you can find some cheap ones that do the trick right here on Amazon.The motion sensor is a bit flaky, enough so that I just turned it off. The phone often fails to detect that it's been turned to landscape or portrait mode or, probably worse, sometimes falsely detects it has been reoriented. It has no sense of up or down, so if you wake it up in landscape mode it'll still show in portrait.The camera takes mediocre pictures, especially if you zoom. It doesn't focus too well by itself, so unless the subject is at ideal range and with ideal lighting, don't expect awesome results. Video is likewise unimpressive.The Optimus V is easily the best handset in Virgin's lineup and a very inexpensive and capable device. I heartily recommend it if you're at all interested in getting into the smartphone craze, yet don't want to pay out your children's inheritance in the process.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Good Phone for People Who Can't Afford Others", "Author": "M. Harris", "ReviewID": "R2JGT8S8UF7ZK1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off let me say that I've had quite a relationship with this phone. I've had ups and downs with it all the time. Here are some important points:1. The Screen - While it may not have the beauty of other phones, it certainly isn't hard to look at. The colors are all very nice, even the blacks are decent for a phone this price. It looks quite nice in the dark especially. The colors are warm, but not overly warm. There is no certain tint to the color, which is something that some high-end phones are missing. Reading is bearable on it, I had no problem reading long amounts of text at all. The pixels are visible, but if you don't look for them, you don't notice them. Actually, they are not that visible, much better than a lot of screens I've seen. While the screen is small compared to a lot of phones, in fact tiny, it's not horrible. But, if you plan on doing a lot of web browsing or movie-watching especially, then you will really enjoy a bigger screen. Even games. So, that is one major limitation of this phone.2. The Speed - A major problem with this phone is speed. Maybe several years ago, this would be considered fast. But nowadays, it's been left in the dust by dual-core processors, quad-core even. This clocks in at 600 MHz single-core. Ouch! Phones usually have at least 1.2 GHz dual-core. And you will see the difference immediately. Applications sometimes open very slowly, things that you would think should be flawless. A lot of times, even if all background programs are closed (I use Advanced Task Killer - works like a charm most of the time, greatly improves performance) the lock screen can freeze up at times. Sometimes that can make the phone unusable, but luckily you just wait a few seconds and it catches itself up. When browsing desktop-sized websites, there can be MAJOR freeze-ups. A lot of times, the status bar keeps saying that something is loading, which it is. But it's only loading one object many times. Because of that one object that refuses to load, the page looks all messed up. And since the browser doesn't have flash, there are a lot of times when things refuse to load. If you're going to browse especially picture-heavy sites like Engadget, good luck! It's a stuttering nightmare even after you wait a while after the page is fully loaded. So be patient if you want to do that kind of web browsing. Mobile sites, however, don't have a problem at all usually, but even they lack the smoothness they should have. When it comes to playing games, there is a lot of stuttering (lag) as well. Most games have at least a little, and many games like Temple Run cannot even be played on this phone due to its slow processor. What I just listed is not even close to all of the limitations the processor creates.3. The Battery - You would think a phone that doesn't have much speed would be a battery-saver. You would think it wouldn't use much energy. Well folks, you're sadly mistaken, and because of the fact that the processor has to work so hard to do the simplest of things, the battery life can be very short. It's enough to get through the day, depending on how much you use it. But trust me, I've come close to fully draining the battery a lot of times. Hooking up WiFi instead of its 3G connection is a major power saver, so you might want to consider that. It's easy enough to do. But on 3G, it drains like crazy.4. The network - All of Virgin Mobile's phones work on Sprint's network. While Sprint has been around for a long time, they still don't have a decent network built up. The speeds are atrocious sometimes, and coverage, oh boy, that's even worse. I found out that the speeds are always less than 1MBPS. Networks like AT&T; can get far better speeds, on 3G. This phone has no 4G, so that's yet ANOTHER limitation. However, even though those numbers are low, it's not the worst. Pages tend to be fast. They are usually close to WiFi. But downloads on WiFi are SO much faster. And in my home, even though I live in a decent-size city, has poor coverage. I used to have a Net10 phone, which runs off of AT&T; and T-Mobile's network, which was faster. What a shame. Sprint's network is just so unstable. For a while, I used to have no service in my home. At least now that's fixed, I guess.There are more limitations than what I listed, but there is one thing that everyone, including me, has to remember. The monthly bill is only $35. That's lower than any other carrier, so the saying, \"You get what you paid for\" works well here. So, I guess for such a great price I can't complain much. But if you're coming from contract, or like me looking to go onto contract, you will probably be disappointed if you purchase this phone, or for that matter any phone from Virgin Mobile.Overall, I still manage to get some use out of the phone. And by the way, it has a low memory capacity (internal) which is another major setback. A lot of times, a message comes up saying it's low. It's a major annoyance, so some more memory would be wonderful. But now that I've taken out a lot of apps and games, it works well for the most part. I can't wait to move onto something better though.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Initially Buggy But Fixable By Custom Roms, Very Durable", "Author": "T. Lampe \"Imagine That\"", "ReviewID": "R2BHSQG1BM8RDY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG Optimus V is Virgin Mobile's first serious jump into the smartphone sea, and I have to say it handles pretty well compared to other more powerful, low-end and midrange phones on other carriers. The cheap prepaid plans are nothing to scoff at, with 35, 45 and 55 dollar per month tiers that provide excellent bang for your buck.Hardware:The build quality of the Optimus V is actually surprisingly good. Not too cheap feeling, and while the gorilla glass front panel looks a bit gaudy, it does a good job of protecting the phone, and is resistant to rupture. The phone, after 11 months of owning it, is quite durable, and has survived drops to the pavement, hardwood floors and carpet from various distances, most around the 5-ft range. A neat occurence with this phone is that when dropped, the back cover flies off and ejects the battery. While people may be frustrated with this, this actually saves the phone from harm because ejecting the battery removes a lot of the mass, resulting in less fall damage. Good job on that one, LG.The Optimus V is equipped with an INCREDIBLY bright 3.2\" TFT LCD screen, it's capacitive and has support for two inputs (fingers) at once. This phone is brighter than my Dell laptop's display as well as my old Samsung Moment and my friend's HTC Evo 4G. I don't know how LG pulled it off, but this LCD screen is absolutely beautiful but is very power-hungry.Inside we have a 600MHz Qualcomm MSM7627 processor and the Adreno 200 GPU which can handle a decent library of games from the android market. There is 512MB of RAM, about 190MB of onboard flash storage and the device comes with a 2GB Class-4 MicroSD (which I recommend swapping for an 8GB Class-6 or better). The 2GB card that comes with this device is often very slow and causes hangups when looking at pictures in the Gallery app.The speaker is not the most powerful on the back, but its performance can be improved by covering the headphone jack, greatly increasing the clarity. The earpiece is quite clear for voice and VoIP calls, but the microphone could be better. Call quality is decent and even in fringe areas I have never completely dropped a call. The cellular radio in this phone gets better signal than an HTC Evo 4G but is not as great as the Samsung Epic 4G. The headphone jack is at a slant so depending on what headphones you are using, your connector may occasionally pop out while twisting. Along with the phone comes an LG earbuds/headset for you to use with a microphone blob that can answer calls.Battery life is decent, better than the Intercept by far, but still only barely makes it through a 14-hour day. I was honestly expecting a little more from a 1500mAh battery. Battery life can be extended by lowering the screen brightness a ton (which is fine, the screen is super bright anyway), by turning off data, gps and bluetooth when not in use, and with the help of third-party apps like JuiceDefender or Tasker. If more battery life is desired, on Amazon there are batteries that go up to 2100mAh that still fit the stock battery cover. If you're okay with a little more bulk, you can install up to a 3900mAh battery in this phone with a custom back cover.Software:The phone comes with Android 2.2.1 or 2.2.2 depending on if you have an older or newer model. The phone is very snappy and can handle quite a few apps but just can't amount to some of the more demanding ones like Netflix and Adobe Reader. There is no flash support for this phone unless you root and install the special ARMv6 build of Flash Player. Even then, it is not powerful enough to play videos smoothly. Virgin Mobile did right choosing a stock android experience, as the LG UI overly on Android is quite silly looking.By default, however, a lot of these Optimus Vs are plagued with software bugs like the 50% time without signal bug that causes data connection issues and battery drain as well as some Android Market problems. Even with rooting, these cannot be fixed unless a custom ROM is applied to the phone. I was in the predicament with the 50% TWS people and found the only way to get rid of the bug completely was to flash a ROM to my phone that had a proper fix. With the help of the great Optimus V modding community at androidcentral forums, I was able to sort out these problems and easily flash a Cyanogenmod based ROM on the phone (and my grandmother's V as well).With a Cyanogenmod7 ROM on the Optimus V, it is a powerhouse, performs even better in games, has support for newer apps, and has built-in SIP/VoIP support. And, above all else, it fixes the data issues and the 50% Time Without Signal bug!With a little effort, the Optimus V can be made the perfect phone for you, but by default, sadly, the Out-of-Box experience is a little unpredictable.Customer Service:I've been a Virgin Mobile customer since 2006 and have always found VirginMobile's customer service to be adequate at the very least. Even if the call center is occasionally an outsourced one, I've only dealt with workers that while from India or wherever, can speak English quite clearly. Anytime I've had a billing issue or another problem with service, they have always been quick to fix the problem or reimburse my lost money.Phone activation is quick and easy, within the hour I was able to use my phone. I've only ever had to call to fix the data after being late on my bill one month once, an hour or so after that call, my data worked perfectly.Overall, I'm very pleased with the 149 dollars I spent in early 2011. The phone has kept up with all my needs, has kept me connected on the go, and (after flashing a new ROM) has remained snappy and usable. The pricing of the plans are perfect and having a WiFI VoIP phone in addition to a cellular phone is quite an asset. The Gmail sync is great and the Mail client supports Microsoft Exchange. There is even VPN support (so I can watch BBC programming on the web :D). While the first stretch of road was bumpy, with a little help from a friendly modding community, I was able to sort out ALL of the issues that I initially had with this phone. I give this product four well-deserved stars. I intend to stick with this phone until Virgin offers something more powerful than the Triumph.If you would like to flash a Rom to your phone the quick and unexpectedly-easy way, see this thread on androidcentral (note the spaces between the dots) ----> [...]Sorry for that wall of text, by the way. ;)", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable value", "Author": "1 \"camera user\"", "ReviewID": "R3E1TLJDDKN2WC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is not perfect, but it gets 5 stars because for $25 a month and no minimum contract, it is absolutely unbeatable in terms of value. I was previously paying close to $70 a month for a non-smart phone that couldn't even function as that most of the time due to reception issues. Even including the initial cost of the phone, I will be saving myself almost $400 this year by switching to a smart phone. I still don't understand how this is possible.The pros of the actual phone are that it is a droid phone that seems to function very well so far and is a good size for your pocket. Some others are just a little too big for me. If this is your first smart phone, then I don't think you could fail to be amazed by the stuff you can suddenly do on your phone, and by all the free software that is seconds away by download.The cons for me are the camera (poor in low light and no flash), and the built-in speaker. The speaker can be quite fuzzy, and because it is located on the back, you can only hear it optimally when the screen it facing away from you. If you put the camera down, then most of the sound is muffled. I also find the speakerphone pretty much unusable during calls due to its fuzziness.Battery life is not great, but this depends on how you want to use it. If you need to be instantly notified about every email and will be using the phone constantly throughout the day, then this phone is not a solution for your needs. For me its fine though. When I am at my desk, I just turn the internet fully off as I can see emails etc on my desktop. Then when away from the desk (or at weekends), I turn the internet on and use Juice Defender to limit internet checking (e.g. receiving new emails and facebook messages etc) once every 15 minutes. This makes the phone get through the day without limiting it too much.  Use QuickSettings to rapidly switch on and off Wi-Fi, blue tooth, GPS and internet.I also have TaskKiller installed. There is much debate over whether this is a good thing or not, but I found that the built in photo viewer (Galleries) was using loads of battery even when I wasn't looking at it. Task Killer makes sure the program shuts down when you stop using the phone. I set it to allow all other tasks to remain open.The other issue is internal memory. There are thousands of amazing apps out there. Most can be moved to your SD card, but many cannot. You will quickly run out of space on the Optimus V unless you are more frugal with your apps than anybody wants to be when first discovering so much free amazingness.In summary, if you are someone who needs a blackberry, don't get this phone. If you are switching from an iphone, then you will probably be disappointed by the camera. BUT if you are someone who wants a very functional smart phone for an amazingly low monthly cost, AND no contract, then you can't go wrong with this phone. I am in love with it despite its few obvious flaws.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value, great features and no two-year contract!", "Author": "Jared Castle \"Oregon writer\"", "ReviewID": "RLUKRYADOUUEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased two of these LG Optimus V smartphones in July 2011 with a Beyond Talk plan that gives us 300 anytime minutes and unlimited text and data for $35 each monthly. Now, seven months later, we feel great about our first smartphone purchases.We don't live in an area with 4G coverage (southern Oregon), so there was little reason to commit to a two-year plan. We have 3G connectivity and the Android 2.2 operating system, featuring a 3.2\" QVGA touchscreen display (480 x 320 pixels).A nice surprise is the Amazon App store, where we purchase most of our apps. We have nothing against Android market but the prices are usually better at Amazon and we can test many of the apps before purchasing them. We upgraded from the 2 GB microSD memory card included to a 16 GB card. We recommend you upgrade as well, so you can enjoy the apps without worrying about overloading your phone.The only feature we don't have (and really want) is a flash for the 3.2-megapixel auto-focus camera/camcorder. That's really the only complaint we have with this model.My Google, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts are linked to the LG Optimus V. My most used apps are Google Listen and BeyondPod, both of which give me access to a wide variety of podcasts, music and news. I've also downloaded my cardio playlist from the Amazon Cloud.The phone comes with a 3.5mm headset/headphone jack. I regularly use both my Ultimate Ears 200 Noise-Isolating Earphones and my Jabra Sport corded Stereo Sports Headset. I'm happy with the sound quality and volume.In summary, the lack of a flash is not enough for me to drop a star off my rating. I hope my next smartphone purchase is as good a value as this one.

The gold standard (iPhone) was an option, but a pricey one for a decent data plan.  Android is the next best thing, but not all Android phones are equally good.  The other reviews are accurate -- LG Optimus V is a GREAT phone; best I have ever had.  Most of the best iPhone apps have been ported to Android.  I do not feel the least bit deprived for passing up the iPhone.Prior to buying this phone, I tried to port my old Verizon number to a cheapie voice-only phone on Net10.  But Net10 customer service couldn't figure out how to do it.  Virgin Mobile customer service is only so-so; it took 2 attempts and a visit to the Verizon store to solve a mistake made by Virgin while porting my Verizon number.  But it was time well spent because their $25/month plan is unbeatable for voice & data.  With any luck I should not need to worry about customer service for a long time.  If I was willing to accept a new phone number, the whole experience would have been plug-and-play from day one.Until my Verizon coverage disappeared, I did not realize it would cost LESS to avoid mobile phone contracts.

My god is this phone amazing and I am the person that is coming from a iPhone 3gs, yes an iPhone 3gs 16gb white.The difference between these two is that the iPhone 3gs needs a contract and that the LG Optimus V uses free google gps and has swype texting (which makes texting so much faster trust me) and has many more apps like google voice recognition for search and texting unlike the iPhone 3gs.The only difference between these two is that the iphone 3gs screen is slightly bigger and I say slightly but since I've had this phone for more than a week now I can confirm that you hardly notice any difference.Also, unlike many other carriers and phones I've used this phone can get hot-spot (you cnet people need to download the app sheesh) and use the unlimited Virgin Mobile unlimited data plan to use it for your laptop for taking the train or anywhere you are located and are receiving 3g!!!!And for your information I commute every day 25 miles into the heart of chicago from the suburbs and NEVER lose any reception along the way, because ever since SPRINT took over Virgin Mobile, VM's service is phenomenal and always stays true to its word about bringing the best coverage for the cheapest value (and do not get fooled by the word cheap - the phone with this $25 plan will kick any carrier out of the water).I've always HAD Att and iPhone from 2g to 3g and then 3gs but eventually got fed up with paying at least $80 per month and being on a contract that I tried this prepaid plan out and I have loved it ever since.If you are even thinking about getting prepaid let me tell you Virgin Mobile gives you the best bang for your buck, has the best, most polite customer service (called them five times for different things and was assisted in the best way), and uses SPRINT's 3g service and its towers therefore has the BEST coverage especially anywhere in the Chicago land area including Milwaukee and even up to Madison - yes never lost signal once while traveling even that far away.Best part is that you can import your prior number so you don't have to alert everyone on your contact list that you have a new phone AND yes there is even BETTER NEWS the app BUMP can shift all your contacts from either another android phone or iphone to this phone in a matter of seconds so no need to input all those phone numbers.I am truly loving this service and this phone and as a graduate student let me tell you this is TRULY the best thing that's ever happened to me...and to think I actually spent 4 grand over two and half years paying ATT for unreliable service.Even if you are thinking about this go out to your nearest Target or Radio Shack and try it out both give you 30-90 days for return policy and if you don't like it return it for the full refund and for the pre-paid card also.Though you will like it please let everyone know how your experience was so we can let people know what the best product is so other phone companies should compete and give US CONSUMERS better pricing!!!!!!", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone BUT...", "Author": "Antonia M, PhD \"The Inner Power Doctor\"", "ReviewID": "R1BZ9R66PH1SIU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "And this is a big BUT for me...the internal memory is sooooo small (179 MB). The descriptions I've read on this phone conveniently fail to mention the small internal memory. This is my first smartphone and in this day and age it just never occurred to me that this would be an issue, considering how people do everything on their phones these days and especially since you can get an SD card--which I did.  As a newbie, what I didn't know was that you can't put everything on the SD card. There are many applications that force you to store them on the internal memory. So I have found myself constantly having to delete applications because I keep running out of space. It is incredibly frustrating for many reasons, including the fact that I can't get email, text messages, or dial the phone easily when the memory is full. (In fact, today I missed an important message for this very reason).Going to web pages can be painfully slow as well--it sometimes reminds me of being on dialup. However, I do appreciate being able to do all this on my phone. Aside from these two issues, I otherwise really like this phone (or maybe it is more accurate to say I really like Android, the swype keyboard, and the apps I have downloaded). The camcorder is descent. The camera is ok in a pinch--the quality is not great and the zoom is not useful. It certainly can't, as I hoped, replace my digital camera (which is at least 7 years old). I guess there's a trade off when you have these all-in-one devices.But it seems to me I will eventually need to \"root\" my phone and do some things that other reviewers have mentioned to resolve the space and speed issues. I am giving the phone 3 stars for this reason. I shouldn't have to hack and tinker with the phone (or in my case get someone to hack and tinker with it for me) to that extent to get it to perform better. I paid a lot more than 90-something dollars for this phone (although the virgin mobile plan was cheaper back then so, that makes up for it I guess).So before settling on this phone, see if there is another one that also gives you more internal memory and better performance when accessing the web.

The ex has had him on some cheapo LG Rumor like phone & stuck with Verizon for the last two years - contract is up and I'm not letting her renew.  Here's why:  For the last 2 years, I've been paying 29/mo, on top of a phone that cost me 149/upfront.  She paid 'only' 49.00 for my son's phone but, the plan adds 60+/mo to her contract = family plan + data+ text + minutes + taxes + fees + who knows what the heck most of those charges are for.Meanwhile, I've been paying 29/mo.  That's it.  29 plus a buck for sales tax.  No fees, no weird surcharges, no having to scrutinize the bill, no class action lawsuits and, most of all, no counting texts or watching internet usage and, thanks to SIPP and Google Voice, no worries about long distance or minutes either - just 29 bucks and done.Yeah, the phone itself doesn't have much internal memory but, I slid in a 16gig microSD card and, no problem - every app, mp3 and video I need is right there.  And really, you don't really need to carry it all with you.  I work at a desk all day and, all day, I'm streaming from Google Music, Amazon Cloud player, Pandora, the BBC, TuneIn Radio, Spotify (yeah, literrally, 8 to 12 hours a day, all day, no problem and no worries).  Oh, and Virgin Mobile Live, free app on the phone, is not to shabby a station either, and it streams, all day.Before even talking about the phone, let me just say that I don't need to live my life in fear of my texting limits, voice minutes, or data caps and that means that I have a phone I can actually use.  My Verizon & ATT friends live in fear - need I say more about the number one purpose for having an Android phone in the first place?The phone itself can be made to tether to my iPod, iPad or my son's DS which, we do occasionally but, since everything is on the Android phone anyway, why bother.  Its there if I need it, which is great because it sucks to need something and not have it...almost as much as paying an extra 25/mo to get it from Verizon or ATT and never use it.So 2 years and, although I was thinking about upgrading to the latest greatest in Virgin's mobile stable, I think that I'm going to stick with this one for now.  I saw that they lowered the price of the phone, and raised the price of my plan to 35/mo (all us old faithful users are grandfathered at the old price) but, still a bargain!Bottom line:  if you're going to use your phone for stuff, and use it often, and don't want to live in fear of the 'bill shock' this is a great carrier/phone combo.  No, its not the latest dual core gHz AMOLED ice cream sandwiched techno-masterpiece, its just a work horse that does 99% of what you need.  GPS, no problem:  I'm an avid Google Maps user, and every day I use CardioTrainer to track my running/biking/hiking - flawless.  Social networking:  I'm using the Google+ app, works fine, as does Twitter (eesh, and Facebook if you have to).  Text:  Get Google Voice ASAP - flawless.  Tunes: Audible, Pandora, Slacker, Spotify, Virgin Mobile Live, Sticher, and so many more.  I check out video from CNET and have used other apps but, can't speak much to that other than to say it works fine.  Games:  Yeah, Angry Birds et al works fine, at least according to my son, who never stops playing that and the other 200+ games we've accumulated (thanks Amazon free app of the day!).As long as I've mentioned it, definitely download the Amazon apps, including the cloud MP3 player.  Just beware, buying MP3's is like an addiction to crack - way too easy and very satisfying in the short run (so I'm told).  Way to often I'll hear something on Pandora, pop over to the Amazon MP3 app and, 3 to 8 bucks and 10 seconds later, I'm listening to the album.But hey, with the, literally, 80/mo extra it would cost (and I'm not paying) for an equivalent plan from Verizon, I can afford it :-)  I can also afford the Pandora upgrade, Hearts of Space for a year, Spotify Ultimate each month, an OnLive subscription (got a beta for the phone, works fine but, also tethers to the iPad, where it really works great) and, a few MP3 albums to my iTunes collection each month.By the way, Spotify syncs your iTunes (music, podcasts) automatically over Wi-Fi to the phone as soon as I get home (but everything is also there via Amazon's cloud and 3G) so, it plays nice with Apple.  Also, as soon as I walk into my home's Wi-Fi net, pictures and videos upload automatically to my Mac via Google+.  It's really a sweet setup and totally painless to set up.Doing the math, I can buy 5 of these phones (me, my ex, my son, and our 2 nephews), pay for their termination fees, and pay for the monthly bill for all of them, and still pay less than the cost of 1 to 2 hideous Verizon/ATT plans for with all the minutes, data, tethering, texting and 'stuff' that they charge you for.  Literally, I'm looking at the Verizon bill for the two of them and its over 250 bucks and I'm really not sure what some of that stuff is, just that the Verizon Rep says those things have to be on it.And since most of the rest of my family lives in Asia and Europe, using Android SIPP clients (via Google Voice) to call them for free, well, that saves another bunch each month - plus via Google+ and hangouts, we can literally just 'hang out' with video and voice for hours on end.That brings up one annoyance since the video 'hangout' became popular among friends, family and work - no front facing camera.  But I remedied that with an external bluetooth vid-cam, as well as bluetooth stereo headset/mic I use while jogging (works great).  Problem solve, probably would have done it that way eventually anyway (I get tired of looking up my son's nose while he talks).  As for memory, I move every app to the SD card if it can go and tend not to use those that won't.I bought another one of these just too goof around with and root - gingerbread and ice cream sandwich work and look great on this phone and there are some nice custom ROMs out there if you're so inclined.  Virgin/Sprint say a Gingerbread upgrade is in the works but, I wouldn't hold my breath.  Android 2.2 is kind of old but, nevertheless, if you're looking for something that just works, it may be old but its very dependable (eg: stable, doesn't crash and I can always take a call no matter what's running - that's what phones are for, right?)Said much more than I meant too so, let me say this to wrap it up (the real bottom line, promise):  this is the Honda Civic of phones and service.  You have to pay a little more up front, and you know that you're not getting the latest in car stereo's or flashy trim but, you also know that a Civic will always get you to work, sip gas, and you won't need to budget each month for repairs.  At the current price, you don't even have to pay a lot up front.In other words, this phone will not impress your local barista techno fashion wannabes but you will NOT feel any remorse if you find something you like better 6 months from now, drop it in the toilet, or leave it at the restaurant.  You won't worry about handing it to the kids to play games while out at the restaurant, or dropping it, jogging with it if it looks like it might rain and, if Virgin's service doesn't fly for you, well, you're not really out anything and you're not tied to a contract for the next 2 years.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I ditched my iPhone for this thing.

I don't like plans that require 2 year contracts, I would much rather pay the full un-subsidized cost of the phone than have that built into my plan, forcing me to subsidize everyone else's expensive phones.I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for an entry level android phone.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A really good phone", "Author": "Marina", "ReviewID": "R27CQFKBI62XSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone.

Switched to Virgin based on the no-contract and the cheap unlimited plan. As far as service, these are great. The only places we can't seem to pick up signals are in the remote Midwest (but, AT&T; & Sprint don't pick up there either, it's expected) and some of the remote beaches I hit on the East Coast (though, who really wants to be interrupted by a cell phone on a remote beach).Phone worked absolutely wonderfully for the first several months. Now, both mine and my boyfriends phones, act up on a pretty regular basis. Phone doesn't ring, but goes straight to voicemail whenever it shows \"full bars\". Sometimes the screen goes blank and you can't end a call or dial a call. Fortunately, the battery is accessible on these (unlike the iPhone) so you can easily pop it out and back in, but really, I shouldn't have to do this. Last night my phone went unresponsive. Touch screen stopped working. Had a phone call coming in (phone was ringing, but the screen was not showing the call, nor giving the option to answer) again, had to pop the battery out to get it to act normal again. I'd say that each of us have an issue with the phone that requires a battery removal 3-4 times a week.If this was happening to one phone, I would say that one of us had a bad egg, but these problems are constant with both. If we didn't travel so much to other parts of the country, I would assume some of it was a local network issue, but the same thing will happen to us (screen unresponsive) when we're on opposite coasts.  We've both wiped our phones clean of apps and restored the factory settings, in case it was something we downloaded.

My work and social life didn't require anything fancier, and the simpler phones generally held up better than my colleagues smart phones.  However, after expanding my business, it's become necessary to own an Android smartphone that enables me to conduct my everyday duties.  As well, it would be nice to own a fun handset.I did a lot of research, comparing cellular carriers in my area (particularly the Chicagoland suburbs), and it turned out Virgin Mobile - with the LG Optimus V smartphone - was just perfect for me.  Virgin Mobile, using Sprint's network as its backbone, has always provided great coverage in and around the cities and states I work in.  For service, I signed up for the $25/month service.  300 anytime talk minutes and unlimited data and text suits me just fine.  I've never gotten close to my limit.  Virgin Mobile throttles 3G data after a 2GB cap, but I've never gotten close to that (I rely on encrypted wi-fi in most of my offices).  As a Virgin Mobile customer for years, and I've always been pleased with their cellular service, and their customer service.  I'm paying less than most of my friends, however I feel I get comparable service - sometimes even better service (especially the poor souls with AT&T;, who can't get a dependable signal in the Chicago Loop area).  The 3G download and upload speeds are comparable to other 3G service in my area.  I average 2000 kb/s, at home, and get even faster speeds in downtown Chicago.  An added bonus with Virgin Mobile's no-contract service, is that I'm not locked into some draconian service plan.  Nice!My roommate and several of my pals have the T-Mobile G2X (a.k.a., the Optimus 2X), and the Optimus V compares quite favorably.  While the more-expensive G2X has a nicer camera, LED flash bulb, a slightly nicer screen, more internal memory and a faster CPU...  Truthfully, I think the Optimus V is only just slightly less awesome than the G2X.  And, in the areas where the Optimus V are weaker, they really don't faze me.  I don't need a powerhouse phone - but even when I'm playing games or editing photos, I feel like the Qualcomm 600 MHz CPU holds up just fine.  It's still the most powerful phone I've owned, and is no slouch against other same-generation smartphones I've used.The Optimus V and very open Android Froyo 2.2.1 OS, really does suit my needs quite perfectly.  I can run the latest builds of Opera Mobile, TeamViewer (remote control software), Square with the little credit card reader, Hulu Plus, Netflix movies, Avast Antivirus, MyBackup Pro, Facebook, Cerberus (tracking software), PDF and e-book reader, Springpad, RadioReference Scanner Radio, Groundspeak geocaching app, MortPlayer multi-format music player, Zedge, multi-format QQPlayer for videos, WiGLE war driving, and many other apps - including the occasional game and augmented reality apps.  Additional perks are Google Suite integration, Gmail, Google Contact, Google Calendar, YouTube videos, Google Maps, and Google GPS Navigation.  The Android operating systems makes it super-easy to customize.  Custom wallpapers, ringtones, alarm clocks, animated screen savers, advanced launchers, custom security lockout screens and more are available online.  There really isn't any part of this phone I can't customize to my liking, WITHOUT having to root it (which I hear is fairly easy).It's a fine form factor - 113.5 mm (4.47 in) tall, 59 mm (2.3 in) wide, and 13.3 mm (0.52 in) thick.  With the stock 1500 mAh battery, it weighs a comfortable 129 g (4.6 oz).  The battery life is a little better than the G2X under similar usage, and there are higher-capacity batteries available.  As well, there are a ton of accessories available for the Optimus V.  With a little shopping around, I found numerous cases, screen protection, charges, data cables - all for super cheap.  I added in a 32GB micro SDHC card, and it instantly recognized it.  Connected to my computer, via USB micro cable, it was instantly recognized and mounted on Windows XP, Vista, and Win7.  After months of daily usage, after loading a myriad of apps, I haven't had any major crashes.  The touchscreen is very precise and sensitive, allowing for complex actions and quick typing (I've since started using Swype).  The speakers and mic are pretty good, with no complaints about call quality.  The voice recognition works really well, either with the built in microphone or using a headset.  The external jack works fine, though I only use it for the Square card reader.  For hands free, I use a Bluetooth headset - all of which, I was able to easily pair up.  All of the buttons are sturdy, and offer a satisfying click when pressed.  After months of use, the buttons still feel good as new.  The camera isn't too shabby in adequate light, either, with automatic geotagging.  Video recording is also quite good, for a phone.  A feature that comes in real handy, is that you can use the phone as a mobile hotspot, with the use of a free app.  This really is a well-designed handset, and never seems to freeze or crash, after months of extensive use.Am I the envy of owners of Apple iHype products or state-of-the-art Android handsets?  Doubt it.  Virgin Mobile may not be the sexiest of service providers, and the LG Optimus V isn't the most vogue handset.  Do I care?  Heck no!  Honestly, I'm PROUD to own a phone that is reasonably powerful, stable, energy efficient, and bargain priced.

It locks up repeatedly and has to be restarted multiple times per day.  It's probably a good phone for people who do minimal web surfing, if that's not you get something a little more robust.  I'm waiting for black friday to see if I can get a good deal on an Evo, if not I'll buy one anyway.  I do not recommend this phone though overall I'm still happy with Virgin.**Two months later I'm slightly less impressed with the phone.  The good news of my update is that I got better than expected service when I left my metro area (specifically going down highway 5 from the Bay Area to LA).  The bad (#1) is that it locks up a lot, I was once unable to to answer a call because the the phone locked.  The second issue is customer service, as I was warned, could use improvement.  My wife let her battery die (after which we were unable to recharge it) and we called to ask for a replacement.  A week later I went to a battery shop and thankfully found one since Virgin hadn't sent one yet (and 5 weeks later they still haven't).That said, I still think it's worth the headaches to save $50 per month on my cell phone bill and overall my experience has been positive.----------I was actually happy with my Evo and even as recently as a few months ago intended for it to be my last phone for well beyond the time my Sprint contract terminated.  But I thought there had to be more cost effective ways of having smartphone service so after a not very long search decided on Virgin Mobile.  I looked into their plans and calculated that the cost of 2 new Droids (Optimus V's) and my early termination fee would be recouped after about 8 months paying $50 per month less.  So I decided to take the plunge (after educating myself about the plusses and minuses) and overall I'm glad I did.  As I expected, the Optimus isn't as good a phone as my Evo was, but it is a solid one.  The pros and cons:Pros:1. It actually has a better Calendar IMO than the EVO does that displays an agenda.  So you get a list of your upcoming events rather than trying to remember the dates and tracking them down.2. The battery life is much better than my EVO's wasNeutrals:1. All the apps I used on my EVO work well2. Some people have complained about being able to hear or be heard when they talked on the phone.  I haven't had a single problem with that.3. Screen freezes up every now and then4. Smaller screen than my Evo hadCons:1. Coverage was better with Sprint in the major metro area I live in though I've had few problems getting 3G access when I wanted it.  I don't look forward to being in more remote locations.  I use WiFi at home and it's worked great.2. I could not get it to pair with my car's bluetooth (turned out to be a blessing in disguise, it drove me to buy a bluetooth with FM transmitter which I now use to listen to Tunein Radio over my car's speakers).3. No 4G4. Bookmarks aren't as easy to access though it just takes a couple of more taps to get them.So yes the Evo was better than my Optimus, and yes Sprint had better coverage than Virgin does, but was that worth spending an extra $600 per year?  It wasn't to me.  I doubt I'll ever have a contract carrier again.  And on a side note, I was able to sell my Evo and my wife's Hero for prices that knocked nearly 4 months off of the 8 months I originally thought it would take to make up for the money I put out to make the switch.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone is good but not great", "Author": "Joe V \"Joe V\"", "ReviewID": "R2VBUL5YMHG6JB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: InexpensiveAvailable through Virgin Mobile - no contract, and $40/month for 1200 minutes and unlimited text/data.Feels like a good quality phoneI love the Android OSSwype is very coolCons:Battery life is shortScreen is on the smaller sideStock keyboard is frustratingly inaccurateVirgin Mobile disabled some WiFi hotspotThis is my first Android phone. I upgraded from a Blackberry Pearl 8130 which I kept through a 3-year contract. It was getting quite stale, to say the least. I'm quite pleased with the functionality, speed, and customization options with this phone and the Android OS. This is my first Android phone and I just cannot put the thing down. I want to download tons of apps and customize this phone and the Android Market and the world of apps available make this very easy to do.Phone calls: Overall call quality and speakerphone is good.Android OS: Excellent, I love how many things can be customized and further customized through apps or mods. Android syncs with your Google account so it will pick up uncommon words, like a last name, street name, etc. as long as they are stored somewhere in your Gmail or Google account. This is kind of creepy but really cool because I just entered my Gmail and everything is ready to go. I was contemplating an iPhone but now I'm seriously considering upgrading to a nice dual core Android phone sometime next year. Android just has so many options.Camera: 3.2 MP is OK but not on part with the iPhone or some of the nice 5 or 8 MP phones. The video is \"meh\", but I'm not making movies with this thing.Screen: One the smaller side but quite beautiful, despite the lower resolution than most of the higher-end phones on the market.Performance: Pretty fast but you have to learn to kill apps to keep it at its best and from sapping battery life with background apps. This performs better than the specs would suggest.Keyboard:One of the major cons with this phone is the keyboard is not very accurate when tapping out words. I have larger fingers but my wife got the same phone and her small fingers still result in inaccurate taps. The savior to the crappy keyboard is the Swype feature.Overall, I'm pleased with the service through Virgin Mobile. I live close to a major interstate with a Sprint cell tower not too far from home. I never have less than three bars, even when inside of my brick house, and my 3G does not disconnect like many people have claimed. All three of the Virgin Mobile plans (25/40/60) are great deals and cannot be beat. The only drawback to VM is that Sprint towers just don't cover rural areas. I can drive a half hour into the country and have virtually no service. I went on a road trip from Seattle, WA to Jackson, MS and had no service at all between Spokane, WA and Sioux City, SD. That included stops in Missoula, MT, Bozeman, MT, and Rapid City, SD. Once I got to Sioux City I had decent service for most of the way to Jackson, MS.So, all in all I'm quite pleased with this purchase and have recommended it to multiple friends looking for new phones with inexpensive, no strings attached plans.Update: April 13, 2012The phone is still going strong. One major complaint I have - VERY LOW internal storage. You can only download a few apps before you start receiving low storage space warnings. Second, the battery life gets worse as the battery ages. I want a new phone, but I'm holding out for an iPhone on Virgin Mobile because as much as I love the look and feel of the iPhone, I just cannot justify paying such high monthly usage fees to the cartel of contract cell carriers. I'm confident Apple will get on the ball and release either an iPhone 4 or 4s to the prepaid carriers later this year, I'm pretty sure I would be happy with either of those options, mainly due to the relatively massive internal storage and the excellent battery life.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great first smartphone, w/ $25/month internet!", "Author": "Mike Cary", "ReviewID": "RLNRVXGZ8DGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Smartphone.

The Virgin CUSTOMERNOSERVICE Rep could not tell me what to do when I saw the green padlock symbol and the silver-grey volume button on my screen.

Then, merely by chance, I slid my finger on one of them and it moved!  Who'd a thought?  Duh!I messed around with it long enough to know I didn't know what I was doing and ended up in an Android forum just for this phone: [...] Lots of good info on some apps to install, some apps to delete, some apps to avoid - the forum, and what people have done with the Optimus got me loving this phone instantly.  If you're as new to Smartphones as I was, check it out.Since I use Gmail, getting my email on here was easy.  My contacts appeared instantly, as did my calendar.  Love that syncability.Haven't had any dropped calls in my first two months - clarity has been fine.  It is a little hard to see the phone's screen to make calls in the bright sunlight.For the Internet, I use the 3G when I am away from phone, WIFI when I am at home - It all works well for me.  I downloaded a bunch of apps from the Android Market app store, and also some from the Amazon Android app store.I'm not a texting person - if I were, I know I would consider a phone with a dedicated keyboard.  I see other folks, more skilled than I, using these phones one-handed, so it works okay, I guess.The Camera works simply, both as still photos and videos.  Using Dropbox to transfer files to and from my computers is a snap.  Plugging in the USB cord to my Mac computer allows me to transfer Podcasts and Audible books that I used to use on my MP3 player.  When I traveled out of town, I used the Navigation app and the Maps app to replace my old Garmin auto navigation device.  So the Optimus allows me to travel with two less pieces of electronics, and assorted cables, adaptors, etc.I charge the battery nightly; I also have a charger for the car, which works as well.

I am a teen who only gets about $60 a month for working a job, and has always wanted an Android cell phone, especially for developing apps. All phones from carriers other than Virgin Mobile were way too pricey for my budget, so I decided to get the Optimus V from Virgin Mobile.I got the Optimus V for the $150 promotion at Radio Shack, a great deal, especially since it's off contract. The plans are absolutely amazing; $25 a month for 300 minutes and unlimited texting and 3G data. A similar phone on Sprint -- whose network this phone runs on -- would cost at least $80 a month for 400 minutes. I took my phone home, and was happy for the first few days. I was loving the stock Android 2.2, hating the skins put on other phones. Build quality is great, with one exeption: the soft-plastic battery cover -- it add a cheap feeling to an otherwise solid phone. The 3.2 megapixel camera is -- well, it's a cellphone camera. Pictures were sharper in daylight, but once indoors, thing can become a blurry mess if you don't have a steady hand. Data speeds were average for 3G, and I could get about 600-800 Kb/second download. Then, the data issues struck.3G data would work maybe half the time. I could always get signal -- it was just that data was simply not working. The issues went away for a while, then they came back. Even when we took our trip to Hawaii, the data wasn't working there. I thought it was a problem with my software; I formatted my SD card and did a factory reset, but it didn't help. I looked around on some forums and I found that there were problems with VM's network. I decided I would just tough it out for a while.I also noticed that a few small scratches appeared on my screen. I absolutely hate even the tiniest scratches, so I ran over to my local mall and got an InvisibleShield for my phone.Finally, the 3G issues resolved. I could get reliable data service, now. I experimented with rooting and installed CyanogenMod 7 with Gingerbread on it and overclocked to 806 MHz; it ran as smooth as an iPhone 4. I could get battery life in excess of 36 hours. Then, the worst problem of them all: my headphone jack broke.No sound from media applications would come out the speakers. No keypad tones would sound. My phone thought I had a pair of headphones in it, even when I didn't. The microphone wouldn't work on anything, assuming that I had a microphone on my nonexistant headset. However, on the flip side, sound would not come out the earpiece when making a call; it would only come out through the speaker. I was forced to always use headphones for about a week, and I had to accept every call on speakerphone. I tried every solution to try and fix it, hoping there was simply a stuck trigger or something. I jammed toothpicks, Q-tips, other headphones, and even WD-40 in there, but with no luck. Again, I tried a factory reset and SD card format, but no help. Finally, I had enough. I sent it in for repairs though LG -- a horrible ordeal -- and have yet to get it back.EDIT: I finally got my phone back from LG after 11 days. The headphone jack problem was fixed. Had no problem reactivating it. However, I was extremely dissapointed to find that my InvisibleShield was removed. This really frustrated me because I payed $15 for it, and there was most likely no need to remove it. I checked to make sure it was the same phone and that they had not just sent me a refurbished phone; the S/N and the MEID were the same as when I sent it in. Lame, LG!Pros:1.

With Virgin, you also get excellent data speeds and call quality. On top of that, its only $35 a month... Beat that, other carriers! The Optimus is an excellent Android phone for starters, and is arguably the best phone on Virgin's lineup (the Triumph and Optimus Slider are also very good phones).The phone itself is made very well and is solid, with a rubbery plastic shell, but I put a case OtterBox Commuter Case for LG Optimus - Black - Retail Packaging on it just for peace of mind.The 3.2 inch screen is bright and vivid. Although it is by no means cramped, the screen is a bit on the smaller side. Swype is nice once you get used to it, but I still prefer a regular keyboard to swiping. Quite surprisingly, I made very few mistakes while typing in portrait mode, and I have large-medium sized hands. I use landscape mode most of the time for typing, though, where the keys are much larger.The stock Android 2.2 (READ: no overlay interface) is very user-friendly. I have used many mobile OSes, and I would have to say that Android is probably my favorite. Plus, the Optimus One series are all being updated to 2.3, so let's hope Virgin gives us the 2.3 update.The network/3G data speeds are normally very fast and the call quality is great as well (no dropped calls... Yet). Virgin uses Sprint's cell towers/network for data and voice service, but, unlike Sprint phones, Virgin cannot roam on to other CDMA carriers like Verizon. That means that if you leave a Sprint area, you are stuck without service until you reenter a Sprint coverage area. Before buying, make sure you live in an area that Virgin reaches (you can check on their website)The phone's 600Mhz processor sounds slow in comparison to newer phones, yet it handles multitasking and all of my apps just fine with the occasional slowdown. Speaking of apps, there are plenty available on the Android Market.The 3.2MP camera works very well in both low and outdoor lighting conditions. The camera button on the side is a two-stage button: press slightly for autofocus, press all the way in to take the picture.The phone comes with a 2GB MicroSD card, but I upgraded to an 8GB Class 6 (a Transcend  8 GB microSDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GUSDHC6E), which increases access speed to the SD card. The internal memory on the phone is very low, and the NON REMOVABLE bloatware only limits the number of apps you can have (even if you move them to the SD)... Probably the worst part about the phone. The only way to get rid of the apps is if you Root the phone, but I don't want to mess around with it.With a task killing app and battery-saving settings, I get exactly 2 days of battery with medium use, which is great for an Android phone.

I orignally tried the LG Rumor Touch and was having way too many issues with the phone, so I returned it.Then a month or so later,  I saw a commercial for this little gem. I instantly started to research information about this phone and was sold, being as this as exactly what I was hoping the Rumor Touch would be. I am dissapointed to find out my SD card is not fully utilized. I thought this would give my phone extra memory and even moving some apps to the SD card, at least the ones that allow it, barely uses any space on the SD card.But that is a small issue that is easily overlooked.I am in love with this phone! I love the Navigation feature and that I can speak the name of my location and it will search for it and bring up a list of close locations. On a few occasions, it has totally missed what I spoke. No matter where I am, when I ask for Joanns Fabrics, it will bring up locations in Texas and I am in Wisconsin. Overall, it has saved me on several occasions. This has definitely replaced my Garmin.I downloaded an app called QR Droid that I use while shopping, it helps me research for the best price and also I can search Amazon's reviews. Which is a HUGE factor in my purchasing decisions.I have also downloaded an app called Quick Settings that enables me to access to shut off WiFi, GPS, all those little features that can drain your battery. In that app, it also has a flash light as well. Very bright LED flashlight, which is awesome! And I always know where my phone is at, whereas as much as I try to keep a small flashlight in my purse, either my kids drain the batteries, or they die on their own or quite simply any flashlight in our house, never gets put back where it belongs. With this on my phone, I always have that handy.The camera is OK. Indoors it doesn't work to well in dim lighting. But I recently took some photos of outdoors of fresh fallen snow and those turned out amazing! I would have never known they were from a cell phone if it wasn't me who took them.After owning this phone, I do not know how my life existed before this!UPDATE 4/27/12 :I have been having issues with this phone running out of space and I have been sacrificing apps that I feel I don't use enough or can live without in order to keep my more important apps. I was getting a tad frustrated, so I started searching online what could be my issues. I found  a website that recommends App Tyrant, which I HIGHLY recommend. You can go through your apps and clean the cache and data from the apps. I went from having 17 mbs available and now have 50 mbs available. I know that will start to dwindle as my apps update, but it was nice that I could remove data/cache from the apps that were preinstalled with the phone that I don't use at all, which I am sure took a lot of space as well. And now when updates come through for those apps, I will elect to NOT update those.I also have found information in which to be able to move apps to your SD card without rooting your phone, which rooting makes me nervous, since one wrong move, you can end up with a trash phone.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value, some annoyances", "Author": "Jacob Denhollander \"Uncle Chicken\"", "ReviewID": "R37B0M5845XRI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this is a great phone for the money. I plan on rooting it at some point because the processor is a little slow and I'd like to overclock it. For anyone who isn't a power-user, this phone will work great. I've had this phone for about two months, and the following things are what I like and dislike most about the phone:Keyboard, Swype, and Voice input:I've used iOs and I think that the combination of Swype and voice input make Android a far superior choice for texting and typing. I don't text a lot, but the Swype feature works far better than I expected it to, and the voice recognition is also very, very accurate.Android marketplace:It's got everything you need.Performance: I find that it lags for me on some applications; Again, I have realistic expectations for this phone and don't expect Galaxy II or Iphone 4s like performance.Camera: Is really actually pretty poor, but it's a $100 phone, can't expect much Battery life:This seems to be a common complaint on Android phones. The battery will last a little over a day on standby, but if you are actively using it (especially if you are playing games), the battery will last 8 hours, if you are lucky. Internal storage:This is probably the most irritating thing for me. I bought a 32GB card to store apps, music, and whatnot, but some apps HAVE to be on the internal space, which is extremely limited (200MB). Even more irritating is the fact that the pre-loaded apps cannot be deleted, as they sit in the root file and cannot be removed unless you root the phone (which voids the warranty). I don't use Twitter, so why should I HAVE to have a twitter app loaded on my phone? Reception:Not really the phones fault, but since moving to Louisville, my 3G speeds are slow and I drop calls more often. It would be worth your time to check out Sprint's reputation for coverage in your area.All in all, if you are looking to be on your phone ALL the time, I'd not buy this phone as it's limitations will become onerous to you in short order.

Calling their support wasn't as painful as I thought it would be, and they were able to reset it for me and get me all signed up.  They said it could take several hours for the number to be transferred, but it was probably done in about 20 minutes or so.I like the swype feature of the phone.  It does take some getting used to, but once you get used to it, it's a breeze to text, etc.  I used to have a really hard time hearing callers from my old LG Vu phone.  The Optimus doesn't have that problem at all.  The camera is alright.  I've taken a few photos and sometimes they come out blurry.I did have trouble getting it to go online, but found out if you turn it off and then back on, chances are it will reconnect.  What I do seem to have troubles with is the wifi, at least from home.  It seems like it connects, but may disconnect itself and I'm not sure why it does that.Battery life is ok.  I do notice this wears down faster than my old phone.  But I tend to put my phone on the charger every night anyway so it's usually always charged and at the end of the day there is still life left on it.Overall I'm really happy with this phone and its features.

For the price, there's not much to compare it to. Through Virgin Mobile, I pay $25 a month for unlimited text/data, and 300 minutes. I bought the phone from Best Buy for around $130. I was grateful that there was finally an affordable smart phone on the market.The problem? Almost from the day I got it, I could tell that this phone isn't up to par. Apps take a long time to load, don't load, or even crash the whole system. There are some apps, specifically higher quality games, that will waste half my battery before finally loading. Even texting/calling messes up. It's happened a few times that the phone froze mid-call, disabling me from disconnecting. I had to take the battery out to disconnect the call. In fact...I have to take the battery out to solve about 30% of the app-crashing problems. The longer I had the phone, the worse it got.Battery life is poor. Without apps like Juice Defender (helps to conserve battery life by disabling data connections, etc), it doesn't last long. I don't think I've ever gone a full day without using data, so I can't tell for sure what it's like if you just text/call. One time, I accidentally left my phone at home for the day. I came home to a completely depleted battery (5% or less) 11 hours later. I had received zero calls and less than five texts.I've also noticed that the phone overheats pretty easily. Literally overheats. The battery gets hot to the touch (not more than 90-100 degrees). This greatly diminishes its ability to work normally.Like I said, nothing can beat Virgin Mobile prices. When I got this phone, it was one of the best that they offered. Even though I have issues with this phone (and sometimes VM in general), no way would I pay traditional cell phone bills.

I have no complaints about Sprint and it actually works better than AT&T; in our home. Looking for a \"better way\", I came across the Virgin Mobile Optimus LG prepaid for $120. Then I read \"ajpd's\" review about WIFI only and got even more interestedFirst-the phone. This is actually better than my existing Hero. It is faster and more responsive (expected as the Hero is two years old). However if has some improved features. The desk clock is better, it has a great News and Weather app based on Google (accessed by tapping on the weather). A dynamite version of Speed Dial that uses a picture on your home screen and easier to use buttons. And, of course, free GPS that makes Garmin, Tom-Tom and Apple weep.Second-using WiFi (or VOIP). During my final 30 days, I decided to try using the phone without activating it. I am a long time user of Google Voice. I have one number that rings my cell (on Sprint), my wife's cell (iPhone on AT&T;) and my computer (Google chat). That system works far better than you can imagine. As long as both I and my wife keep our contacts current, caller ID lets us know who should answer the phone over 95% of the time. Besides, the spam filter on Google Voice is worth it alone. I bought Groove IP ($4.99 on Android Market). I did not buy Sipdroid or use PBXes. I set Grove IP up for WiFi only. If you read the instructions, it says to disable the cell phone on Google Voice. Not necessary. Since, call 1, my Optimus rings along with both cell's and my computer. A couple minor adjustments on echo cancellation and I am home free. Very impressive.Now I have three choices. Activate my phone and pay the $35.00/ month-far less than the $69.00/mo. on Sprint. As most minutes will be over WiFi, get the cheapest option. (2)not activate the phone-but lose navigation and emergency use.

I tried the Samsung Intercept for that reason, but the processor in that thing is too slow, making programs like maps and youtube pointless.  However, the process of converting my service to a new phone has been PAINFUL.This phone, as another user commented, is connected to the Virgin Mobile service.  Unlike a more expensive service like Verizon, your customer service calls go to the Phillipines, where attendants are speaking according to a menu, and there is an irksome delay.  It is very difficult and time consuming to get anything important through to the next tier of tech crew in America who can do anything.  In my case, I received a phone from Amazon that had the same Serial # as another user's phone across the state.  I unwittingly activated my service on his phone, and was without my own service for days before I was contacted \"in 1 to 5 business days\" for the first series of troubleshooting (which didn't work).  The more local (I'm assuming east coast) customer rep was really friendly and able to compensate me for the lost time and get the problem worked up another tier.

That means I don't rack up any minutes with Virgin.I think that Virgin Mobile is worth it for their $25/mo plan (300 min, unlimited data/text) - at that price, I feel I am getting what I paid for. They just raised their prices to $35/mo for 300 anytime minutes, unlimited data and texting, and $45 for a 1200 min plan (that's right, nothing in between).

This phone is just as good as newer models, you just have to use your brain. This being an older phone (almost 2 years since it was released) it obviously has an older version of android in it. Instead of complaining about not being able to download certain apps, the simple solution would be to download them from a free website such as androiddrawer.com which keeps older versions of apps up for free so that people with older phones can still download the apps that they love.  The second thing is to remember these are phones, not gaming systems. If you buy a phone just to play angry birds on it, then spend the extra cash and get a nice iPad. Even with the tiny 2gb memory card that it comes with, I am still able to fit all of the apps that I use daily, such as google voice (i use this for free texting and calls when I run out of service), pinterest, instagram, facebook, twitter, my bank apps, words with friends, amazon, redbox, ect...  \"regular\" apps will work just fine on this. Again, NOT A GAMING SYSTEM. Any phone, no matter how big the internal memory, is going to fill up fast if you download unnecessary games. If you INSIST on playing huge games, the simple solution is to buy a bigger memory card (up to 32gb), and download the .apk file onto your computer, save it on the memory card, and then put the memory card back in your phone.  A lot of the other problems I see people complaining about do not even have anything to do with the phone itself, but is a problem with Virgin Mobile service. You get what you pay for. Plus, VM only allows users, even with unlimited data, to have so many gbs of data per month. This is in the small print when you activate your phone with them.

I also find that is works better if I make sure I turn the phone off and on every few days.

CPU downclocking when its not in use saves TONS of battery, awesome screen effects, everything looks and runs very well. Going from a 1ghz snapdragon to this with cyanogenmod; the change is barely noticeable.Phone : It doesnt have an FM radio. I wish it did cause I listen to the radio a lot. No camera flash either, meaning no flashlight app (I used this often on my incredible). Poor but acceptable quality camera. Physical keys can be annoying. Screen is NOT glass. Its a $100 phone, you get what you pay for in features but the build quality is pretty good.Service : Activating the phone was great! The guy i talked to was easy to understand and very nice. Transfering my number took under an hour, I started the $35 a month plan online with a debit card, easy peasy. As far as coverage goes, RESULTS WILL VARY! I cannot believe people complain about coverage on their reviews of this phone, its sprints fault, not the phone. In Grand Rapids, MI, we get good coverage. Download speeds are decent (of course slower than verizon. 20+ verizon towers vs sprint's 2), call coverage is fine, I havent dropped a call or had 0 bars yet.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Always Low On Space", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R22O365TLG7QSC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "(Note: I did not purchase this phone through Amazon)I've been using this phone since about mid-December.

Willard", "ReviewID": "RQLR1J17YGDGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nobody has ever matched Virgin Mobile for no-contract, low-cost cell phone plans. Now, after years of offering comparatively inept phones, it's nice to see them finally upgrading their lineup to include a selection of decent smart phones. Of course, buying a phone without getting roped into a two-year contract involves paying a fair price up front for the phone itself. So you have to weigh the benefits of getting a remarkably inexpensive no-contract provider plan against the higher initial cost of the phone itself.For me, that's a no-brainer. Virgin Mobile's $35 a month basic smartphone plan (unlimited internet and text with 300 unlimited talk minutes a month, or $15 more for unlimited talk) is ridiculously cheap.The LG Optimus V is arguably the best Android smartphone currently being offered by Virgin Mobile, and it's a very solid performer in most respects. Phone call clarity is excellent with no static, bad connections or dropped calls here in Southern California. The display is big, bright and easy to read. Buttons and basic functions are conveniently located, easy to learn and navigate. It's thin, reasonably small and light for a smartphone, with a pleasing finish. Apps and websites open fast, the touchscreen response is precise, and after a very short period of familiarization this is a phone you'll be comfortable using for everything from simple phone calls to internet access and texting.It's certainly a Best Buy in a smartphone for what it delivers at the price, even without considering the bargain plans Virgin Mobile offers.The biggest disappointment with the Optimus V is the 3.2 megapixel camera. There's no built-in flash, and picture quality should be a lot better, even in bright sunlight. That's not a deal-breaker for most people, just a criticism that LG should take to heart. Speaker volume and quality for phone calls, sound files and videos is no better or worse than you'd expect from the tiny built-in speaker, but the ear buds that come with the phone supply excellent sound. Like most phones from mobile providers, there is quite a bit of annoying bloatware built in that can't be deleted, but what else is new?If you're a text or email addict, the on-screen keyboard leaves a lot to be desired, but the Swype function is a tremendous help after you get used to it.Finally, nearly all Android phones suffer from a common problem that gets a lot of negative attention -- short battery life. The Optimus V is no exception. If you subject your phone to more than casual daily use, you'll want to buy a spare battery or two. The good news is that Amazon offers excellent Anker batteries (with a free charger) that actually last 20-25% longer than the OEM battery that comes with the phone.[...]In combination with Virgin Mobile's smart phone plans starting at just $35 a month, the Optimus V is probably the best, most inexpensive smartphone solution you can find, and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good gadget for the $", "Author": "Robert Eugene Reppert \"rrepster\"", "ReviewID": "R38B0LXT649PF5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The VM LG Optimus V is a FANTASTIC phone IF you live in 21st century civilization where Sprint coverage is plentiful - IOW major cities.

It does pretty much everything I want it to. It will not play games that require a lot of processing. This is an entry level Android, let's keep that in mind here.

Most apps work just fine, but I did have issues with \"The Weather Channel\" app, causing the phone to lag/freeze/hang. This phone is more unstable than my old HTC Hero. The Optimus crashes occasionally, usually every few days, more frequently than I like. This is a great smartphone for the person just getting into smartphones or for the low-maintenance user. That being said, LG isn't a leading phone manufacturer and it shows. Overall the phone is responsive and does not lag very much.The real plus here is the service. No contract. The plans that VM offers are unrivaled considering price vs. features. Of course you will want to check your area for coverage (Sprint coverage), but I have been very satisfied with service so far. I ended my service with Sprint to move to VM and I have not noticed any difference, at all. None. And my bill is less than half what it was before with Sprint (on the same network). Now, Sprint's network might not be as strong or good or fast as Verizon, but you pay for what you get. So, if you feel like it's worth it to pay $120 per month for service, then go ahead. But, you can get almost all of the same features, at a slightly slower speed, for 1/3 of the cost here if it is a sacrifice you are willing to make.Bottom line: The LG Optimus V is not the best phone on the market by any means, but it will be more than most of us will ever need.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Minimum plan is now $35", "Author": "ravl13", "ReviewID": "R29GOHKPDOQSDN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great phone for the price, but just giving consumers a heads up that the minimum plan is now $35.

Even with my corporate discount they were stick it to me for 2 line of almost 200 bucks a month.60 of that was just for the data plan! What a joke.  Low and behold I was looking at prepaid as an option. Several people kept talking me out of it. Finally I decided Ill never know if I dont try it.  So I bought the phone, took it home charged it up. Made sure I had signal at the house. Took it to work to check for signal as well. Tested the phone on WIFI and its a nice zippy phone. Can I compare it to my 500 HTC NO. But I decided to pull the trigger and go with the then 60 dollar unlimited plane, which is now 55 a month.  I could not be more happy. Service has been fantastic, web 3G is pretty zippy.

I have had no problem figuring the phone out, just by playing with it. I have read other reviews that claim you can use the phone via wifi without activating the phone, and then you can use Skype to make calls.. I am more than happy with my plan from Virgin. Previous reviewers state they are getting unlimited text and web with 300 mins of talk for 25.00 a month, well the cheapest plan now is 35.00 a month, then 45.00 for 1200 mins, 55.00 for unlimited everything.., try getting that from Verizon or any of the big carriers. Calls are crisp and no dropped calls from my phone or area, (Las Vegas), I may still establish a Skype internet number if I feel I need more talk time, it sounds like a good idea so you don't exceed your minutes.The only thing I find a bit challenging is the on screen keyboard, but, I find the talk to text option very helpful.I read some really great reviews about the phone here before ordering it, and I want to thank the people that took time out to write the reviews.

Even though I absolutely love my iPod Touch and would not mind at all upgrading to an actual iPhone, the AT&T; and Verizon plans on offer just weren't worth it, given the amount of time I typically spend on the phone (not long). What's more, I don't like to be tied down to a long-term contract. How on earth would I know if I'll still be able to make monthly phone payments in two years?Then I heard of Virgin Mobile's \"Beyond Talk\" plans and realized that this was exactly the plan I was looking for if I wanted to upgrade to a smartphone. No long-term contract, and for a mere $35/month you get unlimited data (for email, web browsing, messaging, etc.) plus 300 anytime minutes. Given that this is about what I was paying to top up my minutes on my previous prepaid phone, making the switch was a no-brainer for the chance to get access to email on the go and not just at wifi spots.Of the phones available for purchase on the Beyond Talk plans, the LG Optimus V seemed like the most reasonable and versatile. After about a week of ownership, this opinion has been amply justified. The phone arrived the day after I ordered it (thanks Amazon Prime!) and within fifteen minutes I had activated it on Virgin Mobile's website and was good to go. The touch screen is very responsive, almost at the level of the iPhone, and the apps work briskly and smoothly. So far the Sprint 3G network has been very reliable and quick enough for most purposes.

If I don't look closely I can't tell it's not HD.All in all I am very satisfied with my investment.

Most of the software limitations were easy to fix without much technical know-how. There are a few hardware limitations, but only one (not missed call light) is something I really care about. Your experience might be different based on your requirements. My needs are that of a student who also works part-time in an academic environment.The Good:This is an inexpensive smartphone that has all the basic features necessary for a first-time user of smartphones. While it might lack some bells and whistles of more expensive phones, it still meets my expectations.1) Smooth handling: I found the handling very smooth - clearly the software doesn't overburden the hardware, and it can handle most of the operations I throw at it.2) Easy to root - The rooting procedure is very simple on this phone (I haven't installed the latest updates because it might remove this loophole). Five minutes and I had a rooted phone that greatly enhanced its capabilities.3) Great plans - The Virgin Mobile (VM) plans are among the best I have seen in the US market. I was tied to Sprint (and I know VM uses a lot of Sprint infrastructure) until recently, and though I got a phone \"free\", the data plan, contract and low minutes made me decide to break my contract early. Most carriers (admittedly post-paid) charge about $30 for data alone. I can get a plan for $35 with \"unlimited\" (they throttle speeds after a limit) data, messaging, and 300 minutes.4) VOIP capabilities: Together with GrooveIP and Google Voice (and the data plan/WiFi capabilites), I can make calls for free (i.e. without using my minutes). With the $35 plan, I can effectively make unlimited calls (though call quality might be poor if you don't have good data/WiFi speeds).5) Apps: A smartphone is only as useful as the apps that are available (otherwise, just use a regular phone), and Android has a large number of free and paid apps that I find very useful.6) Exchange support - While I do use a lot of Google services for my personal data, my work is centered around Microsoft Exchange and Windows. I found it easy to link up my Exchange account with the phone. Within a few minutes, I had the phone ready with all my contacts, email, and calendars.The Bad:These are a few limitations that I noticed in the first few weeks of owning the phone:Hardware1) No missed call/message light - This is a very basic limitation that I find mildly annoying. Even the most basic phone I owned had a light that blinked when I had a missed call or message. The only notifications are software notifications that I need to unlock the screen for.2) Low memory: Initially I ran out of memory on the phone, even though I loaded only a handful of apps. I fixed this via rooting and using a memory card, but it still crops up occasionally.3) Battery - All modern smartphones consume a lot of power. I have fixed this by rooting, but atleast 1.5 to 2 days of charge (with moderate use) is something I feel any phone should meet (to be fair, I don't know of any smartphone that achieves this). This device needs to be charged every night with just moderate use (i.e. I do a few hours of email/browsing, half an hour of calls, and play 15 minutes of games). If you spend a lot of time on the road/without charging, you might want to get a spare battery or a different handset.Software1) No signal: When the phone reboots, it uses a lot of battery because (for some strange reason) it keeps searching for a signal even though the has full signal strength. The only solution I found was to switch it to airplane mode for a few seconds and then back to the normal mode.2) No Flash: The default operating system is Froyo (Android 2.2.2) which does not support in-browser flash (so no videos without using a Youtube/Video app)3) Limited default email client: The default email client lacks basic functionality like search, sorting, etc. (This is not the GMail app, but the other email client that comes pre-loaded).4) Bloatware: A lot of unncessary Google and VM apps are preinstalled. While the VM apps are small, the Google apps are huge and take up a lot of the internal memory. Most of them are not removable (unless you root the phone, and sometimes not even then). Since I am paying for the phone, I find this to be an unacceptable practice (but every phone suffers from this, so I don't see a better option on the market).5) Mixed-Sync: This was a problem I faced initially. A google account is linked with the phone (it might even be compulsory to have one - but you can use a dummy account). I made the \"mistake\" of using my real Google account (a personal account). For work, I needed to link my Microsoft Exchange account with the phone. It ended up syncing my personal (Google) calendar with my work calendar. I was able to undo it, but I would prefer it if I was asked permission or notified.6) Poor Outlook support - While Android has great Exchange support, it does not support Microsoft Outlook sync (via bluetooth or USB). So when I got the phone, I had to first back up my local Outlook data to the Exchange server (or a Google account), and then link the Exchange server with the phone.The Fixable:All of the fixable problems I found are simple to work around, but most require rooting. If this is something you are not comfortable with, you might consider a different phone/carrier.Without Rooting1) Calendar based silencing: An app called Buzy (free) lets the phone read your calendar and set it to silent during meetings or classes - something I was surprised to see did not happen by default.2) Battery - A (free or paid) app called JuiceDefender helps me conserve battery. To make full use of JuiceDefender, a rooted phone is useful.3) TimerDroid - A countdown timer/notification.With Rooting1) Cisco VPN - If you need to VPN to a network, Cisco AnyConnect VPN client for Android is easy to setup and use. However, it needs a rooted phone.2) Battery via SetCPU - This is a nifty program that lets you decide how much power the phone uses in different states (like screen off, during a call, low battery, etc). So you can extend battery life (but might make the phone less responsive).Useful Apps:These are a bunch of apps that I found extremely useful, and would recommend. Root is not required, unless specifically mentioned.1) GrooveIP (paid) + Google Voice - This allows you to make calls for free without using your minutes.2) Cisco AnyConnect - VPN Client (root required).3) BeyondPod - RSS client4) SetCPU - Allows you to control CPU frequency (root required).5) Dolphin Browser - web browser that is much better than the default.6) ES File Explorer - A file explorer (benefits from rooting)7) FolderSync - An app that can synchrnoize with cloud storage (Amazon, Dropbox, Sky Drive)8) Dropbox9) Memory Booster10) Titanium Backup - useful to backup your system so if the phone crashes, you can restore it.11) Quick Setting - easy access to all important settings.12) Color Note - create check lists/notes that can also be pinned as widgets to your screen.13) SSHDroid - allows me to SSH into the phone, to drag files from my computer to the phone or vice-versa, without bluetooth or cloud services.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad, IF you hack it", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "RDBEQIWCN3CU0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I first got this phone I was really impressed with it, coming from a very cheap dumbphone.

It did take a little bit longer than 24 hours to port my number to my new phone, but that was no big deal to me.

The touch screen is responsive, but I must admit my fat fingers have had to adjust to using the Android keyboard. I tried using the Swype keyboard but didn't really like it that much. I did purchase an OtterBox case and a separate screen protector because I am tough on devices.

I have used the latest Apple iTouch (new Dec 2010) and the version just prior to the latest iTouch (bought April 2010).  Using the Optimus feels similar to using the iTouch with some things better with the Optimus and a few vice-versa.  The items that come immediately to mind that are better with iTouch are the excellent screen resolution and good sound output via the built-in speakers (Optimus is still pretty good in these areas).  The items that appear better on the Optimus are the availability of Swype (love that - better for me than a slide out keyboard by a long shot), Google Navigation (seems to be as good or better than my Garmin - really excellent and usable in place of a Garmin for my purposes and no added cost) and the MicroSDHC slot (comes with 2 gb and you can buy up to 32 GB).  Some of those items are huge for me - having a 3.2 gb camera/video-recorder that can write to an SD card that I can port to my PC just like a camera is big.  The navigator is important - my wife now has my Garmin and I was planning to buy myself a new one but not now since the Optimus appears to be very adequate as a nav and I have one less item of clutter and, most importantly, the savings from not buying another nav pays the whole cost of the phone (I bought the phone for a net cost of $109 at Target but if you have to pay more it is worth it).Some things that Optimus has in common with iTouch/iPhone:  WiFi so you can have very fast and free internet anywhere you can get WiFi; large free app selection for android 2.2 (I suppose Apple's is similar but I am not as familiar with that.  For Android I have found everything I have thought of for an app for free and in about 1 minute including yahoo finance, yahoo mail, amazon, stopwatch/timer, weather/news,  B&N; Nook, minutes checker, etc.).My short review above is not about the PHONE.  That is because I would not buy a smart phone to make calls when you can get a good phone for making calls from Virgin Mobile or at any big store for $0 to $20.  My LG1500 is GREAT as a phone and was $0 from Net10 ($20 but with $20 load card so free phone).  For my purpose having the phone incorporated into the Optimus V just means one less item to deal with since the Optimus (like other smart phones) can be my mobile pc, phone, navigator, music player and camera (and I suppose more once I learn).  The phone on the Optimus seems to work very well, BTW, and the reception/signal is much better than my former Virgin Mobile phone (so maybe it is better than some cheap phones for that...) but not as good as my Net10 phone (I credit that to the network more than the phone).A friend, yesterday, put his Droid X down next to my Optimus that I was bragging about.  I was humbled.  Just in sheer look the Droid X is incredible (screen size).  He, however, has a 2 year contract and paid a lot more $$ than me up front along with it.  I paid $109 and could just use it like an iTouch if I wanted to for $0/month but will pay the $25/month for totally unlimited smart phone use and 300 anytime talk minutes.  Hard to beat and no contract.  The Optimus is good but it is not a Droid X - cost/benefit decision to be made (I am presuming Droid X can do all of the same functions that Optimus can).", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "First Smart Phone", "Author": "Steve G.", "ReviewID": "RN21X2RSZAC70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been looking for a solution for a one device communications, camera, music and e-mail system that I could take along with me for motorcycle touring, and for light day to day usage.

Facebook can be slow to load, but the facebook message (preloaded) is an easier and faster alternative, as you can backload into your profile quickly.

The screen and buttons frequently become non-responsive. If I'm reading a newspaper app I can typically get through a few articles before it gets stuck and I have to take the battery out. When it gets stuck the power button doesn't do anything.----June 8, 2012 update---Space on the phone's internal memory ran out on me so I've moved my apps to the SD card. This definitely decreases the stability of the phone. Sometimes the icons will all turn into the stock android app icon and when I click on any of them the message \"this application is not installed on your phone\" comes up. Sometimes the problem resolves itself after a few seconds, but sometimes I get impatient and restart the phone. Maybe it would always fix itself if I waited long enough. Also, the phone seems to freeze more often than it did before. I end up taking the battery out about once a day. It seems that when it freezes up the power button is useless so you can't restart it without cutting the power. I still like it overall, but I'm feeling the difference between this and an iPhone more than I was before.-----original review-------After being an iPhone user for 4 years, this phone is not as much worse as I expected. Here are the differences I have found to be meaningful after a few weeks:-Screen size: The 0.3 inch difference in screen size between this and the iPhone sounded negligible to me, but I have found that it is much harder to type on this phone, using either of the preloaded keyboards or downloading others that claim to be better. Also, most Android apps are clearly optimized for a larger screen. Not infrequently I come across pages where you need to type something and find that when the keyboard opens up the only thing I can see is the header on the app or webpage, so I can't actually see what I'm typing. This difficulty compounds the super narrow keys on the keyboard.-Stability: In the first few weeks it has frozen a couple times such that the only thing I can do to get it to respond is to take out the battery and put it back in. Other things crash maybe once a day, not enough to annoy me.-Battery life: I speak on the phone very little, but I have some app or other open and use the internet and GPS quite a bit. A couple of times it has died on me late in the day after I'm already home, but usually it has a few percent at least left. If you plan to talk on the phone a lot or for some reason find it inconvenient to charge it up every night the battery life would be a problem.-Voicemail: I'm not sure if this is because of the phone or Virgin Mobile, but you have to call your voicemail to get your messages and go through that painfully slow old-fashioned system of listening to the computer voice tell you the number of messages, the phone numbers, when the call was, etc. This is much less convenient than having all your messages listed on a screen where you can see the time and name or number to play or delete with the touch of a button.Other than that, all my thoughts about the phone have more to do with Android vs. iOS rather than the Optimus V itself. This phone is clearly not as luxurious as an iPhone or a much more expensive Android phone. It is a great way to save money by trading down or a cheap way to trade up from a not-so-smartphone.One last note: get the GrooveIP app and a Google Voice number. You can place and receive all your calls over the data network with your unlimited data plan instead of using your very limited minutes. I use 90% of my minutes with my girlfriend so I only had to give her my Google Voice number and have plenty of minutes for other people who call me. The voice quality is a little bit tinnier and washed out than over a regular call, but it's not a big difference. The biggest problem is that there's about a 2 second round-trip lag (if I say something and am on speakerphone I don't hear my echo for about that long, is what I mean). You have to learn a hint of patience so you don't end up talking over the other person.I'd rather have an iPhone, but I'd rather rather save $1,400 over the course of two years.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the nimble-fingered.", "Author": "charwoman", "ReviewID": "R1UTQLV2IVBIJF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for years and wanted to try upgrading my LG Rumor Touch to an android phone.  While I was looking, Target put the Virgin Mobile Optimus V on sale for only 80 bux, and after first verifying that it could be returned, I went for it.I don't actually like to use my phone for calls, because the VM service in my area is spotty and  I generally prefer to make calls from my office or home phone.  But I use it a lot for texting and web, checking email, etc.  I charged the phone overnight and then the next evening activated (swapped) it online, substituting the 2g microsd card that came with the phone with a 16g card I already had. Since I know there's a lag time with activation, I waited till the next morning to try using it.I found battery life and call quality to be pretty good.  Calls were much clearer than on the Rumor Touch, and although it was obviously going to be a little more challenging to use than the RT, I picked it up quickly enough. I have a Barnes and Noble Nook Color, which is a locked-down but Android-based reader, so I had a little familiarity going in.  The ability to set it to use available wireless networks was a plus, especially since the VM service is not great inside my house.  I wasn't anxious to try a lot of apps but did download the Nook reader and Netflix apps and was impressed by the usability of both on this phone. The voice-to-text options really blew me away, since I had never bothered mucking around with the voice commands on the Rumor. I couldn't believe how easily and accurately I could dictate a text message or open a website.  But the onscreen keyboard was ultimately too small and twitchy for my thumbs and fingers, and after trying to get used to it for a couple of days, it was in the end a dealbreaker. I returned it today and will probably be getting the Optimus Slider here on Amazon instead, since the keyboard looks similar to the one on the Rumor.If possible, I'd recommend giving the keyboard on this a live tryout before buying, but if you are reasonably comfortable with such things, I'd say this is a pretty good deal, especially at the price I paid. I really wished I could make it work for me.  As for the service, I upgraded to BeyondTalk last year at the 25.00/monthly rate, which they no longer offer, but I stayed grandfathered at that rate so it's a good bargain even if I'm not always impressed with Virgin Mobile in general.One last note; when I returned the phone to Target and told the clerk there was nothing wrong with the phone but verified that I'd factory reset it, returned all the original items with it and even put the stickers back on, she said \"we don't resell phones, they're a loss\" and when I asked what would happen to the phone she said \"it'll probably get recycled.\" She had already finished the refund by the time that came out.  That's a big bummer and disappoints me about Target. So if you do buy a phone from Target that works fine but just isn't for you, for the sake of not being wasteful, consider reselling it on eBay or something rather than just returning it.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Lot Of Phone For Not Much Money", "Author": "UnseenWorld", "ReviewID": "RZY7LC5VWCX1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I could give half stars, it would be 4.5 stars, not 5.The phone's body is quite nice.

However, when I found myself hit hard by the recession I talked Sprint into switching me to one of their \"dumb\" phones on a cheaper plan to get me through to the end of the contract.As my Sprint contract came to a close, I did a little research. Well, really, a LOT of research. When I research something I become possessed until I reach a decision. I told myself to be realistic about my needs and, as a result, one decision I made was that, while it would be nice to have a 4G phone, it would not be a deal killer to end up with 3G. I really don't use my phone enough for anything necessitating 4G.I also told myself that at least for the time being I didn't want to be tied to a lengthy contract, so I decided to take a serious look at pay-as-you-go and prepaid phones/services. That pretty much eliminated the iPhone. Besides, my experience with the EVO taught me the Android interface, and I really felt that the Android market had all the apps I would ever need. No matter what you want, you typically end up with many 4 and 5 star choices.When looking into plans, I did want as much unlimited service as possible, but if it would save me money, I would take a plan with limitations that would fit within my normal usage. In the end, I determined to give Virgin's 300 minutes + unlimited text/web a try for $35 a month. If I end up going over 300 minutes regularly, I'll go for the next step up which gives me 1200 minutes for $45 plus the unlimited text/web. I'm not a middle school girl, so there's no way in Hell I'll ever go over 1200 minutes.Unlike the aforementioned minimalist Virgin phone, this more capable phone doesn't limit me to using Virgin's ringtones and wallpapers. I can choose from among the huge range of ringtones and wallpapers from sources like Zedge. I have loaded many Android apps and so far haven't found any that won't work. Of course, I filter them a bit based on some of the phone's limitations. One example: it has no forward facing camera. Neither does any other phone at anywhere near this phones $100 price range. Versus what I was paying before with sprint (about $70 a month) my savings on Virgin's $35 plan will pay for the phone in about three months!One more thing, if you plan on storing much on the phone in terms of music and apps, you will probably want to replace the puny 2 gig MicroSD card with an 8 or 16 gig card.I should, however, note that it can't play Flash graphics due to limitations in the processor speed and memory. You can, however, play Youtube videos and Youtube comes preinstalled on the phone.This is a heck of a lot of phone for a mere $100. I can recommend it without reservation unless for some reason you absolutely must have 4G, a forward-facing camera, and/or Flash.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works for Wifi Hotspot for 35 per month", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R33V0NTYIRAQ0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SO in playing with this phone I was able find a way to use it as a WIFI Hotspot for unlimited data for only 35 bucks per month.

They could have put a little more into providing a better screen, I guess so that the overall quality of images would be reflected. I had a phone from Tmobile before this one and man that thing was a beauty. I had to return it since Tmobile was unclear about their charges. The other issue is the keyboard.

My wife has an iPhone, which is terrific, but my needs are considerably less.I should mention that I really enjoy the iOS devices. I have had a couple of android devices, and thought they were clunky, but things have matured a bit, and the VM Optimus is a decent way to check out what's available. I am really pleased that for a relatively cheap price I can dabble in the smartphone world without much reservation. Not worrying about the data plan is a lovely part of this deal.I haven't had any trouble with memory issues. I did pick up App2SD which moves many apps to the SD card. Generally I am satisfied with the music and navigation apps. Podkicker seems to do a good job for subscriptions. And so you have the Android world: on iOS, iTunes is pretty much a clearing house for everything that goes on a device. On android, you might have several apps to achieve the same thing. It's not a bad thing, just different, and takes a little more work.As for the phone, it is a nice size for me, though I absolute suck at typing on it - the screen is slightly less than really responsive. The phone is light, feels just a bit cheap. The screen is OK for video podcasts. Video looks OK, a bit oversaturated and standard def-ish, but absolutely fine and smooth. The music chip seems fine to me. I use Doubletwist or just drag and drop to sync iTunes playlists.The camera is OK. I do like having it for barcode scanning, which works very well.Probably the most processor intensive thing I've been using it for is VNC (Mocha) and though the screen is small, the rendering is fine.Picks up the LAN just fine.Not the phone's fault, but Sprint's network just bites. Where I live in upstate NY, Verizon is about the only carrier reaching into the Adirondacks. On the Net10 crap-phone I can get a signal most of the way through the mountains. With the Optimus, there is no cell or data signal at all. Not sure yet if this is a dealbreaker.All in all, this is a fun phone that does plenty of what you might want from an iPhone or more advanced Android device, for a whole lot less.Update: It's been a couple of months now, so there are a couple of updates. I had some trouble porting my old number over. Though it took a little time with Virgin Mobile agents, they were very helpful, got it done, and gave me a free month of service to boot for the inconvenience.Battery life is bad - I had a couple of trips that were a little more intensive on my phone needs, and maybe I got 6 hours out of the thing. Recently I ordered this:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KW14AE/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details and now seem to get 2 good days out of the phone with moderate to light use of data and voice. Not bad for 12 bucks.Voice quality is good.3G just stops working fairly often, even in solid delivery areas. This is annoying and either requires a reboot, or, and this seems to work most of the time, going in and out of airplane mode.I don't install a lot of apps, but of course the apps update themselves, and I finally got one of those low memory warnings. I use App2SD, but as you know, this doesn't work for everything, and it is stupid that I can't move off bloatware like Twidroyd and Scavenger.

I love to make phones my own so I currently have downloaded LauncherPRO to give it a 3D feel with Froyo and Advanced Task Killer (it has a widget which saves going into the menu time) At the most I get 300 mb of RAM all to myself but Android annoys me with opening apps in the background which have nothing to do with what I'm currently doing or want to do. But the appstore is amazing and pretty much all apps can work on this phone because of it's beutiful resolution that works with a screen it's size. I used to love swype but it's keyboard looks kind of weird and hard to type on if I didn't want to swype so I know use the stock Android Keyboard with auto correct and auto complete on saves me time going back on minor mistakes even with the responsive precise screen (I have chunky thumbs) Overall it's a perfect phone for me after a year or so I might upgrade to the Motorola Triumph or whatever new phone they might have then but no point now since I've ony had the phne for 2 weeks. Pros- Stock Android 2.2, Andorid market, 512mb of ram, GPU, 3G, App compatibility, multi-touch. Cons- slows during and after heavy proccesing load (to the point of freezing), low battery life, the 4 keys on front feel as if they might fall off, 3.2 mp camera (no hd) overall I would recommend this to ANYONE!!!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone - Especially on a budget", "Author": "Joshua J Bova", "ReviewID": "R3R3WLL8QZ9YR7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I searched for a new phone for almost a month. I wanted an android phone, and this one seemed to be the best option. So far it has not let me down. I get good 3G coverage all around town (Fayetteville NC), and haven't had any \"dropped\" calls yet. In fact I like this phone almost as much as my old LG Ally I had with Verizon. And I love the fact that I am only paying $45 a month (1200 minutes and unlimted text and web), compared to the $70 I was paying with Verizon. It also seems fast enough to handle running everything I like to do. I so have Task killer running, and that makes a big difference. But I can easily run Facebook app, browser, pandora, and a few other apps all at once and don't see any lag. I also like that the OS wasn't \"tainted\" by a bunch of \"carrier software\" that can't be uninstalled. There are a few shortcuts that Virgin mobile preinstalled to check account ballance and such, but over all it's a pretty clean Android OS.There are a few things that I not a fan off, but they are minor, and for the price difference I can easily learn to live with. Also most of these \"issues\" I knew about when I got the phone, and they weren't a real surprise. I miss having a slide out keyboard, but that was known when I got the phone. The screen is a little small compared to other Android phones on the marked, but it hasn't really been a problem, I have been able to do everything just fine with the screen size it has. The Camera isn't bad, but there is no \"flash\". But at 3.0MP, it takes decent looking pictures. The plug is a Micro USB (most phones are using that now) Which I am also not a fan of. It feels flimsy to me, but again it hasn't caused an issue at all.... just my personal preference. My actual biggest complaint, that did suprise me, and I miss is there is no LED on the phone. so once the screen locks, you can't tell if you have a new message or anything unless you unlock it. Again, it's a minor problem, but one I figured every one should know about.Overall, I am glad I got this phone. It's not perfect, but it's fairly cheap, there is no contract, and the plans and service seem good so far. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good cheap smartphone.Pros: very inexpensive, Compact size, Runs good, If using \"Task Killer\" and not leaving GPS and WIFI on all the time, the battery last amazingly  long for a smartphone.Cons: No LED, No flash for Camera, power plug feels flimsy", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Replacement phone works great!

The problem is that is freezes up constantly requiring the battery to be removed it order to start it again (this happens 2-3 times per day). A quick Google search reveals that others are experiencing the same problem. LG support blames the software version (ZV4) and claims that updating to ZV5 would fix it. Unfortunately, they also told me that Virgin Mobile has locked down the updating capability which means I have to send the phone back to LG to be updated with an estimated repair time of 5-7 days in addition to shipping time. So it looks like I'll be without a cell phone for several weeks while I wait to see if this problem can be fixed.Updated Review:Virgin Mobile offered to replace the phone for me and sent me a new one so I didn't have to be without a phone for several weeks. The new phone is running the LG ZV5 software update and I am not experiencing the freezing problem that the first phone had.

I am also impressed with its features. It does take a little time to understand the phone's hardware and operating system. It is a shame that some would blame the phone, but ignore that it is in fact their ignorance that is causing the problems.In conclusion I rate the phone 5 stars.Now on the other hand, the VM service which is owned by Sprint only runs on Sprint's network service with \"NO\" roaming allowed. Although VM claims there is no fee for roaming, the fact is that since \"no roaming is allowed\" thus the reason for the \"no roaming fee\"; nice marketing gimmick.  This means that if your area is weak for the Spring signal network or you go out of the area, you will have no service. If you had a regular Sprint phone with Spring service then roaming is enable, and if you are out of their service area then you would be roaming with no extra charges. This fact was discovered when the wife switched from Sprint to VM. So be prepare for this no-service problem.The new updated $35 ($10 increase) monthly plan is still a nice price. It would have been nicer if there were more minutes added to the plan, and if roaming were allowed with the $10 increase. Maybe in the future.In conclusion, if you do not travel much out of the Sprint service area and have a good signal in your area you will be fine.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great smartphone for 1st time smartphoners", "Author": "sman999", "ReviewID": "R35VYF3UX3JPM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GOOD:I like the speech-to-text feature. You hit the microphone button and speak your message, it converts it to text & usually does a good job of it. You can use this in most programs and the texting app.LOTS of apps to choose from. Download the Amazon appstore and download a free app a day that you would usually pay for. I've gotten a lot of high-quality apps for free through this.Overall I like the android OS, the notification system is really nice, just pull down the menu from anywhere and see any missed calls, texts, etc.Full integration of apps into the Android OS. Really makes life easier when trying to use apps. For example, you can use an app such as Groove IP to make free calls over the internet connection and not use your minutes. If you are on the cheapest plan, this helps conserve those 300 minutes! You can set it up so the system asks if you want to make a call through the traditional dialer or thru the Groove app, it makes life a lot more convenient.The BAD:Smaller screen makes it hard to type. I tried my sister's Motorola Atrix & it was much easier to type with the bigger buttons, but you can use SWYPE on this and get your messages written.I would worry about dropping & breaking it, it's fairly compact but also seems a bit flimsy, so I bought the body glove case for it which include a nice kickstand on it.Not a lot of internal storage for apps, download a program like SuperBox, which tells you when you have an app that can be transferred to the SD card and this will help save some space. As long as you don't download a ton of apps you should have enough space for your important apps. If you fill up the internal memory texts stop coming through and the system gets sluggish, so that's when you should delete some of the extra games or whatever that might have accumulated.OVERALL: You can't beat the price of the monthly plan on Virgin Mobile. I have mine on the $25/month plan, I think it's now $35/month, but that's still a great deal for UNLIMITED texting/data, which is what I mainly use.

I also went to BestBuy to check out how the phone feels in my hand.So far I am very, very happy!!!I got the lowest $25 beyond talk plan which has all the (unlimited) data needs I have and the 300 minutes of talk time is more than what I need.There are so many free apps in the marketplace that I found very useful.The phone is very responsive.I'm using it mainly for e-mail, calendar, alarm clock, notes, shopping list, product bar code reader, watching videos, web browsing, listening to radio, calculator, annoying call blocking, weather, news and even games like angry birds for my kids just to name the few useful apps that I found in the Droid market place.Now, I spend less time checking e-mails with my PC.I spend those times plaing with my kids instead.It connects to my home wireless network but I don't really have to since my plan includes unlimited 3G access.Activition was smooth too, considering I was switching from a VM pay-as-you-go talk-only plan to a beyond-talk plan.The VM rep was helpful and was able to transfer my remaining balance from the old plan to the new plan and port my phone number in no time.In summary,CON - quick battery discharge, though you can disable unecessary apps and/or use apps like JuiceDefender that can do that for youPRO - the phone has got a everything I need, happy with the service from VMAnyway, I am sure there are much better smart phones out there.But for the price of the device and the no-contract beyond-talk plan from VM, it's a win-win for me.Good luck shopping for your next smart phone, I hope you'll find one the suits you.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Value on the Smart Phone Market", "Author": "toothman79", "ReviewID": "R3N5AT33O5GU7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I paid $119 (on sale) and $25/month for UNLIMITED text, data, + 300 talk minutes.

There is an included Youtube app which is fairly decent, though.The supplied touchscreen keyboard has impossibly small, closely-spaced keys that result in frequent mistyping and backspacing.  I replaced it with the Swiftkey app which has better key spacing and also intelligently predicts your next word for quicker typing.This phone can be a bit slippery in the hand.  An inexpensive silicone sleeve can address this.  Also, the touch screen is plastic and not glass - this means it may be less likely to shatter on impact, but is probably not as hard as glass. A stick-on screen protector can help prevent possible surface wear.As others have mentioned, battery life is way less then with just about any non-smartphone.  My gophone went about a week between charges with light use.  This phone gets a lot more use (since it can do so much more) and I find myself charging it at least once a day, sometimes twice.  At work I sometimes keep it charging on my laptop USB port when I'm at my desk.Free apps such as JuiceDefender can help improve battery life.Still, when you first get this you will be playing with it a lot!  Keep an eye on the charge level so you still have a working phone... ;)Here's hoping that a savvy manufacturer will come out with a double-capacity battery for this little gem - they could sell a lot!Screen is on the smallish side, and if you need reading glasses then this phone may not be for you. Web pages not designed for small screens will require a LOT of horizontal and vertical scrolling, which I find annoying.A really sharp browser app ought to be able to reformat and resize the screen contents on-the-fly to make it more readable without scrolling in all directions.  Perhaps we will be seeing this browser on the market - I would pay for such an app.Fortunately, for now, popular web sites such as Facebook and Gmail have their own apps which make for a much more user-friendly experience.You can add up to 32 Gigs of memory on a Micro SD chip (2G supplied).On the down side, \"all memory is not alike\".  Many apps can only live on the built-in memory chip.  Apps such as \"App 2 SD\" can offload some (but not all) apps to the SD chip.  Each moved app still leaves some amount of code behind on the built-in memory.In my first week, I downloaded so many free apps that I had to delete some in order to add new ones.  As a fairly new user, it's not clear to me how to save/restore a deleted app from backup. If you delete a paid app, it looks like you might need to buy it all over again if you ever want it back.Don't know if these memory limits apply to fancier phones or not.  Just something to be aware of - don't spend a bundle on a new SD chip thinking it works the same as, say, disk space on a desktop.

Most of the internal memory is eaten by factory installed apps and phone processes. At first you would think this is not a problem - you think that you can just get a bigger SD card - However, only about 50% of android apps are written so that they can operate off of the SD Card. On my phone I am limited to about 6 optional apps on the phone memory before it crashes.  Each time the apps update they generally take more memory so each update cycle I lose another app.  I am now deleting my favorite weather app and my favorite news app just to keep my phone functional.

Go to their website first and check to see if service is available in your area. Also, don't buy this from Amazon. This phone started off at $149, then raised in popularity and went to $199. Don't pay a cent more than that, many places still have this phone at $199 or less depending on sales.This'll be tough to review since this is my first smartphone that I've owned, so I'll be reviewing this for people skeptical about owning one of these.I've had this for about 3 weeks and I love it so far! I put a 16 GB sd card in it and I've replaced my music player with this. The $25/month plan (Which as 300 anytime minutes and unlimited web data and texting) is a bit more expensive compared to what I used to pay, (I had one of those old pay-as-you-go phones) but the features greatly outweigh the cost I'm paying now.Google maps GPS works very well, but it was tough to get used to. It's not like a typical GPS where you can save favorite locations, but instead you'll have to save it as a contact on your phone.Call quality is very nice, texting can be a slight pain depending on the keyboard software you're using. (I do miss the slide out keyboard of my old phone) I use the Flex Input9 keyboard, use Amazon's app store and hopefully they'll offer another keyboard of similar quality for free with it's Free App of the Day.It's web browsing is very nice, you will need a 4 or 5 bar signal to get good browsing speeds. The signal itself has been a hit and miss, some places I'll get poor signal just by going inside a grocery store(Some kind of weird interference I suppose), but it's been rare.The battery life is a problem, but there are ways to extend it. What I do is turn the phone to it's lowest display brightness, turn off the GPS, 3G speed, and keep the phone locked when not in use. My phone's battery will stay at a 90% to 65% from 5AM to 10PM depending on usage. You can actually get apps from the Android Marketplace to see what exact percentage your phone's battery is at.

There have been many occasions that my husband's iPhone with 4G had nothing, and I had full coverage with fast 3G. The other downside would be the storage space, it seems to fill up on the phone pretty fast, but I just use a Micro SD card and it does the trick. I drop this phone on concrete or other hard surfaces probably at least once a week without a case, and it's got some scratches, but the screen is flawless (I have a cover on the screen) and the phone itself doesn't have any bad damage, just normal scratches any phone gets.

Which doesn't make sense because there are so few apps on my phone.Also, the phone is pretty slow now and sometimes slightly lags if I swipe through the screens or try to look at my photos, etc. Also, glitchy things happen sometimes (although rarely) such as the phone restarting on its own or app icons suddenly appear somewhere else from where they are normally placed. The phone service is pretty awful in certain locations as well. If you're standing outdoors though it's usually decent enough service. I live in New York City though so for the most part I have decent service but when I go to school in Ithaca, NY., the service becomes almost nonexistent indoors.The good:The plan and price really makes up for the lacking features. I still pay $25 a month for unlimited texting and 300 minutes with data which is really impressive compared to other plans. You can upgrade the storage to store tons of music and I have used this for over two years with absolutely no problems. Also, I've dropped this phone so many times and it has yet to crack or have a scratch on its screen. It looks just like when I first got it, which is really great when you see all those broken iPhone screens. The battery life is outstanding - if I don't use the phone at all, it can last almost three days and if I'm using it to listen to music for hours on end, it can last almost 12 hours.

As long as you know your requirements for the phone you want, and you do your homework, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this phone.  Just understand it's NOT a Samsung Galaxy S3 or iPhone 5. It's technically on the entry-level side of Android phones, but it sure doesn't seem like it. I bought mine in mid-2011 when it was still new to the VM line for $129.00. I'm still using it to this day with no problems. I bought this one for my mother who recently broke her old tracfone. Quite the upgrade for her. I use mine ALOT for everything and would reccomend it to all but the most demanding phone users.Pros*Size - Absolutely perfect in my opinion. Even with an Otterbox on it fits nicely into jean pockets.*Ease of use - Very well designed. Nothing I can think of to complain about. From the camera, to the audio player, to the physical button layout.*GPS - OUTSTANDING. Forget the Garmin. It will speak to you, map out a route, and give you literal turn-by-turn directions by voice and map. 10 out of 10 on the navigation system. And it's FREE.*Plans - $35 a month gets you unlimited everything except talk time. And you'll get 300 minutes of anytime use with the $35 plan.*Durability - Very good. Can't count the number of times I've dropped it. But you'd be smart to pick up an Otterbox and Zagg screen protector. Then, it's a sherman rank of durabilty.* More - I could go on and on. I might buy a 3rd Optimus V just to have a backup for when / if this one ever breaks.Cons*No Adobe Flash - Unable to download it because of \"processor requirenents\". But you van always use a browser with built-in flash. And I've heard on good authority that Adobe Flash CAN be installed on a rooted Optimus V.*No Camera Flash - Not a big deal to me but may be to others.*Internal Memory - There isn't heaps. Most apps nowdays can be moved to the external SD card. But some can't. The fix is to not update too many that aren't SD compatible.*Battery Life - Could be better, but I've seen much worse.

Let me offer a brief explanation", "Author": "Randalusa", "ReviewID": "R1R9Z1CNA9NDN1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not one of those giving lower marks because the item broke or crashes all the time.Rather, the device incorporates two of the most annoying design failings ever found on a phone.1. The speaker is TOOOOOOOOOOO LOUDDDDDDD. The very lowest setting available in reality ought to be a 7 out of 8 rather than the 1 that it is (along with the missing 1-6). And though the phone goes louder still, there is no reason why anyone should ever want even the 7 that sits in the 1 slot of volume control.How about giving us people who aren't talking on an airport tarmac with a jet spooling up a volume level that doesn't rattle the speaker and blast our eardrums! Plus this is my second LG Optimus. I have owned the Optimus V with Virgin and the T with T-Mobile. Both exactly the same.2. After dialing a call and pressing the go button or upon answering, the screen SHUTS OFF, which leaves no way to find the speaker button, which itself is tragically a soft button rather than what it should have been to begin with, on the body.3. Those items took owning one to know. Even beforehand, I willingly (reluctantly) surrendered the idea of a flash that could be used either for photographs or as a flashlight. Plenty of disappointment right there.4. The power button is nearly impossible to feel by touch only. Even when looking, they made it so teeny that a fingernail is the best means for pressing the thing in.5. They put the dorky smile button right next to and bigger than the period, which means frequently dropping a smile in rather than the intended punctuation mark.6. LG forces all capitals when entering www or http, which sort of sucks if only because their programer should no better, then additionally because I don't want a stupid phone forcing any change in my grammar or syntax.One thing I do like is the 4 buttons on the front. Imagine the dopey Apple freaks being willing to put up with the inferior Mac computers and iPhones all these years, each of them barren of convenient physical buttons for common functions. So LG got that part right, yet botched the finesse items. Two stars rather than one for kind of functioning if you avoid the speaker and for the quite decent screen response (which I figure they all have, however).", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone For Those Of Us On A Budget", "Author": "shadygrady0002 \"shadygrady0002\"", "ReviewID": "RSEKIL8S963LC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Now that I've owned this phone for a little over a year now, I feel I can properly review it.I was one of the few people I knew who didn't own an I-phone or a Droid and I was starting to feel like the odd-man out, listening to people talking about what apps they downloaded, how they are able to listen to music on their phone, blah, blah, blah.Well, being a man on a fixed income :), I wasn't about to invest in an expensive I-phone or sign up for some 2-year contract with outrageous monthly fees.  I did some research and found Virgin Mobile.  First of all, I couldn't believe I could get 300 minutes with unlimited web and texting for $25!  After getting over the initial shock of that, I couldn't believe that I was actually going to get an Android phone for a little over $100 that was going to  greatly improve my life and finally make me \"hip\".I must say, after a year, the phone has held up very well.  there are still lots of apps on it that I have never used.  I got it mostly for texting but I have found some of the apps on the phone very useful.  Downloading music is also quite easy.Problems I've had is with Virgin Mobile service.  There was one particular time I didn't have service for like 3 days.  I was constantly in contact with the folks at Virgin Mobile and they were working really hard to fix the problem, which was finally resolved in 3 days.  Also, I noticed that sometimes it takes a really long time to download certain apps onto the phone.  And over the past couple of months, I notice the spacebar on the keyboard is becoming a little difficult to use.  Also, when I'm in the gym and trying to listen to music on the phone, it shuts off and resets itself every few minutes.  It doesn't do this when I'm just doing a normal walk.  But, whenever I use any kind of machine in the gym (treadmill, eliptical), the phone constantly shuts down and resets itself, which is really annoying.Other than that, I feel that I have gotten a lot of value out of this phone.  For the price of the phone and the service, you simply cannot beat it.

I have received numerous calls from bill collectors (all for the same person), obscene texts (from someone looking for the same individual, obviously thinking they still had this number) and many voice mails which use up my minutes, but have never been for me.

This allowed me to overclock the processor, which the phone handles fairly well and stably, as well as to gain access to some other functions for the phone that the stock OS does not allow, like operating the phone as a WiFi hotspot.

One for myself, and one for my wife.After 8 months, I can say that the Optimus V is a good, basic smartphone. Having a \"basic smartphone\" would seem to be a bit of a contradictory term, but that's exactly what it is. Being basic, the Optimus V is hampered by a few significant shortcomings. Primarily, the Optimus has only about 150mb of internal memory. With apps continuing to get larger and larger (taking advantage of the newer, larger phones), the 150mb on the Optimus fills up very quickly. The FB app typically takes up almost 15mb on my phone, Google Maps takes 10+ mb, etc, etc...so even if you like to have only a moderate amount of apps you'll quickly find yourself having to pick and choose between them, because not everything can be moved over to the SD card.The Optimus is also limited by its CPU power. It only has a single 600mhz processor. That is at the very low end of the spectrum, with the newest powerhouse phones having dual-core 1.2ghz+ processors. As more apps, widgets, and feeds are added onto the Optimus, it can get pretty bogged down, resulting in slowed response, hangups, freezes, etc. This is not the phone to get if you want to play some of the graphic-intensive games. I played Angry Birds for a while when I first got the phone...but when the levels got larger and more complex as I progressed through the game, the Optimus started to struggle. The framerate got lower and lower to the point where it wasn't really playable anymore.Those are the major shortcomings...there are some other minor problems as well. The battery life is not great (but that's pretty common nowadays). The VPN capability does NOT work (probably won't effect many people). It seems to be a widespread problem with LG smartphones. There is also no Flash support. There's No Netflix App (although it can be sideloaded unofficially).But, with all it's shortcomings...this is a good phone for the price. If you want to try the android experience without spending hundreds of dollars or locking yourself into a contract...this is a great way to do it. The phone itself works fine. The Wifi performance is very good. The navigation works well. It will still run the vast majority of apps you could want to use...just not all at the same time!If all you want to have a smartphone for is to check your email, look some stuff up on google, and surf the net a bit during a quiet moment...this could be a great phone for you. That is how my wife utilizes hers, and she absolutely loves it.However, if you're a more demanding user with large amounts of apps and games...or are a tinkerer like me that enjoys squeezing maximum productivity and performance out of your gadgets...you may not be satisfied in the long run. I've gotten to the point where I feel like I need to upgrade...so I'm planning to \"graduate\" up to the Motorola Triumph, which is another Virgin Mobile phone that has a much larger internal storage capability (2gb), a significantly faster cpu (1ghz), and a larger screen.Even when that times comes, though, I won't regret having bought the Optimus V.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love My V", "Author": "OptiDroid", "ReviewID": "R2IMPCA31GGH78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Optimus V a couple days before Xmas when Target had it for $69.

There is no face-to-face video, no dual cameras, not 3D, no dual core processor and has a smaller screen than most newer phones.However, the Optimus V does run Android and can run most apps you find on the android market. It plays video and music well, but does not have an HD screen. It is very durable, I've owned mine for about 2 years and it still works great and inspite of dropping in several times it's not all scratched up.In my area it gets very good reception and sound quality of the calls is very good. The touch screen works great out of the box and installing my 32g memory card was as simple as sliding it into the slot.The only down side is that it has a dated processor so it does not run all apps as smoothly as other phones do. The screen is smaller compared to more expensive phones as well. Perhaps the most annoying part of the phone is the low amount of internal memory. There are seval apps that have to be intalled on the internal memory and cannot be moved to an SD card. So, after a while you will have to move as many apps as possible to the SD card(not included).

I believe you can uninstall the SCVNGR,WHERE and Poynt updates to clear space, if needed.However, for $99 with no contracts or strings attached this is phone is one of the best values on the market if you are just looking for a basic cellphone.

It is a solid, well working phone.  I've had two issues with it, one of which is resolved and the other which is a potential unfixable flaw:1. initially my Gmail and Google calendar were working fine, but then fell out of sync. After playing around with the passwords and resetting a bunch of stuff, it finally started working again.  Not sure if this was actually a phone issue or a Google issue.2. this one is definitely a phone issue:  after-market headphones do not work well in this phone.  The stock in-ear phones that came with it sound fine, but I've bought two different pairs of expensive, after-market in-ear phones and both sound tinny and faint - like they aren't connecting well.  The only difference I can see is that the stock phones have 3 rings on the jack, whereas the after-market phones have two.  My 'suspicion' is that Optimus has manufactured their phone to only work well with their own phones.  If this is the case, then beware!  If I had known this before I bought the phone I would have not bought it.UPDATE:date: December 2012.  I've had this phone for over a year now.  Still work solidly, and is rugged enough to keep on ticking after being dropped.  My chief complaints are: as noted above, its hard / impossible to find non-LG earphones for it.  And secondly, the virtual memory sucks - I am continually getting \"out of storage\" warnings whenever I try to load a new app or use a current one.  I can see I have plenty of storage on the SD card, and all of the apps that I can move to the SD card have been moved there.  It just doesn't seem to manage its memory very well.

There is both a bad unique and a good unique with the Optimus. Let's start with the bad.CONS:-The Optimus V has a very mediocre processor at 600mHZ, but I will talk about this more later.-Games lag a lot(don't stop reading I will explain this more in the pro list)-Many crashes in the beginning, none after about a week of use.-Battery life is closer to bad than good.-No flash.-Camera could be better but the pictures outdoors with adequate lighting looks pretty good for a phone-Android 2.2-Plastic material used for almost the whole phone, this might be a pro for some people, a con for some people.-HORRIBLE INTERNAL MEMORY CAPACITY!  Really LG, 150MB? With all the stock apps and the VM apps, its really about 100MB.  Enough room for 5-15 apps.  And you might say, why don't you move the apps to the SD card?  Well even if you do hack it to go on the SD card, some of the features won't work and most notably if you want to put a widget the app needs to be on the phone's internal memory.PROS:-Many, many custom gingerbread ROMS that will satisfy all the Angry Birds nerds out there as for some reason the stock ROM can't handle some games(Angry Birds) and also people who are waiting for the gingerbread(2.3) update as the update has rolled out to Sprint LG Optimus S customers but there are reports of many bugs and problems.  I know this is about the Optimus V but the ROM that I am using(cyanmod 7) is amazing.  As I said the games run without lag and the whole experience is just better as cyanmod 7 has many custom tweaks you can make to better fit your use of the device(WARNING, putting custom ROMS might break your phone, do it at your own risk)-Vanilla android(no modifications to the UI by the manufacturer)-Processor performance makes it look better than 600mHZ LG did a good job of maximizing performance from the processor.-Prepaid plans!-The touchscreen is pretty responsive compared to the Intercept.CONCLUSION:So basically its a great phone for first-time users, as I was, but after you get used to it you will download more apps as I said the internal memory capacity is horrible and soon you will be searching for available memory.  So for previous smartphone users who don't want to be tied up to a 2 year contract with outrageous monthly fees, the Optimus V might be a stretch, but the more high-end Motorola Triumph will probably be adequate.  The Optimus V will be perfect for people who use it for email, business calls, and a casual game basically the type who use it more as a phone and a mobile email checker.

For unlimited data and more talk time than I'll ever use, it's a fantastic deal. Even at the current $35/month, you can't beat it, particularly since it's contract-free. The phone itself is OK. The cellphone part is good--conversations are clear, the speakerphone is loud enough. It's a good phone. The camera is pretty OK, good enough most of the time that I rarely wish I had my \"real\" camera with me. The real downside of this package is the smartphone part. Android 2.2 is pretty terrible on this phone. Laggy, fussy, clunky, crash-prone--it drives me crazy. It ignores more taps and swipes than it responds to, and then it often is lagging enough that it responds in the wrong way. The on-phone storage is tiny, so any apps that can't be installed on the storage card (and there are a lot of them) will use up that minuscule on-phone space. I have fewer than 50 apps--all under 10 MB each--installed, and have all of the ones installed on the storage card that can be, but I can't install any more apps because the on-board storage is completely full. Battery life is abysmal without running battery manager apps--and I don't like having to babysit my phone like that. (The \"Auto Airplane\" app is a godsend for this phone, though it trades functionality for good battery life. It turns off all the radios when you turn off the screen. The battery lasts for days as a result, but all the auto-notify and GPS features are turned off.) Also, this particular combination of phone and Android DOES NOT RUN FLASH. You need to install a third-party web browser that preprocesses Flash on a server, just like on an iPhone. I've become way too familiar with the \"Manage Apps\" screen and way too adept at pulling the battery out to \"fix\" yet another Android glitch. I tend to stick to a few relatively stable apps (Dolphin web browser, K9 email, Winamp) that aren't painfully laggy, counter-intuitive, or crash-prone. Which basically means that I use it like a featurephone instead of a smartphone. Overall, I think it's still a pretty good deal, even if Android isn't all it's reputed to be.

The discounted price was due to \"cosmetic defects\", which turned out to be nothing but a small scratch on one corner of the casing. For those looking to purchase this or any Virgin Mobile prepaid phone, I highly recommend going the eBay route.The Optimus V is everything you'd expect from a mid-range smartphone. I've had friends try to steer me away from Android devices in favor of the iPhone, but, unlike those friends, I have rent and bills to pay and cannot afford the exorbitant cost of even the cheapest iPhone data plan. Currently, Virgin Mobile offers a plan for this phone at $35 which includes unlimited data and texting with 300 airtime minutes per month. You'll be lucky to find an unlimited data tack-on plan with another carrier for less than $40.The phone is very responsive and switches through apps quickly. I have yet to lose a call, but the 3G reception is notoriously spotty even in heavily populated areas. There are short-term solutions to this problem such as reactivating, turning airplane mode on and off, restarting the phone, etc. It's my hope that Virgin Mobile will resolve this issue as seemingly everyone is struggling with 3G connectivity.The Optimus V ships with the stock version of Android, and you'll be glad it does. The skins and bloatware that come pre-installed on other providers' Android devices severely reduce battery life. As it is, the battery life of this phone is already atrocious - though that's not surprising considering what a powerhouse the Android platform is. Without a battery regulating app such as Juice Defender, you will not make it more than 6 to 8 hours on standby without the battery being depleted completely. Before installing Juice Defender, I had to keep the phone plugged into a charger while in the car and at work or risk being without my phone for the remainder of the day. Even with the best battery regulating app, don't expect to go without a full recharge for more than about 12 to 14 hours.One of the perks of owning an Android device is the ability for customization. The stock version of Android itself does not allow skinning (without jailbreaking), but there are several apps out there that enable you to completely customize the look and performance of your Optimus V. I'm a hobbyist graphic designer, so I had a lot of fun developing my own skins for Beautiful Widgets and LauncherPro (both highly recommended), and now I have a phone that looks totally unique and performs faster than it did out of the box.On the topic of Android: I found myself preferring Android over iOS just as I prefer almost everything else over Apple products. I refuse to pay twice as much for a logo and a shiny metal casing. I can also replace my battery without dealing with a team of smarmy hipsters and sending my phone away for weeks. Suck it, Apple.Other than the battery and 3G connectivity issues, I have nothing else negative to say about this device.

Very easy and free activationNote on VM coverage: VM uses Sprint's network, but does not include ANY roaming. That means coverage is limited to metro areas, and along Interstates and major roads. Carefully check the coverage area before you buy.Note on the negative VM feedback: While most reviews for this PHONE are good, the web's user reaction to Virgin Mobile customer support is predominately NEGATIVE. This really scared me off. However, the brick and morter retailers disputed this negativity. My retailer offered 100% money back return, so I decided to give it a try. Since activation was easy, and I have had no issues with talk or data, I've had no reason to call support. For those of us who don't have to call support, this plan may be ok.

It was also the best value I could find for a phone that has wifi calling capabilities (my workplace has really bad reception, so this is the only way to make calls).  I've only been using it for a few days but so far it's been great.  The call quality is good to excellent (depending on wifi signal/reception outdoors).  Virgin also has a handy guide on their website which has details about all the functions on the phone, in case you haven't used a smartphone before.  I also like the fact that I can install apps on the phone.  The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use.  Love Swype for texting :DThe processor is not the greatest however, and there is a 2-3 second lag at times (I usually see this when I want to rotate the screen).  I don't know if there are other functions where this is the case.  The battery will last a day tops if you have wifi/3g on all the time, but from what I've heard, all smartphones need to be charged at least once a day.

The phone's internal memory leaves quite a bit to be desired though, I only have about 55mb left out of the initial 150mb. Many apps cannot be installed to the SD so this is problematic.The battery life is alright, but you're going to need to charge this phone every day, and it does take a fair while to charge, so be cognizant of this during your daily whatever. I did install Juice Defender Lite which seems to help keep the battery up longer.Call quality is good. My Rumor Touch used to drop calls constantly and sending pictures sent forever but this phone seems to do better on both counts. I haven't had the opportunity to use it with Skype yet though. The internet service is good though, nice and fast. The wifi function is a huge plus too.As for the design of the phone I have no complaints. It sits well within my hand, it doesn't feel cheap, and the keyboard (though requiring some getting used to) is pretty nifty. The speaker quality sounds pretty good too when playing music and using speaker phone. The 3.5mm headphone jack produces some good audio as well. The screen is kind of a scratch magnet though. I got this phone a few days ago and I already managed to acquire a hairline scratch on it without doing anything extraordinarily stupid. The scratch isn't too bad however it does irk me; Make sure you order some screen protectors and possibly a case.Overall; I recommend this phone emphatically for anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton of money on their plan or their phone. I am new to the world of smartphones but I'm pretty technologically inclined and I just can't say enough good things about this phone. The only thing that is holding me back from 5 stars is the battery consumption and charge time.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone", "Author": "Matthew Henry", "ReviewID": "R3QUXN6LW0QVOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is very reasonably priced.

No, the power button doesn't work when its like that.Just recently, doing my remove battery trick to unfreeze the phone - the phone couldn't restart.

Since this phone is used with the Virgin Mobile service, the service is a part of this product. That's why I feel that it's valid to involve this in the review for the phone. The phone itself is made and programed to be used with Virgin Mobile, so that is an actual physical part of the phone.Like it's been said by so many people on the internet, the LG Optimus V for Virgin Mobile either has extremely poor reliability when connecting to the internet or it simply can't connect at all. That is, it cannot reliably stay connected or connect in the first place using the Spring 3G network. The Optimus V I got could not connect to the internet on its own at all. The phone connected with Wi Fi, but not without it.I was not satisfied with that. The product is sold as a phone that can connect to the Sprint 3G network. Mine didn't do that. So the product I got did not function fully as it was supposed to. So I canceled my Virgin Mobile 'Beyond Talk' plan and got a refund. And I took the phone back to the store I bought it from and got a refund.If you search online about this issue, you'll see people recommend things like turning the phone off and back on, putting it on airplane mode and then off, and dismounting the SD card. I tried all of these repeatedly and the phone still never got online.I was able to make calls and do text messages. And that is all the phone could do in terms of communicating. It worked great with a Wi Fi, but I'm not satisfied with being limited to Wi Fi on a phone. The phone itself seems to perform nicely for what it is. But without the use of the 3G network, it's a very incomplete product.If you research this phone, you'll also read about the short battery life. At first, I felt that I would be okay with this. I've seen complaints of this on many products that use a rechargeable battery. But I've personally experienced a disappointingly short battery use on this phone. The charge does go down quickly on the battery that is included with the phone.PROS:-Screen looks nice-Sounds great when playing music files and using headphones-Camera is decent, although I haven't tried the video recording feature-It comes with a 2GB micro SD card-Can charge battery with a USB cable with a certain mini plug, the slim kindCONS:-Very low battery life-Mine never, ever worked on the Sprint 3G network that it was supposed to do through Virgin Mobile. Same result with many other customers of this phone.Whenever you research an electronic product and there are a lot of reviews for it on a website like Amazon, there are usually a few or more negative reviews. No matter how many good reviews there are. I'm sure there are cases when the bad reviews can almost be disregarded and the product turns out fantastic after all. But that's not the case with the LG Optimus V for Virgin Mobile. This really is an absolute problem product.Calling Virgin Mobile for tech support will be a hassle also. If you call them and keep pressing 0 for a live representative, you'll be told good bye and hung up on after the third time. That is uncalled for, tacky, and low on their part. You'll have to jump through the hoops in the automated system to get to a live person.To me, a cell phone should be able to do calls, voicemail, text messages, text messages with attachments, and internet without Wi Fi from the start of activation. No exceptions. Mine didn't perform all that it was supposed to be able to from the start, nor did it later on.

Unfortunately these seem to be common problems with this phone.

The only problem I have with this smartphone as well with any other touchscreen (including, er, iphone) is that the touchscreen keyboard SUCKS. It doesn't matter what people say, it is not easy to use a touchscreen keyboard, and it takes a big chunk of the screen. So, I'm letting this smartphone go, and I will get the Samsung Intercept which has a slide out keyboard, the way nature intended with REAL keys.Even though it doesn't have a dedicated graphics processor, I don't care, since I don't play video games much.One thing I forgot is that the Optimus V plays videogames fluidly, including angry birds and racing games, but playing video games on a touchscreen is not the way nature intended.

The touch screen doesn't respond well to my touch. I have to touch things multiple times. The thing that ticks me off the most is that there is an insanely small amount of apps you can install because although you can move some of it to the sd card, it still takes up room on the internal memory. As do  the running of some apps. So basically you have to constantly remove apps everytime one of the essentials has an upgrade. Also I can't send or receive pic messages ever.

The size of the phone memory is not only tiny (less than 180MB), it's taken up by bloatware, leaving very little space for apps that cannot be moved to the SD card. These apps, some of which are large, take up the lion's share of the phone memory, along with other Android system files. A couple of months ago, when I didn't yet understand the problem (being a total newbie), I went out and bought a 32GB SD card naively believing that it would solve my \"phone storage is getting low\" notification problem. When I saw that my new SD card is only 1% full and I was still getting the low space problem, I looked into it and realized that it was still the internal memory that was the problem, and that cannot be changed. Okay, then, most apps can be moved to the SD card after they are installed, however, many cannot be moved out of phone memory, resulting in a crowded tiny space and a vast empty SD card. So I can make sure the apps I'm installing can go to the SD card, right? I was thinking that would sort of solve the problem. But now, there's an additional problem: there's so little space left on the phone memory, about 16MB, that it's getting close to where there won't be enough room to even put apps there temporarily. As far as I know you cannot install apps directly on the SD card. Like a huge room with a teeny tiny door. I've had to uninstall apps that I really wanted to even get room to go through the phone memory to the SD card. Of course, the largest apps (some of them useless to me) came with the phone and cannot be uninstalled or moved to the SD card. In looking at other phone descriptions, I see people describing phone memory sizes like 2GB as too small. That's more than 10 times the size of the phone memory of the LG Optimus! It's too bad because I had no other problems and really enjoyed the phone until I ran into this problem, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I have no problem with Virgin Mobile's service.

At first I thought it was a steal, but I realized pretty quickly that you get what you pay for. A few months after I bought the phone, it started to experience a lot of lag. Everything feels like it takes 5 times as long as it should. Even the keyboard takes a few seconds to pull up when I want to type something. Nothing is instantaneous. Part of the slowness might be due to the tiny internal storage, which causes my phone to frequently complain about running low on space even though I've limited myself to just a few apps and I've moved everything I can to the SD card.To make matters worse, half of the apps I use crash on a regular basis. The GPS navigation causes the phone to crash at least once every time I first open it. In fact, the GPS crashes occur with such regularity that I've gotten into the habit of opening the navigation app before heading out so that the phone will crash before I'm in the car, just to get the crash out of its system.One smaller con about this phone is that the audio quality of recorded videos is horrendous. To be fair, that's the kind of thing you should expect from a cheap phone like this, but I want to mention it as a warning to anyone planning to record videos.

It falls out of my pocket constantly, and although it comes apart, it starts right back up perfectly. It's a brick, it won't break. The touch screen is responsive, and the camera (eh) is good for day shooting still objects, but not for taking pictures of energetic pets or concert scenes. Sound is clear (unless it's videos from loud areas, concerts or parties). No real complaints with battery life - if you're on facebook for a few hours, of course the battery is going to drain, but with texting, calling, and occasionally checking networks, the battery (for me) usually lasts from 6:30 am to 8:30 pm, which is enough time for me. It's not a hassle to charge over night.My one true complaint is the memory isn't great. I don't have many apps and have to delete photos I don't view every once in a while.

To describe it in a single word, I'd call it \"adequate.\" I enjoyed nearly everything about this phone, but its few minor and increasingly frustrating flaws have led me to quickly begin searching for a superior device.To begin with the positive, I loved the fact that the LGOV packs many of the features commonly sought after from modern smartphones in a sweet slim compact design, meaning you won't have to carry around a brick in your pocket just to check a Yelp review or write an email. In addition, the app suite available for download for the LGOV is almost as wide as for a brand new phone, but being that it is a slightly outdated phone (Android OS 2.2) several apps won't be available.That being said, while finding apps to use for your phone won't be difficult, operating them may be. This phone is somewhat slow, at least compared to newer models. This isn't a problem when you're calling or texting, but processor intensive functions cause noticeable lag - browsing the web or your photo gallery can be a chore sometimes, and you can forget about gaming on this phone.Another (last) major gripe about this phone is its embarrassingly tiny internal memory which can't handle downloading more than a handful of apps or in-text pictures from friends. I hated having to rummage through the memory to delete items to make room for new ones, and even though I have a microSD, not much can be ported over.Overall, for the purpose of making calls and sending texts regularly, this phone fits the bill if you want to save money.

I do the $35 monthly plan, which is fine for my needs. I don't talk on the phone much, but I like accessing the internet from time to time with wireless.  I get good service, rarely drop a call, and all in all I'm pretty happy with it.  I can, however, see some problems that a more savvy user would not tolerate.  The wireless/internet I believe is 3G.  It can be slower than molasses.  You can watch Netflix and check facebook and such if you've got a good connection, but the average \"free\" wireless hotspot is not going to let you do anything without a fight.  My second complaint is the battery life is really quite bad.  It's not bad at ALL if you're just using it as a phone.  It keeps its charge pretty well, and I've left it for a couple of days and it was still fine.  The trouble comes when you do ANY sort of \"playing around\" on it.  It drains that battery dry so quick, you don't even know what happened. You're in the green one minute, it's shutting itself down the next. There is also some glitching issues where a random sound will play on a loop constantly until I reset it. I believe it's a \"facebook pop\".

I have essentially combined my IpodTouch and my cell phone in this one product.  I now seldom carry my iTouch with me as this phone carries music, podcasts, apps, etc.  And it works with both WiFi and 3G.  There are 2 issues I have with it:  One is the memory storage - I increased the removable storage to 32GB so I can carry more music and books, however, the phone itself is only 8GB and that severely limits the apps you can put on it.  Many apps cannot be moved to the SD disc or continue to take up storage room on the phone.  Therefore I have to frequently clear out data/cache to create room on the phone and to get rid of the annoying icon that tells me storage is low.  When that happens, I cannot use the internet as it will stop and tell there is not enough memory to do so.  The second issue, and it's not the phone's fault, is I use Virgin Mobile, which is based on the Sprint network, and it appears that Sprint's network is shrinking in this area.  They've taken down some towers and I just don't get good reception anymore.

UPDATE: the apps that come with the phone cannot be updated since internal memory is so low, the only apps that can be update are your new/personal apps you download fresh from google play, since those apps are stored into the SD card.i am gonna have to lower the score for this smartphone from a 4* to a 3*. the main reason for that is, the phone freezes too often and you can't update apps stored on the internal memory of the phone.the prime issue with this phone is STORAGE SPACE, there is barely any. even when you put a micro sd card you still have the problem of some apps not being able to be stored into the sd card memory space (not sure if there is a fix for this issue). i am lucky i have been blessed with a grateful spirit, i am grateful i even have a phone. if i was someone else i would had given this phone a 1 or 2 stars because of the storage issues.update: i managed to put some apps into the sd card. i have more space now. i recommend not downloading graphics heavy games, and only download apps that you must need.Bottom line: (07/27/2012) the phone is great, but storage is a issue for app heavy users, make sure you store most of your apps on the micro sd card, especially if you have a 16GB card and up. if you use a smartphone for games, movies, e-books, shopping or social networking, this phone would be good but you will have to risk not having enough space. just buy a high end smartphone if you plan to read a lot of e-books and see a lot of movies on your phone. get this phone if you are certain you aren't gonna use too much storage, and if you don't mind if the phone freezes often.update: (07/29/2012) i raised my score back to a 4*, because the phone performs really good despite the minor lags and crashes and poor battery life. web browsing is surprisingly really good, music is great, and apps run great (depending on graphics). overall great phone.update: (08/03/2012) the phone doesn't freeze anymore, but keep a watch on that memory. also some apps are not compatible with this phone. mostly graphic heavy apps.Final Update: (08/16/2012) the score has gone back to 3* since the limited memory has become a bigger issue now. you can't send or receive new text messages if memory runs low. i have to keep deleting apps. the phone also crashed at random times, but that does NOT annoy me at all, it is just the storage issue that bothers me a lot. i will stick with the phone for now. will upgrade to something with at least 8GB in the future. btw, the virgin mobile service is really good in my area.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible, terrible phone", "Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "RDROSSQK6CD6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these phones on May 9; the return policy expired June 12.

So much that when you have only a few apps you will have to delete all your texts if you want to send one because of lack of space. Its only a $100 phone so whatever. It just takes some getting used to.  After that no problems, great call quality, decent web browsing. And after doing this for no more that 3 hours. My battery was on red. Its not good.

If you really want this phone, go buy an extended battery, or else. The keyboard is cramped and tiny (if you have big hands like me) and landscape mode doesn't help it. Learning all these things about this phone, I still loved it. I drop it still a year and a half later almost every day. Full impact and it still looks brand new (which is good if you are clumbsy). Fastforward a year and a year and a half later and its pathetic. I have only two installed apps. Instagram and facebook. It crashes atleast 15 times a day and randomly turns off about 8 times. Its very sluggish too. And you can't use any app within the first 5 mins of it being turned on, or geuss what? It will crash some more. It has become a frustrating nightmare.

You might have read that they changed the software and took out the tethering option. You can still tether this phone using a program called Foxfi. Virgin blocks the download of Foxfi from the Google Play store. You can download Foxfi from the developer website. With Foxfi, wifi tethering is possible without rooting your phone.  Now that we've established that you CAN tether, the question is SHOULD you tether.  Virgin will tell you that tethering violates their TOS. Personally, I think what I do with data within my data allotment is none of Virgin's GD business.  That being said, I rarely use the tethering. First, Virgin's 3g network is nothing to write home about, and there seems to be some performance hit between the incoming speed and the tethered speed. The first time I used Foxfi, it delivered 40kb/min -- in other words, slower than dial-up. In subsequent testes, it did better, but rarely over a couple hundred kb/sec.  That's fast enough to check your email, but not so fast that you won't seek out a wifi when you can.I usually use my Optimus V for streaming Pandora and XM-Radio.  It works well for this; however I miss having dedicated control buttons like I had on my XMP3 portabble radio.  In general, it's a good low-priced basic smart phone.

I keep this phone in a clip case on my waist or in pocket and have to say it is durable.  Let's just say it has gotten a pretty good durability test.  It is at times under powered processing wise and the battery thing that many others have said may be true if you use it extensively for GPS, which I don't.  I use mine quite a bit recently for Google Play Music and Bluetooth headphones to listen for music.  I've never gotten any less than a full days battery even with playing music and checking email all day.  I usually get three full days without much phone use but usually charge it daily unless I'm traveling.  I've run it out after two days quite a few times.  Obviously, use leads to battery loss.The camera is good enough but I find it lacking.  It can't take any movement.  There is no worthwhile stabilizing mechanism or flash.  There are many deficiencies for the camera but not that many in comparison to other phones.As far as traveling, I spend most my time in Western Washington and rarely leave service area.  The phone does not pick up a great signal strength but it works pretty well here, even in some areas that don't seem to be on the coverage map.The main issue I have with it is program storage.  I bought an upgrade to the SD card that goes with it and have moved all apps that would move to the SD card.  That hasn't kept it from really limiting how many apps it can run.

I like the phone so far and am happy with my decision.The main issue I see with this phone is the lack of internal phone memory. I want certain applications on my phone, but I cannot have them because I do not have enough internal memory. Even with a 32GB SD card, and Apps moved over to the card, I still do not have enough space, because every app (even the ones on the SD card) use some internal phone memory to be used. That is a serious inconvenience. *** UPDATE: I discontinued the use of the phone's built in email, and switched to a Yahoo email app, and that gave me back half of my phone's internal memory. I don't know why or how, but there it is. So if you are short on memory, you may want to try this.The screen is smaller, and even though it is not by much it is noticable. The browser is not bad, but you cannot switch tabs on it(which I loved and used all of the time). It is harder to read on this phone, whether on web page or on ereader, because of the size of the print and the way the browser acts, but it is possible if you do not have problems with your vision. I couldn't change the browser because I didn't have the phone space. Now that I have the room, I may try one of the apps out there. There are a few other things that the Iphone has available that the Android does not, but conversly there are things that the Android offers that the Iphone did not. The battery in this phone last much longer than my Iphone did. I understand the settings and have the notifications on minimal and certain settings perfected so that the battery easily lasts me all day long, even with heavy use. I love that. The Iphone I had to charge at least once during the day with heavy use. However, I do worry about the charging port on this phone. It is not easy to connect and disconnect the chargers and I worry that eventually the port will break and the phone will stop taking a charge, but I will not know that for sure until I have had the phone for longer. Also, on the Optimus, I can get email from all of my accounts instead of chosing just one. I don't know if that is something they have fixed for Iphone, but on mine I could only have one account automatically go to my phone and had to check the others manually. With the Android, I set up my accounts and can check them all.Ultimately, this is a good little smartphone. It is reasonably priced and you really cannot beat the service. It is steady and reliable.

This plan gives you 300 minutes, unlimited text and unlimited data which is perfect for me, my girlfriend has a Verizon contract and is about $90/month so if you don't use a ton of minutes each month this deal can't be beat by the major carriers. It is also nice that is month to month so if I ever lose my job I don't have to worry about paying a cancellation fee or ruining my credit. The phone it self is great, the touch screen is responsive and a decent size. The internal memory is fairly limited if you are the type of person that downloads a lot of apps however that is easily upgradable w/ a larger micro SD card. One complaint about this phone is that it doesn't run some of the newer more taxing apps, also it seems to have slowed down a bit since when I first got it. Overall though for the initial/monthly price this is a great value.*Changed my review from 4 to 2 as after about a year and a half with this phone it was almost unusable, I never dropped it or anything to damage it internally but after a while it became extremely slow, would restart on its own, would exit text messages mid text for no reason and have really slow response times to every click so I had to replace it with something newer.

The controls are pretty intuitive, and the Swype app is awesome for text. I can even compose full emails on the phone (albeit slower than on a keyboard). The screen appears to be self-healing? In any case, it has survived several weeks tossed in my purse without a case with nary a scratch. Impressive.Three notes of caution-- it has a small internal storage space. That can be remedied by buying a larger SD card and moving everything you can to that (there's an app that can help you with that). Or you can root your phone and move *everything* to the SD card.Also, the phone as it is out of the box is not Flash-compatible. It will play YouTube videos through the YouTube app, but not videos on stand-alone sites. This appears to be solved when you root it, as well.Finally, this is really a data-focused phone. Talking on it makes you sound like you're in a tin can (though it also has something to do with the phone you're calling). Most of the plans are talk-minimum and data-heavy anyway, but just be forewarned.

So far I am very happy with it.PROS3G and Wifi - My previous phone was a Kyocera Loft. That was fine for doing things like occasionally checking E-Mail and Facebook, but it was through a painfully slow connection. The Optimus is a HUGE improvement over that. The 3G is great, and when it uses wifi the connection is instantaneous. I can now use things like Pandora and Youtube, which were impossible on my old phone.Android 2.2 - Like I said, I don't have much of a frame of reference since this is my first Android phone, but Android 2.2 seems fairly intuitive and easy to navigate.Swype text entry - This makes typing on the phone go so much faster. You just slide your finger from letter to letter on the touch screen, and it automatically figures out what you were typing. It works great!Price - This phone might be priced as an \"entry level\" Android phone, but I have two friends who are also on Virgin Mobile and they both had this phone as their first Android phone. One of them upgraded to the Motorola Triumph and one upgraded to the HTC Wildfire. They both said they miss the Optimus, and that they got fooled into thinking that a more expensive phone would be better. They also both have plans to go back to the Optimus. I should note here that I bought mine at Radio Shack for about $30 more than the Amazon price. I had thought that Virgin fixed the price of their phones so that they cost the same wherever you buy them, but I guess I was wrong about that. It was still a good deal at $30 more.CONSBattery Life - I have really been putting this phone through its paces, streaming videos and music, playing games, etc., and so far I have to charge it every day. At my level of usage, I am thinking it might be beneficial to upgrade to the extended life battery.Apps stuck in phone memory - If it were up to me, I would move everything to the SD card, but I can't. There are lots of apps that are stuck in the phone memory, including some that I downloaded! I don't know how much memory the phone started with, but it is down to 78MB and I am concerned that I am going to fill it up. At that point, I guess I will just have to delete some of my apps. It would be nice if the downloader automatically gave an option of where to install an app, and even nicer if the app management tool allowed all apps to be moved to the SD card.Button backlight timer not configurable - This is not a huge deal, but the timer for the button backlights is set at around five seconds and there is no option to configure that time. It's not a huge deal until you are using the phone in the dark and then you have to feel around for the buttons.Lock-up - This might be related to an app and not the phone, but when I am using the streaming app for my favorite sports talk station the phone will lock up if the 3G signal drops off. The only way to recover from that seems to be to remove the battery and re-boot the phone.If Amazon would allow half stars, I would give this phone 4.5 stars for almost perfect.

I ordered the phone on a Friday, I received it by Monday (I was very impressed). The phone has a nice tactile feeling to it and the phone is just the right size (3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9 inches) for people with small hands like me. At 2.7 ounces, the phone is very light and portable. Additionally, I don't have to recharge the phone as often as I used to recharge my old one. With one daily charge of the battery I can use the Pandora application while checking my personal e-mail and surfing the web roughly 2 hours per day, I don't talk on the phone very much so I only use it for about 15 minutes per day. I also use the built-in MP3 player application to listen to my tunes stored on the included 2 GB microSD card. I don't watch Youtube videos very often; however, I've noticed that whenever I use the Iheart radio app for about 30 minutes, the phone gets very hot and the battery is drained so I have to recharge the battery more often when using this application. I have not used the phone with wi-fi so I can't comment on how soon the battery lasts with the wi-fi turned on. I've taken a few photos with the phone and 3.2 megapixel camera is decent (what do you expect for the price?). When surfing the web, the 3.2-inch touchscreen is very responsive and bright, I've noticed that when I go out for a walk, the screen is hard to see outdoors when exposed to the sun light.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the phone, very light, portable, nice fit and finish, long battery life, excellent sound (loud volume) and touch screen is very responsive, great value.Virgin Mobile planI activated my LG Optimus V phone with Virgin Mobile, I was able to do this on-line and was able to keep my existing phone number, since I'm not a big talker or texter, the $35.00 monthly plan (with no annual contract) is just right for me.

Then and Now! and What I have Learned", "Author": "RLHammon", "ReviewID": "R34O1EYLAMKDHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well I am very happy with the product. I have never owned a cell phone like this one and was very surprised on how fast it is and that it is more like a very small laptop than a phone. And the apps that you can get for it are almost limitless. It is quite a surprise. The SD Card of 32 gigs is great for pics and videos you can make, I am quite happy with the 8 gigs SD card I am useing. But the 2gig SD card that comes with it would be plenty for the strickly bussiness users, not so much for the media or power users.I am most unhappy with the amount of memmory that the OS has, because if you are a app nut like I am you will find that you will have to remove apps to make more memory space. Out of the 5 windows or desktops that you can scroll through I haven't been able to fill all of them at the most 3 to 4 desktops have been filled for quick use. Of course that cuts down on the cluster and most likely you will not even use all of them. But the fact remains there should be enough memory to do it if you want.UPDATE:After useing the cell phone for about 3 months now I have a few things more to say about it.Pros: or Con:1. I had a problem getting the Virgin Mobile data network working the only reason it started working is because of my curosity. One day I pushed the actvation button even though it was already activated and after a minute or so I noticed that if I turned of my wifi the 3g would start working.2. The media volume is veary low.3. Even though I live only about 1.5 miles from a cell tower my bar is only showing 1 bar while in the house outside is moves to 2 bars. This means I have to go outside to talk to a call if I stay inside the voices are broken up.If I played with if the battery went down in about 2 hours, but if I just let it stand by for a call the battery lastes 2 days before it got down to about 30% power left. I didn't like some of the applacations that came with it or just wasn't going to use them and because they weren't removeable they just sat there takig up memory and because they were automaticly updated they took up more memory so I couldn't install something I would use because they were takeing up the memory I would need :(.Other than the above I realy liked the phone. But it is my first smartphone so it wasn't hard to please me.I FOUND OUT ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO THAT VIRGIN MOBILE HAS PUT A LIMIT ON UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD OF DATA USEING THE 3g TO 2.5 GIGs a MONTH.No longer UnLimited e-mails, web browseing, messaging or anything when useing 3g. Of course you can go over the 2.5G but your monthly billing of $25.00 or what ever you pay will be higher. I knew it wouldn't last it was just a ploy to get new users because we told every one we talked to when it came to the cost of the service we were useing almost braging.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "The worst", "Author": "vrystaat", "ReviewID": "R2PA8O5ZTXCR1K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have just bought this phone, & it is going back.How this piece of junk gets 5 stars, I have no idea.The on screen keyboard is the worst I've ever used.Text messages are extremely difficult to type, send and store.

All of the five star reviews are probably from people who just got it.All of these issues have been happening n he past 3 months. The biggest problem for me is the internal phone storage space which is only 108mb. Constantly my phone will randomly ring and then the icon will show up that \"phone storage space is low\", and you cant clear that icon!! Then about five minutes after that icon pops up another will show up and say text message memory full. I deleted all of my text messgaes so how is it full? It also cant recieve text messages until i delete something.  Now you might be thinking why don't I just delete some apps. Well I cant because half of my apps were preinstalled which means you cant transfer them to the sd card and you cant uninstall them either. Most of my apps are on my sd card that has plenty of space, and there are only around 5 that are no more than 20 mb so what takes up all of the space????????? Virgin mobile gets horrible service where I live, and in my own house it only gets 2 bars!The internet is is sooo slow most of the time even on wifi. It's especialy bad almost to the point where you can't use it on 3g.  I have two friends who have an iphone and half of the time when they text me it shows up blank. I really don't know why this happens, but it happens a lot! Another problem is the lagging. Wheever I try to use facebook the screen will go black and I'll have to exit it and enter again like three times for it to work. Another major problem is the freezing. I am constantly taking out the battery and putting it back in to restart my phone because the power button won't work when its frozen. Sometimes when Im texting people somewhat quickly the keyboard will glitch and then freeze making me shut off the phone and restart it. It does this so often that I can't stand it anymore!  I forgot to mention this but another thing about virgin mobile is my phone constantly goes into 1x service which is basically pointless because you cant do anything.  I also enjoy uploading youtube videos to my account, but it is quite difficult when the video is longer than a minute. For a video about 3 minutes to upload on wifi it takes around and hour and it takes a ton of internal phone space too. Alos, my friend and I were both downloading this game at the same location and I started downloading mine 2 minutes before her and her phone finished ahead of mine. It's just really hard for me because I always have to use a friends phone to call home even in the the school that I go to, and half of the places I go. Plus, it will randomly restart itself for no reason.  The sound quality is very bad. I will put my phone on full volume and I still cant hear my ringtone. My parents used to get mad at me and ask me why I didn't text them back, but honestly I didnt hear it. Same goes for calling.

The stock VM rom is, simply put, not good. It's slow, it likes to freeze up, the internal storage is woefully insufficient, and it's not very battery-friendly. After installing a different rom, I was able to remedy these issues and, as a bonus, am now running Gingerbread on my Optimus V instead of Froyo.With the custom rom, I was able to overclock the cpu from 600 to 864 MHz (although I suspect this phone has the same cpu as the Optimus V slider and Elite, only under-clocked). This has noticeably improved the performance of the phone, and almost completely eliminated freeze-ups (You still won't be running the really high-end games, but overall the phone will operate in a much smoother fashion). With the root, I was also able to install an app that lets you expand the internal memory of the phone onto a Micro SD card. This is important because many apps will only install to internal memory; so if you only have the phone's stock 128 MB to work with, you run out of space quick. The battery life is also better under Gingerbread, I can usually make it through a day now without having to recharge the phone halfway through. The camera is so-so, only 3.2 MP, but it works for basic stuff. The video capture isn't great, but it does function. The call quality is good; I don't have trouble hearing people or being heard when I make a call. Service in my area is pretty good. Video playback is good, no problems there (unless it's wonderful Microsoft Silverlight). The screen could be a little bigger (it doesn't make a great gps, for example). This phone is a little thicker than most newer smart phones, but still fits in your pocket quite nicely. In the interest of time, I won't list all the cool things Android itself is capable of; but rest-assured, it's a highly efficient, capable, and customizable open OS.In conclusion, I would not recommend this phone to someone who wasn't going to \"root\" it. The internal memory is not sufficient, and the stock rom's performance and battery life issues make it highly undesirable. I would rate this phone two out of five stars stock.

Then you NEED to do your research on the sprint network for your area. My area gets PHENOMENAL sprint service. I had Verizon and was paying over $55 for 400 minutes 500 text and 25mb web. With this phone and sprint network I get way better coverage and more web/messages/minutes for LESS. In addition, with Verizon I did not have a smartphone.Now on the phone itself:BATTERY - As long as I manage my open apps/wi-fi my battery performs amazing. I use this phone 100X more than I did my Samsung rogue and it still lasts 2x longer. I am constantly playing games and texting and charge it every other day depending on use. Standby battery time is great when not using phone(make sure to turn off apps and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).SCREEN - Beautiful screen for the money. May be small for some, but you save money and battery life with going small.ANTENNA - 3 to MAX Bars plus 3G everywhere I go in Tampa, FL / Sarasota, FL  Sprints 3G is plenty fast for me.KEYBOARD - This would be the only downfall for me. Its kinda tough to type with it, but if your good with the swipe type feature than it makes it easier. You could go for the slider version of the Optimus V if you want.SPEAKER - Media/Speakerphone is loud but highly adjustable. Call volume could be a little higher, but I've dealt with worse.OS - Have had no crashes since purchasing. Phone has been quicker than expected for spending $50. It isn't a dual core Galaxy S2 though so don't expect that. Have had no problems with games such as superstar baseball or angry birds. Browser is good as expected for the screen size.Conclusion: This phone is a steal at anything $100 or less with no contract.

It's too bad that the Sprint network, on which VM rides, doesn't have more coverage in the northwest.3G data coverage is spotty and doesn't always work indoors, but when it works, it works well.First, second and third-tier customer support are of questionable value. First- and second-tier appear to be \"follow the sun\" call centers around the world, while third-tier is based in North America. The people in third-tier are much more empowered to help, but they were still unable to get my service going in the first place. I had to approach fourth-tier support (executive escalations) to get my initial service configured and working correctly, including number porting. Lower tiers of customer service must be both trained and empowered to do more to satisfy customers. Asking customers repeatedly to reboot their phones or punch in a few numbers won't cut it when the problem is a broken database entry on the VM or Sprint end of things.Billing for phone insurance is perpetually broken and I am tempted to cancel it.Android 2.3 \"Gingerbread\" for the LG Optimus V should have been rolled out already, but hasn't been.The recent price increase, if it ends up affecting me as an existing customer, may drive me away. At the pricing as of August 2011, BeyondTalk is too expensive.Update: February 2013. I have departed Virgin Mobile for Ting. The customer service at Virgin Mobile is still unbearably bad and the telephone support personnel haven't been trained on the new billing system that replaced all account numbers, making it difficult to obtain correct data for number portability. Expect to have to send an EECB to get the process completed. Third-tier support appears to have been moved out of North America.

One of the first nights I had this phone it was 80-85% charged, I turned on the live background and by morning the phone was nearly completely dead.

I've only had it for a couple months, but having to physically remove the battery to get it to unfreeze has become fairly common.It frequently locks up when trying to do anything, even just unlocking the phone to use it sometimes takes 15-20 seconds for it to respond. Apps (especially Facebook) frequently crash or freeze, and it takes forever to update the news feed (sometimes it doesn't update at all.) When I have to reboot my phone just to see Facebook updates, something is wrong. Data in general is extremely slow on this phone. Also to use wifi, even at home, I have to go into the settings and select which network I want to connect to every time I unlock the phone. Absolutely ridiculous.I actually had to keep my old iPhone around because I can basically only use this LG as a phone and navigation. Navigation is one thing I'm impressed with, but it too frequently locks up and won't update where I am.It's always giving me \"memory low\" warnings, even without downloading new apps. There's no way to automatically save to the SD card, so the crappy internal memory is constantly getting filled up, forcing me to manually close apps and delete old data and text messages.I'm honestly flabbergasted that so many people like this phone, I swear they're all coming from a 15 year old Nokia.

The LG Optimus V is rootable (stoke ROM only, costume ROM well cause the loss of 3g DATA Service if you try to activate phone for the time after flashing new ROM), using Gingerbreak.  After rooting and changing the way the CPU governor behaves, it is both faster and power efficient.*Tip*There is a small bug with the \"Call Standby\" in that it aways looks for either 3g or 1x data service every after connecting, which eats up the battery quick when the phone is idle.  This can be temporally fixed by one of two ways: the later is the best way but this well have to be done after every reboot or startup.  After you do either one of the two ways plug the phone back into the charger to reset the Battery Usage Stats, and what you are looking for is the \"Call Standby\" to be less then 50%.One:  Putting the phone into Airplane Mode for 12 seconds.OrTwo:  dailing *#*#4636#*#*Dail *#*#4636#*#* / Select Phone Information / Press the Menu Button and Select \"Select Radio Band\" and Press Force Close after. / Select Phone Information again and got to Set Proffered Network Type and select CDMA then select CDMA (Auto).Tips for Root users:Go to, be come a member of [androidcentral.com] forums, this is a good phone and there are people other there that can help you make this phone even greater.  Say-away from ROM Manger and ROM Manger's ClockworkMod Recovery 5.0 or higher, as both are incompatible with the Hitachi Screen (Android v2.2.2), if you wish to flash a costume recovery then go with this one RA-OptV-3.06, it is sable; I've used it to Flash all the ROM's that I've tried.Update: After having this phone for 3 months, and Flashing several different ROM's I can safely say these is one great phone very easy to Root overclocks well and great battery life with the right configurations for your type of usage.  I'm now running the Harmonnia 2.0.3 IHO (Gingerbread) ROM and love it, the in-beaded CPU controls and RAM Memory Management is fantastic, equaling great battery life.  This phone is a good phone, the problem is the Android FLoyo O/S being weighted down by all the bloatware that Virgin Mobile added, and all that bloatware are Startup Apps and that slows it down.  Must Costume ROM's do not have all that bloatware and the phone as a result starts up fast and is just plain faster.Food for thought: rooting your phone does void the Warranty, so it you do Root make backup of it after flashing a Costume Recovery that way if something does go wrong and needs repair you can return back to Stock.Final Report:  After cycling the battery and wiping battery sats, this is what I see running the Harmonnia 2.03 IHO (Gingerbread) ROM with CPU Governor set to Conservative and Overclocked to 825MHz.  Phone idle about 1% power draw every 3 hours, playing music through headphones with the DSP EQ running see about 3% per-hour Screen Off and 5% Screen On.  Talk-time with headphones is better then without, running about 8% per-hour (without headphones about 11% per-hour); web over 3g 11% per-hour while over WiFi 8% per-hour with screen on.  This was done without running a battery saver type app and those people (like myself) that are medium to heavy smartphone user those apps would do nothing for you until you sleep and the phone sets idle, and most people charge their phones over night.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOPE", "Author": "Jeffy", "ReviewID": "R2H07X7ZE0A2PR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I bought this fing phone, it came with someone else's memory, pictures, and everything, also the BATTERY DIES IN 1HOUR! charges for all day and dies and does nothing.

I'll add a little to the great reviews here, from my perspective as a developer.First, I read on a review here that I could use SipDroid & assorted complexities to get free cell phone via WiFi service. This path was a no-go. But - just try Groove IP instead! The app costs $4.99 from the Android Market, and you need a (free!) Google Voice account and phone number, which *must* be attached to a you@gmail.com account. (My other one didn't work...) Other than that, works great! Set up in minutes, and *none* of it was as mystifying as the no-go Sipdroid route... I think the Sipdroid loophole has simply been closed. But with Groove IP, the cell phone receives and dials calls, direct from the cell phone icon.Second, I wanted to do Flex -> smartphone development. Only to find that Adobe AIR \"doesn't support the LG Optimus V\". Other places will tell you that it's ARMv6 processor phones in general. It is not true. It was not easy... But I eventually did get this phone to run apps, directly from Adobe Flash Builder 4.6 (debug on device and everything!) To get Adobe AIR itself installed on the phone, just download the AIR SDK from Adobe.com, find the file C:\\AdobeAIRSDK\\runtimes\\air\\android\\emulator\\Runtime.apk, copy it to your cell phone SD card, and install that, with AppInstaller (also available in Android Market free if you don't have it.)Sorry for the gory details. But I really did buy this phone intending to never buy a contract on it, and use it for Flex -> smartphone development.

Especially if you're a business person, be very very careful before starting service. If you're a teen, this probably wont count :-)Pros: Coverage is pretty decent - way better than Metro,I think. The 3G service is nice. & For the year plus that I've been on VM, their customer service has steadily improved.Cons: I started having issues way back in Sept or Oct of 2011 when I realized I basically could not be on more than one call at a time - no multiple calls features at all! So no 3-way, no conference calls or even switching between calls! So, I called support and they said they would \"send\" a repair \"code\" to my phone automatically to fix the issue. That didn't help at all!Soon after, I got my wife the Optimus V (coz all this time, I thought it was my cheap handset that had issues) and was honestly delighted by VM's 3G service. But like my cheap hand-set, it immedietely had similar issue with multiple-call features - I started getting very suspicious of the service itself! That was Nov 2011. Just today, I called because of a billing issue (that's a story for another day!!! Grrrrr!!) and decided to follow-up on the multiple call thing that had never gotten resolved! Turns out that VM quietly got rid of multiple call features!! One of the reps I talked to said they only offer them on the very high-end phones - yap, count Optimus V out too... not even for an extra charge! Honestly, for me, that's a deal breaker. This is the last month both of us are on VM service!! To be crystal clear on how bad this issue is, if you are on one call and someone else calls you, do not swtich over to pick up!

I got one after seeing other people use the same phone on the Sprint network, and being impressed by it.My old phone was a no-frills clamshell, the LG VX3850, on Verizon Wireless.  The difference in functionality-to-price ratio between the old phone and the Optimus V is night and day.  Unfortunately, so is the difference in reliability.  The Verizon phone never let me down even once, even when it broke at the clamshell hinge.  The Virgin Mobile phone loses it's data connection every few days, it seems like, and I've seen the drop last for 48 hours at a time.Google the phrase \"time without signal\" and \"Optimus V\" and you'll see a large number of references to the problem from around the country.  There are a variety of suggested workarounds posted on various message boards, like toggling airplane mode, rebooting the phone, and changing settings on the test menu, but in my case, none of them really helped.  When I emailed VM about the problems I was having, they took 3 days to respond, and acknowledged that there was a problem with their network.You can check your phone's time w/o signal status in the battery usage menu under the about phone menu in system settings.  In my case, the number generally hovers around 50%.So keep this in mind if you're going to buy this phone.  It will only be functional about 50% of the time.  I'm still leaning towards keeping the VM phone and porting my old Verizon number to it, because the features and price are still attractive.Battery life typically lasts me a day and a half, with the use of a battery saving app, and about 12 hours without an app installed.  GPS works very well with Google maps and navigator apps.  There's even a Quick Settings app which enables you to toggle on the phone's wifi hotspot feature, thus allowing you to tether other devices to it and access the internet through the phone's 3g connection.Every now and then a text message I sent will be delivered to the other party a day or two late.  I'm not sure what the excuse is for this, because sms messages are sent over the voice network, as I understand it.I have reconciled myself to the idea that this phone is really only meant for light use, as I have other communications options available to me for most of the day.  If this were my only option, and I used the phone all day long, it simply would not be enough.However, as a portable wifi/gps-enabled device, it's really not a bad deal, provided you find it for the standard $150 retail price.  I also own an Archos 70it, and I think the Optimus is the better designed, more useable device.  Any Android tablet that is more functional than the Optimus is going to cost close to $300 at this point in time.  Any better Android smartphone is going to require a 2 year service contract.Even if you don't want to use Virgin Mobile's crappy phone service, the device is still useful for browsing and gps mapping.I haven't decided yet whether I want to stick with Verizon and return this phone to Radio Shack, but if I went that route, I would probably opt to upgrade to Verizon's equivalent of the Optimus.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Over Priced", "Author": "L.

This soon went far beyond being mildly annoying, as it frequently woke me up in the middle of the night. It also made me a laughing stock at work. The cubicles in my office would erupt with the sounds of mocking laughter and shouts of \"Dwoid!\" every time my phone went off. Every day someone would call me \"Droid Guy\", yell \"Droid!\" whenever they saw me walking down an empty hallway, or pour Tabasco sauce down my pants. All because I cheaped out instead of just shelling out a few extra bucks for a Samsung Galaxy or iPhone. I was unable to disable the voice alerts no matter how hard I tried. Even putting the phone on silent didn't stop it completely. My son's wedding ceremony was completely ruined when my Droid glitched, causing it to utter \"Droid\" literally every other second. Attempts to turn the phone off at this point only caused the repetitions to increase in speed and volume. I was crammed in the middle of an extremely crowded church pew, and it took me several minutes to remove myself from the ceremony. My family wouldn't speak to me for weeks.I've finally decided to return my Droid. Though the damage this phone has done to my social status and sanity won't be so easily shed. Whatever you do, please do not buy this phone!

However, there are quirks with the phone that I particularly don't like.For example, the battery drains quickly within a day even after constantly disabling the extra applications. My phone has to be charged constantly, at least every single day because of the applications.Also, the phone automatically dials people without me even touching the screen or dial pad.Another problem is that, when I use the mp3 on the phone and accept an incoming call,  I have go back to the home screen to reopen the mp3; I have to do this because the mp3 doesn't always resume playing after hanging up.I didn't realize that the phone is on a 3G network with Virgin Mobile, so streaming videos would produce videos that freeze for a period between 10 seconds to minutes at a time. You can not watch a video like this, it's frustrating.I thought by having full web browsing, that I wouldn't have to use my laptop too much.But it's AGGRAVATING to search the web with this phone because when you browse the web, the letters are too small, and it's hard to fit everything on a small screen so you can't see the entire page on the phone at once. You try to make the screen bigger by hitting a button on the screen that appears and then disappears rapidly, so then you hit some other link by accident, which is so frustrating!The camera does take pretty good pictures especially during daylight.

Three months ago, out of the blue, I wasn't receiving calls or texts and outgoing calls resulted in a canned response that I am \"within range of a Sprint Private network, please move outside of the private network before making a call.\" This is from my house and I work from home.  This seemed illegal. After walking angerly down the street, I was able to call Virgin Mobile tech support at 1-877-600-8065. They of course don't want to support the phone while I was talking on it. I explained that this was my only phone and that I worked from home, so no work number. He gave me notes which I wrote down. They had me try to reset the MSID and MDN #s by typing #847446 hit the disconnect or power button.  This opens the NAM window. They had me re-enter the same numbers in that were already there. MSID was a number similar to the phone's number and the MDN was my phone's number. OK'ing out of the NAM menu rebooted the phone. All worked alright for a few days. I was still only getting one bar in an area that they said I should have four bars, but I received calls and I could call out without the message. Three days passed. I tried the NAM reset again, but it did not work. After three more resets of the phone it finally let me call out again.Two days later, the message came back. I tried the reset several times to no avail. I called the support line and they were aware of the problem and they explained it to me. One of my neighbors has received an 'Airave' Sprint signal booster that Virgin phones try to connect to. Virgin Mobile works off of Sprint's network and unless I knew who had the Airwave and I asked them to have me added to their allowed list, I was out of luck. I was not happy. He had me reset NAM info again. The reset continued to work off and on for 2 months. I called back last week and asked if they had a solution. I of course had to re-explain the situation, where he again said I should do the reset. I said that wasn't good enough and that I needed to be transferred to billing for a refund. At this time he said that the problem could be resolved by a specific list of 4-5 phones, all of which were 2 year old models. They all could be programmed to ignore the Sprint 'Airwave' booster as a signal provider/tower. The Kyocera X-tc was the one that seemed the top of the list. He did not have the power to ship it out to me without supervisor approval, but the supervisor approved it and at this point my 1 bar phone disconnected. I called back and had to start over from scratch. Repeat for effect 'from scratch'. They have no record of any previous conversations. Again, I got to supervisor approval. They approved and then the help desk person said they could not locate a phone in supply to send to me. They suggested I call back the next morning and they could get it sent out. Reason being was stated that the phone supplies changed dramatically every four hours and it was likely to be available in the morning. I agreed, as everything went well with this phone tech. I called back in the morning and had to start over from scratch.I had gotten to the point where I was asked which phone I needed (approved by supervisor etc.) My one bar phone disconnected again. I called back again and had gotten to the supervisor approval stage when again I lost connection. I walked down the street and made the call again with two bars.  I of course had to start over from scratch and explained at the beginning how frustrated I was getting and walked the technician through all the steps I had been through. He put me on hold (there are always several holds per call) This time it was to track down someone who knew of the Airwave issue. I again retell the situation to this tech and he never asked for the supervisors approval and proceeded to ask me how I would be paying for the phone. I explained that I had already been approved for the phone on several previous calls and said he would contact a supervisor. He came back to the phone and said that I did not have enough Top-off minutes to deduct the phone charges from. I re-explained the whole mess to him and he refused to budge. I asked to speak directly to the supervisor. The supervisor's name was Javier. He of course asked me to start from the beginning. He stated that even though for three months I was getting less than half of my incoming calls, major delays on text messages and lower signal strength than I had been receiving before, and of course could not dial out without consistently getting the message to move outside the Sprint customers zone, that it was not their fault. I would have to pay for the phone. I explained that I had been through this two times before and the only problem was with the phone availability. I asked him to check with any other supervisors, he said he was the only one. My voice had definitely been rising as I was beginning to boil over. He said that he would would like me to remain professional. I said I needed to talk to the manager or his boss, and he refused, and said that he was the highest authority in the center.
