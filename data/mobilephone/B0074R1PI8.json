Do not buy from this seller!", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R1F59CJ7W9Z40F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "S. Howard", "ReviewID": "R3V44H2TDS651", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything we expect in a phone. The only issue is short battery life because it doesn't last a full day of use, we had to purchase a mobile charging station.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPhone 4s, Top 5 Hardware, Very Poor Software!", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID": "R2SKXRUOKULFA7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For years I've heard how great the iPhone is and with every iteration people seem to echo this sentiment.  So, I decided this time around I was going to try it out and see if it would satisfy the high expectations that my previous smartphones had built up.Honestly, I believe there's no easy way to review the iPhone without breaking it into two pieces as the Software and Hardware deserve equal consideration and I feel they help to balance the weaknesses of this phone.I will say, this phone does have some major failings in the Software so if you're just looking to find out how this is different from your current Smartphone then skip to that section.HARDWAREBUILD QUALITY The iPhone 4s Feels Solid, it isn't likely to come apart on its own and overall feels very solid.  The only area I would consider a weakness is in the choice of Glass used for the display so the phone is very well done over all.SCREEN For the past couple of years the iPhone 4/s had a pixel density advantage over pretty much every phone on the market and the screen featured the best viewing angles from any screen that isn't using Amoled Technology.  Well, not improving the screen size, resolution or technology used in the display has left the iPhone above average but no longer is it the best in any area.With Smartphone screens running Amoled technology viewing angles, black level, contrast and color had already left IPS Technology behind and if that wasn't bad enough all the latest Android Smartphones feature a HD 720P displays using various technology.Of course even the construction of the iPhone 4s Screen leaves something to be desired as many other Smartphone manufacturers have been using Gorilla Glass for a few years now and the glass is proving to be much more resistant to scratching or breaking; Sadly, Apple decided to go with a more traditional glass that is prone to shattering and this wouldn't be so bad but, it has been glued to the actual LCD since the iPhone 4 debuted.  Basically, this makes for a fairly pricey repair and the situation could be improved with Gorilla Glass.Overall, the screen is a top 5 Screen in that it does enough to rank 2nd or 3rd best in many categories that you view the screen but it really isn't in the running for the top spot anymore and Apple really blew their big advantage here by not updating the screen as well.SOUND HARDWARE Again, this is a very deep area to review and stating it is good, doesn't do it justice!  You see, Apple has used Cirrus Logic Chips for a few years now and while previous Android phones used to use the same technology, they've all gotten away from them for a reason that we can only assume are supply problems (Apple likes to buy up all the chips in advance to give themselves and advantage).Cirrus Logics DSP Chips are honestly known as the best available for Noise Canceling in phones and honestly, there really is no better phone on the market for eliminating background noise while making a phone call.  It is so good that it can be frustrating when you're trying to play something for somebody on the other end of the phone.Sound output for music and movies is decent but could be better and that's something I'll go into later on in the software section.Overall, the Audio is very good and voice quality is top notch!CPU Apple uses their proprietary ARM based A5 CPU which is a dual core 800 MHz CPU (it is listed as 1 GHz but speed tests show it is actually under clocked for  battery purposes no doubt). The A5 is a top 5 performer easily and could be the best CPU on the market but not many tests have tested just the CPU so we'll just leave it as being one of the best on the market.GPU To beef up the power of the phone Apple went with a dual core SGX543MP2 GPU from the folks that brought us the Graphics Technology behind the Nintendo 64.Nothing more needs to be said other than noting this is the best GPU on the market and there's nothing even close to it!  Most expected nVidia to compete but sadly, this puppy is top notch and it shows in the graphics it is capable of pushing!  We're talking console quality gaming graphics.ANTENNA / COMMUNICATIONS Obviously, this was a sore spot with the iPhone 4 and it was arguably the biggest ding Apple has ever taken to their reputation.  Well, it is safe to say that attenuation is normal from the 4s Antenna and I personally have not seen any dropped calls as a result of hand position.Overall the signal is decent, not the best but not the worst either.  Of course the biggest issue here is the lack of LTE and I'm not going to lie, this is a problem if you want to use bandwidth intensive applications.Overall, I wouldn't even say the iPhone 4s is in the top 10 for its Communications Hardware as it was intentionally handicapped by Apple.\fCAMERAS The 4s features both a front and rear camera with the front being a modest camera used mostly for self portraits, video conferencing, or making a short video of yourself.  The rear camera is used for Portraits and video but can also be used for videoconferencing.The front camera is on par with most and doesn't set itself apart.  The rear camera is a top 2 camera with a backlit sensor, wide aperture and low noise considering the sensor size.The 4s, along with the HTC Rezound and HTC Titan, have set the bar very high for Cell Phone Cameras!  The 4s is better at Video with the Titan and Rezound being better with still image capture.  Overall, like I said, it is a top 2 camera on the market and honestly, this is the biggest reason why I decided to try the phone.  While the Competition has zero shutter lag, the iPhone 4s Camera has significant Shutter Lag!BATTERY The 4s has gotten a lot of press regarding battery life and this really has the potential to be on par with the Antenna issue given the fact that the phone doesn't feature a user replaceable battery.For me, I will say I was disappointed with the Battery when I first got the phone as it many phones using LTE 4G Communications Equipment were getting as good or better battery life.  Of course, after shutting off a bunch of the background processes and location services as well as tweaking the screen timeout and notifications, the battery life was similar to middle of the road 3G Android devices.  So, it is serviceable at best.Bottom line with the battery, it isn't even close to best considering it has a top of the line GPU and Dual Core CPU in the phone and you cannot just pop an Extended batter in it because you cannot replace it!HARDWARE SCORE = 4.0 based heavily on CPU and GPUSOFTWARE iOS was somewhat revolutionary 4 years ago and it is the platform that Apple has chosen to build around.  Whether that's good or bad, depends on what you're looking for. EASE OF USE iOS is similar to that of Windows 3.x in that its basic structure consists of applications, folders and a desktop.  With iOS there's no menu / app draw for accessing applications as they're all right there on the desktop or in folders (each folder can hold a max of 16 items).  Other than these things you have a task manager, search screen, Android Style Notification bar and a unified Settings Panel.iOS is very easy to use and if you can't figure it out, then you should be rocking a flip phone because Smartphones clearly are not your thing. SOFTWARE FEATURES The 4s has several features built in that are pretty standard among Smartphones and some of these are below average offerings while others are above average.  I'm just going to hit on a few of these that you're likely to use in everyday life.Music PlayerIs a sub par music player.  Yes it features typical playlists, artist, album and song profiles as well as a few EQ Presets.  Where it fails is in implementation.You see, the EQ is actually placed under the Unified Settings Panel and it pretty much locks you into setting one preset if you haven't taken the time to embed presets into your songs, using iTunes on your PC or Mac.  Also, if you've created any custom presets on the Computer, there's no way to sync them with the iPhone and if you've applied those custom presets to your music the phone shuts off the EQ all together!  This is a huge drawback to me and I find it hugely unacceptable.The iPhone is a branch of the iPod line and neither of these can store the EQ presets which is a really poor design flaw when you consider that the whole line started out as Music Players!  HTC recently bought Beats Audio and as that technology matures it is going to create a lot of problems for the future of the iPhone.SiriSiri is Voice Control / Voice Recognition on Steroids and while it can be awesome, we have to remember there are side effects when using Steroids!With Siri, She flakes out at times and just doesn't work at other times!  Now, this is an issue because at no point in time did Apple ever list Siri as a Beta Product when producing their TV Commercials and yet if you visit their site, you find out that Siri is in fact a Beta Implementation of the Software.Honestly, Speaktoit is more mature and less flakey!  Plus, it runs on every modern Android phone (without Jailbreaking / rooting) and not just a single model.iMessageThis is a good concept for integrated messages but it has one fatal flaw!iMessage is basically a unified messaging app for IM and Text messages.  What it does well is seamlessly switch between text messaging and IM as your network connection goes from WiFi to 3G.  What it doesn't do well is Group Messaging, you see if you send a text to multiple parties that works like you expect.  However, iMessage actually passes on those other numbers to the recipients so that any replies go to everybody!  This is a GAPING Security Hole and I'm surprised more people aren't making a huge fuss out of it!Yes, HTC has this group messaging as well but they warn you and let you shut it off!SafariThis is a typical browser and honestly, it can work very well as many pages were created just for Mobile Safari.  The only failures I've seen are where it refuses to redirect to the desktop version of pages when you click on and instead reloads the mobile version but this doesn't happen that often.Overall, Safari is up there with Dolphin HD and Android's Browser for top mobile browsers.CameraFor A Camera as good as the hardware is on this phone, Apple did a huge disservice with the Software.  They basically made it a point and shoot camera with very few settings and this means the image you get is going to be hit or miss depending on the lighting.When comparing Camera Software with likes of the HTC Rezound and HTC Titan, the iPhone is now and has always been woefully inadequate!  You see, HTC gives you control over ISO and White Balance as well as Scene Modes for different types of conditions and they also give you every other setting that the iPhone 4s offers.  This is why the 4s will never have a higher rated camera than other smartphones with hardware on par with Apples offerings.With that said, the lack of control is evident again in the video camera portion and it is behind the Rezound in that the Rezound has 2x Slow Motion Recording.  However, the iPhone 4s Metering is seamless and easily changes without so much as an obvious shift in lighting during recording; this is the best video camera metering in a phone period!Map SoftwareiOS features very accurate mapping as the backend is based on Google Maps.  It will find locations, give you a list of directions and pretty much works okay in this area.  Where this fails is the fact that the iPhone has no turn by turn navigation.  There are apps that will do this for you but, Apple doesn't allow you to make them the default App so they never fully integrate into the phone.\fFace TimeThis is just a standard video chat app that does what it is supposed to do very well.  It's really a bright spot for Apple because it leaves them with an application that is standard across all of their modern devices and there's no hassle making it work.This is one area that is above average as the competition requires that all participants go get the app, create an account and honestly they often have compatibility issues with the phones they're trying to run it on.  The only exception is Skype which is cross platform but it still requires people to go get the App and Register with the service.KeyboardWith the iPhone you pretty much get the Apple keyboard, take it or leave it.  It is a solid basic offering that isn't going to wow you in any way.Honestly, I find the keyboard a bit cramped and I often found myself hitting the back space key when trying to push M or hitting A when trying to push S.  Crud, not only can you change the keyboard on the competing devices, they all seem to have universal emoticon support. On iOS you have to install the Emoji Keyboard just to get Emoticons to which they don't work with any other device but the Apple devices unless they find an Emoji plug-in for some random Application!Spell CheckingWhat iOS does is more a Spell Confirmation as it waits until you get near the end of the word to show you most suggestions and even then it seldom shows you more than one suggestion.This is way behind the Competitors as they feature a row of options and this honestly speeds up typing as you're able to often tap your words to select them within a few key strokes.SOFTWARE SCORE = 2.0BOTTOM LINEApple Created a very powerful phone with some very good hardware choices but they dumbed it down with extremely poor software choices!  I'll be selling my 4s After only 3.5 Months because to me, the limitations of iOS far out weigh the power of the Hardware!If you're at all using Android to a fraction of its potential, you likely will not be happy with this phone.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good update to the iPhone 4", "Author": "G. Lee", "ReviewID": "R7ELQRIWIE284", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up a Verizon iPhone 4S on release day to replace my existing Verizon iPhone 4.  It is an excellent, reliable device that excels in making phone calls, texting, emailing, and all the other stuff that one would expect from a smartphone.  I have not had any of the battery life issues commonly reported on the web.  I'm not sure if these issues are due to a bad batch of batteries or if it is a software glitch, but regardless of the cause, I have experienced no battery related problems at all.The value of the iPhone 4S really depends on what type of phone it is replacing.  For anyone with a 3GS or older or any other branded smartphone, this phone is an excellent choice.  If you are in the same boat as me and already have an iPhone 4, the answer is not so clear.  If I was limited to one new discounted phone every 2 years, then I would have stuck with my iPhone 4 and waited for next year's model.  Fortunately, I have a family plan with multiple lines, all of which I pay for, so I am able to upgrade yearly without any pricing issues.  I do not think the 4S is enough of an upgrade from the 4 to justify the upgrade if it means you will have to miss out on the iPhone 5 (or whatever it will be called) in 2012.  Yes, the 4S is a little faster, Siri is pretty cool though not essential, and the camera is a tiny bit better, but other than that it's pretty much the same phone.  I would wait for the iPhone 5.Having said that, it is a great phone.  The extra speed is noticeable.  After owning the 4S for a month, I switched back to my iPhone 4 for a few days to see if I could notice any difference between the two phones, and the 4S is definitely faster.  The camera is a bit better as far as getting less noise in lower light situations, but the 4 has an excellent camera too.  I doubt switching from the 4 to the 4S is going to make a monumental difference in your pictures.  If you really want better photos, save your cash and buy a book on art composition - improving your composition skills will make a much bigger impact on your photography than spending cash on a new camera.If I could only pick one phone to have today, the iPhone 4S would be the one.  But if you've got an iPhone 4, don't blow your 2 year upgrade on the 4S or you'll be kicking yourself when the iPhone 5 comes out in a year.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Dudness", "ReviewID": "R1T5PRM4UDAZXQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this phone a few weeks ago.

Siri is capable of doing almost anything! From asking her how to get somewhere, to hands-free dialing, she can do it all, and has a fun personality.

I can text twice as fast as I could with my old phone, and in addition, the keypad doesn't make any noise, so it's perfect for that discreet text during class. The only warning I would throw in that I've had to learn the hard way is that when a group text is sent out, everybody that is part of that text will be able to see all responses.

I contacted her during the weekend, expecting hours or even days before a reply, but she emailed back within 20 minutes. When you buy from her store, you'll get almost an immediate email detailing your purchase and its tracking code, as well as an entreaty to take up any complaints or issues with her, which she will resolve to the best of her ability. I placed my order for an iPhone 4s- locked to Verizon on Saturday, and received it Wednesday, two days before the earliest delivery estimate, secured in a bubble wrapped envelope that was placed inside a tightly taped Priority cardboard box. The phone was in better condition than described, looking brand-new to all except the most discerning eye. It also came with new Apple earbuds, a USB connector, and front-and-back screen protectorsWhen buying an iPhone, or any other smartphone online, one runs the risk of getting a stolen item or encountering other ploys by unscrupulous sellers.
