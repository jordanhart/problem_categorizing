The waterproof feature was also one of the thing that made me make the move. This phone is just beautiful...The phone is very very fast and responsive, I was impressed. I really like the widget that allow you to access to different phone configuration very quickly. Turning wifi, bluetooth and GPS OFF in just 4 clics. Every thing is faster with Android, access to configuration, killing running application, switching application ... Apple should learn something here.The 5 inch display is just gorgeous, every things look great... photos, videos, web browsing ...Regarding the camera, I was a little disappointed with the Sony Camera App, it has a lot of feature but the final image was not that punchy so I purchased an app called \"HDR camera+\" and waooo... this app literally changed every thing with the camera and get the best out of this 13 megapixel sensor. Exposure, color tone, color temperature, color saturation, sharpness... everything is so much better ...What I miss from IOS is the Airplay feature build into the system. Android has some third party application available to stream music and video but it does not work as well as IOS.For example It recognize my Yamaha RX-V773 as an Airplay receiver but I was not able to stream any music, the Android music player just got stuck.But I can stream music and video to my Philips 46 inch TV ... I don't get it....Now about battery life, it's not that great ... This 5 inch full HD display suck a lot of juice and don't expect more than 5 or 6  hours oh intensive use. I mean by intensive use, 3G connected and display on all the time ...The problem with that phone is that you can't stop using it all the time ... So get prepared to get some extra juice somewhere ... for example an external battery pack ....", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "review for tmobile Xperia Z 6606 US version But same phone features", "Author": "UnCivil Earth", "ReviewID": "R3FQ3FQQ3SPGPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing . The features are awesome the Sony apps just for this phone make it better . The 13Mp camera is incredible and takes beautiful pics . Also unlike samsung the phone works well with Apple Computer products using Sony bridge for Mac . Yes thats right this phone plays and Stores iTunes easy with out doing any conversions of audio files or using double twist . It was a pain to play any iTunes on My Galaxy SII. The photo software on the Sony has things not available on any camera phone. Smile detection, Burst mode, 1080 Video , 1080p 5in beautiful display, Bravia sync and the ability to use a Ps3 controller for games . The phone is a I phone top competitor in my book and about $250 cheaper. I can't wait to see where sony takes this kind of thinking for the future. Its also water resistant to 3 feet for 30 mins so little splash while listening to music in the shower or by the pool is ok. This is a beautiful phone top to bottom with great accessories available like the smart watch2 , Sbh52 wireless headset with caller id. This is a great phone give it a try over Samsung and you will be happy. With t mobiles buyer remorse what do you have to loose....I think you will love it...Pros: Great for texting, Great web browsing, Long battery life, Easy to use, Great camera, Useful apps, Fun games, WiFi, GPS, 4G, Durable, Large screen, Touch screen, Music, Keyboard, Speakerphone, Volume level, Processor, MemoryI would recommend this to a friend!", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "In love", "Author": "Damian Mercado", "ReviewID": "R3314UHVT9ICFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing. I made a thourough research about all the phones on the market. I personally dont like Samsung (because of its user interface) nor Apple (overpriced and too limited). I'm a HTC fan and i guess the only phone better than this one could be the HTC One (in my opinion). I recently tried the waterproof feature... AWESOME! No damage at all. Camera works wonderfully underwater as well.PROS:WaterproofAmazing cameraLatest android OSGreat soundBEATIFUL FULLHD Bravia powered screenSTAMINA modeNFCLTECONS (nothing is perfect):The screen is so sensible that reacts when a waterdrop falls on itThe screen does not work correctly underwater or REALLY wetBattery \"Monster\": while screen is on and gps active it drains the battery so severly that not even charging is enough. (nevertheless if STAMINA mode is set up, it lasts all day)(also the gps [as usual] it sucks up the battery)Also the speaker for phone calls is quite small and must be placed correctly on the ear, otherwise it's quite hard to hear.CONCLUSION:It is one of the greatest phones on the market. Even though the underwater performance could be better, it helps to avoid any major damage caused by water. One of the best cellphone cameras. Quite customizable. TRULY powerful. GORGEOUS screen.

I am 10-12 feet from the wireless gateway at work, with one wall between my device and the router. One minute I'd have 5bars, the next it would drop to 1, then to 3, then drop off all together. And even when I had 5 bars, the connection speed was SLOW. I have had mutiple devices connected to that router at any given time with a constant 5 bars of reception and never one drop off, or bandwidth isues.The second issue is the battery. You can almost sit and wath the battery indicater go from full to empty, it drains so fast. Even with the screen off, it drains the battery. I had about a 60% charge whn leaving work one day. 1 hour later, it was at 29%. All I was doing was downloading a podcast, and the screen was off most of this time.Finally, if you are buying this device to use on T-Mobile's network, be warned, I was only ever able to obtain Edge data service even in areas where I had received 4g and 3g with my iPhone. I contacted T-Mobile technical support and we went through all kinds of troubleshooting procedures without any luck in fixing the problem.I have contacted the seller about returning the device. i will update with a review of their services once I receive a response.7/11/13 Update: Seller responded and has offered to allow me to return the phone for a refund.

More I must say that when I activated the camera was a little disappointed because I did not see the clarity, sharpness and vivid colors that should have, still 13 Mpx and photos represent the strong Sony. But to compare the quality of those photos with photos of S3, they do not arrive but not even close.

Will Explain why and why my rel rating is 3.5. I bought this exact model, the international unlocked LTE model.I will start with what Sony has always brought to the table and that is style. Pure gorgeous phone with very slim factor and humongous screen. Even though it's a five incher it does not seem as big as a five inch screen should. Only slightly wider and taller than my S which is a 4.6 inch screen. It fits just fine in the pocket and it's extreme slimness helps. It's front screen is pure black with a minimalist strategy in mind. The back reminds me of the iphone 4 as it's pure black shiny and classy looking glass enclosure. The silver aluminum button on the side pops on this otherwise minimalist looking phone. There is no equal when it comes to aesthetic design. Perhaps iphone but I still prefer Sony.The screen is bright and gorgeous on this five inch display; however, I realize the bigger the screen the less sharp it may look and this was the case compared to S. I however thought since it has improved from 720p to 1080p the level of sharpness would equal my smaller screen S. It didn't. I would say it did improve with the letters. I would say that is the biggest improvement... the text was super sharp but colors and clarity was not much of an improvement over the S. Also, Video on this screen is superb and the 1080p does shine over the xperia s when it comes to video. The large screen makes it a joy to watch movies on this powerful phone.The software is is the latest Jellybean version with minor changes over 4.0.4. Though the changes are slight there is a HUGE negative change. Apparently Jellybean ended support for Adobe Flash! WHAT!. This is a huge negative since my movie collection is on amazon and in amazon's greediness, they decided not to put out a video app for video even though they did for apple. Go figure. Thus I can no longer watch videos on amazon through my browser which was the only way I could. Now I can't blame Sony for something google did and amazon did, but it's a fact that cannot be changed with this phone. It's really a shame because that is where this large screen phone shines.Another small gripe is the elimination of the dark screen on the phone mode and messenger phone. The background is now white which is quite annoying on the eyes used to a dark background. Not the end of the world but definitely not an improvement.I know it seems like I have nothing but negative things to say but these things are no fault of Sony's. Thus the four star rating. What this phone brings to the table that no other flagship brings is the water/dust proofing, powerful quad core processor and something very needed over the S is micro SD expansion. The reason for the 3.5 rating is that this particular phone did not work on AT&T;'s 3g network. I did some research and did not expect the LTE to work since it has different bands but 3G was supposed to work. Well it didn't, it work only on the edge network! Unacceptable. I am hoping the phone was defective and this is not a common aspect of newer international phones since my xperia S worked perfectly fine and it was an international phone. I tried many configurations and called AT & T to update the IEN number but to no avail. Now this is my experience so I am not saying this phone wont work on 3g since apparently it's working for others. In the end I had to reluctantly send it back. Prompting a review for THIS phone. (International Version)That being said, the Xperia Z is still my next phone, but I think I will wait for the US version to avoid any further problems plus, on such a big beautiful screen, LTE seems more appealing. The ZL a more compact non weather resistant version is already out advertised on sonystyle US site but no Z oddly enough. As usual US customers are left in the dark so I will have to be patient.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "WORKS ONLY 1 DAY !!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Carlos Heber \"Carlos Heber\"", "ReviewID": "R2VTDJ6250YFOD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi,I received the phone, insert my micro sim card and start to use it.At night, I left the device charging and in the morning is death !!!!!!!!!!Was impossible to turn on pressing all the combinations of the buttons.BEWARE !!!!

Some of you may think it's silly, but, it was because of the music player. The player lists all your music by Album, Artist, or Songs but doesn't recognize the folders I have those songs in: like my Gym folder, or my For Sleeping folder, or my Soundtracks folder. Instead it just puts your whole library in one long list. Horrible.  My Galaxy S3 was able to recognize the 'folders' which I loved. With a PC you can probably create your own playlist using Sony's software, but for Mac, we only have drag-and-drop option. Music is important to me so this problem was a deal-breaker.Also I had to put the volume up to the max to listen to my music loudly. (not ear-splitting loud, but loud enough to feel it, the thumping and all that.) And what if you had a track that was recorded with a softer low volume? Well you probably couldn't listen to that track that loud at all. Not having louder volume control means this phone might not have a built in amplifier for music--like Sony has with it's MP3 player Walkmans.This may also affect the loudness of your phone call audio quality--which I didn't try--but assume might suffer from this.Plus the quality of the music was only okay. The audio enhancements were nice but not w.o.w nice.  Not like my Galaxy S3's music player which has an awesome surround sound reverb function and better bass controls.So yeah, if you use your phone as a music player a lot (at the gym, walking outside, in the car etc), and sound quality is important to you, then this is definitely a deal-breaker.On the plus side....the screen is great. I tried the video clips included in the phone....phenomenal. Awesome video quality.And yes the sweet spot is looking at the screen directly straight on, but really, even if off to the side a bit....it's really not as bad as reviewers are making it out to be.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good...and Bad and What's that say?", "Author": "Eric Hofmann \"Sonthert\"", "ReviewID": "R1OHI06TPN38GU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The positives:1.5GHz processor. Nice speed.Good video quality.Great Camera.The \"huh\"?These are specifically directed because this is a Docomo version:Many of the icons, system notifications and of the assorted functions are in Japanese. If you don't read Japanese, this may be a small problem. Most of the functions are not critical. Selecting a different language works for the important functions. Selecting autodial functions automatically add Japanese international calling codes to the phone number (which can have unexpected and unpleasant results I would imagine if you don't catch it in time...calling Japan...to your phone bill). Most of the icons I imagine are associated with Docomo, which is the Japanese equivalent of Google. The phone also has Google functions in parallel.The negatives:Android 4.1.2 isn't as advanced as I would have imagined it would be. Its quite similar to the V2. Doesn't seem to be a fantastic upgrade.Call sound quality...too quiet. Slightly muffled. The sound quality is slightly better on the X10, and was much better on the LT18i.Waterproof? Well...the external speaker for phone ringer and application sounds was quite good. Then, while testing out the waterproof claims of the phone. Now the sound on the external speaker is nearly non-existent. Too quiet to be heard from my pocket (which is where it should normally be). Now the external speaker is not quite useless, but close enough while its in my pocket to make the phone useless. No warranty, not that it would cover water damage anyways? So, I have a useless $1200 phone. I had to have the one that wasn't black or white and order it from Japan. I have checked the settings. THe XLoud function doesn't seem to be working. Its activated, but it doesn't change the volume of the phone anymore. For those of you who own one, I made sure the port seals were all in their proper sealed position (but the external speaker is nowhere near any of the open ports). Initially, the external sound quality was SUPERIOR. Now, its way below average.The network coverage on this phone is merely adequate. It seems to have a My Xperia X10 gets and holds signals much better. Somebody mentioned that it doesn't pick up 3G, I never tested that extensively, since my areas don't have great 3G or 4G coverage.Only comes with a 2GB MicroSD. Switched my Xperia X10's 8GB MicroSD with it. (Um...is that an upgrade then?)Uses micro Sim. You might have to upgrade your SIM...I wasn't prepared for it. I had to wait an extra week for a new SIM. I resisted my friend's recommendations to just \"cut\" the standard SIM. :)Overall, I am pissed that I am dealing with a phone that's external sound quality is now poor. If it gets better when it dries out, I'll update this review. However, I won't trust the waterproof nature of the phone again, even if it does \"come back to life\".Update: It dried out. External speaker is working fine again...Still have to ask...if its waterproof, why does it stop working?Update2: I would also like to say that the battery life on this phone is far superior to any Sony-Ericsson I've owned before. Whatever they did is fantastic. Normally, I could go one to two days between charges on the phone. Two to Three on the LT18i. Right now, the XperiaZ is running about nine days between charges.
