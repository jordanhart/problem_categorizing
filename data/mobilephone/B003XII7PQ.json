The unit arrived much more quickly than expected. It was a bona fide new unit with every bit of packaging, peel-off protectors, slips of paper, connectors, and instructions that a new unit would have. It was in perfect condition and works perfectly. Shortcomings are inherent to the unit -- it's not a high end BlackBerry and I didn't pay a high-end price. Keys are stiffer, the unit doesn't have as solid a feel as top of the line models, and the interface of this older (2009) model is not as nice as newer models. The track pad is fine, not much different than on the current (2011) models. The purchase deserves 5 stars because Amazon shipped a genuine new unit, not one that is refurbished or missing documentation like so many other reviewers have experienced, and it works. I paid a bit extra for the one-year warranty, which is documented in the form of a card shipped in the box, to be on the safe side. It looks like I may not need it.
