If you want a camera get a canon or nokia that will blow this or any other camera-phone out of the water in terms of price and function.It is extremely easy to put music on this phone as it is treated as an external hard drive when plugged in to your computer. Windows media player will add music in a comparable time frame with Itunes or Sharepod.The screen is crystal clear with beautiful color range.It comes with a 3.5mm jack so you can use any set of standard headphones.If you decide to get the rubber clip on case, the whole phone becomes incredibly sturdy with an extensive amount of grip.

The phone works excellent without it though, no delayed texts, nothing. Make sure to buy a separate memory card as there is none included, if you plan to take more than five pictures and use the media player. The battery comes pretty mug completely empty, dont expect to play with your new toy right away, as it needs tocharge for around 4 hours. I did not lose any of my contacts after turning the phone off or taking out the battery, as I am an existing tmobile customer. The camera flash is very bright. Overall, I recommend it to anyone.

I knew what kind of phone it was because I owned one before. However, sometimes you get 'invisible' text msgs that aren't there when you check them and sometimes after deleting all your voicemails, it still somehow shows the icon as if there is still one. Other that that, it is a phone that is very appropriate for texting given its large keyboard and large screen. But if you prefer light phones, you wont probably like this one because it weighs a ton! Overall a simple phone if you are not into apps and other stuff your laptop or Mac can do anyway.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like it more than my smartphone!", "Author": "Leland G. Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1W1WL0Z9P2DZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone 2 days early!OK. First off, I must elucidate some facts. This phone has some history behind it. The original Sidekick LX 2009(PV300) was discontinued initially in 2010. It was re-released in two forms: The Mobilicity Mobiflip(Sharp PV300G) in late 2010 and the Cincinnati Bell Sharp Jump (PV300GC/PV300GR)in 2011.I received the PV300GR. This is not the ORIGNAL(nor does it come in the original black box), yet, it is a modified version that doesn't include the Catalog, AIM/Yahoo/Live IM clients, the browser, or the Email client. Instead, there is a generic IM application(I guess you could use any handle/service you want), Opera Mini(an EXCELLENT browser); the Catalog and Email client have no replacements.The misconception arises with people saying this phone can't access the Internet. The truth is: The original Sidekick can't, nor can the Mobiflip because they lack the option to change the network APN. The Sharp Jump does have this option, meaning you can change the APN, thus you can get online.(There is a caveat: The 3G bands are 1700/2100, so you can only get 3G with T-Mobile, or any MVNO that uses T-Mobile like Simple Mobile and Straight Talk. Otherwise, you'll revert to GRPS/EDGE for data, like I do on AT&T.;) This also goes for Multimedia Messaging, so long as you know and change the MMS gateways.As a phone, it functions very well. I can hear callers clearly, and they have no problem hearing me. However, to me, it seems that there is a slight echo whenever I speak. Also, the ringer is not terribly loud. It's enough if you're close to it, but you probably won't hear it if it's two rooms away.As a messaging device, it's awesome. The keyboard is very spacious, but a little shallow: the buttons don't have a lot of give. The text messaging and multimedia messaging inboxes are seperate, and that's nice. There's no threaded messaging in these applications, nor is there a lot of space in either(100 messages on device and 30 on SIM for texting; 2MB total for Multimedia messaging). There is an auto delete function for both, so that's a means of management for heavy texters.As a browser, it's OK. Obviously, browsing would be better on a smartphone, but Opera Mini does a commendable job of rendering pages through Opera's compression servers(helps save money for those who browse per kilobyte). Text entry is a snap with the keyboard.This device also has a 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microSDHC slot(I think it'll take up to 32GB; I have a 16GB card and it works fine). The media player functions great.  You can access it wherever you may be on the phone by pressing the Jump and Done buttons at the same time. However, getting video to play on the device is a troublesome task. It says it supports MP4 and 3GP, but all the files I've thrown at it were not supported. I'll have to try a different video codec and report back...The customization options are fair enough. You can choose one of four themes for the main screen(I found means of sideloading themes, but that doesn't work for this phone. A slight bummer.) You have plenty of choice for ringtones, but to set them, you must go into the Phone, Text Messaging, and Multimedia Messaging applications to set each kind of alert. You can import ringtones from Multimedia messages(once you set it up), but they don't have the custom light patterns like the default ringtones. Instead, the moodlights flash to the bassline and the trackball cycles the color spectrum.The camera will do in a pinch, just not inside. If you are inside trying to take a photo, make sure to have some lights on to begin with. I haven't messed with shooting video, but seeing as it only shoots up to QVGA, I personally wouldn't bother.Overall, I have to give this phone a 5/5. It's a great device for those that just message a lot, or need the basics. You want apps, go get a smartphone(Honestly, you really won't be missing much... heh.) I'll monitor the comments for anyone who also happens to receive the Sharp PV300GR and who want help to set up the settings for the Internet and Multimedia Messaging.UPDATE: 8/7/12:I've figured out how to place Themes and Videos on the device.Videos are best encoded in 3GP format, at a resolution of 480*272 with the H.263 video codec and the AAC audio codec. You can just paste them anywhere on the drive.Themes are created as such(NOTE: YOU NEED A MEMORY CARD FOR THIS):1. Plug your phone into your PC with the USB cable.2. Access the phone's drive and create a new folder called Themes.3. For each Theme, you must have all defined elements noted in a text file, titled theme. A simple one can be made as such:string Name(en_US) (Place the theme name here, must be the same name as the folder)bitmap ring-background (Place the name of the photo you want as the background here, including the file type, ie: neon.jpg or neon.png. I HIGHLY recommend using a 854x480 photo)bitmap ring-folder-background (Can be the same as above, or a different photo. Again, follow the same rules for bitmap ring-background.)4. Place the theme.txt file and the photos in the same folder. Title the folder the same as the theme name.(If you set the string Name(en_US) as Neon, then the folder MUST ALSO be titled Neon.)5. Place the folder in the Themes folder.6. Unplug your phone from the PC and give it a few moments to read your card. From the main screen, press Menu and go down to Themes. Your theme should show up below the built in four.UPDATE 11/9/12: I am using this phone with Simple Mobile, and I have 3G(!) internet access.Their APN is simply(heh) simple.

When received the phone i turned it on and plugged in all my contacts with no problem. It worked for about 2 weeks then one day i turned it on and all my contacts were lost. This didn't bother me too much because i had saved them and uploaded them without a hitch. The next day i didn't use my cell phone, but i kept the phone plugged in to the wall just to keep it charged.In the morning i woke up and tried to turn on my phone. It wouldn't turn on. No lights. No noise. No anything. I had looked at FAQ's online and found out that you can over charge the battery, meaning you would have to watch the phone until it was completely charged and then unplug it immediately or it won't turn on. I bought a new battery, tried different chargers and nothing seems to work.The phone has no water damage, or cracks. It's less than a month old and the phone won't turn on, its broken.

The elimination of Danger's closed-architecture OS and cloud services (stemmed from Microsoft's acquisition of Danger) is the serious downside to the series, as the lack of web services and the lack of a Sidekick ecosphere for downloading/purchasing extra programs makes it a crippled phone. This forces you to make do with whatever programs the phone has and its stock features (there is no calculator, as one would have to download it from the Hiptop servers, for example).  The membrane keyboard is very difficult to beat for texting, as it is roomy and has a row for numbers.  The Hiptop OS has plenty of useful key combination shortcuts, making it faster than selecting with the trackball or directional pad.  The trackball is very precise and the whole layout of the rest of the controls are intuitive.  The 3MP auto focus camera takes pretty decent quality shots, though can be a bit touchy when you pull up the camera program using the pre-focus/shutter/right shoulder button--as you press and hold, it will take a picture if you hold the button right after the program loads (it does give the option for you to save or discard right after the photo is captured).  Its LED flash is pretty standard fare, though it would be nice to have this as a flashlight as it is fairly bright.  The media program is pretty flexible with creating playlists, except that it is like many other phones with stock media players: there is no equalizer, despite a powerful enough headphone amplifier.  Bluetooth works well, but is crippled compared to other smartphones, as it does not offer a two-way file transfer--just files sent only to the phone.  The MiniUSB connector charges the battery and transfers data to and from your computer as it is shown as a separate drive.  The LCD screen is very detailed and very crisp (dense pixels), which is expected from Sharp.  Phone calls can be made by flipping open the screen and using the keyboard or you can leave the screen in place and use the trackball to dial.  Call quality was good, though compared with my previous phone (LG Incite), the microphone is not as sensitive.Pros:Quality phone hardwareKeyboard and trackball qualityScreen resolutionDecent auto focus camera with LED flashMicroSD support (up to 16GB)MiniUSB--a standard and common connectorCons:Dead closed Hiptop platform (no external sources of obtaining programs)Crippled Bluetooth services (no proper file transfer, just sending files to the phone)Don't expect WiFi, as that was left out of the design.If you never use data services, such as mobile web and email, and tend to text more than you make calls, the Sidekick LX 2009 should be worth looking into--especially if you are a prepaid customer and would rather not settle with a similarly priced LG Neon or a Samsung t369 (both are messaging phones).The particular Sidekick I picked up was new-old-stock (retail starter kit) and was unlocked--though it was missing the 1GB MicroSD card. The rest of the package had the pouch, headphones, T-Mobile SIM, mini USB cable, USB adapter/charger, documentation and phone--all new.  No snags with AT&T; and T-Mobile prepaid services, other than the obvious shuttering of the Sidekick services.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Piece of junk....", "Author": "Bodasity", "ReviewID": "R3PRXM7EUZWVG9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned this for about 4 months and this is what I've found.Let me go a little in depth into the good and bads:Lets start with the good...1. Cool phone.  When you use it people notice because it is such an original design.  (main reason I like it)2. Awesome keypad.  It is perfect for a texter and the button size is great for someone that can't see all that well.3. Battery life. Lasts about two days of heavy(ish) use.  I have gotten 3 days out of it.Now let me go into the bad...1. Not exactly user friendly.  Slow to navigate and a little unwieldly.2.  Back cover doesn't want to stay on.  No matter how hard you try it won't stay on.  I can just pull it out of my pocket and the back will slide off.3.  Some weird HUGE glitch in there OS.  For some reason when the phone is on for more than 2 days without turning it off, it will basically become inoperable.  The camera won't work and you won't be able to call people.  You won't be able to push certain buttons or respond to texts.  If you try to shut it down to try to get it working again, it won't work.  You have to remove the back and pull out the battery.  THEN it takes about 5 minutes to start up to operable speeds.

First of all, the \"sidekick\" feature on the phone is great, and texting is very convenient and fast. This phone may be a different experience for some,however. It's not a touchscreen, and you have to use the little gray ball on the side of the phone to click things instead of your fingers. It would be a little faster if you could use your fingers, but for me, using the trackball wasn't too much of a problem. The main feature of this phone is texting, and the main menu has 2 menus for it. It's user friendly, except you can sometimes forget how to access the settings menu, which is the upper left button. All the basic settings are easy to operate and change, like the trackball speed, and sound profiles.The only few cons in the phone is that you can't set a song as your ringtone. My ringtone on my previous phone was always \"Day Tripper\" by the Beatles. Here, it was hard to find out how to change the ringtone in the first place, unless you go through all the settings. Then, once you get to the ringtone menu in sound profiles, you have to choose from one of the weird ringtones that the phone has provided for you. I can't say that they're the best, and some of them are pretty bad. If you want a good ringtone, choose \"fatcat\".The second con I have is the games and the internet connectivity. The default game that was stored on this phone for me was \"Bob's World, LAKE OF DOOM!!\". It's a pretty corny platformer game, with this ball just bouncing around the screen. I couldn't figure out the controls. I had \"Opera mini\" browser on this phone, and I couldn't connect to the internet very well. Also, you can't check your email.In general, this is a pretty good phone.Best for people who love texting To sum it up:Prosgood user friendlinessawesome texting featuresorganized/easy to operate settingsConsBad choice of gamesBad ringtone selectionCan't check your e-mail,not so good internet connectivityA few settings that you can't find without extra experimentation.Hope you liked this review!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "sucky sidekick", "Author": "A.

So things don't get messed up.- Internet browser (she did not get this feature)- Can receive ringtones from other people.- Can record ringtones- Has a good battery life (about 2-3 days)- Can change the picture of the locked screen- Pretty good sounding speaker phoneCons:- Power Cycles. Has done this around 4 times. When it does this, it deletes her contacts and pictures and all text messages (picture and regular text). It hasn't deleted any ringtones or music.- Cannot send pictures to Facebook (hers cannot. I'm not sure about other people's.)- Is not compatible with Phonezoo (that we know of)- Sometimes freezes on the locked screen.- Cannot remove a ringtone after you have saved it (I'm not sure about other Sidekick's.

Admittedly, I didn't use these features very often on my old phone, but it was nice knowing that I could.

The phone often freezes up, going to a green screen and then dying, or sometimes only freezing and forcing me to take out the battery. Also, sometimes it simply will not make a call, and has to be turned off and on again in order to work.The scroll ball on the right of the phone has already gone out, and the memory for messages is terrible, holding only 100 total. Putting in a memory card doesn't help, either. Also, the camera doesn't work unless you have a SD card in the phone. Even then, sometimes it fails to save the pictures to the memory.I should mention that I am not a smartphone user, so I'm not used to a phone with a lot of features, but even my expectations were sorely disappointed with this phone.Please, save your money and get a  phone that will last longer and doesn't have the major glitches this phone does.

The down side was that your internet capabilities are not functional when you get the phone due to what type of plan you get.The organizer is real nice and simple to use.  You can easily keep track of all your tasks that you need to do for the day and manage what tasks need to be done on the day.The keyboard is good although i felt that the keyboard buttons felt stiff when you first start to use them.  However with enough use you can \"break them in\" and the buttons will start to feel natural.  It was real easy to type in what I want in my messages and i did not have a problem typing in long messages and tasks.  The way the phone organizes your text messages is good and it was simple to keep of who was messaging you.Importing you contacts to the phone was easy too.  If you got all your contacts stored on your SIM card the phone easily imported them to the phone's address book.  I would suggest you put the most important contacts in your SIM card just in case you lose data on your sidekick.I got the product brand new so I did not have any problems with the phone when it came in the mail.  I can not say what it is like to get a used one but buying the device brand new was a good experience.The only downside was the slight lag experienced when you play mp3s and do tasks on your phone.  The device would hiccup every now and then but not too much to become disruptive as you are doing your tasks.Overall i thought the phone is great if you are just starting out in the smart phone phase.

The space bar is hard to press and it's giving me trouble because at times i need to press on it hard to get it working. I thought it would have been easier to use since the keyboard gives you a lot of space for your fingers but i was wrong. The keys aren't very sensitive and my other pantech phone could type much better. So overall i give this phone a 4/5, looks great and it has a pretty long battery life. If you love to text and do so frequently this is probably not the right choice for you. Again the keyboard keys aren't soft, you must press hard to make them work.
