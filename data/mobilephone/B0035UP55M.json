Easy to use, and very long battery life, and a few nice features. I got a good deal on a Android, and after a very frustrating month of trying to learn how to use all the apps, I sold it and went back to my simple Sanyo, and couldn't be happier!", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "LED display goes black!", "Author": "S. Hampton \"rabbitfever\"", "ReviewID": "R85STWI0UTF6F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone near the end of Jan. 2010, right after it came out on the market.  Great deal with a decent phone w/ unlimited talk, text, web for $50/month & no contract.  But I have only used it 2 1/2 months and the LED screen display has gone black - therefore I can't see my contacts, who's calling, etc.  Still sending and receiving calls but very disappointed this phone has malfunctioned so quickly under average, normal use!  It's my only phone so going to be a problem doing without it while addressing the problem!", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's risky, but you may have better luck.", "Author": "A. Guerrero", "ReviewID": "RPCPYKHEIM56N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had it for about 8 months now.  When I bought it I knew it was a cheap, simple phone and only needed it for calling, not entertainment.  It was working great for the first few months, then suddenly one day, the phone stopped receiving incoming calls.  I could only get texts and messages stating I had new voicemail, but no calls.  Now, I could call someone and it would go through, but they couldn't call me.  I called customer support and they had me reset the phone, take out the battery, turn it off/on, etc...still no fix.  I've tried researching online and have come across others who are experiencing the same thing.  The best answer I could find was that there must be a network problem, that it's not the phones.  ???  Okay, moving on.  I even tried to set the phone to forward calls to my Google number, but another setback, the phone doesn't have call forwarding.  Anyway, that's my story.  You'll have to decide for yourself if it's worth it or not, but I think one should pay a little more and get something better.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sorry for the inconvenience.", "Author": "joseodos", "ReviewID": "R3RFS29018CSK6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My fault, I didn't read the full description, and put a bad note to it, maybe next time I should pay a little more attention, seller is really nice, agreed to return item for money back.

I bought my Mirro 1 and a half years ago, and I've been amazed by just how much abuse the thing can take- it's been through my washer and then the dryer and still works great, with everything but the camera and outside screen working excellently.  It has good call quality, quick texting with T9, and absolutely AMAZING battery life, though I don't have web access and so can't cover that area.  But still, this is a good phone to invest in long-term and features everything newer phones would have - great call quality, fast texting for sbout the average price.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good for the price", "Author": "M.

I needed a phone just for making calls and occasional texts. You can access the internet but I don't. Its just what I was looking for. I've had two (my first one got run over after I dropped it in the street) and they have both worked great - no complaints. The sound is nice and loud, the buttons are big, the screen is big, and the battery lasts forever.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Low Quality", "Author": "Turtles all the Way Down\u2122", "ReviewID": "R1SA8VKR9O1Z87", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Though the screen on my phone has yet to go permanently black(like it did for the other reviewer here), it does black out. The battery could be fully charged, but if the phone is in a bad mood, it goes blank and I have to turn it back on.I really should have paid the extra $ for a seemingly better phone. I got this phone at target and the only phone up was $70 more. I figured it couldn't be THAT bad---I was wrong. When I first saw it in the store I thought it looked kinda cheap, I mean it's bigger than it needs to be...far from sleek. Also, though the camera might have the potential to take great pics, the location of the camera on the phone makes it hard to take pics because the camera is generally where you'd hold the phone. My best shot at taking pics with this is to hold it sideways..the conventional position is just too hard.The sound quality is also pretty bad. I purchased the same ring tones I had on my previous phones...they just didn't sound the same on this. Music on this sounds like you're listening to it on a cheap AM radio.For the record, I know several people that have switched over to boost & virgin mobile(both sprint), and everyone I know that's joined either program has been disappointed with the phones. I'll give it one more shot and try upgrading, see if they have anything above this I like. I don't want to have to go back to AT&T;, sprints rates are sooooo much better, but having lame phones can be a bit of a bummer", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Senior friendly doesn't just mean large keys", "Author": "neophytophile", "ReviewID": "R1ELWY5SQ1O8RR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been trying to find a senior-friendly phone for a couple of years.  Too many phones just make the keys bigger.  In my experience, seniors may be less familiar with using common features like scrolling and menus. The most important thing is to make the most basic functions intuitive.A senior is trying this phone out, and has found it easy to use. I like the fact that you can turn the speakerphone on with one external, clearly marked key.  It's very difficult to find this feature, or to search for it specifically.So I'm disappointed to learn that it's not very durable. Have other people had that experience?", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Muy buen producto para usarlo con chip de cualquier compa\u00f1\u00eda.", "Author": "Abel", "ReviewID": "R3GV7NI1YGTLYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Muy buen producto para usarlo con chip de cualquier compa\u00f1\u00eda.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price.
