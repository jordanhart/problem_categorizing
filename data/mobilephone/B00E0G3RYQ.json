So while the phone itself gets a 5 star the seller (FSG) is causing the 3 star rating.Unfortunately it looks as if the description for this phone on the website is a mish-mash of the RM-875 and the RM-877. I discovered the RM differences after having to do research trying to resolve the LTE connection issue.  I purchased the phone based on the description itself.  All the initial research I had done was about the quality of the phone.  I had not come across any review that spoke about the differences between the RM versions. The RM-875 does not work on LTE Band 4 while in the description it says that this particular phone does.The phone itself is awesome. Loved how it looked, loved how it felt, especially loved the quality of the images.  However I am sending it back because I do need to do be able to use some of the functionality that you can only get on a US compatible phone such as mobile hotspot.Again, Love the phone just make sure if you're hoping to use it as an LTE phone in the US, make sure the RM number is 877.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Non LTE-41MP Camera Phone", "Author": "Mawiyah", "ReviewID": "RPYTWFCND8DFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As news states, this phone is known for its 41MP camera and grip.

Every iPhone I've had something wrong and Apple geniuses open their mouths with $100 min to fix it. Anyways, I tested Samsung 4S and to be honest it was pretty cool, but a hunch you can say, led me to Lumia. The reason was basically my new Dell with windows 8. I love that win 8 OS. As being a long time Mac guy, I can easily say that windows 8 has the best UX, fast, fluid and 'smart' by far. On mobile basis Lumia is the best smart phone I've ever seen. It's an amazing user experience with great hardware quality. I strongly recommend Lumia and win 8. It takes everything you know about smart phones to a new and amazing level.

The camera is the most important thing to me when it comes to my phone anyway so I said I'm going for it.I had the easiest time transferring my contacts (with nokia's data transfer, was preinstalled on the phone) from my iphone to nokia (usually the hardest part when switching devices, especially when an iphone is involved!)I'm getting the hang of the phone, but can say I'm extremely happy with my purchase, just extremely disappointed in amazon!", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best camera cellphone....

The focus (on distant objects/scenes) did not work.  I used all of the recommended lenses and settings but still was not able to get it to focus.  Finally I turned off the phone, and when I turned it on again about an hour later, the focus appeared to be working again.  Unfortunately, after 10-15 pix, the focus went blurry again.  I went on line to the Windows Phone site and they recommended a soft and/or hard reset.

The battery, with heavy use it only gives 8 hours? You literally have to charge during the work day and then at night again, not convenient at all, no modern phone, even with heavy use, should have less than a 14 hour battery life. Perhaps a new accessory, a wireless charging case WITH internal battery and a convenient kick stand which extends battery life by 60% or more?2. The navigation touch buttons should never be lit up for long when watching videos or reading, way too bright and distracting3. The browser has no forward button, start page or home button, very inconvenient4. MOST OF ALL, FREE UP MUCH OF THE FILE SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS, if you download something there is no way to find them or get them off the phone,  (leave that for evil and crazy iPhone), a file manager preferably with network/workgroup capabilities, it is windows after all.5. Being able to create folders would be nice for organization, convenience and speed6. The NAVIGATION needs a few things, firstly to be a bit more accurate, often it shows a destination as in the middle of the road or in a vacant lot next door, but also a quicker was to search favorites especially when looking for a destination, more and quicker ways to select DRIVE TO when viewing a saved location and to tell us if we will arrive at our destination on the LEFT or on the RIGHT or STRAIGHT AHEAD, how else will we know which lane to be in, do you know how inconvenient that can be on a 4 lane highway?7. A built in way to check minutes and messages used based on free numbers, out of package numbers, reduced rate times and overseas calls8. NO EXTERNAL MEMORY, WHAT?  HD video recording (10Gb per hour)  and 41mp pics?  My music collection alone is 16gb.9. BEING ABLE TO SYNCHRONIZE with a PC desktop software and OUTLOOK via USB, wifi OR/AND bluetooth.10. A quick console for WIFI, BT, DATA, PROFILES, RESTART, BATTERY SAVER, FLASHLIGHT etc.11. A \"breathing light\" option for the sleep state to we know when an alert is waiting.12. A non wifi network dependent way to show play video and images to nearby devices, perhaps Miracast along with the DNLA, and a way to show the phone\u2019s screen as well.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera phone, though windows phone is very limited compared to android", "Author": "Bruno Tucunduva", "ReviewID": "RVC6BS5UFP7AI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great, and works beautifully with Nokia photo apps.Everything is running smoothly and never had any system break until now.Windows phone is really limited.

So I tested the camera and little by little, those yellow-tinted problems have gone away so \"CHEERS\" Nokia and Microsoft, I apologies if I gave it a 1/5 star on my rating because its frustrating at first but I changed it recently thanks to that recently released black update. Now and forever I'm a Nokia fan and a Microsoft product user, I'm still testing the phone so I only gave it a 4/5 stars for now and might comeback again in a few days to test out the black update on the Lumia 1020. Who knows, I might give it a complete 5/5 star rating. Keep up the good work Microsoft and Nokia! Thanks so much.------- IGNORE MY REVIEW BELOW ----------- FOR NOWI recently have something of a problem in taking photos! All of my pictures have a yellow-tint that mixes with the white color... and in the commercials they always say its the best camera, shame on you NOKIA! I have a lot of respect before, and even bought 2 of your flagship phones, not its your fault this issue was hidden to the masses...  BEWARE, IT DESTROYS YOUR PICTURE AND MIXES YELLOW during post processing of the photo... regardless whether or not with flash or not! SHAME! SHAME!I HOPE THIS REVIEW WILL HELP NOKIA DO SOMETHING CAUSE THEY CALL THIS THE BEST CAMERA PHONE AND I FOOLISHLY BELIEVED IT... This yellow-tint photos that I keep getting, but how come the Nokia Lumia 1520 (which I bought too) is not experiencing this??? See how loyal a customer I am to you NOKIA!
