{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "YevgeniyIgorovich", "ReviewID": "R2R673420PQV4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for almost 2 weeks now and have to say that it's awesome. I ordered it on the MetroPCS website. Had major issues with the one ordered from their website for the first 3 days; it wouldn't give me a 4G signal. I had to go to two corporate stores. The first store didn't have this phone in stock. The second one did exchange it for me. I have to say, this phone's Android system is super smooth. Even though it's Gingerbread (2.3) instead of the new 'ice cream sandwich' or 'jelly bean', i love how fast the screens cycle. I switched from an LG Esteem to this one. Had major issues with the LG Esteem; it would shut down for no reason at the most awkward of moments; it had a horrendous battery life. This phone has neither of these issues. A charge lasts for about 7.5 hours (compared to 4hrs on the Esteem.) The major reason I switched from the Esteem was the processor speed (and also that my gf really wanted the Esteem.) The Anthem has a 1.2 gig dual core processor; pages load much faster then on the Esteem. I also switched to this one because I did use the micro HDMI port a lot on the Esteem. Have to say that the Esteem beats the Anthem's image quality. I connected the phone to my 46\" flat screen and the Anthem's image quality is a bit pixilated; you wouldn't really know the difference unless you have experience with Esteem's stream quality. Overall, I highly recommend this phone; the screen is super bright and sharp. I can listen to music, play chess online, and read a PDF file all at the same time. And one of the pluses with this phone is that it has a valid 'task killer' app preloaded on it that allows you to delete the annoying MetroExtras app that Metro likes to add to their phones. This is something that cannot be removed on most other MEtroPCS phone unless the phone is rooted. I will post more if issues come up.Update 10/28/13: So, have been taking a look at some of my reviews and decided to update this one. Have had the phone for a year now and can honestly say that it's solid. Updated it from 4 to 5 stars. Have been thinking of getting a Galaxy S4 but found out that you need a special adapter for the hdmi output. What's the deal with that? Sounds like they're trying to sell you something that should already come with the phone.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst phone ever!!!!", "Author": "barbie", "ReviewID": "R1DSSII4D9QY5R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had the phone for three months, and nothing but PROBLEMS!!!1)FTM always comes on every 3 days!! 2)The Screen disappears, before you have access to end the call!!!3)Internet connection is awful...The worst phone ever!!!!Marie/Georgia", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Within 2 days having problems!!!", "Author": "Beth", "ReviewID": "R1MI7OQN77461Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Dont get the full 4G bar and keeps shutting off for no reason and bought 2 of them and going to take them back!!!

Has this line design that looks pretty cool. As big as this phone is, it doesn't look very thick, especially with the giant screen. It pretty much looks normal. As for the OS, i wish it can be updated (Without rooting it) but it does not. Although Gingerbread itself is pretty decent, but definitely not as good as ICS 4.0, but it's workable. One thing i like about this phone, is the mobile HotSpot, unlike the Lg Esteem this phone has it. Plus this phone has better battery life as well, and better than my Lg motion. The price is pretty good too, im actually thinking of activating my Zte anthem over my Lg motion. Although my Lg is faster, but i still like the Anthem. Over all, good phone.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "ZTE Anthem 4G LTE Prepaid Android Phone (MetroPCS)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NJpkoep2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009KSDKC8"}}
