{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why would you pay so much for an iPhone if you can have this phone?", "Author": "XTIAN", "ReviewID": "R1K26RU8IFTCKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My brother has an iPhone and as far as I can tell, my Optimus One can do the same things as his iPhone and even more because I can install apps from SD cards, use my phone as an emergency external storage device, share files through Bluetooth, install dashboard widgets, super customize it and more things an iPhone CAN'T do.I guess the iPhone can handle hi graphics games better (i'm just guessing, i haven't made a real comparison between them),but I don't believe that's the main function of a smartphone.WHAT I LIKE:- The display is very nice.- Touchscreen is responsive even with the LCD protectors.- Fast, responsive, smooth..- Even when it's made of plastic, it feels solid and elegant. It doesn't look cheap as other smartphones.- The buttons are of good quality BUT I think you only need 3 instead of 4. I've used some smartphones where the buttons get stucked.- Android Froyo 2.2.2 works great. I haven't upgraded it to 2.3 yet.- LG Messaging widget is very nice. I wish you could download it for other smartphones.- If you make a good management of apps/services you can make your battery last 3 days.- Charging time is very fast.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:- Camera has a delay when taking pictures.- The regular keyboard is somehow small that's why I use the widescreen keyboard but even there it happens lot of times that when pressing space I press full stop.- SD card slot should be more accessible (you have to take out the back cover) like in Samsung smartphones where you have a lateral slot.CONCLUSION : I believe it's an AWESOME smartphone for the price you pay. I haven't found anything I can't do that other smartphones can.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone, BUT NO WARRANTY", "Author": "XopShed", "ReviewID": "R1E7U46O4L3MN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone. It's got a big screen, feels good in my hand both for size and weight. The sound is good. The Wi-Fi and GPS work just fine. All in all, i'm very pleased with my purchase: a relatively inexpensive Android phone that has all the features I need .... except one. It's advertised as \"Unlocked Phone - US Warranty\" (LG P500 Optimus One with Android OS, Wi-Fi, GPS Navigation, Stereo Bluetooth, 3 MP Camera and Video Recorder - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black). THERE IS NO US WARRANTY. I contacted LG directly (which is what the seller, L2D2Online, suggested after contacting them first). This phone is not marketed AT ALL in the US. The phones are \"imported\" from Mexico, and have a warranty in Mexico, which I can take advantage of at my own shipping expense. I specifically bought this phone - paying more money - because of the warranty (there's the same product at Amazon without warranty). You can buy a 3rd party warranty, for about $100 - 1/2 the price of the phone. That's what i assumed the seller was going to supply. The seller eventually gave me a small discount on the price, but i'd rather have the warranty. Just hope it doesn't break.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good phone, but not perfect", "Author": "Gregory", "ReviewID": "R1ILVTIIBSDU0M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really can't understand why somebody want to spend 300-500$ on a iPhone or a Blackberry, when you can get this AWESOME LG Optimus One for much less than that and offering you almost the same functions and features than those \"gimmick\" phones. Snobbism? I don't know.I got my LG Optimus One used in near mint condition for about 150$, a VERY good price at the time for a smartphone (the guy who sold this to me was desperate for a Blackberry and wanted to get rid of it quick). I have a couple of months with this phone and my expectations surelly were exceeded. This is my first smartphone ever, though I have an iPoud Touch 3G with iOS 5 (which I don't use now) and almost everyone I know own different models of Blackberry, so I know how other smartphone work and what they have to offer... not much more than my \"like new\" LG.The LG Optimus One feels sturdy but I really don't think it will survive a medium-high drop, so I suggest beign careful with it. The 3.2inch screen is just THE SAME like than old iPhone/iTouch 3g (3.5inch), with beautiful and crisp colors, VERY responsive and bright, I couldn't tell any difference comparing it next to my Ipod Touch 3G, of course, this will not display 720p or Retina Display, but do I really want to watch a HD movie on the go? I prefer my big screen for that.It comes with Android 2.2 from factory, but you can upgrade it to 2.3 (Gingerbread) just downloading the update form the LG website. Android is just too awesome for words, I was a bit skeptic since I was used to iOS but I can say with property that Android is FAR BETTER than iOS, it feels less restrictive, more open and customizable and with cool exclusive features like widgets and animated wallpapers (at the moment of this writing). The Android Market (now called Google Play) has nothing to envy the Apple Store, there are thousand of apps to download, including FREE apps for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and much, much more. My favorite: Equalizer, YES, a customizable equalizer for your music... an important feature missing on iOS (at least on iOS 5 and lower). With Android you are not restricted to one music player/video player/browser, nothing, you can download others and use your favorite, there are a lot of music player apps for Android including Songbird, Winamp and many others, most of them FREE. So definitively Android win here, I don't want to go back to iOS now.Not everything is perfect though:- You cannot upgrade to the latest versions of Android, the maximum compatible version is 2.3 Gingerbread, so no Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich :(- The battery life is short, with moderate use (some calls and music player) it can last about 8-10h, so this phone needs to be charged every day.- Sometimes the phone struggles a little with the OS, for example it always freeze for a couple of seconds when I'm switching home-screens while listening to Winamp and with an animated wallpaper.- It struggles with a lot of games (i.e. Angry Birds), some others can't even be played.- No Flash for the camera.- No compatibility with Flash (for websites)Conclusion: if you don't care about 8000x5000 \"retina\" 5inch screens, 10000 MegaPixels cameras, restrictive OS, and you don't care about not playing the latest cutting-edge games, then this is the phone for you, you can do almost everything with this phone that you can do with the latest Blackberry: send and receive calls, emails, messages, send your tweets, take photos and share it with friends on Facebook, Whatsapp, browse the web and much much more, for less, less money.Features- 420MB RAM 600Mhz processor (good, but definitely not the best, some even say this phone can be overclocked, but I haven't tried it myself)- Nice design and build, not so heavy (130g)- Good Wifi/3G signal- Android 2.2 (upgrade-able to 2.3)- Excellent colorful crisp 480x320 3.2inch display- microSD slot for storing a lot of music/videos/files- PDF, Doc viewer- Awesome apps like Web browsers, Twitter, Facebook, calendar, notes, weather and thousands more to download from the market.- Standard 3.5mm jack for audio- Very good 3MP camera (no flash)- Can be used as a USB pendrive for storing files (in the microSD)- Can use YOUR FAVORITE digital music player for music/video synchronization (Mediamonkey, Winanp, Windows Media Player) NO longer restricted to that annoying iTunes!!! :D I feel relieved.Included in the package:- LG Optimus One P500 with protective screen film already applied.- USB cable for charging and file transfer.- Wall charger adapter.- Cheap earphones.- 2GB microSD card.- Instruction manual in English and Spanish.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "for beginners", "Author": "GG", "ReviewID": "RID9WFMXZS7GE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If this is your first Android or your first smartphone I will recommend this one for sure.

This was advertised as an \"unlocked\" phone, which means it will work with a carrier that supports the phone.  It wasnt defective, but still locked with \"Virgin Mobile\" which displayed when the phone turned on.  I spent alot of time and energy with T-Mobile (they support LG and this phone)  trying to get it to work and I had a great renew/upgrade already in the works with T-Mobile becasue I was using my own phone.  However, I could not get it to read the SIM card/s. Finally took it to the T-Mo store and they confirmed that it was not unlocked.  Although I got my money back, I still feel like I got ripped off.  I had to select a new service plan with my carrier and scramble to get a new phone right before christmas.  How hard is it to check out a phone before you send it to the customer??

For some reason, my SD card doesn't stay put. So every so often my screen will go black (or sometimes flash black) and there is nothing you can do about it. It only stays (or flashes) black for like 10 seconds, then on the top of the phone it will say \"SD card unexpectedly removed. Please insert a new one\" I think the clasp that holds the SD card may be loose and that is why it does it. That is the only problem I have had with this phone so far.
