{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This phone is the way to go!", "Author": "Franky Franks", "ReviewID": "RIXIMTVZ112I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this phone! For the price, you simply can't get much better. The phone has a beautiful 4.5\" screen that makes surfing the web, playing games, and reading text easy on the eyes. The phone is pretty snappy and is very touch responsive. I've had this phone since it was released from Metro and they released a software upgrade just today; the upgrade is supposed to optimize everything. The phone has a 5mp camera and records 1080p video. The pictures come out great if there is sufficient lighting, but you can always use the flash if there is not. The video quality is also excellent if used outside or where there is enough light. You can also enable the flash to be on all the time while recording movies which is a cool feature. The call quality on this phone is pretty good as Metro has improved so much. I think this phone utilizes a SIM card which you get from Metro, and from what the Metro clerk told me, when you are out of Metro range, the phone will work off of the T-Mobile towers. This phone reminds me a lot of the LG motion, which was my old phone, just a larger version with the bigger screen. Overall, this is a solid mid-range smart phone with an unbeatable price!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price!", "Author": "K. Song", "ReviewID": "RKXOCNM13M8MX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone from some other place, to use for T-Mobile.It's been few weeks since I bought this, and I really like this phone, so I decided to write some review.Let me start with negative points, since this might be what people interested more.1. This phone lacks a lot of sensors, including light sensor (no auto brightness), gyro, temperature, NFC, etc.2. This has only 4GB internal memory, and only ~1.5GB is available to the user.3. Camera quality is so-so.There are other problems you might notice if you use this.But let's face it.When you are talking about those problems, you are comparing this phone to something a lot more expensive.This one costs only $150. Those phones most people compare this to are ~$600. You can buy 4 L9 for the price of iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, etc. You know you cannot just expect the same level of spec for the 1/4 of price.This phone is not for someone who plays a lot of 3D games, which requires a lot of space as well as high power.Just like PC, if you want such things, you should buy a lot more expensive, powerful phone.Also, even though the camera quality is so-so, there is no problem taking everyday photos for website uploading, etc.So in my opinion, these problems are very minor, considering the price of the phone and who this phone is targeted.This phone has big (4.5\"), bright, and clear screen. LG is known for good IPS screens, and this phone has no less.Resolution might be bit low in today's standard (it has qHD), but you won't really notice it.Also, this phone is pretty fast and responsive. And I think its 1GHz dual core is more than enough to handle most stuff smoothly. At least, I didn't experience any problem.So, as long as you can live with 1.5GB app storage and don't play heavy 3D games, this phone should work just fine for you. In fact, this one's power is about the same level as Galaxy S2.Finally, there are few things to note.1. This phone is the same as T-Mobile's LG L9. This one's model number is MS769 and T-Mobile's is P769. They are exactly the same.2. Unlike T-Mobile version, this version of the phone does NOT have carrier branding. Just LG mark and that's it. (Big plus for me!)3. This phone is SIM LOCKED to Metro PCS. You CANNOT use T-Mobile's SIM card right out of the box. (Service Provider Lock, but does not have network lock)4. This Metro PCS one contains a lot LESS bloatwares compared to T-Mobile's. But there is something called MyExtras, which pops up ads, that should be disabled immediately.5. Usually, this Metro PCS version is cheaper than T-Mobile's version. This one costs only $150 while T-Mobile's is ~$200.6. If this does not already have 4.1.2, you WILL get software update notification, even if you don't put any SIM card in it, as long as you are connected to WIFI. So, this one has 4.1.2 Jellybean.If you want to get L9 for T-Mobile, GET THIS ONE.Then you can unlock this phone using... you-know-where-to-look-for way and it will be a lot cheaper.UPDATE: I forgot to mention... If you use this phone on T-Mobile, WIFI calling does NOT work. It says invalid SIM. (FYI, other things work fine. I get 4G signal no problem)I don't know whether there is some way to enable it, but since I don't use it, I just disabled it. So, if you need this feature, just stay on Metro PCS.UPDATE 2: Someone mentioned that updating E911 address enabled WIFI calling, so I tried and it indeed works!So just go to My T-Mobile, and update E911 address under profile menu.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Was A Good MetroPcs Phone - Replaced By $49 LG L70", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R24CH9TJWUN2DV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LG L9 has now been replaced by the $49 LG L70 with Android Kitkat.  The L9 was a very good phone for MetroPCS using T-Mobile's 4G HSPA+ network which covers 80% of the largest cities across the USA. As of May 2014, the LG L9 has been discontinued.The old 2012 model LG L9 has now been replaced by the new 2014 model LG L70 which has 4G HSPA speeds and the newest version of Android Kit Kat software. MetroPcs stores sell the newer L70 for $49.The L9 and L70 lack 4G LTE, but they use 4G HSPA to stream Pandora Radio and Spotify music smoothly and standard YouTube videos load and play after a short wait.Both the L9 and L70 both have average cameras that take okay photos in bright sun but take mediocre photos indoors. The front \"Skype\" camera is of very poor quality and is almost useless.BEFORE ORDERING A MetroPCS PHONE: Go to the MetroPCS website and use the coverage map to zoom in on the block where you live. Do NOT buy a MetroPCS phone unless there is excellent coverage on your block. A strong signal is essential to enjoying your new phone.  MetroPcs has limited service in many smaller cities and NO service in most rural communities.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone at a great price", "Author": "Laurie", "ReviewID": "R326WJJCO4QK2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is worth every dollar.not only is it inexpensive but it's a great quality phone, it's super slim, and light weight , it has a great camera, nice features,but i'd consider buying a SD card with it if you're someone who likes to have alot of apps on their phone.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone... but...", "Author": "pint67", "ReviewID": "R2VPF9QVUN83PV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone. I bought it at metro PCS a few months ago. It works fine except it has very little internal memory. When I put in a SD card for memory, it presents problems and has trouble recognizing it.You cannot move the apps to the SD card. It seemingly has to do with this version of Android on this particular phone.I have tried the many \"apps to SD\" apps out there as well as other apps that may be of help and none will help with remedying this problem. Looking online, one can find that this is not that uncommon with this phone. Neither Android nor LG seem to care.So I had to find a work-around and manually move files to the SD card in the file manager. This is tedious but if I don't do this a few times a week, it runs out of space. (I am not interested in \"rooting\" anything but have come to find out some people do it to their phones)Other than this pretty big flaw, the phone is great. If I had to buy over again though, I would NOT recommend this phone because of this problem... or I would at least warn the buyer to check the internal memory of this phone.For me, because it's my first, I can live with it until there is a patch or newer version of Android released for this model. But it would also me great not to have to do it and with other phones you can buy, this is not a problem.LG should look into this and release something to help its customers.Hope this helps.And if anyone has a remedy, let me know (I have looked on youtube and around the net with no success).", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really like this phone", "Author": "paulzpc", "ReviewID": "R8ZMKQI0Z474F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for two months now and I love it , the service however is a bit shoddy to say the least , Metro Merged with T Mobile.. I am not crazy about this , but the phone LG L9 is a T Mobile phone so I am grateful only for that reason, now back to the phone , it has become quirky, it at times is hard to reboot and jumps from screen to screen when trying to shut it down but I think it's the way I use it and not the phone itself,I just got the rooting right to it and that could make it quirky. I use it to play my music which it has performed wonderfully, I use it to watch movies on my break at work , the phone work wonderfully but is limited to the service , but it will play netflix flawlessly , it plays hulu flawlessly , with the Adobe flash player trick, and still after two months loads very quickly . This phone is a great phone for someone who is going to jump into the Android arena for the first time the performance is 5 star , but will spoil someone wanting to go to a cheaper phone.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus", "Author": "Jenna", "ReviewID": "R2OK9ZLYZYPWZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my new phone, its just like my older one but bigger.
