This means that it is not verizon, at&t;, sprint, alltel, or T-mobile. it just says HTC on it, and it is chrome. They sent me a brown and gold t-mobile version with out a second camera on it. This one is awful. I was very excited to get this phone, and paid alot for it. And they sent me the wrong one.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "seller cheated me...there is no second camera in this phone", "Author": "dk", "ReviewID": "R3PSB5TSXF3HQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initially I dint notice that my phone is not having second camera. Seller has mentioned model number as T7373 and when I explored on internet I found that T7373 has second camera for video calls, even the product's picture also show a second camera. But there is no second camera, this is very big feature missing. Seller should paste original picture of their product.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "T.

It stopped working in a couple of weeks.  I contacted the seller and was given a RMA#.  When looking through the box I discovered a postage free TMobile bag.  The bag was to small to put the box in it.  So once again I contacted the seller.  I was told to put the phone and the charger in the box with a note and drop it in the mail.  I did this, but the seller claims he never received the phone.  After a couple of months my a-z claim was denied by Amazon because I could not provide a return tracking number.  However, Amazon did give me a 100% refund, called a good will refund.  They looked at all the emails between myself and the seller and realized I did what they told me to do,so of course there was no return tracking number. Thank God for the honesty and good will of Amazon or I would have been out over $260.  As for the seller, I think he did get this phone back only not from me.  I think the bag I put the phone in was to the seller they bought the phone from.  I also think the original seller sent this phone back to them to be refurbed and once again be resold.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "No es lo que esperaba..", "Author": "Hernan", "ReviewID": "R245YGJ2SVOUTW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "En general el telefono no es tan malo, lo que pasa es que la bater\u00eda no dura nada, (si lo usas bastante te puede durar 12 hs con suerte) despu\u00e9s es muy grande y pesado.. el touch no es de lo mejor ya que a veces no responde o hay que presionar con mucha fuerza, la calidad del aparato en cuanto a la construcci\u00f3n es muy buena, el sonido es fuerte. El wifi funciona bien, no es una maravilla pero cunmple la funci\u00f3n. El gps tambien funciona correctamente pero cuando el celular se pone en reposo, tanto el wifi como el gps pierden la conecci\u00f3n. Tiene muy poca memoria ram, por lo que si tenes muchas cosas abiertas se relentiza demasiado y hay que resetearlo.. en s\u00edntesis no lo recomendar\u00eda. Vale destacar que el teclado qwerty es de lo mejor pero no alcanza con eso si el equipo es lento y no dura nada su bateria.
