If for example you want to find Dr. Fred. If you type in only \"Fred\" into the search field,\"Dr.Fred\" will not show up as one of the possible \"FRED's\" you are searching for.Ironically when you try to search for a contact to send a text message through in the messaging shortcut, it will suggest names for you. What kind of crap is this from samsung? It makes searching for contacts through the contacts shortcut short an agony!2) The phone just keeps switching itself off for no apparent reason. Initially it would actually re-start itself , but in the two weeks before I dumped it, it just kept swithcing itself off on its own accord. Some people have postulated that it could be the way the buttons at the bottom of the face of the phone are designed-they can be easily \"long pressed\" even just by putting the phone in a tight trouser pocket and hence switching it off. However I have found it off when it previously was on and just lying on the table with a fully charged battery!3)It doesn't allow for one to assign names to the FM radio stations it has tuned and saved! This means you have to recall the frequency of your favourite radio stations. An un necessary requirement considering technology is meant to make life easier.4)If after scrolling through all those radio stations it has saved you ended up choosing to listen to the station whose frequency was saved lets say two pages on the list of radio station.If after listening to your station chose to go back to the list of saved stations to choose another one, the interface will atke you back to the list but will display the stations starting from the first one downwards instead of taking you back to the position on the list of the station you last listened to.5) Surfing using opera mini is such a pain.The phone's touch screen which is resisitive in nature makes it such a hassle to navigate around a downloaded web page. Its 3G speeds are not 7.2 mbps, its more like 3.6/3,2.....which is pretty slow.6)The location of the 3.5 mm adaptor is such an inconvenience especially when you want to listen to media files while the phone is in yo pocket. I think the best location of a 3.5mm jack or adaptor is at the top or bottom of any phone. I will not express my disappointment at them for not being able to provide an outright 3.5mm jack and instead giving us an adaptor for it.7)It seams the message alert tones can not be changed to downloaded tones. This means in places where there are many samsung phones, you will be looking at your screen everytime you here a samsung message lert tone beacause you think its your phone going off only to see maybe four or thee other people also staring at their samsung phones!8) I haven't tried the in built dolphin browser because I think it will be the last nail in the coffin of a phone I was head over heels in love with until I bought it,....now I cannot wait to dispose of it!I will try the apple iphone 4 next and get it out of the way too. I think am missing something there although I think I might end up getting the sony ericsson xperia pro of nokia e7 just because they have QWERTY keyboards.....As for my two simcard sojourn-its officially at the end of its tether.MY ADVISE: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. LOOK AT THE REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND YOU'LL REALISE AM NOT BEING BLINDLY BIASED!", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung B7722 Dual sim", "Author": "RamonAmayaAmador \"Luis\"", "ReviewID": "R9AYRLSVOEBSS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Both the phone and the seller are really poor, the first in performance and the second in service. When I bought this phone I decided to pay much more than a chinese phone offering almost the same, but knowing that chinese products and sellers are not to trust, I went for a famous brand, but also I bought this phone because I needed (and still need) a dual sim phone that can receive calls to any of my two sims (this phone indeed has 2 sim slots), or in others words, if someone call me to Sim 1 my phone would ring and I will answer and if someone call me to my Sim 2, I can hear too my ring and also answer this sim 2 just with pressing a bottom. But that's not the story with this phone. You can keep one of the sims ON, and the other one has to be OFF. If you receive a call on the sim that's OFF, you will not hear any ring and the caller receive a message that my phone is turned off. There's one more complain about the phone having to be plugged into the wall plug very often in the morning (I am turning it on) for a few seconds to turn it on, no matter whether the phone is fully charged. But with this faulty feature I can live, but not with that of not having both sims turned on simultaneously. Well, then I filed a complaint but the seller just answered that they do  not accept returns, replace or refund, after 3 days of the phone being delivered. In my specific case, i wasn't at home when the phone was delivered and just came to open the case after two weeks of being received. SO MY RECOMMENDATION FOR NEW BUYER IS NEVER EVER TRY TO BUY FROM THIS SELLER AND NEVER EVER BUY THIS MODEL OF PHONE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE A REAL DUAL SIM PHONE THAT WORKS SIMULTANEOUSLY.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wrong item description", "Author": "Mano \"mano bala\"", "ReviewID": "RC63KRON515G3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it supports 4 band in sim 1 and 2 bands in sim 2GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 - SIM 1GSM  900 / 1800 - SIM 2So 2nd sim does not work in US", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "US Buyer Beware", "Author": "TLH", "ReviewID": "R10ORS4R8LTN2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have purchased this phone to use while traveling internationally for work, to reduce the amount of phones I carry.  I am not happy with meat & bones of this product.  I will say the desktop software that comes with the product for syncing is fairly complete, but that is all I have to say that is positive.I was hesitant to purchase a phone with no slide-out keyboard, but the touch screen keyboard (not qwerty) is the least of my issues.  If you have to dial a number and enter an extension (or any numeric menu selection) this is not the phone for you.  I have had this phone for over a month and cannot find any way possible to access the keyboard during a call, which is a nightmare.  I also find the phone freezes up easily.  My biggest disappointment is the email accessibility; the phone does not automatically read network data on SIM cards so you basically need an IT degree to figure out the required info to set up network, to access email accounts. Also the documentation with the phone is remedial - plenty of info on how to dial a call (duh!) but no info on some of the obscure icons that pop up or accessing the keyboard while in call to make a numeric selection.  This may not sound like a big deal - but wait until you are traveling and try to refill a travel SIM card and you must do by phone, \"press 5\" - it ain't gonna happen.There is no warranty offered for US consumers, so unless you like frustration and hours of tinkering with the set-up this is not the phone for you.

This one is certainly not the exception to this rule. Indeed, this one is a wonderful mobile phone, plenty of useful and practical stuff, and to this day I haven't experienced any malfunctions whatsoever. I'm very happy to own this phone and I recommend it to everyone. There is, alas, no network in my country to take fully advantage of the UMTS 2100 HSDPA 3.6 Mbps 3G coverage. Nevertheless, GPRS and EDGE are functioning flawless, and I used the WiFi to download games. It worked perfect. A last remark to the spanish speaking community: this phone's languages are english, french, arabic, persian (farsi) and urdu. If you don't understand any of these five languages, do not buy this phone at all, okay? Remember this: only SIM 1 is Quad-Band (850-900-1800-1900 MHz) and is good for either Movilnet or Movistar networks in Venezuela, and SIM 2 is just Dual-Band and it has only two frequencies (900-1800 MHz) and it's  good for our venezuelan Digitel network alone.
