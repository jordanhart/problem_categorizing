Christov", "ReviewID": "RCUU6QRKCLGRA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thru the years I found Nokia to make some of the best phones and this one is not an exception. I bought it because it is a 4 band (world) unlocked GSM, very light and small indeed, full touchscreen, responsive, quick and accurate typing, overall the phone works fast, has a bit slow GPS (when not assisted) with free maps and nice voice navigation, good WiFi, working radio, good loud speaker and call quality, decent email (old style) and normal camera, also the battery supposed to last longer. Overall, it does well what it supposed to do for the price of $180. There is one important thing, the US model has UMTS (3G bands) 900/1900/2100, so the 1900 works with AT&T;, but no 850 AT&T; or 1700 T-mobile. Strange, but the box label and some of the Amazon description are both wrong as they show 1700. I confirmed that with Nokia as well and the phone is working fast on AT&T; 3G on 1900. The phone is made in Mexico, that's fine. It has the plastic look, but it is the simple clean design and the cute shape that makes it look neat too. I am not sure why there is no variety of colors on the US market like elsewhere, that is rather frustrating. The operating system is the typical Nokia, no news there.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!", "Author": "Oscarg", "ReviewID": "R13NX9EUW12RA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone despite of certain reviews that claimed the product was defective or hard to operate and had a very hard to control touch screen. I received the phone this weekend exactly on time for Christmas. It is unlocked and works internationally (currently it is working in Costa Rica the country where I live in). Touch screen is harder to control than others but nothing out of this world way better than an LG touchscreen if you ask me. As far as the model is concerned (since I read a few reviews saying this one was the Nokia C5-04) the model IS the Nokia C5-03 and there IS no such thing as the C5-04. The model does work with wi-fi I tried it out already and apps work beautifully (so far I have tried facebook mobile, facebook chat, skype and whatsapp). As far as the product box is concerned (one review from Costa Rica claimed the box arrived open) it was fine, the box is opened to inspect the contents of it but the phone arrived in perfect conditions and worked perfectly. I rate this phone (even though its from 2010 a 4.5 star rating, shame Amazon will only let me rate it 4 or 5) but it is a great phone with a perfect operational system and specs for the price it has.

At least this is my opinion.It looks great, it feels solid not as usually cheap phones feel like, the touch captative system is very smooth and works quite well (similar to the Nokia N8), the pictures looks great to be honest.

Robison", "ReviewID": "ROJJDRO14FRF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a month now and it is everything I need in a smart phone.  OK, so its OS is Symbian S60v5, the phone memory maybe small and the camera does not have a flash, BUT where can you get a smartphone with great features in such a compact yet powerful phone?  Call quality is great.  Resistive touch screen (get over it) is more responsive than I thought.  I was even able to set it up to use my older data plan.  Since I can only access 2G through my carrier - I can still use all the internet features and use Opera Mini for Symbian without having to pay $30.00/month extra.  I'm even typing this review tethered through my laptop via the C5-03 phone.  Camera takes great pictures.  Music file sound fine with the 3.5mm connection. And the OVI Suite software makes adding software, upgrading, and syncing your phones backup to your computer so easy.  I am hoping Nokia may upgrade the OS to Symbian^3 like the C7 Astound.  In the meantime this is a great phone in this price category.  Recommend getting a silicone sleeve (plastic back is slippery) and screen protector.  Found them at Tmart on the web Super price.

If you are not good doing touchscreen phones better do not do it or perform a good QA testing before releasing products to the market.

My phone came with an Italian (European) wall connection, but also with an adapter for American use. Alternatively, it charges very slowly through the miniUSB port.The most annoying thing is that I frequently have calls dropped or network busy signals when attempting to make phone calls. When making calls, I usually only get through to the network on my first try about 60% of the time.

The touch-screen on the C5-03 is a joke.  On average I had to tap the screen 2-3 times in order to get a click or selection!!!  How efficient is that!?Entering text was another nightmare.  The keyboard that would pop up in an input field was a numeric keypad.  What!?  What happened to a full keyboard?  Oh yeah, you have to rotate the phone horizontally.  Come on.  This is childish stuff.  At a minimum, Nokia should pop up an extended numeric keypad (one extra column of keys, like the blackberrys do).  Oh oh, and get this!  They give you an option to scribble the letters, ha ha ha!  The scribble area is about the size of my thumb.  How am I suppose to scribble each letter here?Then you wonder why Nokia is loosing mobile market share.Anyways, do not buy this phone; it's a waste of your money and time.

You cannot directly swipe the bar to activate conversation even though the screen is lighted. Instead I have to lock and unlock again to make the screen responsive.2. GPS signal is never acquired if you disable network assistance, i.e., if you want to save money by not connecting to carrier data network.3. In some cases such as calendar, it is REALLY HARD to make the right-pointing arrow work so that calendar can move to next month.

The Nokia SUITE software actually gives you an option to sync with \"Outlook\" or \"Outlook Express\" Every attempt to sync with Outlook Express failed. After an extensive phone conversation with Nokia support it turns out that Nokia did not know the difference between \"Outlook\" & \"Outlook Express\". Bottom line, the phones CAN NOT sync with Outlook Express only Outlook. End result I purchased a copy of \"Outlook\". Nokia Suite does do an excellent job of contact, calendar, & etc sync with Outlook.The second problem encountered with both phones was the apparent inability of the phones to use the ringtone assigned to a contact or ID a caller. Both would only show the number of the caller nothing else. After AMAZON replaced one phone (GREAT SERVICE AS ALWAYS) and the same problem still existed. I reread the direction and spent more time on the Nokia site. I was unabled to dertermine the cause of the problem. I contacted Nokia and they told me I most likely had to have a firmware upgrade. I sent the phone to Nokia (C5-03) they returned the phone with updated firmware but told me they could not find anything worng. Mean while my wife was using the C6-00 and found that, in some cases, the assigned ringtone was playing and the contact name was showing along with a voice ID.It turns out that if you enter the same phone number for two contacts (for example HOME 5551212 & ICE(In Case Of Emergency)5551212)) the phone does not know which contact to display so it does not know what ringtone to use it just shows the number calling. (a real problem when you have over 500 numbers stored)It must be noted that I was unable to find any reference to using duplicate numbers for different contacts creating an assigned ringtone issue, nor did Nokia support ever bring up the issue.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love the phone but it is not good enough.", "Author": "Tania Perez \"Dalsia Shephard\"", "ReviewID": "R9O5CPIC7ODP9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I liked the phone, but the memory card does not work when i place the back cover, that's annoying. i don't know what happened with it,  and i don't want to have a phone open all the time.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice", "Author": "Luigilosh", "ReviewID": "R14RN3Y9KRJESJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything is Good!
