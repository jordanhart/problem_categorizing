{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone for a great price", "Author": "Stephen Bush", "ReviewID": "RSX5BON9QEX3S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most of the reviews of this phone praise it because of the cheap price, good camera and hd display(though only 720p). They also say that call quality and the 1 gig of ram is not good enough. But having used this phone for a while now, this 1.5 ghz dual core processor is plenty fast, 1 gig of ram suits this phone well especially because of the price. Also call quality is pretty good. It only has a little over 4 gigs if internal storage, but micro sd cards are cheap. I have experienced little lag and this is partially because the processor is relatively fast(compared to high end devices like the htc one, leg g2 or note 3) and also because of a relatively stock version of android 4.1.2 (not 4.2). But an update to Android 4.4 KitKat is always an option since Google boasts KitKat can run on devices with a half gig of ram. Overall this is a great phone for someone  who can't or doesn't want to pay a lot of money for a good smartphone.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ECJFEJW"}}
