It has English as language but no Google Play Store or a way to find English apps. It has Apps Center which gives you very specific Chinese apps options. Please be careful if you want to use it immediately this is not the phone. Not sure this is because of the seller as it has shipped from Hong Kong.UPDATE 2013/01/04Seller claimed that the phone has a good price because it comes with Chinese Apps. Offered no solution. This information is not available in product description. Please be careful and verify with the seller before you buy. You will have to find custom-built ROMs and root the phone in order to use with English and Google apps if you buy Chinese version.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Google Play", "Author": "pasquale", "ReviewID": "RB2HSCG3AFJC2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hello I bought this smartphone and I consider it very good even though it has some limitations and that is often the first sim crashes and mostly missing the Google Play menu and although the download does not allow you to download any apps.We need a new firmware or update the system.thanks", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "great smartphone", "Author": "Spyridon T.", "ReviewID": "R3P3TSQT0LWWWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great value for those features. you wont find a better smartphonw with same characteristivs and cheaper.
