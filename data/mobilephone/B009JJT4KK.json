{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible phone/tablet!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R2M8PJ657WPZOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When one opens the box, there is a sense of awe. People ask \"Is this really a phone\" was one reaction I got. It is an amazing piece of hardware. I have used Android devices starting from Cupcake version, used iPhone, HP Veer with webOS, Windows 7.5 HTC Titan 2. This phone is the sleekest and one of the best so far. It is fabulous!  I find the big size to be very good and not a problem at all. Will the Galaxy Note 3 be 6\" ?!Out of the box, connect to wireless and get the phone logged into Google account. The advantage of Android phones is that once you are logged into Google universe, everything gets synced up especially if you have been using Android.  The position of power button is at an excellent position for your hand on this Note 2. The additional LED for notification on top is very handy. Listen Apple? The camera serves some really futuristic ideas also. It can check if you are looking at the phone and disable screen lock (even if you set timeout to say 30 sec). Also it can serve as password unlock. Amazing! These can be set from Settings Menu.The Android version as of Oct 26 2012 is Jellybean 4.1.1. Kernel version is 3.0.31-259982. Model GT-N7100. I got the 64 GB microSD card. Get this mobileUltra, it is the latest as of Oct 2012. (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging. Settings show an available space of 59.45 GB. So along with 16 GB built (system shows only around 10.46 GB), my Note 2 has 80 GB memory. With music in the  Google Music cloud, I intent to use the memory for video/pictures as a camcorder/camera.I strongly suggest going through Settings and customizing many things as per your desire. I did Voice Input, Keyboard (this comes with English(UK), change to English(US) for example. Fiddle around the settings and you will be amazed how much you can customize. I also did Battery % to appear in notification bar.One thing I found the default keyboard did not show Mic button. I realized it was next to Sym button. Long press it and choose Mic. And then on, it will appear in default keyboard. Also customize the accent. It can do magic for typing. I type paragraphs at a time effortlessly. This is Google backend servers at work. The Mic on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 does a fantastic job!S-Pen, Ah.. I was truly impressed. You have to use these to believe it. The note taking was very fluid. Samsung seem to have nailed it. I wrote up an equation in Equation mode - x^5 = x^2 + 2x + .... Something completely random, another one d/dx(an equation) and it recognized perfectly and asked it to search, it went to Wolfram Alpha and solved it. It is at first unbelievable and then it starts to sink in this is a computer program made well. Like it should be in first place! Export to pdf is very good. The main thing is the pen is very fluid and feels like a fountain pen writing.Overall, the phone feels very smooth and snappy. The screen is crisp and clear. Apps can even be multi screened. Samsung approved apps can be placed two in a screen. Eg. Maps on top and email on bottom portion. I doubt I will use this, but handy.One gripe I have with this phone is speaker is on the back. Typically if you lie the phone down, the speaker is blocked on bottom. I wish the speakers were in the side. This is a design decision and not sure why phones have speaker on back. But the speaker volume is very high, so I am not complaining too much.One big pain point with Android is once you purchased/downloaded for free Apps, they cannot be permanently deleted. So even if you get a junk app, and delete immediately they are permanently there in your Google Play store. From the phone's play store I got 300+ Apps. One cannot choose 50 apps and say get all these. You have to do one by one. After getting one, the screen resets to beginning. So I went to a computer browser and pushed apps to pone. This is easier and faster.UPDATE: With Jellybean and even ICS, I found you can delete the apps. It is not very intuitive. On Play, there is a circle with a /. Click on it to delete the app. It disappears from the phone list.Some of apps I have as of now :Nike Running+ App - Excellent app uses GPS to track walk/run, highly recommend for fitness trackingAmazon MobileAndroid Status : Android Status app shows ARMv7, Max Freq 1.6 GHz, BogoMips 1592.52 Memory 1.79 GB, Free 365 MB, Internal Storage 10.46 GB Free 7.18 GB.

I have an S3 but the Note 2 is so much better. The titanium gray finish makes it look sleek and elegant, a nice change from white or black. I use an international micro SIM card purchased from Amazon and it works well. I got online through Wi-Fi and downloads were quick. My apps were easy to install and use. I needed an unlocked international version because I travel around the world and I need a phone that can roam on 2G or 3G networks. I also added a 64GB microSD card for listening to music and audiobooks. I can replace my iTouch and not have to carry 2 devices, plus the microSD card slot lets me carry more than the on-board storage. I like having options and the Note 2 gives me plenty.03/15: I set up my music and listened through my Bose headphones. The sound is great and I can change the ambience to bass boost or I can customize my listening settings. I set up my playlists and the graphics are good quality and brilliant colors. I spent the afternoon taking photos with my Note 2 and they came out great. The quality was so much better than my point&shoot.; I also got some video with sound that is amazingly good. Transferring the photos and videos to my PC was easy. Owning this device just eliminated another item I no longer need to carry. I travel a lot and I usually carry my iPad + cell phone + camera. This would replace all those easily. My only two wishes were that it used a regular SIM card rather than a microSIM card and that it came in the same gorgeous garnet red as the limited edition Galaxy Tab 2 7\". I found a deep red flip cover, so here's hoping it will be beautiful. I am very happy with my purchase!04/27: The Amigo flip cover for this device is a beautiful deep berry red. I get compliments on both the case and the phone wherever I go. I'm taking advantage of the daily free Android apps that are compatible. I've gotten some great free apps through Amazon's program.05/16: I have traveled to several different countries in Africa and I have had no trouble using my phone service. Service depends on the carrier, not the device. Some countries do not recognize my SIM card for calls but let me send/receive SMS text messages. My device still rocks! I'm using it a lot more these days than my iPad. I still need my iPad for movies, though, because Amazon Instant Video (download) is not for android devices, just the Kindle, the iPad and the PC. I hope that will change one day because the Note 2 is great for watching video content. I've watched some YouTube videos on this and the quality is execellent.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxay Note 11 Love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RAF179SECXZSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received on time.

Boudreaux", "ReviewID": "R2OF0V99993KSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this for my wife, whose Galaxy 1 started to become well used. The size is between a galaxy 2 and a 7\" tablet. Basically it is a slightly smaller tablet you can also use as a phone. Keyboard size is good. I got the unlocked version because her service provider does not have this model available yet.  Android 4 appears to be very stable, and most of your earlier version apps will transfer.As a plus, this model comes with a built in stylus like the new Galaxy Note 10.1 which is very handy.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 biggest drawbacks...myths BUSTED ;)", "Author": "Bill Door", "ReviewID": "R28IM4YKQIMV2B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I won't waste your time reviewing the features of this phone - factual information on this device has reached saturation levels already!Instead, here are 2 of the biggest fears I had, put to rest since I bought it:1. \"The international version (GT-N7100) uses 3g/4g bands that are not compatible with T-Mobile, so T-Mobile users would be stuck with Edge speeds\". Luckily, T-Mobile have already begun rolling out 3g on the 1900 band (which this phone supports) so there is no longer any real advantage to having the T-Mobile branded version instead, in my opinion. I have been able to get 3g in Kansas City at the time of writing. This is a big deal because, at the time of writing, T-Mobile has the best monthly data plan options by far.2. \"It's too big.\" Nothing could be further from the truth. It fits in my jeans pocket along with my wallet EASILY, and I hardly even know it's there. Believe it or not, it has a less obtrusive profile that my 1st generation iPhone, and weighs about the same. It does have an amazing screen area, but it's very slim, and that makes a much bigger difference than screen area. Apple are simply wrong about the iPhone being the optimal form factor, and this phone will prove that. I predict this form factor is about to become very popular.Complaints that you can't reach everything with one hand are irrelevant - of course you can't reach across the whole phone because there's more phone. You can still reach as much stuff as you could before. There's just extra space for more stuff! How is that bad?I'm not a gadget person who tries out all the latest stuff. The last smart phone I bough was the 1st iPhone. It took that much of an evolutionary leap to persuade me to try it out 5 years ago. This is honestly the 2nd smart phone I have ever been tempted to buy - in my opinion, the form factor, power and stylus precision take this phone a step beyond all the others.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "This equipament has no warranty", "Author": "Paulo Cesar Brochonski", "ReviewID": "R1B0FFPIIUMG5T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buy it,  at your on risk, be aware you will have no warranty support from Samsung neither from the store.If you open the box and the N7100 is not working or stops to work few weeks after,as happened with my one, you threw  your money on the waste.Be always on the safe side,  buy hw with warranty.Good lucky.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible customer service", "Author": "Eleazar", "ReviewID": "R1FHL4EQN0I321", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A few months ago I purchased a note 2 from this seller and everything was fine.

I'm coming from using an iphone 3g so it's hard for me to compare to it's true peer the iphone 5.Pro's- Large screen, lots of apps, good touch response, good rear speaker, quick processing power.Con's- It's take a while to handle it so you're not activating something on the screen.  Also the power button on the side should be moved to the top like and Iphone.  Not sure if thats some sort of patent thing, but it just adds to one more button to accidently pushing during handling.  Also IMO...all buttons should be more flush with the body to help prevent accidental pressing.  These button stick out just enough to be accidently pressed during handling. I just didn't have this problem with an even smaller Iphone.I haven't used it as a phone yet because I'm overseas and will be returning home soon.  FYI, it uses a mini sim card.  What I do like is my computer picks up the phone with no issues like an external device so makes transfering files easy.I find the stylus pretty useless.  The few times I have used it, the action isn't very responsive.  Maybe I'm using it wrong?Another problem I don't like is when I'm texting in landscape mode, the keyboard takes up the whole screen except for the line on top I'm typing so I can't easily reference the material above that line.  Everything works normal in portrait mode.  Not sure if this issue is my phone or a android thing.  Maybe there's another keyboard app?

They do not make a separate \"international version\" model without carrier imprints, bloatware, etc..A lie of omission is still a lie. This phone is presented in a way as to make you think you're getting a phone that has not been molested to within an inch of it's life by a carrier. That's what I want. I want a phone that is unlocked, who's network is unlocked, who's network circuitry is not manipulated to work slower on a competitor's network, who's application area is not littered with all their proprietary crap, and uninstallable, and a phone I can use without having a carrier's stupid logo stabbing me in the eyes a thousand times every time I use it, by pressing their stupid logo on the home key to start the phone and watch their stupid logo on startup screen, by watching their stupid logo on the wallpaper disappear as another stupid logo appears during the call, their stupid \"soundfont\" along with some stupid automated voice thanking me for using <company name>, and saying my <companyname> service has x minutes left. Then another stupid logo as the call connects, then another stupid logo as the call is ended.I'm not kidding. Every time I make a phone call anymore, I feel completely molested. I feel I desperately need to take a shower, look in the mirror, and remind myself I'm someone's father.Odd, isn't it? That none of the reviews here mention that they were surprised to discover it's a Carrier-Molested phone, even though it's described with no indication of this at all?That seems certain proof that the reviews were not written by customers at all, but are the lying lies of the lying liar salesmen.Get online with Samsung if you don't believe me.
