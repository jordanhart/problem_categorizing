I pressed buttons, it responded.  People called me and my phone rang accordingly.  It was a golden time.  A time that I shouldn't have taken for granted.  But I'm human, and so I did.It is a darker age now....God, how I miss the phone I once knew.It started out innocently enough.  Small lag times.  You know what I'm talking about.  I'd turn the screen off and the sound effect would follow a second or two later.  Then three.  Then ten.  Soon enough I'd have the phone back in my pocket and be halfway out the door before I heard the muffled click.  Things continued to get worse.Apps that had always worked began hanging and crashing.  Sometimes the phone would ring, while sometimes I just received a notification that someone had left a message because they couldn't reach me.  Response times to everything grew longer and longer.  It became customary to click on an icon and then find something else to do while the phone tried coming to grips with this request.  Sometimes it just couldn't do it.It tried committing suicide two weeks prior.  It jumped off my nightstand, but only managed to crack its screen.  Now my phone is ugly AND unresponsive.Every day that goes by in which I don't hurl the phone across the room is a victory.  Or is it?

Although I really don't mind, I still don't like being mislead since the description said \"New\", I would have been fine with \"Factory Refurbished\" or \"Refurbished\".

The package arrived on time and was well packed. Everything was in the box including all of the paperwork. There was no wear of any kind on the product and the phone is just awesome. I usually don't buy the latest and greatest so I don't have to pay the highest and most outrageous price for it. But this phone is by no means far behind the most sophisticated equipment out there. As far as performance, the battery lasts a day and a half from full charge to about 15% so I charge it at night and I'm good. All of the apps run smoothly including some that have received pretty bad reviews. (Just keep in mind an apps performance and the phones performance with the app are two totally different things.) I Have great reception and 4g lte. The WiFi is receiver is great too. There is only one place in my mom's house that I can't pick up her WiFi, but then again my sister in law's iPhone 4s can't get it there either so I'm not complaining. What more can I say, it comes with a pack of three scene protectors that don't have the annoying bubbles (provided you follow th instructions) and and a silicone case that improves gripping the phone. This is not my first smart phone and all of my family has smartphones ( iPhones Samsung galaxies etc.) I would not trade mine for any of theirs and it is far better than my old one. Oh, and all I had to do was take it to a Verizon store and ask them for an ESN change. They provided a SIM card made the change to my account. Did not have to pay one penny! I'm happy! :)", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's a Lemon", "Author": "Peter Curtis", "ReviewID": "RNUL1TVA75477", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm not hating on Droid RAZRs. They are actually pretty cool phones. But I would advise against getting second hand phones, especially ones that are as nice as this one. The previous owner must have sent it back for some reason. Now I am hesitant yet tempted to do so. But I do not want another buyer to go through the same horrors as me.The bottom line is that this phone has a terribly weak connection with its charger. And If I plug it in, it will maybe charge 10% of the time, whether it is off or on. Now you can imagine there is no more detrimental flaw than to have your phone refuse to charge or turn on for the better part of its usage. It cost me so much that I was actually foolish enough to depend on it to get me to my new awesome kayak tour job in San Diego. And the damn thing died during the night after I plugged it in at a 20% charge. I was not able to make it to the job on time in the most crucial of busy days and now I no longer have that awesome job.So in a nutshell, this phone has ruined my life and it can possibly ruin yours. My next step is to learn from it and stick it to Amazon somehow if I have a warranty or not because this is unacceptable.

Unresponsive screen, apps that don't run properly, quirky behaviors like starting up apps on its own, and slow responses to any commands are just a few of the problems I encountered while using this phone.

By the fifth month my Razr was running the battery down in less than one hour (and that's with all battery saver options engaged).  I was literally counting the minutes until my contract with Verizon would come up so I could upgrade.Oh one more thing, when I used the Verizon Wireless website calculator to figure out how much the phone was worth, it came up with an amount of $4.76 -- I could not agree more - that's about how much I would pay to get another one of these!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Verizon!!", "Author": "Angel C.", "ReviewID": "R148CE9YD38FAF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone was kool and all for a replacement but truthfully it started off giving a few issues.

The company I got the phone from offered to replace the phone at no charge, which I did. The new RAZR did go into 4G mode but only about 5% of the time I was on it. People complained all the time that the could not hear me on the phone or that I sounded muffled. The phone would regularly lose my data connection and people would not get e-mails I sent off the phone.

OH, and contacts are no longer in the phone menu so you pretty much have to favorite everyone if you don't want to navigate all over your phone just to call someone.Droid X had volume levels for calls, music and apps.

The screen also has a nasty habit of locking up when its being charged. My phone crashed constantly in-spite of having a 32 gig sd memory card.  I love the Motorola smart actions but smart actions that I tired to use to conserve power such as turning off the data when the screen is locked does not restore data when the screen is unlocked. Motorola was not helpful in resolving either of these problems. They recommended restoring to factory default. After several restorations and phone exchanges the same problems remained.
