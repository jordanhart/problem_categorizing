The sound quality is excellent and the pop up bubble is great when i get a message. The phone is easy to use but has some bad points. The worst part is the qwerty board is silver with blue back lighted buttons and it is very hard to see unless the room is dark. The phone is very slippery and will slide out of your hand or off a table or dash if your not careful. The power button is on the top instead of the side so it makes it difficult for one handed operation. I got the phones for free with a two year contract so I have to keep them but if I had to pay for them I would be disappointed. The only other thing that is a problem is the quick (Hello) feature is not that quick because you have to hit three buttons after the phone is on to call that person. One more thing,when you take pictures the screen is off set so to center it can be a pain and takes some practice.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just the phone I needed!", "Author": "iconicdave", "ReviewID": "R34867D1CHGE2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new cell phone cause the one I had was old and the buttons were fading so some of the buttons I couldn't even see what it was.

I really like the phone, and everything about it. The only downfall is that the space bar is a little stiff and takes some effort to press down on for it to become effective.

She was \"in\" because she knew who she was and they knew she just did things a little differently. That is kind of how the Rumor Reflex is, and kind of how the users of this phone have to be: The Reflex is not a smart phone, and let's face it: we all want a smartphone, but I can't justify the pretty penny those contracts cost every month, not to mention the cost of the actual phone that everyone drops and cracks! But if you accept the Rumor Reflex with the understanding that you are going to have to scroll through menus to get to things, and that for everything you want to do, except make a call, you begin with the main menu, I think you will be very happy and, dare I say, yes I dare! Impressed. So: specifics: I realized that all I really want from my cell phone is to 1) be able to text (keyboard: check! Yeah, the face is light-colored with a blue back light, and yeah, the keys stick a little at first, but you get used to it. Also, if you add a plastic protective cover, for some reason this makes the keyboard slide better and makes the entire phone more substantial.) 2)  a camera for fun things I see and want to text to friends or post to facebook (check! But it is only 2 megapixels so isn't great quality, but it is good enough. Also, for some reason the menu for the camera is on the viewfinder and covers part of the image you are composing which is annoying and takes a while to ignore. There also is a camcorder, but practice with it because you need to verify the sound is recording.) and 3) I want to get my e-mails when I'm away from a computer. So this leaves the web, and this will be the biggest disappointment for those who compare this to a smartphone because the Reflex will fall short. The main word here is slow, and I don't mind slow at all, but this redefines slow.  You'll get your e-mail, and you'll be able to respond to them on the pullout keyboard, but you will get them several minutes after you'd get them on a computer or tablet. This isn't just a function of the provider, but it is the phone, going through all those menus, step-by-step.  It isn't smart and accessing the web is going to make this obvious. My e-mails aren't time-sensitive, so I am perfectly happy to pocket the $50 a month I save on my plan, (that is $600 a year, and THAT is a pretty penny) and deal with slow. There are also very few apps that I need on my phone. But you still can have some fun with personalized rings, and alarms and you can even watch You Tube videos and Google those trivia questions if you want. Now: Have you noticed what I didn't mention? talking on the phone. I realized I don't use my cell much for calls. The sound quality is good, and there is a speaker phone that works great, but I prefer text to talk. So all in all, Little Miss Pretty Penny rates the Reflex a solid four stars: It thinks it can, and it can!", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "rumor reflex is great", "Author": "mary", "ReviewID": "R3VKJFPF4DO9ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "was very pleased with the reflex when i got it. its very stylish and easy to use, was way better then what i expected....it may not be a smartphone, but it works great, love the smooth feel of the phone and its lightweight....very pleased with my product thank you", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone I Have Ever Owned!", "Author": "Susannah Book Buyer", "ReviewID": "R2B54AVAIITGTC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is so utterly useless that I am returning it in less than a week.

Richardson", "ReviewID": "R3RBP6G2TFF7CO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is far and away the worst cell phone I've used. The keyboard is virtually impossible to read in most light conditions because it's silver AND reflective, with pale blue backlighting. It requires all manner of contortions to make keys visible. The keyboard is sluggish in responses, especially the space bar, and don't let your charger get too far away because battery life is the worst I've encountered. After a few months use, it's sometimes necessary to restart the phone to get the home menu and call buttons to respond. Indeed, the only thing worse than this phone is the Credo Mobile service through which I got it. When I complained and wanted to exchange it for something that worked, Credo offered six choices: a REFURBISHED LG Reflex like I had OR one of five smart phones, each of which requires unlimited data service and hundreds of dollars is extra yearly expenses. That's all we have in our inventory, Credo's rep explained. Fine, I responded, I'll just send these back, reactivate my old phones and then renew my contract when I can have a choice. No, no, said the rep. That contract is binding, no matter what you do about your phones; send back those phones and you'll have a 2-year contract and no new phone of any sort. After arguing with her and getting nowhere, I decided to fight another day ... and then got the same runaround when I called back. Then a friend telephoned to say they were going to switch to Credo as I had urged many friends. My response: DON'T DO IT. I had encouraged many friends to join Credo because they market themselves as the nation's only politically progressive (liberal) phone company -- good guys who donate 1 percent of revenues to liberal interest groups and causes. But that's just a cheap marketing ploy from what, in reality, is just another sleazy company. One percent? Peanuts compared to other corporations' giving programs. And Credo service costs more. Oh, and if Credo had offered a working phone to swap for the Reflex, there would have been a hefty restocking fee. So stay away from this phone and Credo Mobile. I apologized to the friends I'd urged to switch, and I tell the same any time cell services are mentioned. Credo's marketing ploy is a good one, but it's a ploy. Cheaper cell providers will enable folks to use those savings to make appreciably larger contributions to worthy causes -- and avoid disasters like the Rumor Reflex.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone sucks", "Author": "Deric", "ReviewID": "R96B1GS9G1Q4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We got four phones when we renewed our contract.
