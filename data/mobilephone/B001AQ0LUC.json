Seems to give decent reception.  Unfortunately at this level you get no connectivity to a PC, so you have to manually enter your contacts.It's an unpretentious phone, and it works, but it has a few unnecessary flaws:1.  No non-musical ringtone.  There isn't one which *just rings*.  I ended up choosing some sort of buzzing thing which sounds like a woodpecker, which was the least offensive.4.  Over-large font for texts and phonebook, which can't be changed.  There's a menu setting somewhere to change the font, but it doesn't take effect.  You get to see your texts two lines at a time.3.  Rather unpleasant keys - not very positive or easy to use.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "So I washed TWO cell phones...............", "Author": "Martin A Hogan \"Marty From SF\"", "ReviewID": "R2JDKBDD8W700X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am no one to criticize cell phones, considering that I washed TWO in my jeans in three months!  I had JUST agreed with AT&T; for another two years as well.  I thought I was lost until my nephew told me about `Go Phones'.  For this price, I get a phone that does just about everything my regular Nokia would do - except.It is totally plastic and won't hold up well if dropped.  Forget about texting; the keys are designed poorly and you can easily hit the wrong one.  And (this is a big one) the removal of the back panel for the battery and SIM card drove me nuts!  It appears that the textured part of the phone should be the removal panel, but it is actually the entire half of the phone that gets removed.  It took me twenty minutes to figure this out (but then, remember, I've washed two cell phones!).  Just press in the button on top and carefully unlock the entire back panel (it really is like half the phone).  I read others had problems with this.  The charger/headset cover is very flimsy and will probably break soon, but...This is a temporary phone.  It was very cheap.  All I did was replace the SIM card from my old phone.  It's not meant to be great, even though it has almost all the features an expensive Nokia would.  You know what?  If I manage to wash this sucker as well, I'll just go out and buy another.  No worries.BIG PLUS:  With AT&T;, after six months you can get a new free phone (tax is not included anymore) if you upgrade your service.  They will extend you for another two years.  Hey, don't we all have two years commitments anyway?  Enjoy!", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "better!", "Author": "W.
