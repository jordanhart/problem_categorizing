Giachello", "ReviewID": "R3SLD4SSXCSKMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone and overall , I like it very much. I do miss having actual buttons to push though and it takes a while to get used to the touchscreen. This phone runs on the Verizon network, which is great because the coverage and call quality is excellent. I left Verizon for Net10 because it was just too expensive. Now I have the same coverage and call quality for half the price of Verizon.  Back to the phone: I wish it had more font options. It only has normal and small and I would like it larger. I guess there are apps for this but I haven't found one that I like yet. Also, I haven't figured out how to turn off the auto-spell feature that tries to predict the words that you will use when typing. I hate this because it is often wrong and it will not let you type the word that you want to use without having to try many times. Aside from these couple of minuses, this phone is great. Also, it is not too big like some of the other phones. If I want big, I can use my computer at home.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly What We Needed And More", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R3GQJVR5XQIB5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my girlfriend to replace her horrible Huawei Ascend which had so little thinking memory (as opposed to storage memory) that it was always low on space and the number of apps you could have was pathetically small. The Samsung Centura, on the other hand, has tons of useable storage memory (about 2.5 GBs useable out of 4GB) and more than enough thinking memory to add tons of apps (about 380MB useable out of 512MB). There's more memory free and unused right now than was on her entire previous phone. In addition, this phone is about $39 cheaper than in brick and mortar stores AND it comes with a gift card for $25 worth of credit on Google Play that worked perfectly. We picked up a case locally and she loves the whole shebang. She and I are both incredibly happy with this purchase. If you want bells and whistles and have won the lottery, feel free to shell out a few hundred for a cutting edge phone. If you just want an affordable phone that does what you want and doesn't give you any hassles, this is it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the Money!", "Author": "sweetpeaches", "ReviewID": "RPKVTDM0QIBYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing for the value.It takes great pics and I have all my apps at my finger tips.

I only used it minimally from a data standpoint \u2013 about 500MB per month.  So, I was excited to get an android 4.0 (ice cream sandwich) for such a low price and only spend $45 a month for service on Verizon's towers.But, this phone performs so poorly, that even my minimal needs are not met that well.  I was willing to accept that it has no flash (which really stinks because once you get used to having an instant flashlight with you, it's hard to give up) and only an 800 MHz processor.  (Sidenote: most flashlight apps will let you use the whole screen as a flashlight if you don't have an LED, but it's just not the same)The bad:1) Sometimes, when I drag my notifications bar down from the top, I just get a blank screen for like 10 secs before the info is displayed.  This never happened with my old phone, which was by no means a speed demon.  In general, moving from screen to screen sometimes just lags too much.  I'm not talking about doing anything resource intensive either, just going from the text message screen to my phone contacts will lag sometimes.2) I have had three previous phones that I used with my current bluetooth system in my car.  Two of them were not smartphones.  This Centura sometimes just disconnects from my bluetooth right when I answer an incoming call.  It is really annoying (and dangerous!)  None of my previous phones ever did this.3) Sometimes browsing the web is just so darn slow.  I can understand that it will be slow when on 3G, but it is also slow when connected to my wifi router!  Why would it be so slow when browsing on wifi?!?!  The bottleneck is typically the network, not the device.  But in this case, it must be the device, because I will go to the exact same website at the same time with my old Droid X2 and it will load the pages in half the time.  I am not talking about heavy-content sites either \u2013 just text and images.4) If you go to some android forums, you will see that there is a bug with this phone that causes the clock to get reset to 5 or 6 hours behind the actual time.  I have only had it happen on my phone three times in 2 months, but one morning it caused me to be late for work since I use the alarm on my phone to wake me up in the morning.  This bug has been known for at least 6 months.  How can Samsung not release a patch in 6 months that covers such a serious, fundamental function of the phone!?!?!  Come on Samsung!  (There is a community-supplied fix to this issue, but you have to root your phone for the fix to work).5) If you are connected to wifi, and try to send a text message with an attached pic, it will simply hang on you.  You will not get an error message. It will just state: \u201cSending...\u201d  With a little research I learned that text messages only go through the mobile network and not wifi.  So, I turned off my wifi connection and resent the message and it went through fine.  This is crazy for me to have to worry about whether I have a wifi connection or not before sending a text with an attachment.  I have not heard anyone else having to do this with their phones.  (I never had to worry about this before).This phone would have been SO MUCH better if they priced it a little higher and gave it a little bit more robust features like a dual-core 1GHz processor and a little more memory.  Overall it's not a horrible phone, but I expected it to at least perform basic functions without any drama.  I mean, even my decade-old flip phones didn't lag when switching between text and phone screens!  If you have a few more bucks, you should probably consider the Huawei Ascend Plus, or LG Optimus Showtime (both Net10 or StraightTalk and run on Verizon towers).  They both have 1GHz processors, and have 4-inch screens.  I really don't want a larger phone \u2013 I am happy with the 3.5-inch screen because the phone is nice and small in my pocket.  Huawei has a 3.5-inch phone called the Glory which is on Verizon towers, so I may give that one a shot in a few months.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "New user to Andriod phones!", "Author": "budget minded Momma", "ReviewID": "R2LVPC47FAOI79", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just dumped my old carrier for a prepaid plan, and as someone who has been doing just fine with 'just a phone', this one has just enough features to make it worth it.

At first he was skeptical of having a pay as you go phone, but as an upgrade to a smart phone with Verizon was a minimum of $100/month, I thought it was worth a try.  So far, he really likes this phone.  It is fast enough to watch YouTube and he likes the convenience of be able to \"Google\" things at school.  The only item he mentioned was he said that the screen is not as responsive as he would like at times, but it seems to get better after he reboots his phone.Overall, I am glad I got this for him, and will probably get another for his brother.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "not a bad device.", "Author": "kiddo", "ReviewID": "R1IY6MA46Y7YCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After learning some of the apps Think I am going to like it a lot.It takes nice pictures.

However if you continue typing the word you want, thats what will come up. And sometimes the phone is right, when typing a long word it saves time.

The wifi signal is always 4 bars to 5 bars on this phone so i always get great connection. And yes this phone has bluetooth as well. Since my other phones die too quick i'll use this one as a spare device to walk around the house and listen to internet radio. I didn't have to hook it up to any cell phone service to use it with apps but to use the phone outside of your house without wifi, yes you can activate it with Net 10 Wireless or get a Verizon jetpack hotspot.I was going to add prepaid minutes to it but turns out the one I got in the mail is for the Unlimited Plan only. And I didn't want unlimited, only pay as you go. I will buy a 2nd one.The phone runs slow after installing things, but you have to download a memory management / memory booster program from the Play store and it runs awesome after that. All the apps I have on my galaxy S3 work on this phone. I plan on buying one for each room in the house to connect to my stereos depending on which room im in. The price was only $55 I can buy 8 or more of these for the price of a Samsung S3. Plus this phone is nicer for me because I have small hands and it fits in my pocket as well. Its probably a little bit bigger than a business card but still heavy enough so you cant drop it by accident like an ipod. The phone I received has 2.6gb of space on it.

I don't need anything fancy for my phone, and I didn't really want the bells and whistles that come from higher end phones, so I thought this would be great. I've never had a problem with my service and or really even the Wifi. But now, the battery has to be charged every other day if not more. I charged it on  a Monday and by Tuesday afternoon, with very little use, it was down to 0. I work at a school and put it on airplane mode during the day. I've been doing that since the beginning of the year, and at first, it really helped to save my battery. I was charging my phone every couple of days. Now, that doesn't really seem to matter. I've tried googling because things I've read saying putting it on airplane mode should save the battery but for now some reason it's not. It also has a tendency to freeze up going between airplane mode and off. This phone freezes up more than any other phone that I've ever had and it's quite annoying. I have to turn it off and on again, which takes a while. It also can't be turned on while it's charging. Also, I'm apparently not able to use my data plan. I have WIFI at my house, and I can get the internet there. But anywhere else that I'm not hooked into the wifi, I cannot use the internet on phone, even if I have service. What's the point of a data plan if I can't use it when wifi is not available?
