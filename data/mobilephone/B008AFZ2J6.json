I paid about $30 more from Amazon vendor to make sure I really get brand new item. But I guess this is as good as it can be. Everything in it seems new. Hope it is at least factory refurb. Still better than the \"BRAND NEW\" s3 I bought from a reputable eBay seller. Had to return it.When I booted this phone up, instruction is in Mandarin. Need my Chinese friend's help to change it to English. I will update this review after I play with it a little bit and check if it is really unlocked. I gave 5 stars because this is an excellent phone. I like it better than iPhone 5 because of Android flexibility with the apps. I bought S2 in the past and can't wait to use this one. Do your research before buying, there are 2 models, I9300 & T999. Choose wisely. ^_^", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Careful which carrier you are using", "Author": "ELSC", "ReviewID": "R1G9GSPVHQLALJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There have been many good reviews of the phone. I will not review the phone but will agree with all others that this is one incredible phone. I will add that I received the UK version - it was printed on the box and instruction booklet. All stickers were intact - \"Do not accept if seal broken\" and manufacturer's seal. The phone also had all its plastic protectors intact, both on the screen and back of phone. Battery was in a taped plastic bag. A point to note is that the SIM card slot uses a push spring mechanism. So you need to push it till it clicks (spring catches). To release push in again and spring will push it out.OK, this is a GSM phone. If you intend to use it on CDMA carriers like Sprint, Verizon, etc. It will not work. Only GSM carriers like AT&T;, T-mobile will work. But a major point to note. For T-mobile their 4G runs on 1700 Mhz band, the phone runs HSPA+ (or 3G/4G) on 1900 Mhz. So if you are on T-mob your high speed internet connections may be spotty ... well, until T-mob refarms all their cell towers to 1900 band. For At&t; , no problems. You get HSPA+ (3G/4G) right away. Similar with Straighttalk prepaid, since they run on AT&T;'s network. We don't know what is T-mob's roadmap on their refarming. But if you want to know whether your area has 1900 coverage go to airportal.de .The phone is super fast when you are able to get on a high speed connection. This one's a quad core Exynos whereas the US version is a dual core Snapdragon.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent purchase but on French.", "Author": "Harold", "ReviewID": "R2DY59OGBDESU9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The cel is excelent.

The phone is very light, super smooth to the touch, and fits in the front pocket of every pants/jeans I own.The only two things I didn't quite like were the bevel on the screen (makes it impossible to have a screen protector that covers all of the glass) and the plastic back cover (it is too thin and light, after a year and a half of having my phone, it has tons of scratches and even a big dent).", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": ":-)  Samsung Gslaxy3", "Author": "michelle85251", "ReviewID": "R2MLYC6BECLKQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an unlocked phone, which required a little additional work.
