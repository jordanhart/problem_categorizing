{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GOOD CHEAP DUAL-SIM CELLPHONE BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE", "Author": "Chaz Souder", "ReviewID": "R1G92DOIZKE5VC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I didn't actually bought this phone from Amazon, but from a local provider. Still, I would like to comment on this cellphone, so it can reach the right customers.PROS:Dual Sim factory-unlocked cellphone.FM Radio.Analogic TV (surprisingly good quality, even with the antenna inside the phone).Flaslight.MP3 player.MicroSD card slot (can take 8gb)Big screen (2.4 inches).Bluetooth.Fast device, overall.Reasonable quality for photos taken with this camera.Reasonable quality for videos in 3gp format.Good quality build (although looks cheap and fragile).CONS:No predictive text input (this means: VERY SLOW text typing).Only 50 sms capacity + 40 each sim (this means, you must continuosly erase old messages to make room for new ones).MP3 and FM radio quality like old AM radio stations (don't expect the quality of more expensive cellphones).I would accept most of the cons, but the lack of memory for SMS and lack of predictive text input is a deal-breaker, at least for me.I hope this can help you decide if this phone is actually for you.Regards.En espa\u00f1ol:En realidad, no compr\u00e9 este tel\u00e9fono de Amazon, sino de un proveedor local. A\u00fan asi quisiera informar mi experiencia, para que llegue a los compradores correctos:A FAVOR:C\u00e9lular liberado de f\u00e1brica, doble sim card.Radio FM.TV anal\u00f3gica (se ve bastante bien, incluso con la antena sin desplegar).Linterna.Reproductor de MP3.Tarjeta de exp\u00e1nsi\u00f3n de memoria (acepta hasta 8GB, quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s).Pantalla grande (2.4 pulgadas).Bluetooth.El tel\u00e9fono es bastante r\u00e1pido, en general.Calidad razonable en fotos y videos, considerando la resoluci\u00f3n de esta c\u00e1mara.Buena calidad f\u00edsica del tel\u00e9fono, aunque parece fr\u00e1gil y barato.EN CONTRA:No tiene texto predictivo (asi que hay que presionar tantas veces comos sea necesario cada letra para que vayan apareciendo las palabras, eso significa que ES LENTO ESCRIBIR con este telefono).S\u00f3lo le caben 50 mensajes de texto + 40 por cada sim card, ello implica que hay que estar borrando continuamente los mensajes guardados.La calidad de la radio FM y de los MP3 es similar a las antiguas radios AM, no esperen el sonido de un celular de gama media, incluso la mayoria de los de gama baja.Yo estaria dispuesto a aceptar la mayoria de las limitaciones de este telefono por tratarse de un telefono auxiliar, menos la falta de texto predictivo y la escasa capacidad de memoria. Eso si es fatal, al menos en mi caso.Espero que esta rese\u00f1a le ayude a decidir si este telefono es realmente para usted.Saludos.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "simple phone, works internationally", "Author": "preschool mom", "ReviewID": "R34VLLZWB3PEYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We needed a \"family phone\" for when the kids go out and should be in contact.

It has snappy speed and the user interface is simple enough that my 12-y.o. went through every feature in less than 5 minutes.  It has great feel even in my adult hands, and is sturdy.  The battery life is great, and the camera is also great when you are in a pinch.

This does make it a lot easier to learn but there is still some difficulty in following the directions from instructions that are printed on a 5x7 piece of paper that folds into a 1 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch sized booklet that fails to explain the use of the phone.

I am disappointed because after I landed I inserted a valid prepaid vodafone SIM and nothing happened.

Good to travel for the dual sim card sense.  As much as this phone has a camera, this does not accept picture messages.  it also does not pull up any addresses from your phone book.
