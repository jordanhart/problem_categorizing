The ergonomics are really good and the set of features hard to beat for the money (android, 3G, wifi, bluetooth, ...).Everything would be great if we had managed to get it working on a T-Mobile network data plan; despite spending hours on the phone with technicians to configure it, we couldn't get it to access the web; we called LG who also couldn't help as this is \"not a US phone\". Buyer beware!!Too bad as this is really a great phone at an attractive price.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for the price!  No 3G access in the US.", "Author": "T. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R344275VQDHGYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As far as the phone itself goes. It's great! It's no Samsung Galaxy or HTC EVO , or whatever high end smartphone you want to name... But it is a great little phone for the price tag. It was received in a non sealed box ( inside the sealed shipping package of course ) .  The battery was fully charged ( not in phone ) and the phone already has Android OS 2.1 installed on it.  Leading me to believe that it's perhaps refurbished or \"pre-prepared\" as you can get these phones like that at some retail stores... But none the less, the phone is scratch free complete with protective film on front back and edges. The phone is quick and lag free even after i loaded it up with apps.  I have no complains on the performance of this phone.** I knew this going in.. but some of you may not have done your research. So let me shed some insight on using this phone in the US. **You have 2 GSM providers to choose from in the US T-Mobile and AT&T; ( all other GSM providers you might find in the US are piggybacking off of the AT&T; or T-Mobile network and use the same 3G frequencies )  -  Both of these providers are using dual bands for their 3g UTMS  frequencies :  AT&T; uses  850Mhz / 1900Mhz  -  and T-Mobile uses 900Mhz / 2100mhz .  This Phone does support these frequencies , but only the BASIC GSM frequencies .  But when you are talking 3g signals, Your unlocked phone needs to have support for both frequencies as UTMS that your US GMS provider requires in order to pick up their 3g signal.  And you can see that this phone only supports UTMS 900/2100 dual. So getting a 3g signal in the US on this phone is simply impossible.  You'll be stuck on 2G/EDGEHOWEVER.....  What this phone is great for , is 3G connection on almost every other continent except for North America. In Europe and Asia this phone will grab a 3g signal the moment you land in the country ( provided you have an active SIM from that country) .  Reason being is because most countries outside of US, Canada and Mexico all have a single UTMS frequency for their 3G.. which is 2100Mhz  ... So Therefore this is a great phone to use while traveling abroad, if you're concerned about getting a 3G connection while your in Japan on vacation for example.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Received open box and now phone is DEAD", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "RSP7B38B9ATM9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this new phone, but received the open Box and the battery was already installed in the phone.

This saved me a hassle to upgrade it on my own.its screen is beautiful, I personally cannot see any difference between this one and iphone, except it is smaller. It is way better than samsung galaxy mini.Battery lasts quite long, I probably charge it twice a week, if I don't use it much.However, its touch screen responds kind of wierdly. It is hard for me to pull down the top info bar down.
