This phone is already two years old, thought is was more recent. The product came new in the box, but no  engraving pen - key chain )came with it.  don't know if I would use it any way, nice thought though.  The picture on Amazon shows a different screen then the one that is on the phone, new phone has a clock  wrist watch looking  when closed. The  phone also requires that you get a DATA PLAN through Verizon wireless. This plan is 29.99 a month, this was very disappointing, THIS SHOULD BE PUT IN WRITING WHEN REQUIRED BUY THE PHONE CARRIER WHEN ADVERTISED. I may not use all the features with this plan, and is a waste of our money in today's economy.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Wi-Fi", "Author": "Jeremy Krall", "ReviewID": "R2WZS0M8CGSW39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just a warning, this phone does not have Wi-Fi as the item description says.

It works just as good as another BB. You don't butt dial. The camera takes some really good pictures. the Downs: There is no wi-fi. the memory is not that much so you will need a SD card. if you want to do BBM you will need to update it yourself. and the ringer is a soft but if you keep playing with the sounds it comes out loud. Other then that my sisters love the phones.

You can only access the internet by using carrier (Verizon) data. Someone should update the product description, although anyone who's looking to make this kind of investment should refer to other sites besides Amazon before making the final determination.  I bought this phone while it was still advertised on Verizon's webpage (it's since been \"retired\"). I wanted a smartphone, but I always liked flip phones because they're compact and they aren't especially noticeable in the pocket. Other than feeling a little too light and not being the most durable phone, I really liked it. It was originally a Sprint phone and I waited for Verizon to pick it up. As soon as they did, I moved on it.  If I recall correctly, it did have a slightly slower processor than its candy bar form factor Blackberry contemporaries, but it wasn't a big deal to me. I only browsed the web with it on occasion, as the interior screen was too small to really enjoy the experience and most websites didn't render quite right on it. It was also a much slower, more drawn-out affair than it is with newer Blackberries, Droids and iDevices, but I expected that.  The LED is huge on this phone so it was very hard not to notice if someone called or texted you, as long as you set the LED properly (installing BeBuzz from the Blackberry market helped, too). This phone is highly-customizable, with long lists of options that can take a long time to really sink your teeth into. If you enjoy getting lost in lists-as I do-Blackberries are the way to go.  One drawback: the front display is not really customizable at all. It will always tell time and your only choice is of what style \"clock\" to display. I think there are only two options. I would've rather set a picture.  One more thing: my phone had a \"corrupt theme,\" which hid some of my icons, confusing the hell out of me. A little research online and I was able to fix the issue myself.  Overall, great phone, if outdated by now.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective", "Author": "docbrown", "ReviewID": "RW8O77XMF45QS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received in good condition.

That could be my voice as they complained  on other phones, too -- I often have a scratchy voice.  When we switched providers to Verizon, this was the only BB flip available, and I loved my old BB Pearl so got these on Amazon.  I figure if one goes kablooie I'll already have another.  I'm ecstatic (except for the voice); it always works, has a timer (which the phone I started out with on Verizon did not have), I can carry all my important book lists in Word and Excel, a few PDFs of important documents, bus routes, etc.  Texting is not as easy as with a full keyboard but I only make a few calls a week and fewer texts.
