Mack \"bluelibra7\"", "ReviewID": "R36OBU7584L3FI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Samsung Moment started as a really great phone, but after a few weeks began having minor technical glitches. Ok, no problem. I've had this experience before with a previous cellphone. Even after having Sprint take a look at the phone, offer me a new replacement, and having to RESET the replacement (due to so many technical errors), I still can not get the phone to operate as consistently and efficiently as it should. It constantly freezes, crashes, dials/hangs up when IT decides it wants to. If the phone is rebooted, it takes WAAY longer than a phone should- four to twenty minutes AND more. Once, it took several hours to get the phone past its opening \"Samsung\" credit!!! This included taking out the battery, letting it have it's moment, putting the battery back in, restart and still...(time passes)...nothing. Repeat.I've talked to other owners of this phone type and they've had the same issues. This phone is FULL of Drama and I would NOT trust it if needed in an emergency. I can only hope that Samsung gets better and never produces another piece-of-crap phone like this.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "What a disappointment...", "Author": "Dann", "ReviewID": "R2PR0J6WM7WXU2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Back in early 2010, I was in the market for a new phone. Doing a bit of research, I came to the conclusion that this was the phone for me. For the first few months, it was amazing! Fast forward to early 2011 and the problems started to show. First, it started suffering from slow-down. Not that much of a problem since I'm not much of a talker anyway. Second, the battery started dying after one day. One day!It's now present day and here's the list of problems I have with this:*Battery dies after one day*Takes too long to start up. At least five minutes.*My unlock pattern NEVER works on the first attempt.*Randomly shuts down, even while the battery is still good enough*Will freeze when I try to answer an incoming call.Definitely avoid this.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Moment", "Author": "haileeee", "ReviewID": "RJOWD9IQZDQWN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It won't download any apps like twitter...instagram..freezes up very often.

But it has become the bane of my existence. DO NOT BUY ONE!I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me. My wife's has been in the shop over and over with charging problems. They have had to solder the connector numerous times and we have gone through a bunch of different chargers.And her phone is way better than mine. My phone will completely lock up periodically with the screen off and no signs of life from any of the buttons. I end up having to pull the battery out and put it back in to get anywhere.There have been times when I power the phone on that it has taken over 15 minutes for it to fully boot up.When I get phone calls and I press the button to pick up the call, at least half the time, it immediately drops the call.If I get a call (or I miss the call) it then takes the phone around 3 minutes before it becomes useable again. So if I miss or drop a call, I then cannot call the person back again for awhile.I have also loaded a task killer utility and I have noticed that there are a bunch of apps that load up into memory any time I get a call (and have to be killed if I want to have any battery life).Thank God my contract is almost up and I can pitch this hunk of junk forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "G.

And the battery life is dreadful.Pros:Keyboard works well and is easy to use.Sync with Gmail, Contacts, and other mail is a nice feature.Camera and video is pretty good... sound on video is bad.Storage space in memory is good.Facebook integration is good if you are plugged into a power chord and on wifi mode.Cons:I often have to repeat myself because the other person on the call can not hear what I have said.You can not hold the phone with your shoulder without pressing 3 6 9 with your check.Forget using the touch screen for automated phone calls... it either double registers or deos not register numbers you type.Will not answer calls... I hit the green button and it continues to ring, i hit the answer area of the touch screen and it continues to ring. I guess this phone is designed like the beepers of old days where you just call people back.What i like to call \"freak out mode\" I see a text has come across and try to pull dropdown to look at it. The screen looks like it is going to do it, then the Icon disappears and it sends me to the lock screen. So I have to start the process over.Warm up period... it takes about 2 minutes to turn on and get through the samsung and sprint screens.The phone actually gets hot to the touch with use... I can only imagine what that is doing to my brain.Navigation kills the battery before it locates you... and if you have just enough battery to get it to work, you are somewhere within a half mile of the location it showsThe phone turns of randomly... In your pocket locked... and there is no power.Phone ringer sometimes decides not to work... ringer at half volume... no noise... ringer at full volume no noise. Check settings and it is deafening.Then we get to the Battery:Battery last about 1 day if not usedBattery last about 2 hours on a phone callBattery last about 3 minutes on data download... yes 3 minutes. Often my battery dies before google search is completed and I am in the website.Battery last about 3 hours on Background DataBattery last about 2 hours on signal roamingBattery cover randomly comes off while in pocket or on a table... battery drops out and  I have to wait 3 minutes to get the phone back on.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hate, hate, hate this phone!!!!", "Author": "WWWBuyer123", "ReviewID": "R23EJBTP32CJO6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a HORRIBLE phone!!!

There is absolutely NO reason this phone should be as horrible as it is when I am not a WiFi user or gamer or video watcher.  Sprint customer service is not helpful either...I want to go tell them to pound sand!  This is what I intend to do once my contract is up in Feb.

I think the first problem was the battery life. Suddenly I was charging it twice a day, it would only hold a charge for 6 hours - and that is without running anything, just making a short occasional call. The biggest problem is that it seems to need to respond to every touch you make. That is, if you open something then change your mind it will still open it. It's like it can't respond as fast as it should. For example I would try to make a call, dial the phone number - but it would freeze for a few seconds then all the sudden it would catch up with what numbers I had pushed. This is a problem if you try to do too much, it will have to shut down all processes. If you do too much the phone shuts off all together. Lately mine won't be able to turn back on for almost an hour, no joke. If I take the battery out to try and reset it - turning back on takes 5 minutes minimum - more like 20 minutes usually. I think the hard drive just can't keep up, it just isn't fast enough. I joke that this phone can do about anything but make a call. The latest annoyance has been the airplane mode randomly turning on and I cannot seem to convince it (no matter how many times I turn it off) that I want it off. This means I can't receive or make calls. Also, lately when texting it will not receive a text while I am writing one. This means if someone texts me while I am texting them it will have to \"end process\" and close the text message function all together. It doesn't save the text as a draft when this happens either. These are but a few of the worst complaints, I am not even listing all of the problems I have had with this phone. I am looking into switching over to a htc hero.

I used to have Blackberry phones and those were nice too. I wasn't all that fond of trying the touch screen but now I like it, though I really wanted to keep the keyboard. So, I tried this phone and fell in love with them. Some people state it is freezing and such. I had a point where it slowed a bit, but I went into settings myself and went through all the options to check for updates on both, and now they are working awesome. Phones need updates, and to only have to update them once in over a year is doing pretty good and easy to do myself without having to look at a book or ask anyone.
