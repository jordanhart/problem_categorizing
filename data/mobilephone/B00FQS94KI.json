I typed *#06# to check if the imei number was blacklisted, but to my surprise it had two imdi numbers available. Then again it is a 2 sim card slot phone for apparently any network. The phone seemed to work fine and made calls using a t-mobile sim card. Well either way, from what I saw while using it for the 10 minutes I was looking through the phone, this phone sims like a good deal since it's network free and runs on android 4.2.2 OS.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Orbit 6200 6.0 inch, 4G HSPA+21MBPS\nCPU: MTK6572A/W 1.2GHZ, 6'' QUD IPS Capacitive multi-touch 960*540 Android 4.2\nDual Sim, Dual Camera: 8.0MP (Auto focus) rear .03MP Front\nGPS, 4GB ROM+512 RAM, Support External TH card of 32GB Max\nQuad band 850/1900/1800/1900 WCDMA 850/1900, Supports MP3/MP4/Bluetooth,Wifi, Dimension 167.25x85.35x9.0mm", "Name": "Maxwest Orbit 6200 Unlocked Android GSM Phone 4g 6'' Screen for At&t, T-mobile,simple Mobile,net 10,lycamobile,h2o Wireless,red Pocket & Ultra Mobile", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dtTr4COrL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FQS94KI"}}
