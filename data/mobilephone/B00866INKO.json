Mac Daddy \"New England Patriot\"", "ReviewID": "R1CQBXLOTAI956", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just posted a review on the s390G tracfone. It's on it's way back to the seller. I had it less than a day, enough said on that, if you read the review, you will see what I am talking about.  Now enter the S425G. I have had a tracfone like this one in the past so I knew what I was getting into, I wanted the triple minutes for life option on a good phone. Texting is very easy on this phone, It has a slide out keyboard which I find is very easy to type on, though I am still partial in my head to a keyboard just being on the face of the phone, this is the next best thing. One different thing with this phone is, if you want to use your head phones to listen to the built in music player that this phone has, you will need an adapter, there is no 3.5mm jack. The adapter is a mini USB to 3.5mm and I have ordered one. The ringer options are good, entering contacts is easy. No Problems there.  Activation  was a breeze, less than five minutes(I moved Minutes and Service from one trafone to another) It has the usual display adjustments, lock screen, screeen brightness, Dialing font sizes. The construction does feel solid. I really wanted to have the triple minutes for life option on a phone. This one, in my opinion was the only decent one tracfone was offering, like I said, I tried the s390g and did not like it at all, again, read the review. The phone comes with 60 service days and 20 minutes of airtime. Now by me taking my minutes and service from one phone to the other, I am good until next May. This phone makes owning a cellphone affordable. I had read somewhere that when you break the cost down, a $19.99 card gives you 90 Service days and 60 minutes (180 Minutes with this phone) and that comes out to something like $6.66 a month for service. When I was in a contract with a well know carrier, my wife and I were winding up with bills like $81.00-$85.00 a month. Not anymore. I reccomend this phone and is the LG900G is ever offered by tracfone and has triple minutes for life, Yes, I will jump to that phone, but they dont and probably wont, so this is the next best thing!", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "Annette \"musiclady\"", "ReviewID": "R2IU2SANLC6OGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had this phone for a few days now, but so far, so good.  I went online and got the pdf manual and am thankful that it is still available.  Do yourself a favor and look it over if you're thinking of getting this phone.  Lots of great features.  It takes a few minutes to learn how to use them all, but it's worth your time. I have downloaded this manual to my laptop for easy off-line reference.There are also numerous tutorials on this phone, which I've also found helpful in a pinch.There are shortcuts to most of the features - again, you have to learn how to use the phone to its optimum level.  Don't get discouraged because you're not familiar with how it works.  Take your time and follow the manual and the tutorials.The voice recognition is great - as is the speaker phone.  Bluetooth works well.Sound is good - texting is a breeze.I've disabled the browser, but be careful.  Even though you've disabled all the java, etc. necessary, if you accidently hit the browser button, it will STILL take off time from your minutes.  I've done this by accident a few times in trying to do something else, but realized it right away, so only got .30 deducted.  But do keep this in mind.The key lock works very well and it's easy to unlock as well.  My other phone would random dial and this doesn't do that at all. All kinds of customization features are available.I've used the Calendar, notepad and task list and it's nice to have these features handy in the phone - keeps me from having to take my tablet with me when a small screen will do.Having a camera on hand is nice.  I was with a friend who wished she had brought her camera and her phone camera isn't very good.  I whipped this out and was able to take a few photos in the moment.  Very nice.I appreciate all the reviews here on Amazon.  I checked here first and picked this phone over the 390G for many reasons.  I like the slide-out keyboard.  I don't want to read email or surf the web on a tiny screen (really - you do that?) or watch videos on a tiny screen.Also, a previous reviewer stated that tracfone minute cards are good for 90 days. NOT TRUE. They are only good for 60 days.  Income AND outgoing texts cost .30 - basically 3 texts per minute.  This is still very reasonable.I had no trouble setting it up and getting my phone number transferred from my 11 year old Nokia 1100 to this phone.  I called the Customer Service folks and told them I would wait while everything got done.  If you do that, it takes mere moments for your phone to be ported and activated.  They didn't want to give me all my minutes from my very old phone (sneaky), and when I told them that was unfair, the CS rep agreed and gave me all my minutes back plus 20 minutes.  Be nice and professional with them and you will have no problem.  I have always been pleasant and patient and have always gotten great service from them.Edited to add:  I just received an email saying the service minutes are good for 90 days, but the Customer Service Rep told me they were only good for 60 days.  So that's where my above comment came from - right from the company.  I specifically asked and she specifically said \"60 days.\"  Time will tell.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "fantastic triple minutes for life TracFone", "Author": "kim-berly", "ReviewID": "R1A2CIV0QW2H58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally got my husband to give up his old cell phone plan when he got a bill for over $100 for going over his minutes.I have the TracFone Samsung T404G and love it. He needed one quickly and didn't want to wait for shipping so I got one off the shelf (they had them where I work and I didn't know it!).I ported his old number and that didn't take but maybe 12 hours. Had to enter some programming codes provided by TracFone. Had to call their automated system to get the right codes and that took less than 5 minutes. And it was up and running.Since I have a very similar phone, I got his set up quickly. He's putting his contact numbers in it and he's learning to text (we're not youngin's) using the keyboard. I love having the slide out keyboard.The TracFone web-site has interactive tutorials and I've got to check out the one to set up the voice recognition and help him with that. I'm very impressed with both our phones and the features they have. I use the alarm clock and he needs the tip calculator (tired of him asking me how much he should leave every time we go out). And it has many other bells and whistles.I have 2 16gb micro sd cards with music on them, so I'll share one with him. I put some of my favorite artwork to use for my wallpaper using the card to help personalize it.A friend loaned me her touch screen smart phone one day and every time the little curly hair around my ear touched it I was disconnected. I held the phone out so far I could barely hear my attorney (it was an important call). I decided I never wanted a touch screen phone and I had to get my own mobile phone and fast!We're both pleased with the Samsung TracFone's we have and highly recommend them.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Olde Guy", "ReviewID": "R3TMCCY66BHZQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all (a longish sad story) I ordered an LG505C Prepaid Phone with Triple Minutes because it is sold under Amazon Prime, which I always look at first. I assumed (stupidly) that Prepaid referred to prepaid minutes, after all, anything you purchase at Amazon is Prepaid, so that was an ambiguous way of listing this phone.  When I discovered that Prepaid did not mean minutes I tried to cancel the order but it was too late and it showed up in two days and Amazon very graciously emailed me a UPS return lable and took it back. (Thanks, Amazon, but please remove the \"Prepaid\" listing from your Prime Cell phones so as not to confuse olde folks like me)My next choice was to select a phone that was actually listed with 1200 minutes on board with triple minutes for life, none of which were Amazon Prime. The three phones listed are sold by shopcelldeals which immediately caused me some pause (sounds like a type of name a sleazy used car dealer would come up with) so I Googled it and found all kinds of horror stories from people who purchased a cell phone sold by shopcelldeals through Amazon. All of these horror stories had to do with Tracfone not honoring the 1200 initial minutes and/or triple minutes for life.  But I took a chance anyway as the price was right (amounting to a free cell phone for the price of a 400 minute trilpled one year card).It arrived USPS two days after I ordered it (great service) and after reading everything very carefully, and with much trepidation, I started the activation process with Tracfone, expecting the worse. The first listed method that I tried was to activate with my computer over the net, which did not work as it asked for the cell phone number, which I, of course, did not have yet. So I went for the next listed procedure which was to phone in over my land line phone. Thankfully, this procedure was voice and keypad automated and I didn't have to talk to someone at a call center in India. Then whattaya know, voila!, in about 5 minutes after hanging up at the end of the session, 495 service days with 1210 minutes magically appeared on my Samsung S425G screen, and I happily have no horror story to add to all of those that I read when I Googled shopcelldeals.As to the phone, it is not a Smartphone, and I didn't expect it to be.  I only want it for making phone calls when I am not at home (not many pay phones around any more), so it is exactly what I wanted it for and for right now I will tentatively give it (and shopcelldeals, in spite of their sleazy name) five stars.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone/great price", "Author": "Mike Hogan", "ReviewID": "R28KN6LQAALRZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase this phone for my teenage son so he could text easier and he is very happy with how easy it is to use.  Can't beat the price.  Got it at Target on sale for $35.99, rolled over minutes from his old TracFone(extremely fast and easy to do online)and in less than 10 min. he was good to go.

If you're like me this phone is for you.I've been using this phone for several months now and I have saved so much more money per month as opposed to when I was with AT&T.; I was paying $50 a month for limited calls and limited texts with them. Now I pay about $15-$20 per month depending on how active I am on my phone in a month.Make sure you use the tracfone discount book to go from 1200 to 1400 minutes.

The only hiccup I experienced during activation happened while porting my phone number due to the fact that AT&T; is cagey about providing GoPhone account numbers.  I have only two minor complaints about the phone: 1) it's far too easy to activate the camera function by brushing against the side button, and 2) I've accidentally \"answered\" the phone a few times when receiving incoming calls with the phone in my pocket.

Better call their technical service and talk to them about thier coverage areas. It'll break the deal. 2 days after set-up, the phone quit and gave an unregistered SIM notice with 1100 minutes remaining.  On-line and technical service calls stated that phone number was unavailable and deactivated. They stated I needed to exchange for a lesser feature non-SIM card phone and buy more minutes to get the service reactivated. What happened to the original 1200 minutes and what number would they apply the newly bought minutes? After two months of continual Tracfone service calls, soft reboots, and intermittent service, I asked for a refund that was declined because 30 days had passed.  My patience was rewarded with them losing my 12yr phone number. Should have stayed Net-10. The second star is for Samsung.
