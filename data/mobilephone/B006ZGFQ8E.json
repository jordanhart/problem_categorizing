After I transferred into it, it worked great at first. But it started to freeze and reboot randomly, ultimately the screen now is frozen partway into the Startup process. You can still hear alerts coming in but with the screen frozen there is no functionality, the factory reset procedure doesn't even work. Fortunately this happened within the 30day return window, I have ordered a replacement and will be returning this one..I don't blame the seller in any way, this seems like nothing more than random software failure.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "98% pleased", "Author": "zachary t scoggin", "ReviewID": "R3EG77F3BKZSBR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone showed up promptly and works perfectly. my only issue was that the speaker cover was missing and the battery cover was scratched but all in all it was in good condition for a refurb", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "ckeene", "ReviewID": "RRIQFYG3FLYMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was everything I was hoping for.
