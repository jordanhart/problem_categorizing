I have to admit I was a little worried at first. I purchased 3 of these phones from this seller and only 1 would register on t-mobile's network. I returned 2 of the phones to the seller and they shipped me 2 more new phones. They worked perfect. Excellent cutomer service, they resolved the problem without any hassels. I would definitely purchase from them again. Thanks!", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy review", "Author": "Maqbool Salam \"ms\"", "ReviewID": "R2RFHPGI0S0BR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This device is phenomenal and is fun to use.

But, when we got the phone we found out it wasn't completely unlocked. We had to do that ourselves. But with all the tools online it was easy to figure out how. So, if it didn't come as advertised, why the 4 stars? The phone quality, the battery life, the product itself is, simply put, excellent quality. As soon as it was unlocked, my husband was able to start customizing it, downloading apps, and making it everything he needed. It's also stood up to the real product testers. Our 4 year old and 2 year old. They have both played with it,dropped it, thrown it, watched their shows, and played games on it and it is still running without a hitch! :)", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S", "Author": "Dani", "ReviewID": "R29PYO7SXOLE2R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the phone about 2 days now. It is pretty much as I expected. I am unable to use some apps because the phone is unlocked, or not rooted- whatever all of that means. I have t-mobile, and it's a t-mobile phone, so I am trying to figure out how to either relock it or reroot it. Otherwise, my only other complaint is that the phone was supposed to have the movie \"inception\" on it, but it's not there. The icon for it is there, but the file cannot be found. So, a bit disappointed that it was removed. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to get another battery, I of course have been playing with the phone alot in the last two days to see what all it can do, and I'm only getting a few hours out of the battery. Over all, I'm happy with my purchase, only 3 minor disappointments.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "A+", "Author": "MIsael", "ReviewID": "R2SZ5WEYWJHGDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came with everything charger battery and even a micro sd card im happy i bought from here has some minor scratches but that's to be expected", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible phone", "Author": "Hicham", "ReviewID": "R38IBMYOQLZTLZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it is horrible phone,sim card slot no good,i had to buy new one,but it still the same problem,also battery does not last long,do not buy it", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Could be better", "Author": "crisjoyc", "ReviewID": "R2Q8DV9D6PL4KU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone used so I cant really say too much but this phone froze up on me several times.  also, the camera is not as good as I thought it would be.
