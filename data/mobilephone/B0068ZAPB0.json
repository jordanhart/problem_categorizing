{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some things you need to know about this phone", "Author": "Amanda Hacking", "ReviewID": "R38AYSLOI6GLTS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about two weeks. You need to know some things.1. It is made out of cheap plastic. Not like the older Nokia phones. This one is very lightweight. Because of the cheap plastic construction, there is a sharp edge right where you put your ear. Not very comfortable at all, and not very good for long calls.2. Getting the back of the phone off to put in your battery and SIM is very hard to do. The picture is totally wrong. The only way to get the back of the phone off is to turn the phone face up, use both thumbs, and slide the phone up off it. The instruction diagram tells you to do it facedown. I've never been able to do it that way.3. The menu system. Even though the screen is bright and easy to read, getting to your inbox takes too many extra steps. Same with punctuation. You have to go through about five menus to use a '?'.Now for the good things. The screen is bright and colorful. The buttons are about as easy to push as you can get. The volume on the mic and the speaker is very good. So the sound quality is good. This is an alright basic phone, but there may be other better ones out there. If you use your phone mainly for text messages, this one is a pain because of extra steps. If you use your phone mainly for talking, this one is a pain because of the hard plastic edge where you're resting your ear. But the phone does come with a nice earpiece if you can use that.Battery life is very good.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Small Phone", "Author": "TS", "ReviewID": "R1HKT9ROFZ4NPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone so I could have a cheap phone while traveling abroad. It does everything I need (call, text, alarm, basic phone stuff).  This is a dual band phone (900/1800).  I think another reviewer is confused about what dual band means and gave this a bad review because of it, but like I said this is a great phone. This phone will work in places like Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and some of South America, but WILL NOT work in the US. If you want a phone that will work in the US you need one that is dual band (850/1900) or a quad band phone.  About the phone:Pros:- KEY PAD/TEXTING- the keypad is very nice. They keys are spaced out very well so it is very easy to text and dial numbers on this phone, unlike some other small phones.  The keys are rubber, which worried me a little before I got the phone, but it is a very hard rubber, so the keys are very easy to push. Texting is good on the phone, The phone has T9 and as I said it is easy to type on this phone.- SOUND QUALITY- The sound quality is very good for a cheap phone like this.  Speaker is very loud and it is easy to hear other people.- Battery Life- Battery life lasts a long time.- FLASHLIGHT- Nice FlashlightCons: There are only a few things that you could count as cons, none of them really bother me or affect me, but some people might have a problem with it. But none of them are really a big deal- Phone is light- the phone is pretty light, some could say too light, but I don't think it matters because it performs well.- NO SD card slot- No volume buttons- No external volume buttons, must change in the menu of the phone- again, not a big deal for a good phone this cheap.Overall great basic phone for very cheap, will definitely get the job Done.  Also just a forewarning, this comes with a European plug with an American adapter, so plan ahead if you're not going to Europe.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Here's what I got.....", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R278RUT56S5Q4W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There seems to be some confusion this product. Here's what I got when I ordered it: an unlocked GSM 850/1900 dual band phone. In retrospect, EXACTLY what the product description says if you look closely. Unfortunately, I looked more closely at the comment that says it is an 900/1800 phone, which is what I wanted but not what I got (or what I, dummy, ordered). Oh well, my bad.NET for you -- this is NOT the phone for Europe and Africa, but will serve you well in much of the Americas. Google \"GSM bands\" and figure out what you need. I concur quad-band is the way to go for a global traveler (or a confused purchaser with some extra cash), and BTW dual SIM is a nice to have, too. This one pretends to be neither but would have been perfect for my needs if I hadn't got my dual bands cross-threaded.As for the Nokia 100/101 line -- I don't know what some people are sniveling about. I'm a huge fan of them for traveling in the fringe of the world like I do, it is a very compact, nearly indestructible little workhorse of a phone with good signal, huge runtime, and a flashlight. Very few features, but very high quality for those features that it does have.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap and very light-weight phone", "Author": "Booklover", "ReviewID": "R33G1AGVC60GNU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nokia 100 is a cheap, slim and very light-weight plastic phone: a phone with a radio, that's it, no frills. It has two problems, therefore I deduct one star:1) At first, you will find it rather difficult to open, but there are several handy videos on Youtube that can show you how it's done. Once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.2) Alas, the Nokia 100 model has the same problem as other Nokia phones: if there are any numbers that appear twice, for example once on the sim-card and once in the built-in memory of the phone itself; or under two different names in the same address book, then the name of the contact is not shown, only the caller's number. The solution is to make sure that each number appears once and only once in the address book, and to delete all duplicate numbers from phone and sim (it's a good idea to make a back-up first).What a pity that Nokia has still not solved this well-known problem by updating its software!", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Few Things You Should Know Prior To Purchasing:", "Author": "A Wondering Dawn \"A Wondering Dawn\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z71UFSW3F5NF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased three of these phones for my three foster kids for Christmas. I wanted an affordable 'real' phone that could basically be used as a toy. These were cheaper than some actual toy phones- so I couldn't pass them up. They come in a very small box- about 4 inches by 4 inches by 3 inches in size (I'm literally not exaggerating). It comes with a battery and a headphone set as well as three different sets of directions (in about fifty languages- perfect if your main language is something other than English).What I didn't realize prior to buying the phone is that you need a SIM card in order to do anything on it. The second you turn on the phone it asks you to put in an SIM card (which is not included with the phone). The only thing you can do without it is a demo- which is three games and two ringtones. That's it. Needless to say we are now buying SIM cards.Another very complicated feature of this phone is inserting the battery. It was nearly impossible to get the back open. I mean for the first three hours we thought we had bought duds. Every way we tried to open it, it wouldn't budge. Finally I looked up a video of 'How to open battery case for Nokia 100' on Youtube. The video had 17,000 likes- just to give you an idea of how many people have this problem. It's hard to explain what the video did- but if you're having issues now you know how to get the answer.The phone itself is made of a very cheap plastic. Light-weight. I actually find this better than the big heavy bulky phones everyone has now. It's small. Easily fits in a pocket. Great for traveling (or kids- like mine were for). It's simple to use. I think it's targeted for use with people who aren't technically-inclined. It's very simple. There aren't a ridiculous amount of features. There isn't a camera. All of the features are very basic- very easy to use- very user friendly.At the moment there are two things we can't figure out how to use. The first being the flashlight. It's obvious that there is a flashlight- you can see the bulb on the top of the phone. But I think you may need a SIM card to access it. The second thing is the volume. Even when we turn the volume up and down- it has no effect on actually how loud the speakers send the sound. It's always fairly loud (almost too loud). We've created a new rule for headphones being required with a phone- because the speakers themselves are so ridiculously loud. With this being said, it makes a great phone for elderly people because of it's ease of use and very loud sound quality.There are two very basic ringtones. They are cute little tones. Nothing out of the ordinary of what you would find preloaded on a cell phone. The games include Solitaire, a little action game, and one other puzzle game. They are a bit hard for my kids. They are ages 7, 8, and 10- but they're slowly figuring them out. They enjoy finding different aspects of the phone. And it's design is easy enough for them to use.As for phone calls- we have not yet tried that aspect. The kids did (ugh- humiliate me) call 911 because that's the only number they could get through on. Obviously we had no stressed the importance of NOT using that number (we'd put so much effort into telling them how to use it that we never thought that we should tell them not to dial it). The speaker and microphone worked flawlessly on the phone. It does work for emergencies. It uses a satellite for 911- not an antenna. This is really unique because you can use it no matter where you are (even out of cell range) and it will contact help in emergencies.  So as far as that is concerned- that is a huge plus. It actually makes me feel good to know that the kids will be able to get ahold of an operator no matter where they are. And my home is actually out of cell range- we use a home phone, so that is pretty much all the more proof I needed that they use a satellite for 911.So for the basics of the phone here are the positives:-Satellite (not cell service) use for 911 calls.-Easy to use-Good microphone and speaker quality-Light-weight and compact-Plastic stays clean easilyThe negatives are:-Very hard to access battery-Will not work without a SIM card-Made of cheap 'easy to break' plastic", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Caller name doesn't show", "Author": "Hoang Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1HTTJM2BVI865", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It works well and the battery runs very long.

The box says that is it actually a locked phone instead of unlocked like advertised. The seller could not give me a answer on this either.
