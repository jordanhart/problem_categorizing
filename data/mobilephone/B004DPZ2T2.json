It was fine when I first bought it, but since software upgrades, the phone has deteriorated to the point that I am replacing it. The space bar places periods whenever and wherever and key touches duplicate and triplicate entries when texting and emailing. I restored the phone to factory settings and changed the input settings - nothing helped.I contacted RIM and they aren't interested in helping; needless to say, my replacement won't be a BlackBerry - now or ever. For over $400 you'd think RIM would care. Plus, the phone was sold without a warranty. All around it was a terrible purchase. Read the blogs before you buy this phone - actually any phone. This problem is the norm for this phone and it's quite disappointing that RIM hasn't found a solution.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad Product", "Author": "Vanesa", "ReviewID": "R3B5POKD1FFSSH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Este telefono parece remafacturado, refusbished!! le faltaron accesorios y la caja donde tiene la etiqueta no concuerda el pin del telefono!!!
