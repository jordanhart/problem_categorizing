I've had an iPhone 3.x and 4.x and the Nokia 900 over the past few years... and I really like each one of those phones.  But, the Nokia 920 blows them all away!  It feels solid in your hand.  The screen is crisp and clear to read... even outside.  The price point is absolutely unbelievable!  The camera takes fantastic pictures!  Wireless charging is something you won't be able to live without after you get it!  I went for the Yellow 920 and I couldn't be happier.  I love the glossy finish! Aside from feeling solid, it just feels nice to the touch!  I'm very happy I didn't choose an extra row of icons, never mind the extra cost (the iPhone 5) over the Nokia 920!  If you been considering going with a Windows Phone, you just need to go do it!

So I decided to get the 920, and I am thrilled with it.  It comes in some gorgeous colors (bright yellow!), and it has such a beautiful and sleek form factor that I'm loathe to put it in a case (hence my blue Lumia 900's vulnerability to drops). It gets excited looks and questions wherever I go.  Last week I took it out during a meeting with about 15 of our marketing folks (predominantly young guys), and it ended up getting passed around the room with lots of positive chatter - until the conversation turned to apps.  I agree, it has most of the apps I want, but not all of the ones that I used consistently on my iPhone, and that has been the downfall of Nokia phones in recent history.The marketing campaign for the 900 was all about how everyone had been a smartphone beta tester, and this was the real deal. Followed closely by a software glitch bad enough that Nokia then gave a credit to everyone who bought a subsidized phone that made the phone FREE. I'm sad to say there are still some big problems with the Lumia line. This Lumia has had some rebooting issues, the short battery life is still a big letdown (you are running on vapors by the end of every day), and it's hefty. It fits in a pocket, but you really feel it, especially if you sit down.  All in all, however, I do love this phone and I love having something that not everyone else has.PROS*Form Factor: it's different, and gorgeous, and a conversation starter.  People want it, or want to try it.*Camera: It has a great 8.7 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization (Carl Zeiss, as always with Nokia) and takes good images even inside my house even with curtains drawn.  Sharp.*Screen: 4.5 inch screen with gorilla glass, stunningly sharp 1280 x 760 resolution and blur reduction.  It is also impressively sensitive.  Nokia is based in Finland, and they have 10 months of cold. Nokia engineers have been very motivated to make a phone that can be used while wearing gloves.*Operating System: The Windows operating system features bold, bright colors, animated images, and a very intuitive and easy interface.  I try to restrict my conversations with friends because inevitably people ask to play with the pretty interface and seem to have no qualms about opening my personal email, work email, and texts. I'm still not sure how much I like it that this phone is so attractive and attracting that it makes people forget boundaries.*Responsiveness: Superb. It has a dual-core processor, but it's optimized to run smoothly on slower chips. 60 fps screen refresh rate. It's zippy in most everything you do. 4G/LTE supported.*Maps: best in the business, and Nokia Drive is awesome. I used the 920 when I was in Chicago and it got me where I wanted to go via buses (I know, I'm cheap) every day with no issues (bus times, stop locations, etc).*Some sweet extras: wireless charging and near field communication. And they finally give you a way to resize your tiles, a lack that annoyed me with the 900. Also interfaces with my Xbox 360. I still can't set up my TV programs to record (via my cable provider) like I could with my iPhone however.*Sound: one of the things that seems improved - music quality is not bad if I forget my headphones and I can carry on business calls via speaker.*Price: a LOT cheaper than an iPhone.CONS*Size: heavy, big in your pocket and just slightly too big to be comfortable in your hand.*Battery: you know that sinking feeling you get when you have a low battery warning at the end of the day and there is something important you have to do with the phone that you may not be able to if you can't get to a charger. Yes, it's a jaw-droppingly beautiful display, but this is the result.*Operating System: Still some glitches. Nokia did spit out the Lumia line pretty quickly after the partnership with Microsoft was inked, and they are still on an aggressive timeline.  The company is in trouble, and clearly is trying to strike the balance between getting this phone into people's hands while still maintaining quality.*My plea to Nokia: I want to see the time/date and notifications without activating the phone. I loved the N9 for that.  Please bring that functionality to Lumia.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brilliant", "Author": "Tos", "ReviewID": "R2U0K3BM4A9WSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing phone, but the yellow stole my heart.  The Windows phones seem to be leading the way when it comes to color, and why not?  They are special and unique phones, why shouldn't they stand out?  Of all the flavors of 920 you can get, the Yellow is the stand out.Back to the phone.  By now you've heard about how great the case is.  I really like the curve that molds the phone to my hand.  I'm torn though.  The case is strong enough to keep as is, but can I afford to see my yellow phone scuffed?  Torn.  If I get a skin, it will be clear.What an OS.  The Windows Phone 7 OS was innovative, fast and a breeze to use.  The 920 is in all ways even better.  No matter the OS you come from, you will love Windows 8.

It is gorgeous, bright and crisp!Windows Phone 8 makes the 920 look even better with all the tiles in the Home Screen. Your home screen isn't just a screen with static icons anymore! Yes, you might not find some of your favorite apps if you are moving from iPhone, but if you are looking for something new, fresh and something that reflects YOU, then you should try Windows Phone. Lumia 920 is a great device to give that chance.Camera is another feature that you will love! Cinmeagraph is fun! And the photo quality is great!I did notice few issues with battery and Bluetooth usage. There are also some reports of constant reboots in the Nokia forums, but I haven't experienced those. Nokia Drive Beta app is the culprit that drains your battery like anything! But hey, its a beta app and I think it is expected. With regards to Bluetooth, sometimes it will not connect to my car's Bluetooth. Will have to switch off and switch on Bluetooth to make it work. Just to be clear that these issues might very well be related to the OS and Nokia can fix it with an update.It does not have a SD card extension but hey you get a massive 32GB storage!

I was in the market for an upgrade. Judging from past experiences and researching and reading reviews...I knew I didn't want another iPhone, as many have said not much innovation thru the years(my Nokia N81 had video calling 6yrs ago even thou no carriers in the USA provided the service)yes some tweaks here and there, yes they are lighter but most definitely more fragile. I see many people walking around with cracked screens especially iPhones and galaxy 3s, the one great thing about the iPhone 3GS was it's build and quality it can take a beating and not break.I was very close to purchasing a galaxy 3 nice looking screen good sound better than iphone 5 in my opnion, but something about the build didn't quite convince me so I decided to wait for the Nokia Lumia 920 and check it out (wasn't ever interested in Samsungs Note 2, way to large). I'm glad I waited for the 920 It feels like a premium device it reminds me of the iPhone 3GS great quality, the screen is beautiful, the color options are great(got a yellow one), Windows 8 OS works great for me the live tiles are a breath of fresh air you run you finger along the screen everything has a smooth feel, great speakers, the Nokia apps are great Nokia music pretty much unlimited music, Nokia city lens is an innovative app, Nokia offline GPS app and on are all free. NFC, Yes finally wireless charging, I lost count of how many chargers I've purchased for my Iphone. Last but not least...the camera it's awesome in dark light conditions its like magic you can't believe it, and it shoots great videos as well with image stabilization...having kids this phone is great don't have to worry about carrying a separate camera.Some people say the 920 might be on the hefty side, but if you put a case on your phone the weight is about the same, the 920 doesn't need a case checkout the YouTube videos out there.The App Store doesn't have nearly as many apps available that you can get on a iPhone or Android stores, but I have most of what I need. The OS is new so more apps will be available soon, I can see the difference in the month I've had the device they've multiplied.Some minor things might need to be tweaked with the OS, but I've been getting updates which is good, they seem to be addressing the issues.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "LarsBars", "ReviewID": "R2789RWD7LQATD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone has a really great screen, with currently the highest resolution available on any Windows Phone, (and quite high for any phone).

The battery life is great the phone runs lean so it doesn't run the battery down.  The screen is beautiful to look at and use. I live in the northeast so it is getting cold and I love that you can use the touch screen while using regular gloves. The colors coming out of that screen are beautiful and vibrant.The phone is very fast and responsive so it has no problem running the new Windows 8 that it comes with. The camera is very nice and it takes some really nice pictures even in dim light. Voice calls are the clearest and the most noise free I have heard on any smartphone that I have owned so far. The outer shell of the phone is very strong and tough although it is a bit slippery for me at times since I picked the Yellow one. I got it while the offer for the free NFC wireless charger was offered so I have that as an accessory and it is really neat. Like that I can just lay the phone onto the wireless charger and not have to mess with the tiny USB connector for the regular wall charger. The wireless charger seems to take  little longer than the wall charger. Overall Nokia has done a good job at the phone design like they have in the past.  I owned a Nokia 5160 and that bad boy was heavy but tough as nails. The Lumia 920 reminds me of that toughness.Now what I don't like about the phone is the lack of features and setting in the software. Yes the Windows 8 tiles interface is easy to navigate and figure out. Yes you can move the tiles around and \"customize\" where your tiles are on the screen. Yes you can \"pin\" things and apps to your main screen.  What you can't do is really customize the phone to be \"for each of us\" like Microsoft advertises.  You can add special ringtones for your calls but you can't do the same for anything else.  You are stuck with the boring and not as loud notification tones setup by Microsoft and Nokia. There is no notification led light on the phone for missed calls either.  I could have said that during while I was talking about the hardware but since everything is controlled by software they could have used the software to control some of the navigation lights that are present in the front to notify you that there was a missed call or a message waiting for you - perhaps light up the \"windows logo\" light to a constant pulse. You can't change the phone's system fonts or much of anything else that you could think of.  I am sorry if it may seems petty but if the phone's operating system is advertised to be \"for the each of us\" that means customization to the max and I don't see it in the Windows phone 8 OS. Add more customization to your OS Microsoft, please, \"for each of us\".SB", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone, Everyday a new feature discovered.", "Author": "Anon", "ReviewID": "R3POTZOII3GBSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been the best phone I've ever owned. Previous smartphone use was an iphone4, which is a good phone, but it is boring and stagnant by comparison. I was going to get an iphone5, but think Apple flopped big time on that one and decided to venture into the uncharted windows waters. I am glad I did. The live tiles are very cool, the camera on this phone takes stellar night photos and video, and the customization makes it very cool. Being able to pin tiles to the start screen of the people you contact most is awesome - 1 click and you get a screen where you can text/email/call with just one more click.The voice activated function works pretty well and the speech recognition is good, especially with microsoft's translator app which is very cool (text and voice translations).Nokia music rocks as well, you can download upto 4 music collections to use offline and they have very good songs in every collection I've checked out.Phone feels very solid and the yellow color is a stunner. Screen is bright and vibrant, especially compared to the iphone.I really like how the e-mail syncs and the way texts look with a black background and white writing.Battery has to be seasoned in order to work properly - charge to 100%, drain till it turns itself off, charge up to 100%, drain again, then charge back up and you should get full use of the battery. Pretty much everyone is doing this and it is no big deal.Highly recommend this one.

Unfortunately, people in the US don't know Nokia well. In my opinion, a smartphone should be a good \"phone\" first and that's what Iphone and Galaxy are NOT. Their sound quality litterally sucks. If you are in a very noisy area, your Iphone or your Galaxy are useless. You should leave the place and go to a more quite place. Nokia has sophisticated noise reduction algorithms and gives you a very clear sound qulity in every environment.If you haven't had a high quality phone before you won't realize what you are missing. Exactly like driving a Luxary car comparing to a Kia. If you have never used a good car, you will be okay with your Kia or Ford. Their noise doesn't bother you. their poor suspension system doesn't bother you, their uncomfortable seat doesn't bother you. However, if you drive a good car for a while you know how bad those cars are. My wife bought an Iphone and returned it in two weeks and I totally agreed with her that the sound quality of the Iphone was horrible.It doesn't end there. This phone has the best quality camera, its display is amazing. The Microsoft live tile is very creative idea. The user interface is simply the best. It's beautiful and smooth. In fact iOS 7 is copying lots of things from Windows Phone. Apple always said they would never make a phone with bigger screens however, their next Iphone will have a 5\" display. Put a Nokia Lumia 920 next to an Iphone and you will see how outdated the Iphone looks. All these things mean that Apple is so behind the technology/design now.As of applications, there hasn't been anything that we missed in Windows Phone store.

This phone also has pretty good data compression, it consumes only 60% of your data compared to other phone consuming 100% for the same media content.Audio quality is top notch and this is the only phone which has Dolby Mobile with Free Nokia Music the phone has gone to the another level.Wireless charging is another feature which innovative and very useful forget about search for jack in the night just keep your phone on top of the plate it makes its wonders.My phone has two days of battery life with reasonable usage which I am really happy about.

There is a small key you use to pop the latch to open the sim card slot. It is extremely difficult to make this work correctly. A google search will show that this is a common issue, and I hope Nokia has moved to address it in subsequent models.The phone is MUCH larger than my last one, but I waited 3 years to get a new one so that's not a surprise. I found it fairly easy to adapt to the new size. The screen size is great - I can actually surf with this one - and the touch screen is pretty responsive as well. The onscreen keyboard is easy to use.  For base functionality, it's great.I find that the camera is excellent for portraits. I brought the phone to the beach when I took my granddaughters and got some extremely nice pictures - good enough to print and display.

The camera is great, and was the best at release, which is what really drew me in to this product. HTC has since caught up and Nokia has blown by the competition once again with the Lumia 1020, but the camera on the 920 is still really solid and performs better than any Galaxy or iPhone (I've tested it myself, but there are plenty of comparisons around the internet).Now I feel it necessary to say I've been pretty firmly ingrained in Microsoft's ecosystem for some time, even before I got this phone, so switching from my buggy Samsung wasn't hard at all for me. I use Outlook, Skydrive, Xbox, Skype... you name the Microsoft product and I probably already used it. Still, the mail app works well with any domain (I've got a couple Gmail accounts synced to me phone, too) and if you don't already use SkyDrive, making the switch is as easy as copy and pasting from Dropbox.There are only a few \"must have\" apps still missing from the Windows Phone marketplace, but if the missing service is sufficiently popular there will almost always be a third party alternative to an official app (like with Instagram) so from my point of view the Windows Phone marketplace is just fine. I never try to find an app and come up empty handed, is what I'm saying. I'm sure there are some rare and specific apps that are missing and you absolutely MUST buy an iPhone, but for a casual user Windows Phone should be just fine.And even if there is something missing from Windows Phone that you'll miss (I admit there were a couple Android apps I was sorry to leave behind), there are so many great features built into the OS that make it by far my favorite. The People Hub is a great way to sort out contacts and make your social feeds more accessible, and you can make it so Facebook messages feed into the texting app, making conversations with your friends a bit more streamlined (and allowing you to easily converse over wifi). There are lots of other cool Windows Phone exclusive features that are worth checking out, but, you know, you have Google (or Bing, I guess). The fact that it never ever crashes is also great, though I hear since I ditched Android it's become more stable.I mentioned the camera earlier, but that's not the only great thing about the hardware. The screen is fantastic. It doesn't have the highest resolution ever, but it's still plenty HD and at normal viewing distances it looks perfect. It can be read in bright sunlight, with or without sunglasses. Super sensitive touch means you can use it with gloves, which would be great if I didn't live in Texas, I'm sure. Nokia's build quality is famous, and this phone is no exception. I've dropped it on concrete several times now, and nothing beyond a dent on the corner has marred my phone. I'd say it's invincible, but I imagine if you dropped it face first it might still shatter. It feels great in the hand thanks to the pleasant glossy material (it kind of sticks to my hands, which makes it slip resistant and also kind of icky, so you may want to get a black or blue one, because they have a different finish) and the curved screen is just really nice aesthetically and in terms of touch.In the end, if you're new to the smartphone scape, I wholeheartedly suggest getting a Windows Phone (preferably a Nokia). If you currently use another phone OS (iPhone, Android, Blackberry etc.) then you should give Windows Phone a careful look. It offers many things that other operating systems don't, and the only hardware manufacturer that gives Nokia a run for its money is HTC.I'm glad I made the switch.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best Windows Phone 8 with AT&T;!", "Author": "Pamela", "ReviewID": "R11ZM1HDXDD9QT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So you know where I am coming from in regards to my review, I upgraded from a HTC Titan so, to say the least, there is improvements in practically every phone feature for me.The camera is stellar, it takes great 1080p video, and it can focus and take pictures in low-light. The auto-focus is fast.

People are now telling me that they can hear me a lot better than before. The LTE data speeds are phenomenal. The phone itself is faster and moves through applications a lot quicker.I like the feel of the phone, it rests better in my hand because of the curved back.

I've gone from reading text email on the phone with just a little web browsing, to reading almost all email on the phone - cuz it's that fast and readable.The GPS and other sensors are almost instant. This a core part of Nokia's business, and it shows.I've just begun to delve into the camera - so far it certainly is sharp and clear, and can take  shots in very low light - without the fuzz of my previous phone, and high-end point & shoot camera.Windows Phone 8 is so much better than 7 / 7.5 (which was really good) - added functions and customize-ability is better than anything else out there - Some apps still need to catch up - Live Tiles just need the imagination and code from a good programmer and add so much to what the phone can do. The apps that use them well make notification, updates, and status so easy.Oh, and the wireless charging pad really makes it easy to keep the phone charged at my desk - just by setting it down between uses.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Windows Phone as of early 2013", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R207QUGROKW03N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "nokia 920", "Author": "vuudoo", "ReviewID": "R22D618JJA6KH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Look nice,good LCD screen,easy to use,it just window phone not popular any more,Nokia may out business but still a nice phone", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "For a free phone with contract", "Author": "C.

They really have so many years of experience with different technologies, so when it comes to phones, they might know little bit more than all others. The fact that they've though of little details like using Lumia 920's screen with gloves on, pure-black screen settings etc. just gives them so many extra points in this smartphone war.I'm coming from iPhone 5. Which is a great piece of technology as well, but Nokia has something that makes it very friendly and fun to use. Combined with Windows Phone OS, the hardware and software are one piece of tech. A lot of phones suffer from marketing junk that is being added to the phone, cheap materials, inconsistency and just a lot of ugly little add ons that doesn't make it fun to use their products.Nokia Lumia 920 is beautiful. The bright yellow color makes it stand out. The fact that you only touch one setting of theme, and the whole phone changes to that shade is very smart and unique detail. Sure in Android you can add on 100 widgets (which will drain your battery faster and faster) but they're all inconsistent, look like they were made by a 5-year old and just add on nothing more than annoyance.App store is far behind Apple's iOS and Google's Play, which is the only thing that makes you go \"ohhhhh!\" with a sad face. It is slowly growing, but it will take sometime for a lot of different apps to do same thing I might want to do on iPhone or Nexus phones.What makes this phone amazing:-design-the way it fits into your hand-pure integration of software with hardware-a lot of user experience surprises that makes you wanna use the phone more and more-screen technology-camera lens-durability and recyclability-UI (user interface) is just like nothing out there-most important apps are there (not all)-originality and colorWhat can be improved:-faster update cycle and little bug fixes-more accessories and headphones-Bluetooth 4.0-more Nokia integration into their technology and services-top 10,000 apps and games must be available across all smartphone platforms.This one is for museums.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone poor apps", "Author": "Hank Seifert", "ReviewID": "R17HO2RXRHNONA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Rock solid phone with great camera.

Until recently, it was my only experience with a smartphone. I wanted something more reliable, less app force-closes, better build quality. I was fine with the smaller app market. All I do with my phone is browse the web ,(mostly p**n), listen to music, driving navigation, and read books. You don't need millions of apps to accomplish that.When the Lumia 920 came out, I knew it would be my next phone.It had everything I wanted, there was great videos on youtube of people TORTURING this thing and it coming out relatively unscathed. Great!When my existing contract went out, I grabbed one. The Lumia 920 lived up to all my expecations. I loved the feel of it in my hand. I loved the gorgeous screen and silky animations, the rock solid stability of apps and the long battery life while not sacrificing 4g.Today I dropped my phone from 2 feet off a desk. It slipped from my hand. The smooth texture of the yellow phone probably didn't help in this matter. I'm aware that black and cyan are a textured finish, but I wanted yellow, dangit.The screen was absolutely DESTROYED. This phone is less than a month old.I am also disappointed in other aspects of of the build quality in this phone.I'm in the military, and not always in the cleanest environments. I keep the phone carefully in my pocket with no other objects and never lay it on its screen. Nevertheless, it had picked up several scratches on the screen visible by angling it in good light. Of course I can't see them anymore, since there are so many cracks and fissures on the screen. I am not always in a spotless environment, and by resting the phone on desks or tables with small amounts of dirt, the plastic casing has manged to pick up pock mark holes all over. I have two larger areas with deeper scratches, from what, I don't know.The Lumia 920 was an absolute joy for me to use. I am now deeply disappointed in the build quality and will not be replacing it with another. In a bitter kind of way, I half believe that Nokia initially released a higher quality Lumia 920, and it was eventually ramped down to the fragile blossom of a phone that I am now stuck with.tl;drIf there are any people out there considering this phone, please just take this away from my misfortune. The build quality is NOT BETTER than any other average smartphone out there. Don't consider this as a point in the Lumia 920s favor when shopping for your next phone that you want to keep for 2 years. Other reviews similar to mine are NOT an outlier and it COULD happen to you. Please buy yourself a case or insurance or just get a better quality phone.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Bluetooth Keyboards Support & Poor UX", "Author": "Joaquin Menchaca", "ReviewID": "R16E1JGHNJEJOR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will try to keep this short, I found that this phone (and all Win8 Phones) do not support Bluetooth keyboards.  I wanted to have a mini keyboard to use this to type some notes, as it has Office and OneNote.  Both Nokia and AT&T; hide this little known fact that all keyboards are not supported with Bluetooth, as Microsoft deemed it not important I suppose.  I talked with folks at Microsoft Store, and they told me that users are just suppose to browse or touch up documents, not really create new content on the phone.There are numerous other problems (I'm sure cited by other users), and the many applications one would expect to be commonplace, either don't exist or have really flawed implementations, such as having a lot of UX design flaws and huge missing functionality.  The list is so huge, I could write a book.  One that stood out is using e-mail:  You have to configure a new  application per email (yahoo, gmail, etc.) and so it isn't integrated into one app.  Additionally, you can ONLY have one application per type of account, so if you had two Yahoo accounts (one for spam, one for friends, etc.) then you can only choose one of them.  Thus the Yahoo email app only works with one Yahoo account.So while other systems allow you to browse all your e-mail through a single application, Microsoft forces you to use a single application per e-mail account, and only one of the same account.  Essentially, Microsoft violates the path of least surprise (using what we know to work well), has poor implementation with major gaps that lack functionality, and poor user interface and experience to boot across the board, especially in e-mail.Combine this the fact that you cannot use bluetooth keyboards (or other HID devices like joysticks) despite advertising bluetooth is support (and how they all sort of hide the fact from users), this leaves a very distasteful experience...", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 920, Yellow 32GB (AT&T;)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00A2V7ULY"}}
