Tracfone has been a perfect phone for this level of use. 1 year service is around $100 and you can roll over unused minutes year to year. The minutes do not expire as long as the service is extended before the expiration date. I purchased a LG800G phone to replace an 6 year old phone that stopped working.  In the past I purchased the phone without the 1 year service, and will be purchasing 1 year service separately. But buying the phone and the minutes together is a great deal - better rate for the minutes plus the phone has fresh batteries (the model did not change since the one I purchased a year ago).\u2714 To transfer the old number and minutes--------------------------------------------1. Before activating and transferring the old phone number and left over minutes, the new phone needs to be charged.2. You can activate the phone on-line (if you have an on-line account with Tracfone AND if your old phone is operational). To do so go to Tracfone home page and choose \"Activate Phone\" link at the top of the home screen, and then selecting \"Transfer my number and service from one TracFone to another\". Since the old phone was not working I called the service representative 1-800-867-7183.3. To do the transfer you will need the IMEI number (also known as the serial number) of the old phone, the SIM card number of the old phone, and the old phone number. You will also need the serial number of the new phone which is printed on your activation card.4. I had no issues getting full credit for all the old minutes. To activate the phone the operator had to give me five long series of numbers and even though the call center was in India I had no trouble understanding the accent and found the operator pleasant and easy to work with. The first procedure she performed gave me credit for half of the minutes on the old phone, and then without me having to ask she said she needed to do several more steps to get me the balance of minutes. I had to turn off and turn on the phone twice to see minutes added in two steps.5. The software version I received on the phone purchased in February 2013 is V10e. The older version of the software had problems (specifically version V10d).You can check what version of the software you have by clicking on a blue square with 4 dots on the main screen. Then tapping on the following: Settings - Phone - scroll down to Information - Device Information - S/W version.If you have V10e or later you are all set. If you have V10d you have an older problematic version and should upgrade.I went to LG web site, found support page, and entered 800G. I found a page where there are steps to install software that performs an upgrade for the the phone. The instructions say \"If your phone needs to upgrade, the \"Start Updating \" button will be enabled.I did not test this because my phone is on the latest version already, but I wanted to see if LG had a page for updates and I found it. Amazon does not allow posting of external URL, but you can find it by going to LG web site and adding this \"/us/support-mobile/lg-LG800G\" to the home page URL.\u2714 What I like about the phone------------------------------------------1. I found the touch screen to be responsive, although it requires a little more pressure than the touch screens of my Android devices2. The screen is bright and easy to see. The phone size is 4\" (length) by 2.25\" (width) by 0.375\" (thickness). Screen size 1.75\" (width) by 2.25\" (length). 3\" diameter. It weighs 3.1 oz.3. This phone will be used by someone whose vision is not very good, and I was pleasantly surprised by many font size choices and how well the font scaled up without losing the usability of the menus and prompts.I am attaching a collage of five photos (which can be found by following customer photos link under the main photo). Photo #1 shows font options, Photo #2 shows a screen with font size set to medium size, Photo #3 shows a screen with large font.4. The price of this phone is hard to beat. This phone provided triple minutes for the life of the phone. That means when combined with 1 year service/400 minutes it is 1200 minutes for $90 (current price on Amazon including shipping), which is 7.5 cents per minute. Or for someone who uses a phone less than 400 minutes a year (which is the case in our family), then it is $7.50 a month for the security of having an emergency phone.5. The phone has a small set of useful apps: a calculator, a notepad, an mp3 player, and few others. Using these apps does not use minutes. If you use the browser then the minutes are used as soon as you connect and stop when you disconnect.6. A charging connector is a standard micro USB connector. I have been able to charge this phone using my own cables, so if you already have a car charger or an external battery that uses a standard USB connector you don't need to buy anything special to use it them with this phone. The charging port on LG800G is on the left side of the phone and is covered by a small panel which you need to lift up and turn 90 degrees to expose the connector.\u2714 Customization I have made---------------------------------------(1) I increased the screen time out. This is done by hitting a blue squares with 4 dots (also known as the Menu icon) and then selecting 'Settings'. From the 'Settings' screen select 'Phone' and then 'Auto-lock'. You can choose a time between 10 sec and 60 sections or 'Never'. If you select 'Never' the screen will dim but will not lock. The downside of 'Never' that if something in your purse accidentally presses on the screen you could be dialling or starting up a browser without meaning to do so.(2) I removed the browser from the main screen to the apps bar (so it would not be hit accidentally start using minutes). And added \"Profiles\" to the main screen, which allows to change the phone into silent or flight mode quickly.(3) I populated the contacts, and then added several numbers to the speed dial. Once the speed dial is set you will be able to access it by clicking the phone icon on the main screen, and then hold down the number of your speed dial. Speed dial #1 is your voice mail. Note that when you access your voice mail you get charged minutes. Speed dials also appear as individual buttons on the screen on the second page. To get to the second page you need to swipe your finger across the main screen right to left.(4) I changed the font of the display. This option is accessible by hitting the Menu icon, then 'Settings', then 'Display', then 'Font'.(5) I changed the ring tone. To get to this setting you need to go to the second page of Settings. Start with Menu, then Settings, then slide your finger right to left to flip the page, select 'My stuff', then 'Sounds'. The phone comes with 12 choices for rings tones.(6) You can activate and deactivate sounds by using the volume button. To do so you need to press and hold the lower portion of the volume button. You will get a brief message on the screen \"Silent activated\". If you press it again you will deactivate silence and get \"Silent deactivated\" message.\u2714 ADDING SD MEMORY CARD-------------------------------------The phone is operational without adding an SD memory card. The phone comes with some (relatively small) amount of internal memory. Information about your contacts, calendar, tasks & notes are stored in internal memory. If you are planning to take photos or videos, or listen to music, you should add an SD memory card. Note that your contacts, calendar, and tasks will continue to be stored the internal memory. I purchased this SD memory Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter.1. SD memory card slot is located under the battery. This means that you first need to remove the cover by sliding it down. The first time I had to remove the cover it was a bit difficult, as the cover is very slippery and has no groves to hang on to. I finally was able to do it by using the grippy material used to open cans. Photo #4 shows me removing the battery cover. The grippy material generated enough friction that the cover finally slid off. After removing the cover, you need to remove the battery.2. The memory card slot is on the left side of the white SIM card. The gold bars on the card should face down towards the gold bars on the phone. The memory card goes under a metal holder. You need to lift the metal holder, place the memory card, and then lower the card holder, and push it down until it snaps in place. Note that lifting the holder for the first time requires some force. I used a tiny screwdriver to give me leverage to push it up. Photo #5 shows the holder in up position, so you can see what you need to do to insert the memory card.3. After the memory card is in place, you need to replace the battery and the phone cover, and power up the phone.4. Now, you need to set your default memory to external, and tell the camera, the video recorder, and the voice recorder to use the external memory rather than the internal memory like before.5. To set the default memory:- Tap the following sequence MENU - Settings - Phone - Memory Info - Primary storage settings- Tap on External memory (red check will appear)- There will be a FORMAT button at the bottom of the screen, tap on it- If the phone asks for a security code, enter 0000. Once you enter the security code, OK button will appear on the bottom of the screen. Click ok. Format takes about 1 second.6. To set the camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizontal position, as you turn you will see camera control setting appear on the screen.- Tap the gear icon which is on the lower left side of the screen.- The memory setting is on the second screen of camera settings, so you need to tap the slider on the right hand side (it will say 1/3, first page out of three) once you tap it will change to 2/3.- On the top row you will see a square called 'select storage'. By default it will look like a cell phone, once you tap it will look like a memory card.- Hit OK to save your change7. To change the video camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizon position, as you turn the camera controls will appear- Tap the gear looking icon on the bottom left- Now you need to switch from camera to video, which is done by sliding your finger from camera to video camera icon on the right hand side slider- If you do it correctly, you will see a red button appear where the video camera is. If you do it incorrectly, you will take a photo. It took me a few tries to get the pressure and location of where my finger slides correctly.- The storage setting is on the second page of the video camera, so you need to page down on the slider by tapping on 1/2.- Tap on 'Select storage' icon, and make sure you see a memory card, rather than the cell phone icon.- Click OK to save your change8. To change the voice recorder- Voice recorder is on the second page of Settings. To get there select Menu - slide you finger right to left to page - tap on Voice recorder.- The top option is 'Storage', tap on it to change cell phone icon to memory card icon.- Click ok to save your changeOverall, the phone feels nice, the screen is easy to read, when I made a few \"test\" phone calls I was told that I sound very clear. Other than that I am quite pleased with this phone. Note that this is NOT a full featured smart phone like Android smart phones or iPhone, but it a very cost efficient way to have an emergency phone which can do a bit more than just phone calls.Ali Julia reviewUpdate 3/9/2013:  My original review stated that the thing that I like least about the phone is that its speaker phone is not loud enough to hear well without putting the phone next to your ear. However, since then I discovered that there is a setting which turns on the speaker phone, and with the setting on the phone functions well as a speaker phone. To turn on the speaker phone press on \"speaker\" icon, this icon will appear when you are connected to the other side on the bottom of the screen that is displayed when you are talking on the phone.  To turn it off, click on the \"speaker\" icon again.Update 3/25/2014:  It is now a year later, I just received our second LG800.

I bought this package to replace my seldom used home phone and save some money, and it will certainly do that. To the tune of $360 a year. So that alone makes me happy. I have been a Tracphone customer for several years and am happy with the service and phones offered. This time around was the first time I ported a phone number with them. From a land line AT&T; phone to this Tracphone the port took 5 business days to complete and roughly a week overall. Not too bad considering it's a number I have had for well over a decade and now get to keep. Set up and activation was a fluid, worry free process.The phone itself? It's a good purchase imo. Battery life is good, and the touch screen works fine. Menus are well laid out, and it works reliably. The touch screen is the sort which takes some finger pressure (resistive) to activate but works well enough. However if a heavy txt'er it may irritate as using it's keyboard is not as touch sensitive as you might hope. The lock screen issue you may have read about may also irritate during some calls but I have had no problem working around it using the power button or turning on the speaker phone.If a regular phone user and looking for a good day to day phone I would suggest looking to the LG840 offered by Tracphone. I also own and use that phone and it is a nice upgrade over this one with it's effortlessly operated capacitive touch screen, larger size, and overall smoother operation. As a daily use phone it is more pleasant and convenient to operate and is a step up in tactile feel and build quality. It's around $20 more then this phone at the moment all other things being equal, and well worth it if your budget can afford and you need a frequent use phone with little fuss. Otherwise this phone, the lesser LG800, will do just fine if affordability is an issue or simply looking for a second phone or like myself, one to replace a little used land line.

Thanks to Giant Eagle's sale going on from 02/27/14 through 03/12/14, this deal can now be beat on Amazon. The deal is a bit more complicated than I would like, but simple enough. Buy $100 in either Sears or Staples gift cards in one transaction and get $10 towards your next purchase, plus 10 cents off per gallon in fuel perks. Take the card(s) to Sears or Staples (whichever is applicable) and purchase one or more Amazon gift cards. Just the $10 coupon brings the Amazon costs down to $40.49/deal and if you get the full 30 gallons with fuel perks you can bring this down to as low as just over $37.79/deal. BTW. Sears/KMart gives double rewards on purchase of their own card every day ( but you don't get any rewards for purchasing a gift card with a Sears card), so by buying a Sears card at Sears/KMart then using it to purchase an Amazon gift card you can get the Amazon cost down to $40.49 every day.I bought my deal to activate an Android Tracfone. Unfortunately, with Android Tracfones the transfer of minutes and service days is one way. Can't use an Android Tracfone? Too bad, all you can transfer back is your phone number. To make matters worse, Android Tracfones come with no setup minutes or service days, so you have to load minutes and service days on them to try them out. My solution was to purchase one of these deals, use the card to add minutes (and 90 service days) to my 840g, transfer the minutes and service days from the 800g to the Android after activating the 800g with a new number, then once I verified everything was working, transfer my number, minutes, and service days to the Android Tracfone.This could have lead to a loss of 365 service days, but at most 20 minutes, much less risky than most other approaches.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Functional", "Author": "pp \"pp\"", "ReviewID": "R3N838F0YGUULL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the D-O-G X-ferring over the 50 or so min.

KIDS gotta love that gimmick.I use a soft ballpoint end to peck out a text ON THE KEYBOARD and the pen method is solid.When you get a call you just hit the GO BUTTON....EZ.....Later the fone locks screen at aninterval of your choice. BUT you could \"buttdial' dropping it in your pocket B4 the screen locks--i never did --- but I hear the beeps and all until the lockscreen takes the screen out after a call.GET IT!!!  How much is it?  OK!! That is exactly how far you could go wrong!!I mean versus a $100/mo for 24 month lock in....that is $2,500.00 wrong!!BROWSER-----Takes time to find the TRUE MOBI SITES --- minute eater,once you got trimmed down mobi sites BOOKMARKED it is fast surfing....Use TracFone MOBI 1stfor news and sports scores sites to BOOKMARK......then try  Yahoo! too.I could not find fast GOOGLE mobi....must be phased out.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super good price, good phone, good service. What's not to love?", "Author": "Bob Spafford", "ReviewID": "R3AXP1E5HN1IYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Price?  Here, as of this writing, you can pay ShopCellDeals $44.98ppd. thru Amazon.  But if you just go to ShopCellDeals dot com, you pay $37.99ppd.  (Important note- You can not browse at SCD and find this deal.  You must search for \"LG800G with One Year of Service\" to find it)  Anyway, you end up with fine cell phone service at a total cost of $2.53/month!  If you need more time, it's minutes tripled for life.  How can you beat that?My instinct is to stockpile some of these, getting years service at a really low price.  I have asked, and both ShopCellDeals and Tracfone have replied in writing, that nothing here expires, ever.  In addition, I have a personal back story. . .Years ago, Net10 (Net10 and Tracfone are the same company) allowed resellers a super cheap deal on dumb phones that worked out to $3.33/month.  I bought a dozen.  Activating a new phone on line, keeping my number and carrying over of my pile of minutes, cost me very little time.  There are some advantages to doing this.  If you lose a phone, step on it, drop it in the john, it just quits working, or whatever, you just activate a new one from your pile.  Instant fix!  The cost and inconvenience of these mishaps becomes zero.  You can also carry a stash of charged batteries with you, and have days of talk time available away from power.  (I am even left with a pile of pricey lithium batteries and chargers, which I now use in electronic projects)  Indeed, nothing at all expired over the years of service I got.  So, that gives me the courage to buy 4 of these LG800 phones, for 5 years of really cheap cell phone service.  End up with lots of good working cell phones?  Fed law says that 911 has to work free forever, so I just pass them on to women's shelters and local homeless folks.Phones?  I am delighted with them!  Most of the complaints in these reviews concern missing features which are found when the (somewhat incomplete) user manual, available on the LG site, is consulted.  And the many complaints of high finger pressure needed for the touch screen have an EASY fix.  You will be delighted with the high sensitivity and accuracy you get using a stylus instead of your big fingertip.  You can type WAY faster on the QWERTY keyboard with a stylus.  I got a pack of 5 Nintendo DS styluses on a bargain table at Walmart for $2.  They are about the length of the phone.  I cut the length a bit, and slide them in the camera lens hole in the rubber cover.  'Keeps it real handy.  It may turn out that gals with long nails are already fixed.I bought a 4GB micro SD card (the largest the phone will accept) for about $5.  The LG800 plays music very well, and 4GB holds about 40 hours of mp3. You will want a USB to microUSB cable to connect the phone to your PC, where it will appear as a disk drive for your music, pics, vids. An inexpensive neat addition, moves from phone to phone in seconds, no tools.Service?  I (and others) report having gotten good service from both Tracfone and ShopCellDeals.  I just ordered the last two of these phones, and the time from placing the order, to the time I got an email saying order shipped and here's your tracking number, was 2 hours 39 minutes(!)  Also, there are good \"service\" tips right here in Amazon's reviews.  Especially valuable is the excellent setup advice in the review by Ali Julia (tells you how to configure the phone to store everything on the SD card).One concern I have had is that some people report trouble getting the included 1 year to show up;  A few folks say they got 12 months;  Most say they got 15.  'Seems that folks are signing up all sorts of different ways.  After reading all the reviews, I decided upon my path to activation, and I am happy to report that it worked perfectly for me the first time.  In a few minutes, I was told that I had everything which had been promised.  So, if any others would like an accurate and detailed accounting, here's what I did.At Tracfone dot com, I used the \"activate my Tracfone with a new number\" path, and ended up activated with 20 minutes of service (they give you for testing) and an expiration date of today.  Oops!  I turned the phone off then back on, and was told that I now had 20 minutes and 1 year.  Yes!  Strangely, although my phone showed that it was activated, the phone number screen (\"dice\"/prepaid/my phone number) was blank.  After another off/on sequence, that screen showed me my new phone number.  Then, I made a short test call to verify operation.  Perfect!  Only after seeing I had 19 minutes of talk, 1 year of service, and a working phone number did I use the phone's \"add airtime\" function to add on the 3 month card.  After another off/on, I saw the correct 619 minutes and 455 days of service on the phone.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  So, that exact sequence is what worked for me.  I wish everyone the good luck I had.

Initially I was a little skeptical because of the minutes card shows only 90 days of service. So instead of risking loosing my old rollover minutes then I opted to just activate the phone on it's own and see if I would get what was advertised.  Sure enough I got 600 minutes and 1 yr of service days. I did this late at night and therefore I waited till morning and called Tracfone.  I talked with a nice gentleman who asked me for phone info and once that was done then he had transferred all minutes and days from my old phone to my new one.There was a slight glitch when I initially activated this phone.  It gave me 620 minutes and 735720 days.  But when the phone rebooted then it showed that service would end in 2015. There was update pending so I left the phone on and went to bed.  The next morning then I rebooted the phone and the days had turned into 1 yr instead of that huge string of days.  So if anyone else experiences that glitch then you might want to wait before transferring your old rollover minutes and days to this new one.  Also by calling Tracfone then you can be assured that your old minutes and days are transferred properly.  Customer Service is not manned 24/7.  Calling during business hours is about a 10 minute wait.  I have used Tracfone for years and they have never let me down.This phone works just great!!

It's a great phone.  You will need to buy a 4 gig micro sd card if you want to add ringtones.  I make my own ring tones, using phone zoo, which you can transfer via usb/phone cord (you can get one cheaply on Ebay).I personally have the one up from this, the LG 840G.  This phone CANNOT connect to the internet via your router.  The LG 840G can.  Otherwise, I don't notice a huge difference.  This phone is slightly smaller than that one.  One nice thing about the LG840G vs the LG 800G is getting messages the phone locks up before you can put the code in and you have to manually unlock it.  That is not an issue with the 840.  The only other comparison I can think of that is lacking is you have to wait for this one to lock (you can change the time it takes to do that) and I can lock the 840G by turning the screen off.  I tried it on the 800G and it doesn't work that way.  Given I set them to lock in 10 seconds,not a big deal.My kids, my father in law, Mother and my husband all use this phone.  It was easy for my grade school kids to figure out and understand.  My mother has a TERRIBLE time with anything related to technology.  I was surprised at her lack of problems using this phone.  It is very straight forward.For anyone curious if this phone will work in their area, this can be a problem though easily fixed.  It comes with either an AT&T; chip or a Virgin Mobile chip.  My state does not have Virgin service.  Only 2 of the phones I ordered (all from this business this is listed under, who is easy to work with) came with the chip I needed.  Tracfone--who sucks to deal with because the calls are shipped overseas--will make you activate the phone..  Then they make you wait 24 hours to see if it will work.  They won't tell you what chip is in it, I tried to explain that only one of the chips work, no matter, you still have to play the scripted game.  After the 24 hours they will move you up one and have you put some numbers in the phone.  Then you have to wait either 24 or 48 hours (depends on who you get when you call back).  THEN they will take your address and send you a new sim card.  The upshot is this is cheaper, and the minutes are a good deal, than if you ordered from Tracfone's site.  So, I wouldn't worry about whether the phone will work in your area, Tracfone will (for free) make sure it works for you provided one of those two carries work for you.  You just have to go in knowing you will be on the phone for a fair amount of time trying to make it work.  They will not vary from their script--I had a working sim from a phone that was washed, and asked if we could just put that in instead of them sending me one.  That did NOT go over well.  You have to play their game.  It can, however, take up to 2 weeks to make your phone work.We transferred phone numbers in 2 cases.  They indicate the phone will work until they do the transfer, not true.  My verizon phones were cut off immediately.  One phone worked after 24 hours.  The other worked after a week.  I do like tracfone,though.  I text a lot and call rarely so my minutes last quite awhile.  If you are new to tracfone and don't use your phone heavily, I think it's worth it.  Minutes continue to transfer over as long as you don't run out of time.  It's a great deal for us, it meant my grade school kids could have phones for safety reasons.  They will never use the minutes up, so the one year of service works fabulously for us.  Even with my husband talking on his LG 800G daily, it's been cheaper than with verizon.  Sending pictures and receiving pictures do suck up minutes.  Also, some of the smart phones will send messages as if they are photo, that takes up more minutes that I'd like--but it's a rare issue.

Pretending that a specific feature is offered when it's not the case is what we call in Canada a consumer deceptive trade practice.

I spoke to 4 different customer service representative (all girls) for 3 - 4 hours across 2 days and eventually a manager (another girl). The manager's advice to me was to return the phone as the SIM card can't be activated. I did not give up and made one final call one day later again to Tracfone. This time I hit a knowledgeable and very good customer service guy. He solved my problem in about 15 minutes and my phone started working. Makes me wonder what those girls and the manager are doing.

I was aware that you can not call cell phone numbers in some countries at the discount rate, but surprised to find that if your country is not on the list, you simply can not call there at any price. This leaves me with only one number to call, but it's still worth it to call my parents. After going trough the lengthy Tracfone procedure, calling some 800 number, then dialing an access code, and then dialing my parents, I get a recording saying; \"this is an illegal number.\" I try a few more times, and then try again a week later. Perhaps I had made a mistake or perhaps there was something wrong with the line that day. No luck getting trough so I call Tracfone. It ends up being several long calls. I will not give you a lengthy rant about bad, incompetent service and no solution to your problems. You have heard the same story many times before.Cons: My phone came with one year of service and about 300 minutes. At this point my minutes are nearly used up. I have made less than a dozen local phone calls, totaling less than half an hour. I have listened to messages from some criminal trying to sell me a fake cruise ticket. I have not yet been able to make an international call to anyone I know. I have spent the majority of my minutes waiting on hold and talking to Tracfone service reps. They are now suggesting that I call them from a different telephone so that they can troubleshoot this one.Pros: Tracfone has kept their promise of letting me make international calls at local rates. In fact nearly all my calls have been overseas. I am not sure exactly what countries I have been calling, but it is quite obvious that English is not the first language in any of them. It would be nice if I could at some point make international calls to people I actually know, rather than to the Tracfone call centers around the world.P.S. This rating is obviously for the Tracfone service, and not for the hardware. Since the Phone can not be used with any other company there is no point making a distinction. Please be aware that this low rating is NOT meant to reflect on the seller here on Amazon.
