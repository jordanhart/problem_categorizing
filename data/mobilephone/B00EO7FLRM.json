{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love It", "Author": "alchartreux", "ReviewID": "R1S6FLBR286DO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for $19.99 and am extremely happy with it. For one penny at the current price, this is a steal.I switched from an iPhone 4s which I had used for two years, and, which had served me very well. However, I wanted a bigger screen, 4G speed and \"landscape\" view for maps, and, I didn't have the money to upgrade to the newest iPhone. So, I bought this Android device, instead. I don't regret the switch, at all.PROSScreen size -- a gorgeous 5.5\", close to best-in-class with 1080p and 401 ppi resolution, great clarity, brightness and colors. An absolute joy to use.Battery life -- Stellar; you will easily get through the day with heavy usage. A big improvement over the iPhone. If you reduce the screen brightness, you can squeeze more life out of the battery.Phone size -- Yeah, it's big, but, it still fits into my jeans front pocket. The large size of the phone also means that it's easier to grip, and harder to drop, because you have a better grip on it. I haven't dropped it once in over 3 months of use.Processing power -- Quad core, 1.7 Ghz, more than powerful enough for everyday tasks and occasional gaming. Can be switched to dual-core as an energy-saving feature.Storage space -- a generous 32 GB, with an extra 64 GB available if you add a Micro SD card.Removable battery -- this was the closer for me. I like the fact that the battery is removable. This allows you to carry a spare around (although, with the great battery life of this phone, you really don't need to do this), and, further down the road, to eventually replace the battery entirely when the re-charging capacity is reduced, thus greatly extending the life and functionality of your phone.User interface -- Very easy to use. LG's \"skin\" for the Android operating system is not overly gaudy or showy. There are a bunch of pre-installed junk programs, but, you can delete most of them. Most everything on this phone can be customized to fit your preferences.Camera -- Quite excellent. I actually reduce the picture resolution from the default 13 megapixels (which creates ridiculously large image file sizes) down to a more reasonable 8 megapixels (which creates picture files of roughly 2 megabytes in size).LED-lit Home button -- Very cool. There is a multi-color LED backlight surrounding the home button, which can serve as a notification.COULD BE BETTERSpeaker -- Adequate, but, not great. Sound quality is fine for speakerphone calls, but, it could be better. Worthless for listening to music.CONSCall answering -- A minor gripe, but, still worth mentioning. The call answering gesture is the most idiotic that I've seen on a smartphone -- instead of simply tapping \"Answer (a ringing phone icon),\" you have to do a swipe of the phone icon that is actually more tricky to pull off than it should be. Really stupid.Apps that I recommend:Inomail Lite -- the best e-mail program that I've used. Very similar interface to iPhone's e-mail.Google Voice -- Allows you to make free texts, using a Google Voice number.Dictionary.com -- Great dictionary.Opera web browser -- The best Android browser, in my opinion. The only one that lets you easily create website bookmarks, amazingly, and, which has browser controls at the bottom of the screen.Note that, as of 1/18/2014, AT&T; has revised the smartphone plans on its website to the decidedly more costly \"Mobile share\" plans, but, if you buy your phone from Amazon, you can still choose the cheaper \"Nation Talk\" plans. Here's why I don't think the Mobile share plans make sense. Yes, they offer unlimited talk and text, but, I never came close to using my 450 minutes a month, and, with rollover, those unused minutes are available to you the next month. As far as texting -- I chose to pay per text with my Nation Talk plan, and I simply use Google Voice texting app to text for free. There are other apps that allow you to do free MMS texting. If a few texts are sent to me via AT&T;'s SMS texting service, I pay 20 cents per message (30 cents for pictures), which doesn't come close to the $20 charged fee for unlimited texting. Here is my breakdown of available plans:Nation Talk 450 (2-year contract):450 talk minutes (with rollover) - $39.993 GB of data - $30.0020 cents per text, or, $20 for unlimited texting (better to pay per text, and use the Google Voice app for free texting)Monthly total - $69.99, plus taxes and feesMobile share plan (2-year contract):Unlimited talk and text2 GB of data - $55 ($70 for the next tier, 4 GB)Connection fee - $40Monthly total - $95, plus taxes and feesMobile share plan (no contract; bear in mind that you will pay the full purchase price of your smartphone, potentially hundreds of dollars):Unlimited talk and text2 GB of data - $55 ($70 for the next tier, 4 GB)Connection fee - $25Monthly total - $80, plus taxes and fees", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "My daughter LOVE her phone!!!", "Author": "MmeMoxie", "ReviewID": "RKT3CFOTU4DJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I honestly, can not say anything bad, about the LG Optimus G Pro Smartphone! It simply, is awesome. The size of the viewing, is large, larger than a Galaxy S4. It works and is easy to use. My daughter is so in love, with this phone. I added 32GB extra memory, so that she could take more pictures/videos with her phone, of her grandson ... My great-grandson.Setup was so easy. Basically, turn on your phone, after inserting the micro-sims card and extra memory. After that, you simply personalize the phone, to what you want and don't want. I did, make sure that there was a good Anti-Virus program/app installed, with an Android phone, that really has become a necessity. The rest of the apps were the ones, she wanted and uses.First of all, by buying this phone on Amazon ... I was able to save $50, from AT&T;'s online store. Which allowed me to buy a phone protector and the extra memory. I am extremely pleased, with this purchase and this phone. Important question ... Would I purchase a Smartphone from Amazon, again?

The last few phones I've owned include:Galaxy S4 (Verizon)LG Nexus 5 (AT&T;)HTC One GPE (AT&T;)Galaxy Note 2 (Verizon)I stopped using the Note 2 and gave it to my son who is in college. I found myself missing the real estate of the larger screen but didn't want to take it back from my son.I was going to go after the Note 3 but would have to purchase it off-contract and $700+ is insane for a phone.Pros:Screen size - even though it has a 5.5\" screen similar to the Note 2 this phone is noticably more narrow to hold in one hand.Wireless charging works greatmicroSDWicked fast - I use Nova Launcher Prime and never a hesitationCons:Much prefer the stock Gmail app to the LG skinned appWhile there are some nice touches in the skinned launcher, I prefer stock AndroidNot many third party case options for protection", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "my baby", "Author": "Sheniqua", "ReviewID": "RFUL2VP32CCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I adore this phone.

I normally use my 10\" tablet for main book reading nowadays, but I also like the option to continue the book if I am waiting for an appointment, or at work break time. My earlier smartphone was good but I wanted a slightly bigger real estate. This phone served the purpose, while not being too big to be difficult to carry. It fits my shirt pocket nicely (although top is visible outside the pocket), and not wide to be difficult to hold. The book reading and movie watching is great - I have lots of DVD rips on attached micro-SD card which I can easily watch with downloaded free apps. However, many mkv files of Blu-Ray movies do not play OK (they have problem in my tablet too), but whatever plays (1080p), plays very nicely. However, the wireless connection sometimes drops off and does not come back on, although the icon shows connectivity. I have to turn off and on the WIFI to get the connection back on. But I do not use the network much, as I consume most of the media from local storage, or with occasional sync (Kindle App, Google Books).So all in all, I am happy - but for the occasional glitches of WIFI, I am forced to deduct one star.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Underdog of 2013", "Author": "Pete C.", "ReviewID": "R2UY76ESVHJMYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is phenomenal.  It truly is the underdog of the Android phones.  It's speed is amazing, easier to hold than my Samsung Galaxy Note (original), the screen feels smoother probably due to the Gorilla Glass 2 and the screen is astonishing.  I watched Pacific Rim on it last night and it was clear as a bell!  It has superior battery life but you can even squeeze more out through the use of the Quad Core Control function, which limits the phone from four cores to two.  Never noticed a difference until I tried to watch Pacific Rim in 1080p format, then I had to turn off Quad Core Control.I recently bought this phone as an upgrade on Black Friday on contract with AT&T; for $39.99 but the following Thursday the price dropped to $14.99.  I called Amazon and within 60 seconds they refunded me the difference. Talk About AWESOME Customer Service!PROS:Too Many to List - See aboveCONS:As of this review, stuck on Android 4.1.2 but that shouldn't make too much of a difference, see:[...]BTW, the Tough Case by Case-Mate is a wonderful case for this phone, just wish I could find it in white.

I was worried about switching from the IPhone to an Android, but I'm glad I made the choice. The large screen and the amazing vibrant color are beyond what I ever expected from a phone. The Android operating system took awhile to get used to, but this phone is far superior to the boring old IPhone. After reading some other reviews I was worried about dropping the phone, because some users have said the screen shatters easily, but I haven't had that problem and I've dropped my phone a good 15-20 times, both with and without a case. The only con is that this phone can't be easily used one handed, but at the same time I don't have to zoom everything just to see it.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone.", "Author": "HPlaptopuser", "ReviewID": "R1AXEHY9DCJIY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Generally, this is a great phone.

I upgraded from the LG Optimus P705 and as happy as I was with that phone at the time, this one has proven that LG is a brand with which I'm glad to have stayed.  Considering the specs of other phones in this category, the only thing I covet beyond this product is the lack of new wireless AC support (since this design precedes the technology), but I'm already looking forward to my next LG phone.One thing I have noticed about LG phones is that it is almost a necessity to reboot them after each charge. Charging, for whatever reason, seems to make the OS a little unstable (random app crashes here and there). I don't consider this too much of an issue since rebooting takes all of twenty to thirty seconds (shutdown to full operation).
