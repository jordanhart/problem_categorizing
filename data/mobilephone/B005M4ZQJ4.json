HP still provide great support and has mechanics to update the firmware from their site palm.com/rom I doctored it and updated with the latest firmware from HP/Palm website. I also unlocked it paying a site $17, but now there are free unlocking site available which I used for my other Paln Pre devices. I also use it without SIM using developer mode, given below. The white phone is very cute and distinguishes from the standard color. Has plenty of space for music and volume is pretty good in the internal speaker. Touchstone capabilities are awesome.  Unfortunately HP fumbled and stopped these line of products, but they are great and part of a history.Steps to bypass activation and use with just wifi: At the first screen to put SIM Card, using the keyboard type: BZ (those are the buttons for #*). dialer will appear. When the phone dialer appears use the screen to type: 3386633# and press dial. The phone will restart and you don't need a SIM card to use the phone.

Like most of the people who made their reviews about this phone, I have experienced all OS from Symbian, iOS, Android, Windows Mango and the RIM, WebOS is for me the most user friendly. This phone is so tiny but it can tether like crazy with it's 4G speed. The battery may be a bit disappointing and the App World may not have many applications but you can't expect to do much on such a small phone.Camera is ok with a good light source. You can customize many settings by downloading a third party app just like Cydia on iPhone. For me, the best benefit I got from this phone is it's tethering capabilities. If you were grandfathered with an unlimited data this phone can maximize your usage. And no, I don't feel the \"throttle\". I get the same consistent speed. Works great for streaming videos too.I'm planning to get another one in fact.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome smartphone with this price!", "Author": "yl147", "ReviewID": "R117PWCNOQSPK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is so cute! It easily fits in my pocket. The keyboard feels very comfortable for typing massage. Very fast when run apps. I really like the multi-task design of WebOS and how easy it is to open and close an app just by sliding my finger. This phone definitely can satisfy my basic daily needs as phone call, massage, browsing websites, check email and facebook, etc. It may not be very convenient for listening music or watching videos because you need some kind of adaptor to connect the earphones to the phone. The other concern is that the battery doesn't last quite long. It is enough for a whole day, but you'd better recharge it every night since the battery is not removable.

The slide out keyboard sucks. I do not like phones that have moving parts like that. But I did like the size of this and the touchstone compatibility. The 4G is fast enough and teethering using free teether was excellent. I streamed Pandora through the cellular network to my car stereo via Bluetooth and provided a hotspot to the kids Kindle Fire's. Not bad for a phone that most people laugh at when they see it. But this phone isn't about being number one. It is about not having the same thing as everyone else and not caring what other people think. I liked how small it was and how simple it was to setup. The price is right and the camera is... so-so.The screen is GLASS! This is good news for those with scratched up plastic screens. These gorilla glass screens are scratch resistant and have fantastic sensitivity for touch. But I dropped mine onto a corner and the screen shattered. Oops. But the good news. If you break the glass, it's cheap to replace the phone. Then you just swap the SIM card, log into your Palm id and your back.I do not like the magnetic headphone jack thing. I like listening to my headphones while my phone is charging. With a touchstone that's fine. But without a touchstone, you either get the headphones or the charging, not both. Oh well... Next I will buy the Palm Pre 3. See how that thing does. I am sad to see Palm phones go. WebOS was perfect for guys like me. I do not care about carrying around thousands of apps or having the fastest this or that. ITS A PHONE!

But this phone out of all of them is the most user friendly and comfortable.It seems like keys are small - BUT they r not, i typed messages twice faster then on any other touchscreen phone.Phone is small phone and doesn't look like u caring a TV in your pocket. WebOS is already proved to be best developers platform, and i can say it's the most flexible and easy to use from all the other mobile OS i've used. Yes it doesn't have millions and millions of apps but you can find all apps you would NEED - and most of them are free.I also own TouchPad from HP and TTS functionality is just awesome! $5 touchstone makes it easy to recharge wirelessly.Some ppl say that this phone is slow - not true. Phone is fast. As i said - WebOS is very flexable so u can accelerate it / overclock. Any phone is going to be slow if u r running 20 apps without closing processes. Also some ppl left reviews saying that it's hard to close apps - actually thats a lie - process of closing an app is easiest from any other phone - u just swiping app-card/window up.So please people - before posting negative feedback about great products - READ MANUAL and fallow instructions!", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hp veer", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R2N3142NZHZ0EF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off im writing this review because of the product and the functions.Pros - phone calls are great. Texting works. Keybord works . Screen is clear. Phone looks brand new .Cons- phone isnt updated wich means if you get the version I have u will have hardware and software problems as I did.for instance.when I made phone calls the screen shuts off and there wasnt anyway I can turn the screen on. I pressed everything and the only solution was restarting the entire phone after I made calls. texting was ok but it was really laggy.When I sent a message, it took a while for it to show up on the screen.also while I was having a conversation the messages werent showing only when I got the notification . I had to delete the convo and start a new one with that person.  Also when I try to listen to music or pandora no sound is playing sometimes. I wasn't able to use my email accounts . when I looked at the charger when I opened the box it was really dusty like. I can see it disappear as I wiped and cleaned it.just for experience i wouldn't recommend this product to any customers. And that if someone sells devices they should explain if there are problems . I give this 2 stars because it came on time and I was offerred a refund but which I do not trust . If u want something alittle more meaning try the palm pre 2 or the pre 3", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Lorrant", "ReviewID": "R3K7TR41WZ1O6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's really a nice phone I love the way it operates nice graphics and smooth operations.

The phone arrived and I activated it on Straight Talk (basically AT&T; service). Lets first say the phone is very small in size and I ordered the white one and it's very very slippery. If I knew before (from reviews) I would of got the black one for more grip. Any who, the Web OS experience is about the same as before with the palms except a few diff tactics that I don't like so much. The web browser is pretty good and does have Flash Video, I was very disappointed in the camera as I knew there was no flash but the quality of pictures and camera is just bad and so is the video recorder. Now with the actual hardware its pretty spotty, when I say spotty it means the phone kind of just freezes once in a while and is pretty slow even with a 800 ram. The battery life (can not replace)on the Veer is I say the worst battery you can get except the Samsung Epic(slide keyboard). The one thing that I really cant stand with the Veer is that the phone has a \"battery saving\" chip in it that makes the screen dim off and on really drives me crazy that it does this and no way of turning it off unless you download Preware and use a Patch. Now with the app store- it's just plain awful!!! Yes you can get Facebook(doesn't upload), Twitter,the basics, but no Google maps, my Amazon music store will not even allow me to purchase songs, and no navigator unless you have a contract with AT&T.; On the other hand, emails load quick, the keyboard is amazing, the size is cool and fun, the call quality is decent but it depends on the Service you have. Overall the HP VEER is a very fun smartphone that is small, most of the time zippy, and def a crowd stopper. I was disappointed in the \"dimming\", the app store, Amazon music, and At&t; service.
