{"Reviews": [{"Title": "N8 Usable, Robust and a Bargain", "Author": "Jay Busari", "ReviewID": "R2MZSZMZ86SKG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone a couple days ago.Comparing N8 photos vs iPhone photos:  - iPhone screen is 960x640, while N8 screen is 360x640.  - A picture when enlarged will look more blurry on the N8, compared with the same picture enlarged on the iPhone.  - This doesn't mean the N8 camera takes blurry pictures.  - This means the screen resolution is better on iPhone  - This means the camera is better on N8.The bad quality UI complaints are mostly due to the 3rd party widgets included from YouTube, CNN, BBC, National Geographic, Paramount movie previews.My phone crashed (UI got stuck) due to some third party app, and I tried to remove the battery (as with most other phones) but couldn't.I realized I did not need to remove the battery...just press the power button for 5-8 seconds and the phone will reboot.BTW, if you'd ever need to replace the battery yourself, just use a small \"allen key\" type screwdriver.The Nokia N8 multiple home screens are a great way to organize yourself and reduce phone screen clutter.If you need a portrait mode qwerty keyboard, swype or dayhand maybe interesting options for you.I personally need a qwerty keyboard in portrait mode.Keep in mind that qwerty keyboard is just a burden for most people (esp. older people in Asia).Such people will be content with just reading messages, sending a few \"very short\" messages with the T9 keypad...while making a lot of calls and taking a lot of pictures anytime anywhere.Among the things I love about this phone:1. N8 is able to play all sorts of vdo file formats.2. Camera gives you 12MP pictures, and HD video! Just make sure to peel the plastic off the lens on the back.3. Connectivity cables included (usb to thumb drive, usb to pc/mac, hdmi to tv is flawless)4. Multi-tasking5. Long battery life6. Internet, Email, or Web Connectivity can be set to be via \"WLAN only\" or \"WLAN preferred\" or \"3G only\", etc.  You can minimise mobile operator fees as you like.7. Combine Push Email with your choice of network connectivity via WLAN and you start to save money with the lower phone bill.This is my opinion on the iPhone vs N8 issue...  - US journalists/bloggers who write N8 reviews are mostly new to Nokia/Symbian.  So they will only \"evaluate\" their comfort level with the N8...for just a couple of days.  They admit (very briefly) that \"I'm an iPhone user, I tried to use N8 for x days\", before they start hammering the N8.  - N8 gives you the gear to lower your phone bill  - Hackers have traditionally been about lowering their AT&T; phone bills. Many in Silicon Valley, including Steve Jobs, grew up with this mentality. Nokia probably realize this and gives you a choice...the press is not giving Nokia the credit for giving you the freedom.  - Nokia N8 robust hardware will still be handy after many years of use and software updates.Part of the \"UI problem\" is due to the less tightly structured Symbian UI development kit, by allowing 3rd party developers the freedom to create their own look and feel.So each app on Symbian can have a different UI structure and user's experience may not very be consistent across different apps even though they are using the same device (N8).The less tight structure of Symbian APIs has proved to be a strength as Symbian has evolved to support a much larger variety of hardware types with different phone form factors:- some touch screen- some T9 keypad- some qwerty keypadNokia, as a leading phone manufacturer, offers a larger choice of phone form factors for a larger customer base...that's the reason Nokia is a leading phone manufacturer.Each form factor will be preferred by different types of users, since there is a much wider consumer base.Many business users will prefer a qwerty keyboard.Many users will prefer a T9 keypad and find the qwerty keyboard a distraction with too many buttons...for example, they usually do not do a lot of texting or type on a computer keyboard.Many people like the \"feel\" of a touch UI...but that also means that each app is more likely to have \"touch buttons\" on a different location of the screen.That means touch UI phones require the users to \"look before you touch\".That means with the keyboard or keypad, users can \"feel\" as they \"touch\" the phone buttons without looking.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great phone, with lot of features", "Author": "Vijay \"svijay\"", "ReviewID": "RW82KHITJ5GJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from Amazon, a week back and I own a Nokia N900 too.  I wish to compare these two, as Nokia N900 is one of the greatest phones from Nokia.  1)  First let me go to internet browsing.  Nokia N900 is the first phone to have full flash player and the major capability is it will play videos directly in the browser, for sites like youtube, facebook etc.  Once facebook moved to latest flash player, N900 is not able to play the videos(eventhough there is a hack).  Nokia N8, does not have full flash player, but it has flash lite.  I was expecting that the youtube and facebook will not be able to play the videos directly in the browser.  To my surprise, both the sites played the video in the site itself, thats really great.  With respect to Nokia N900, every site determines it as a computer and hence will show the full page, instead of the mobile site, which is good, if the wifi or 3G is really good.  With respect to Nokia N8, every site determines it as a mobile and hence will first display the mobile site, but if you re-route it to the full site, still it displays the sites like charm.  Conclusion: with respect to internet browsing Nokia N8 does great.  2)  Playing videos.  Nokia N900 has a resolution of 800x480, hence the videos look very good.  Nokia N8 has a resolution of 640x360, so I expected videos(good videos like HD videos) will look less attractive, but to my surprise, it looks great in Nokia N8.  Nokia N900 can almost play any video format directly, like wmv, avi etc, including flv.  I am not sure whether any other phone can do/compete with this.  Nokia N8 on the other hand, has the ability to play any video format, but for avi and flv there is a little trick.  When you copy an avi file, your PC may complain that this device is not capable to play it, but you can still use it as a storage and say yes to it.  To my surprise, media player picks and plays well.  For .flv files, after you copy, the media player is not going to pick it, as if it doesn't support it.  If you go to file manager and click on this .flv file, media player picks it and plays well.  I haven't tried .mkv file yet, as the mkv files that I have are all big and it is not allowing me to copy those.  Conclusion: Playing videos is very good in Nokia N8.  3)  Camera.  Nokia N900 has 5MP camera and in this area, Nokia N8 stays way ahead with 12MP camera and xenon flash.  Nokia N8 has xenon flash, which normal cameras use, still even normal cameras cannot take good pictures in dim night lighting.  Similarly N8 photos come good, if taken in close shots in night.  In daylight, photos come really good.  The beauty with N8 is its photo and video editing softwares out of the box, which are really good.  HD video recording in N8 is good, provided you don't show quick movements to turn the camera to a different angle and this is mainly due to the 25 frames per second video recording.  Conclusion: Nokia N8 camera and its capabilities are one of the best.  4)  GPS.  Nokia N900 is pretty dumb in this area too, as it doesn't have voice guidance out of box.  So lets directly jump to Nokia N8.  Nokia N8 has one of the best GPS with voice guidance, one major disadvantage that I came across is, it needs 3G connection to work(I am not sure whether this is correct, what I am quoting is just my experience).  Once it connects, it works good.  I just found two minor issues, one is it informs you to take a turn just when you are few feet away to take the turn, whereas Garmin GPS informs you well ahead.  Similar way when you arrive at your destination, it says you arrived at destination, it does not say, whether your destination is on the right or left, whereas Garmin GPS tells which side your destination is going to be.  Conclusion: Nokia N8 GPS is definitely good.  5)  Widgets.  Nokia N900 stands out with respect to widgets and its definitely the best in the industry.  You can place the widgets whereever you want, even one on top of the other.  Widgets are really useful in N900.  Nokia N8 on the other hand has fixed dimensions for widgets and you can't place it whereever you like.  You need to place it in the designated places.  The main drawback for this that I found is, in email widget, you don't get much required information from the widget, you still need to jump into the mail app to know what email came to you now.  Still widgets look good in N8.  Conclusion: Nokia N8 widgets are still good.  6)  Chat and Voip.  Nokia N900 stands out in this area too, as Skype worked with Nokia to have the skype integrated into the contacts.  Like that, google, yahoo, even sametime all are integrated into the contacts itself.  You just need to go to contacts to see who is online.  You can call that contact through various options, like gsm call or voip call using skype or skype to skype call or skype to skype video call, same way for google, yahoo etc.  It is very powerful, none of the mobile has it integrated like this.  With respect to Nokia N8, I believe it is not out of box and I am not sure whether I need to install anything to get a similar experience.  I heard skype is still building an app for N8, so still I am searching for a provider who can offer video calling capabilities, so that I can use the secondary camera.  Conclusion: Nokia N8's capabilities in this area are not yet explored.  7)  Social networks.  Nokia N900 has beautiful widgets and integration to contact well.  Nokia N8 is not less to this.  It has widgets and integration to contact also well.  Conclusion: Nokia N8's social network capabilities are good.  8)  Bluetooth.  Nokia N900 has the usual bluetooth version and it works good even with A2DP.  Nokia N8 stands out in this, with latest bluetooth version 3.0.  The transfers are really fast compared to the older version.  The beauty comes with out of box drivers to support bluetooth devices like mouse, keyboard etc.  Imagine, I paired my bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the phone and it reduced the time that I spent to do the typing, a lot.  I don't have a monitor to connect using the HDMI port, if I have, then it becomes a complete system.  Conclusion: This is one of the best in Nokia N8.  9)  Battery life.  Nokia N900, in line with all the other powerful smartphones, with all the widgets constantly checking the internet and all the chat softwares too constantly checking internet, it comes for 75% of the day and you need to charge it after that.  Nokia N8, to my surprise even with all the above said things, it is able to withstand for atleast 2 days.  Conclusion: Battery is really good in N8.  10)  WebTV.  Nokia N900 doesn't have this capability.  Nokia N8: need to explore in this area.  Conclusion: Need to explore in this area.  11)  Micro USB capabilities.  Nokia N900, not much to say.  Nokia N8, can read your memory stick out of the box and will show it as a drive in the file manager.  Conclusion: Micro USB in Nokia N8 is capable of more things.  12)  Speakers.  Nokia N900, has stereo speakers and it can produce loud sounds without any external speakers.  Nokia N8, doesn't have stereo speakers, but to my surprise the sound is equally loud as N900, but I found only one problem in this area, as the speaker is in the camera compartment which directly comes in contact to the ground.  If you keep the phone down on a desk, you will not be able to hear any sound, as the speaker is blocked by the desk.  Similarly even the mic is on the same side, so if you talk over phone handsfree, by keeping the phone on the desk, both the parties are not going to hear properly.  13)  FM transmitter and internet radio.  Nokia N900 is outstanding in this area.  If you find to get your popular radio stations URL from internet, you just need to grab the URL and give it to the media player, then N900 can stream your radio station live from internet either using wifi or 3G, which means even if you are in any part of the world, you will be able to hear your favourite radio station live.  Using the build-in FM transmitter, you can transmit to your own car radio.  Nokia N8 has the FM transmitter, which is equally good to N900.  Even though N8 has internet radio concept, it is basically app based, which means whatever stations the app is providing, thats what you are going to hear.  If you want to do the same things as above(like grabbing an url and feeding it to media player), I am not sure how to do it.  Conclusion: FM transmitter is really good, but internet radio needs some improvement.I hope, I covered the review of some distinct features apart from the usual ones.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hands down best phone ever!", "Author": "Bookworm \"bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "RT5DMWGAX9Y2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What more can I do with it (compared to iPhone or Android):1.

Feeling tired :( Users are welcome to comment and add additional pros and cons. I am sure there will be Nokia fanboys and iPhone and Android fanboys.What can't I do (or can't do so well):1. The UI (yes iPhone and Android have better intuitive UI)2. I can't fart with my mobile (but I do have all the apps that I would ever need: e.g. call screening software, office software, pdf reader, flash support, email solution, the entire Oxford, cambridge or a host of other dictionaries etc.)3. Zillions of games that you may avail on iPhone, u may not have on Nokia yet (believe me it's changing fast). BTW, N8 has a faster GPU than iPhone4!Now some misleading media propaganda:1. N8 has only 680 MHz processor: Believe me Symbian is by born very efficient. If u ever own a Mac and try to run a Windows 7 in a virtual machine then u know how slow it is. Processor doesn't define speed. I started with a 233MHz pentium processor with 32MB RAM which ran Windows 98 extremely fast with all Office applications, a bunch of productivity apps and a host of games. To give a recent example look at Windows Vista, which runs very slow on the same computer compared to Windows 7 or Mac OS X!2. N8 has only 256MB RAM: Again u don't need that much RAM. The Symbian^3 has \"Writable data paging\" which works like virtual memory. And don't forget, Symbian is built from ground up to be battery, memory and processor efficient. No other OS (including Android) claims that feat.So, in conclusion, if u r looking for a very modern looking user interface, go for iPhone (or Android). But if u r like me who shops for functionality (and who dreams to carry only one gadget (no GPS, no camera, no Apple remote etc.)) then surely u should give N8 a serious thought. And don't let naysayers fool u with usability issues.

Needs more buttons. Decent camera.", "Author": "U Lala", "ReviewID": "R3KZQPXLWRFYHX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Reception: Very good. Has two mics, one for talking and one in the back for noise cancellation, so call quality is very good on both ends. The speaker next to your ear is loud and clear.Body: The screen is glass so you don't need a screen protector. The anodized/painted aluminum finish is sturdy, but way too slippery. I would strongly recommend getting a silicone case or something.Camera: Shame on Nokia for cramming 12MP into a 1/1.8\" sensor. I'd be happy with 8. This practice should be heavily frowned upon. The autofocus is very fast but not exactly razor sharp. ISO performance is decent, which is expected for a 1/1.8\" sensor. The flash is pretty weak, so this camera has to crank up the ISO to compensate, which unfortunately degrades photo quality. I personally prefer a wider angle, around 28mm but that is just personal preference. That said, it is still probably the best camera available on a phone. Pictures come out pretty bland and soft on default settings. I hate that you can't save the default processing settings to \"Vivid\" and a little higher contrast. Every time you turn on the camera it resets these settings to factory defaults.Interface: It often takes too many clicks to go places and type things. The touchscreen sensors aren't as well tuned as any of the iphones. I always feel like I could use more buttons. For instance, if you're using the music player, and the phone auto-locked but you want to change the track, you have to unlock it before you can do anything. Same if you want to turn the player off. On my old Sony Ericsson candybar phone, you can press the play/pause button because there is a dedicated play/pause button. If you want to change the track, you hold down the volume button and it changes track, or tap the volume button to change volume. On the N8 if you hold down the volume rocker it rapidly changes the volume. There is also a serious lack of dedicated \"cancel\" or \"back\" button, commonly found on almost all Samsung or Sony Ericsson phones. What's the point of having a touch screen you're still only going have two \"soft keys\" up front and hide most of the options in a submenu?Organizer: I hate that you can't set an alarm to recursively ring on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Yes you can set it to ring on \"workdays\" only and then set the \"workdays\" but I like to have several custom alarms and this doesn't do it for me. The workaround is to set 3 different alarms on the calendar on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and then make them recurring every week. The problem with the calendar alarm is that if it rings and you don't hit snooze in time, it will not ring again. It will auto shut off. Lame. And why, in the Notes app, do I have to click 3 different things to even begin typing? It should be one click. ONE! Or two at the most.GPS Navigation: It takes about 10-20 seconds for the GPS to track down your location. It's great that you can download maps and use it offline, but the interface and user experience is much inferior to Google Maps, and the same can be said for the search feature. So, I just use Google Maps. But yeah if you're stuck in the middle of nowhere with no cell/internet reception, at least you can figure out where you are.Web surfing: The default web browser is sluggish and annoying, but Opera Mobile is a very suitable (albeit buggy and crashy) replacement. Too bad Opera can't do Flash yet but at least it can do Youtube.Texting: The keyboard is OK, not the best ever but I can live with it.Battery Life: With moderate useage it will not last more than 2 days.This phone will not satisfy your thirst for instant gratification. It will do almost everything, just not necessarily as well as you would like. $550 is a lot to pay, but who wants to carry around an extra camera everywhere? I suppose if you are of the purse-carrying variety, this should not pose a problem. Other than that, a mediocre picture is better than no picture, and a decent picture is even better. I think I will keep it, but if I had to do it all over again, I would do more research into other models.UPDATE: 11/18 Just found out about an application called Swype, which makes the keyboard about a billion times better (only works in Landscape mode, Portrait mode is the same).Apparently the alarm can only snooze for ~45 minutes, which is just plain sucky. I like a good hour and a half of snoozing, darn it! I suppose I could work around it by setting a second alarm 54 minutes after the first one... yes...UPDATE: 11/27 Just found out you can set your own scene mode in camera settings and save it as the default scene mode, so yes you can save the settings.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "The BEST phone ever", "Author": "Bookworm \"bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q6QYV5MWM3CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What more can I do with it (compared to iPhone or Android):1.

The N8 also uses a faster GPU than the iPhone 4 (SOC GPU), called the Broadcom BMC2727, for a great gaming experience which you can also pipe directly to an HD TV and play on the big screen.  It also comes with free turn by turn navigation, available in 74 countries. Of course, its a Nokia so Video Call capability is a given.

Navigate anytime with a fantastic GPS module and free life time navigation (including turn by turn voice navigation with street names, lane guidance, speed limit warning, traffic etc.!!). Go buy crap GPS software for iPhone for a huge price (last time checked was more than 50$) and even then that won't even come close to Nokia navigation. Don't forget Nokia owns Navteq (the worlds largest map producer)2. Transmit FM and play it on your car music system (iPhone doesn't even have a FM receiver)3. The best camera (those of u who read the misleading review of endgadget, if u r really reading my review, then u r serious and go ahead to search on google to find zillions of unbiased camera review, comparing N8 even against DSLR)4. Pentaband network support, which would let you use the phone with both AT&T; and T-Mobile 3g network!!5. Dolby surround sound output6. USB on the go (which means you could connect your USB device with the phone!)7. Bluetooth 3.08. The only OS that has a very complete bluetooth stack implementation (perhaps too technical for some of the readers) that allows u to even control ur powerpoint presentation with ur cellphone (using salling clicker). The poor iPhone guys, no ur phone doesn't have that functionality (crippled at OS level)9. The OS that gives superb battery life (anyone using Symbian would testify for this)10. The freedom that comes with an open OS (OK, Android is also open)11. The most configurable and complete enterprise wireless stack (trust me, I never ever had any problem to configure my Nokia phones for the most convoluted enterprise wireless network!)12. A built in completely integrated VOIP support. You won't even notice that u r using VOIP. And trust me, if u know how to use VOIP effectively, u could save a huge amount on your phone bill13. The ability to work as Bluetooth HSPA modem (or even create Wifi hotspot with third party software)14. The TRUE TRUE TRUE multi tasking. Yes that's three TRUEs. No one else (including the upcoming Windows Phone 7) supports true multi-tasking. If u ever use Symbian multitasking, u would hate to use others' sham multitasking15. Many many ... can't list. Feeling tired :( Users are welcome to comment and add additional pros and cons. I am sure there will be Nokia fanboys and iPhone and Android fanboys.What can't I do (or can't do so well):1. The UI (yes iPhone and Android have better intuitive UI)2. I can't fart with my mobile (but I do have all the apps that I would ever need: e.g. call screening software, office software, pdf reader, flash support, email solution, the entire Oxford, cambridge or a host of other dictionaries etc.)3. Zillions of games that you may avail on iPhone, u may not have on Nokia yet (believe me it's changing fast). BTW, N8 has a faster GPU than iPhone4!Now some misleading media propaganda:1. N8 has only 680 MHz processor: Believe me Symbian is by born very efficient. If u ever own a Mac and try to run a Windows 7 in a virtual machine then u know how slow it is. Processor doesn't define speed. I started with a 233MHz pentium processor with 32MB RAM which ran Windows 98 extremely fast with all Office applications, a bunch of productivity apps and a host of games. To give a recent example look at Windows Vista, which runs very slow on the same computer compared to Windows 7 or Mac OS X!2. N8 has only 256MB RAM: Again u don't need that much RAM. The Symbian^3 has \"Writable data paging\" which works like virtual memory. And don't forget, Symbian is built from ground up to be battery, memory and processor efficient. No other OS (including Android) claims that feat.So, in conclusion, if u r looking for a very modern looking user interface, go for iPhone (or Android). But if u r like me who shops for functionality (and who dreams to carry only one gadget (no GPS, no camera, no Apple remote etc.)) then surely u should give N8 a serious thought. And don't let naysayers fool u with usability issues. Believe me, with just couple of days of use, every unintuitive UI would become intuitive (I am a Symbian veteran and it feels very intuitive to me).", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great hardware, web browser needs work", "Author": "Michael Papile", "ReviewID": "R1KLQAB7UEQI8S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hello this review has been updated and lowered in rating.  We have 2 N8s and both of them froze and died.  This is a problem for many people and I would not recommend this phone until Nokia fixes this issue.Here are my pros and cons about this phone.  I have owned a lot of top smartphones, so I figured I would highlight what I find excels and what lags current crop.  Overall it is a very good phone.Pros:  Camera - The camera is pretty much perfect.  You can tell they put a lot of time into it because the software works well and the pictures are great.  There simply is no better camera out there on a phone.  Construction - This is a very attractive, and study phone.  I have no doubt it will last a long time, it is very nicely engineered  Battery Life - Battery lasts longer than any other smartphone I have used.  Memory-  People criticise the lack of ram, but I have not run out of ram ever, and actually having more ram wastes battery.  Radios - Pentaband phone, not very common.  This will work everywhere on earth pretty much.  Navigation - Free, no data connection needed and works very well.  GPS works better than any other phone I have used. Syncs fast and works even without view of sky.  Sports Tracker - It is awesome!  OMAP processor - Do not listen to MHZ junkies, this processor is very nice because it handles  Connectivity - This phone is the first one I have ever had that switches between Wifi, 3G etc seemlessly and shuts off data when phone not in use.  Very well done.  HDMI out/video - works well and default player plays nearly any format you throw at it.  even MKV files.Cons  Web Browser - After using the maemo browser on n900 I realize how good mobile browsing should be.  The default browser sucks bad.  I know they are coming out with update, but that is no excuse, should ship with good browser  On screen keyboard - It is terrible, Opera mini did it right on N8 why can nokia not do it.  Screen - The resolution is relatively low for modern smart phones.  It looks very nice, but when you view pages zoomed out text is garbled due to lack of resolution.  I have pretty good vision so I like to read tiny text rather than zoom in.  UI - Symbian is a perfectly fine OS, but the UI is inconsistent.  Some areas you hit enter to have setting go, some you have to hit check then ok, some menus go away when you touch shaded part etc.  Nothing is consistent.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "vx", "ReviewID": "R3EFW9PHQKFAMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do actually have this phone (ordered it from NokiaUSA and got it on time since im close by IN).This phone is for the Symbian lover wanting a new experience, unlike S60 5th edition. And this phone delivers.Construction and hardware wise, it is perfect (no removable batteries my gripe, but oh well). The camera is fantastic and may even replace your stand alone camera. Feels great in your hands too.The software..its what S60 5th Edition should have been...the music player, only 1 touch tapping, multitouch are ALL welcome editions. Do not use the ovi maps that come with it, go to beta labs and use OVI maps there...it has multitouch etc. Am thoroughly enjoying it...where they can improve is the web browser and calendar.Web browser will get an update in Nov from beta labs...will include better multitouch and a brand new look/feel, much like (n900 etc).All in all, this is what we want, something new but keeping the familiarity.Good job Nokia..looking forward to your N9", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Needs more applications, but great phone overall.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1COM1444RNP3R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would rate it as 4.5 stars if Amazon lets me.I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now. Before getting this phone I also considered getting an Android phone or upgrading to iPhone 4. I had an iPhone 3g before which is a great phone, but overall based on my top preferences I switched to Nokia N8. Of course I also thought about the price since the N8 gets no subsidies from any carrier, but I realized I can just sell whatever iPhone I get when I renew my contract (oh and the data plan is cheaper for the N8, please read on).CAMERA: #1 reason. I wasn't satisfied with iPhone's weak camera. Even my much older phone (2006 model) had 5mp and a flash! I also had an option to upgrade to iPhone 4 with 5mp camera to even it out, but 2010 that is below par compared to most high end phones. Besides, I also dont really like bringing my digital camera. I like to travel light and not worry about forgetting my camera. Top Andriod phones have 8mp, which by megapixel count would have been good enough for me. But I want something closer to a dedicated digital camera - which translates to Xenon flash and larger camera sensor size. Overall, picture quality is great. It takes 2-3 seconds to turn it on, which is just a bit slower to compact cameras.GPS Voice Navigation: It's free, as fast as my brother's Garmin to load and locate, and has turn-by-turn voice navigation. Google Maps is nowhere close to this. I am really bad at multitasking and the worst I can do is look at my phone or printed maps for directions while driving. Android has pretty good voice navigation too.DATA PLAN: I'm with AT&T; right now and I dislike being forced to pay for smartphone data plan that I don't use! I unlocked my iPhone and installed something so it would use 0 data, but AT&T; still detected the iPhone regardless and began charging me. Maybe I did something wrong with the unlocking. Anyways, AT&T; doesnt recognize the N8 as a smartphone so I can either get $15 unlimited data plan or no data plan at all whenever I want. In the long run that saves $15 a month if either right now you are paying $30 right unlimited or $15 for data plan you dont use. x24 months if I had been on a 2 year contract. That's $360 total! Compensates for the big initial expense.The N8 has other good features such as great build quality (no cheap plastic feeling), penta band (when I go abroad), and HDMI out (which is super fun to use for games,  pictures, and movies). But overall the three above are my top reasons for buying it.However, despite all these great features, the N8 definitely falls behind with applications. There's the \"oh most iPhone and Android apps are junks anyways,\" but I could say the same about Nokia. I'm not really an apps person, but I do miss most of the games from my iPhone. It's still a pretty new phone so hopefully new games would come out. At least N8 has Angry Birds... I wont give it 5 stars until more non-junk apps become available.In summary, if you want an all-in-one phone with great camera and GPS navigation and don't really care about applications and mobile internet, then this phone is perfect. But if you do a lot of gaming and social apps like Facebook, this phone might be disappointing.Hope this helps!", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia N8- a should-be leader in the smart phone market", "Author": "mea032", "ReviewID": "R1DLMYSTH39232", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a previous owner of other rival phones (e.g.- iPhone, Android, Blackberry), I am extremely satisfied with the overall performance of Nokia's new arrival, the N8.  After a week of use, I find myself being continuously impressed and rarely disappointed.  Its most stand-out feature, of course, being the beefy 12 MP Carl Zeiss camera. The capabilities and features embodied in this addition rival most stand-alone digital cameras.  The editing tools and other options, via apps and widgets pertaining to the camera, just add to the already impressive capabilities of the hardware.Also, the Cymbian^3 OS is an improvement from previous Nokia OSs and it is way ahead of its competitors in terms of stability and overall function. Most surprising is the ease at which the phone can be navigated and settings can be modified.  Like with most open-source phones, every ounce of memory and seemingly limitless control is at the user's fingertips.  The interface is very easy-to-use and Nokia provides many useful tips in the form of notifications, which can be disabled if necessary, to inform the user about some capabilities that may be passing them by.Going back to hardware, the phone has a number of convenient attributes. The scratch-resistant, and nearly damage-proof, gorilla glass screen is something all phones should consider using in the future.  This is one of the few phones that manages to combine durability and responsiveness, without making any sacrifices.  The HDMI and mini-USB jacks are a wonderful addition as well when you consider the opportunities they provide.I could continue to praise every little thing about this phone, but I should conclude with a few notable shortcomings. Most apparent, especially for those who previously owned an iPhone or Android phone, would be the severe lack of apps on the Ovi store. Those users interested in frivolous, time-wasting apps will not be satisfied with the currently destitute app store. Although many of the apps and widgets available are not geared toward fun as much as function, previous users of those app-rich phones might feel lost in the world of Nokia. Another downfall is the standard web browser for the N8. Its clunky, non-responsive operations seem out of place in the phone's otherwise efficient OS.  Fortunately, Nokia is aware of this issue and it is something that can easily be improved via a simple update.  Finally, like many phones of its kind, battery life may prove to be a hindrance.  It is difficult to say that the battery life of the N8 is any worse than any of its competitors and users can easily figure out ways of improving battery life. I only note this because I have been led to believe, by several reviews, that this phone boasted an extremely long battery life, while what I am experiencing is average at best.In closing, I can honestly say that this is the best phone that I have ever used in terms of overall capability, reliability, and durability. Those of you looking for the next big thing, deciding between the iPhone or Android, or even just looking to try something new, I implore you to give the Nokia N8 a shot.

Rose", "ReviewID": "RCSWCL0XKWOQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About a month ago, I ordered five of these so I could see each color before purchasing one.  All colors were very impressive but I went with the blue.  My wife, who was not in the market for a phone, saw the green one and wanted it immediately.  So we have two.  My prior phone was a Nokia N900 which I used for a little over a year.  I really liked the N900 but decided to try the N8 because it appeared the Maemo software on the N900 was turning into more of an Nokia experiment.  I could be wrong but enhancements and upgrades for that phone seemed unlikely.  Most of our friends have IPhones so for just that reason we didn't want one.The N8 was a very impressive surprise.  The looks and design make it cross into a more elegant catagory.  It's kind of like taking off an average looking wrist watch and replacing it with a Rolex or Omega.Below are the pros and cons.Pros:1.  The size (particularly the width) and weight are perfect for using one hand to perform functions.  The width of many popular smart phones make one handed use awkward.  Also the phone is all aluminum, a fact that distinguishes it from 99% of the competition whose phones are all plastic.  This is a visable and tangible difference, one you definately feel when you pick up this phone.2.  The glass is a special material (gorilla glass)and we've noticed that occaisional miscues that might have put small permanent marks or  scratches on our other screens don't faze this one.  We purchased Zagg protective film but decided not to use it unless it becomes necessary.3.  For calls and music, my N900 had two separate speakers and the sound was very good.  The one speaker on the N8, actually sounds better and is much louder.4.  As noted by others, the photos and videos taken with this phone are in a class of their own.  The end product is superior to most dedicated cameras.5.  Battery life:  For both my wife and I, who are middle of the road users, the battery lasts a solid two days and even more depending on the usage.  We typically charge on the third day.  I was charging every night with the N900.  As a side note, the N8 has an attractive analog clock and day/date screen saver that we leave on all the time and it seems to have little or no effect on battery life.6.  This is a small item, but the N8 provides the means to have a wrist strap.  I typically put the phone in my pants pocket with the wrist strap in position to grab when I hear the ring.  I got used to this on the N900 after a few months and found it very handy to use in many situations.7.  When you press and hold down the \"call\" button, you are prompted to say the name of the contact you wish to call.  The N8 brings up that contact, along with others that may have the same sounding name.  If you don't interrupt the process, the selected contact is called.  This is not a hit and miss thing.  For the most part, it's pretty accurate particularly as you become more familiar with what the phone likes to hear.  This same voice command also works for calling up applications.8.  There is a feature that will record phone conversations.  This recorder can be used for any purpose, business meetings, family arguments etc.9.  There is a second camera on the screen side of the phone for use with applications like Skype.10.  All of the on board applications perform as expected or better in some cases.  As far as we are concerned, all the hype about symbian being inferior to \"whatever\" is just that, hype.  Personally, I feel a very high percentage of users do not enter into a zone where using symbian is going to hamper their use of a smart phone.11.  Along with the typical useless programs, Ovi store also has several good ones.  For example, we loaded \"Swype\" which is a text entering program.  On the virtual keyboard, you move your finger across the keyboard and without lifting your finger, stop at the letters you want.  After you've completed the word, you lift your finger and the word is inserted into the text.  A little hard to explain but it's pretty cool.  Another one is \"Own Voice\" which is a program where you record your voice as the one that gives GPS instructions.  i.e.  \"Turn left...no no, your other left.\"12.  I guess it goes without saying that as a phone, Nokia has always been a little ahead of the curve and the N8 is no exception.  Reliable excellent call quality and ease of use.On the con side:1.  It seems to me that the camera lens should be covered when not in use.  It hasn't really been an issue with us but it just looks like something that should have been addressed.2.  The speaker slot is located in the camera lens housing which protrudes out from the phone.  If the phone is tipped just slightly forward when laying on a table, the speaker slot gets blocked off and a ringing phone will not be heard.  The difference between hearing and not hearing the phone is only about 1/32 of an inch from the phone being perfectly flat.  The Nokia silicone cover emiminates this issue.3.  I found the Nokia Ovi Suite for the PC something of a challenge.  Not exactly user friendly.  Loading programs was cumbersome and a lot of the times didn't work.  I found the majority of the problems I encountered were due to me not using the correct procedure or starting from the right screen.  However, I also found that making a mistake was usually the only way to effectively get the correct procedure.  In any case, there's been an update and between that update and me learning about what not to do, things seem better.So in conclusion, Both my wife and I feel the N8 is an exceptional smart phone.  Stylish, functional and elegant.Update:  I've had the N8 for 8 months now and must say it continues to be amazing.  I've had no problems of any kind.  Even though I've been pulling it in and out of my front pants pocket the whole time, there is not one mark on the gorilla glass.  Looks like it did when new.  It's overall handsome exterior still grabs admiring comments.  I back-up my data frequently because if I was to lose this phone, I would definately get another N8.  I've seen the new E7 with the slide-out qwerty keyboard and although very similar and tempting, it's missing the FM transmitter and the wrist strap holes like the N8.  Also, I've been told that although the E7 screen measures larger, the actual display is only slightly bigger than that of the N8.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Front Pocket Wonder", "Author": "Private Citizen", "ReviewID": "R3HRYRHNOSV6NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll not get into the debate about which smart phone has the best operating system, the most apps or the fastest processor as I could care less.I wanted a great camera phone and this is the best one - hands down.

I personally waited until I received it from Nikon USA about a week ago, used it for a while, then I thought about writing the review.I have a Blackberry Curve 8300 and I own an iPod touch (3d Gen), I never owned a Nokia phone before, and I feel very comfortable and amazed by many of the features on the Nokia N8. The hardware of this device is exceptional, in my opinion. The camera, HDMI, USB connectivity are all very nice features. The screen resolution, although not as high as an iPhone but felt that it is more than enough for me. I edited images and watched videos on this device with no problems at all, the quality was excellent. This device comes with an internal 16Gb memory + a micro SD card slot (up to 32 Gb additional memory), more than $200 cheaper than the iPhone.The software and operating system though have some room for improvement. Although operating the phone was simple and mostly straight forward, but some features could be better, such as the calendar (operational but can be improved in terms of its look and ease of use) and selecting/copying/pasting text (a feature that I still don't know how to do on the N8 but was simple and easy on the iPod).I looked for the following options when I thought about buying a new phone:1- Price: the price shouldn't be inflated2- Calendar Sync with MS Outlook: essential for my work and everyday use3- Good music player: I have a bunch of lectures and songs that I rely mainly on my phone in my car while traveling (I currently use an audio tape with cord) - The N8 has the FM transmitter feature which is very useful too (I was able to play a small movie for my kids on the phone and let them hold the phone in the back seat with no cables .. they considered it cool!)4- WiFi connectivity: I'm not a big fan of the data plans!5- Nice contact manager: Nice one on the N8 - the Ovi Suite Synced my contacts and my calendar easily and in a very simple way.There are a bunch of other features that I still did not explore on the phone (GPS, HDMI, Voice commands ...etc), but those I presented were the most important ones and the N8 did a great job to address all of my needs.In summary, I believe that Nokia is in the right track with touch screen interface, the OS is operating finely and have very nice features too, shortcuts, widgets, customizable home screens (3) all of those are working in a slick and smooth manner.The phone signal is working well, the call quality is excellent, people have been commending the quality of voice when I call them too.In one sentence: Excellent job Nokia.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera, But The UI Is Holding It Back", "Author": "Douglas Auchter", "ReviewID": "R8YYK7E54ZJHA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been a Nokia user for years, owning a number of their Symbian phones (N75-3, N95-3, E71-2, E72-2, N97-3). I was eager to get this because it appeared as if it was Symbian 5th (S^1) done correctly which is what I was looking for, not to mention the camera really sucked me in. It's been a month and a half since I began using this as my primary device, and I've spent considerable time using it and comparing it to my N97 and Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S).Overall, the N8 doesn't appear to me to be a completely finished product software wise. While comparing it to my N97, I noticed that a number of features that I found very to be useful and loved were gone, like the customizable equalizer in the music player (I'm hoping Nokia gives it back to us in the next firmware update), and the GPS Data application that we always had. Still, there were other things that made me wonder what the software developers were doing during the testing phase of Symbian^3, like how there's no way to send an MMS message that gets stuck in your Outbox, or how there's no menu option to add a song to a playlist from the Now Playing screen like there was in S^1. There are plenty of other examples I can give as well, not to mention all the inconsistencies across the UI. But it's not all bad. In fact there's a lot to like about it.Here's what I liked about it:The camera is fantastic but it will take some time to really master it. Nevertheless its really easy to take a very good quick shot of something, and did I mention how real the coloring is? The days of fake reds and yellows are gone. Video recording is very good. It may not be quite as smooth as the iPhone 4, but there's no overexposure problems, coloring is real, and the audio is by far the best on the market. You can edit your photos and videos right on the phone, unlike with my Captivate, and thank you Nokia for still putting a very good camera button on the side of the phone unlike some other phone makers who don't have one at all (I can't stand that about a lot of Android phones). Reception is typical Nokia aka top notch, and phone calls are crystal clear. I love Nokia's Profile's that allow you to personalize your ringers and tones, and create and customize your own so you can have different ones for different times of the day. Build quality is very good; the best next to the E71. HDMI will actually display the whole UI on your TV unlike certain Android phones which only display your videos. It has a microSD card slot that's easily accessible and USB OTG which allows you to connect any FAT32 formatted flash drive to the phone which is really cool. Finally we have multiple homescreens on Symbian, and you can still create folders in the application menu to organize all your apps just like we've always been able to do. I love the home key that doubles as a notification light and I'm glad its a physical key. Ovi Sync which backs up your contacts, calendar and notes to a server is great. Ovi Maps (v3.06 which does not come with the phone because it's still in beta but has multitouch) is really good. The GPS on this is the best I have ever seen. The single speaker is actually pretty loud (though my N95-3 still sounds louder). Finally we have threaded SMS although it's not done properly. Video playback is very good and it has a long list of formats that will work. The music player UI looks good but is missing key features that were there in my N97 that I always used. However, I really like how disconnecting your headphones while music is playing pauses the song. Also, the volume seems to have more intervals than in previous Nokia's. I like how this isn't always connected via a data connection like a lot of Android devices (My Captivate eats through data because so many apps are constantly downloading information, like Facebook, Twitter, Weather apps, etc). Haptic feedback is really good, and at times you will really think you're actually pressing a real button. Love how it has a front facing camera unlike practically everything you get today from the carriers (thank you unlocked phone market). Love the screen saver that shows the time and any notifications. The battery will get you through the day as long as you aren't syncing email at all times during the day or running any homescreen widgets all the time like Accuweather. I was pleasantly surprised about that, although, if you're going out on Friday night and you did a lot of web browsing during the day, charge it before you go out. Ovi Suite, as much as it still needs work, is really nice to have since you can use it to back up your phone data and download maps to your phone for Ovi Maps. I love how the phone can connect to your computer as a storage device and NOT have to be used through a specific software like iTunes. I like how you can set any song you have as a ringtone, and you can do this through the music player too (again thanks to it being unlocked). The email client has a great implementation of pinch to zoom unlike the Gmail client on my Captivate which has none or the email application on it, which does a poor job of it. Leave it to Nokia to give you multitasking without rules or limits, and I like the familiar Symbian feel it still has to it.What I didn't like:There is no customizable equalizer to fine tune the sound in the music player (only presets that don't do much of anything). The non-removable battery, no matter what you try and tell me, will always be something I don't like. Don't bother using red-eye reduction before taking a photo because it just makes the subjects' eyes look weird. Just edit the photo afterwards. I personally find the 3.5\" display to be a little too narrow (a 3.7\" would have been better. There are no stereo speakers like on previous Nseries. There's a number of missing menu options that should otherwise be there, the settings menu needs to be restructured badly, and there are too many UI inconsistencies. The Facebook and Twitter apps are terrible compared to ones you get on Android. There is no portrait QWERTY, the landscape QWERTY is not designed like it should be (like the ones on Android, iOS), and the current keyboard takes up the entire display. Certain aspects of the UI are too small to be finger friendly. I find the homescreen switch button to be pointless and think it should be a customizable shortcut instead. The email client is slow and does not display HTML correctly all the time. 256MB of RAM is acceptable but 512MB of RAM would have been much better for every type of user. But I do push this phone hard. Kinetic scrolling speed is not consistent across the UI. In some applications a quick flick will give you a fast scroll, and in other applications it will give you a medium pace scroll. The phone is slower than it should be at times, like when browsing through your loaded SMS Inbox, and when Ovi Sync is running. There are the unnecessary annoying connection notifications which I can't stand, and I don't like how tapping on a link in a text message results in a pop-up instead of simply opening the link. The web browser needs at lot of work UI and page loading wise. I'm still getting all those (you are now leaving a secure website...) prompts when I just want to get to my web page. There is a slight hesitation on the first pinch to zoom in the photo gallery. Only 3 homescreens while Android has 7. The camera UI needs work, and by work, I mean completely redone. No LED flash means no flashlight/video light. There's no touch to focus in the camera for stills or video recording, and you will be cleaning the camera lens a lot. The number of apps available for the U.S. market is a joke compared to Android and iOS's app catalog. Smart dialing only looks for names instead of both names and numbers.As much as I really wanted to love this phone, I can't because of the software and all the things that were left out. Until the software gets updated and the UI gets redone, and all the things that are missing get put back in, I can only give this 3 stars overall, even though it definitely has the potential to get 5. Don't get me wrong, I like this phone, and I'm going to keep it, but I'm not completely happy with it yet. Maybe in January I will be. As far as recommending this, it's the best choice if you want a camera phone, but until the app store starts getting the top 100 apps in the Android Market and iTunes App Store, I really can't recommend this to anyone in the U.S. market who just wants a nice smartphone.For those who have Nokia phones, and are looking at getting this, it's better than anything else Nokia has offered at this point. But that's really not saying much. Symbian^3 is good, but not where it needs to be. Thankfully, there is an update planned for Q1 next year that will bring a lot of changes, but only a few which are known at this point, like the portrait QWERTY. I would wait until that update comes, and then make your decision. Also, there is a second update planned for Q3 next year where the UI will be redone.For those who have Android devices or an iPhone, I highly doubt that you'll like Symbian as it is now. In fact, I know you won't since I also own the Captivate. UI wise it's a step backwards and the app store doesn't have anywhere near the number of U.S. centric apps the other two platforms have. Unless you really want a great camera/media device/phone, I really think that you'll be more disappointed with this than anything, even with all the little things the N8 can do that others can't. Maybe after the upcoming software update, it might be more appealing, but again, if you want apps, there aren't that many good ones. Try it for yourself though. Maybe you'll like it.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Na, Na, Na, Now I'm Feeling So Great Like An N8", "Author": "massaskillz", "ReviewID": "R145TRXS6PEF1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from Amazon two weeks ago and I've been playing around with it since. In my opinion, this is the BEST Nokia phone to date. Now, before reading any further, I'll give some background information about me so whoever is reading this can possibly relate and continue reading OR not relate and move onto another review:- I'm a male, age 25-30.- Consider myself pretty technologically savvy (career is in IT).- Previous phones: Motorola Razr, then Nokia N95 8GB, and now Nokia N8.- Originally purchased an iPhone 4 16GB, but didn't like the feel of the phone in my hand (Nokia N8 has a better feel), and was not fond of the simplicity of the iPhone 4.- I like being somewhat different and not having a phone that the majority have (although if everybody started buying an N8 now, I wouldn't sell mine and get another kind).- Live in Canada (had a friend bring this over for me) and use this with Rogers Wireless and it works great!So here's a breakdown of what I like and don't like about the Nokia N8.What I LIKE about the:Camera- 12 megapixel camera takes great quality pictures! You can do normal view and also take widescreen shots.- There's a Nokia Panaroma app that stitches together pictures for you! Great for taking landscape pictures!- HD recording is amazing--the video and sound recorded is surprising.- There's a built-in lens cover that automatically opens up and closes unlike my N95.- Built-in image editing (i.e. no need for a Fat Booth app--you can edit yourself and edit even more things!)- Looking at pictures and watching video is great on the screen.Call Quality- Crystal clear. Didn't have a problem with N95, and same goes for Nokia N8Keyboard/Texting- Despite other people complaining about a lack of a qwerty keyboard in portrait mode, I actually prefer the numeric keypad using T9. The buttons are bigger, so it's easier for one-handed texting.Homescreen- 3 customizable homescreens. I use 2 though--one for apps, and one to see a list of my e-mails from Gmail and Hotmail, my notes/reminders, and the music player.Music Player- Very easy to use, FM transmitter works great.Syncing Contacts/Calendar- I was able to sync my google contacts and calendar using Mail for Exchange.Gorilla Glass Screen- My girlfriend prematurely took off the screen protector that came with the phone, and I freaked out thinking it would get imperfected before I got a chance to put on a different screen protector. Now, I'm actually considering not putting anything on it at all. There has been no scratches--anything and everything that has gotten on it was able to get wiped off.Maps/GPS- Free maps and navigation for life! GPS finds my location very quickly.- Ovi Maps is great and is constantly improving. They teamed up with TripAdvisor to give you a feature that will provide information on restaurants, shopping, sights, etc based on your location on the GPS---so you can read reviews of things that are close to you!Battery- I charged it fully before using and then discharged it fully for the second usage.- Takes about 2 hours on an empty battery to a full charge.- I was able to get 2 full days of moderately heavy usage on the phone before the battery ran out.- Now I try to keep the battery charged up as much as possible to maintain its life.What I DISLIKE about the:Call Quality- The other person on the other line sometimes reports hearing their own voice speaking, but I can't conclude whether this is the fault of the phone, or the wireless service, because it has happened just a few times.Vibration- Okay, well this isn't really a problem anymore, but I know other users have complained that when the phone is on silent/pager mode, the vibration when getting a text message is to quick and weak. Well that's because the default \"Ringing Type\" setting is set of OFF. You need to set it to \"BEEP ONCE\" and you'll get a nice long vibration alerting you of your incoming text messages.Music- There's not button on the sides to go control your music (I'm used to having accessible buttons like the N95), but it's not that big of an issue for me.Maps/GPS- There is no overview of all the turns/roads you need to take to reach your destination, which I'm sure (hopefully) they will add in a future update.Apps- Lots of people complain about the lack of apps, and so do I. But this phone is still new, and I'm looking forward to more and more development of different apps for it.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I got what I wanted in a phone with lots of customization, great camera, and great build quality to last for some time.

Let me tell you this phone has a great quality build and great spec's. The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a \"point and shoot\" camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.I have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.Constant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.Overall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your \"point and shoot\" camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase.

I downloaded maps for usa, canada,mexcio,china and hongkong along with street name prompt voice in English(us) and mandarin(china) within 2 hours. no need to bother data plan.I am currently owning Garmin 765, Tomtom 540XL and Megellan 4700. Nokia n8 is the best among them due to its super fast gpu, 16GB flash memory, crisp AMOLED screen at highest resolution (640x360),super loud speaker and multi-touch capacitive screen. (Garmin 765 is slow in rendering and touch input is buggy, Tomtom 540xl tele atlas map is not as presice as navteq for usa, megellan 4700 is poor in rendering vector maps due to its screen resolution and bad bluetooth).The 12 mega pixel buit-in camera surpasses my 10 mega pixels Canon point and shoot camera A1000. Night shot is even better than my 18 mega pixels Canon T2 DSLR. but it takes some time to get used to since looks like it doesn't come with image stablization altough it is supported in vedio recording, user has to slowly and gently press down the camera button to take a picture even after haivng fully focused.Nokia n8 has managed networks nicely, it is fully  customizable for prority to use 3.5G, Edge, wifi. default is wifi, 3.5G then at&t; edge for internet. it allow user to create different network destination and select one as default. main internect apps allow user to choose customized network destionations.Nokia mail supports yahoo, msn, gmail, etc and microsoft exchange server, user can manage all various email accounts in one place and it supports archive folers for yahoo mail. there is a minor bug,  due to its push email feature, it keeps turning on wifi if it is available even when user exits nokia mail application and turns off wifi manually. i believe this minor bug can be fixed easily when nokia are ready to update.another potential problem is that it can not show chinese/japanese/korean due to the location setting of usa and the missing of fonts library. nokia may formally allow user to download and install the east asian fonts. curretly it shows China map in Chienes pingyin. for chinese web pages and contacts it shows rectangular box instead which needs to be fixed as nokia promtotes the conecting of people.fring works fine with n8, it can be downloaded from ovi store right from the phone and it is free, it supports instant messenging (fring, msn,gtalk, yahoo,etc), video call and voip call. no need to bother skype which is not available for nokia n8.the built-in web browser is already very nice to show web pages with multi-touch to zoom, flash to play youtube, java 2.1 to play java game. so I haven't tried the opera 10 or opera mini-browser 5.1.FM radio can be directed to its own loud speaker though it is still required to plug-in the accompanied headset as an antenna. FM radio is super sensitive, can pick weak signal, and sends out better sound than lexus car stereo, sadisk sansa FM radio. super basss is excellent but don't know how to disable it, looks like nokia n8 doesn't have built-in Equalizer application, should be easy to find one over ovi store.as always, nokia n8 is a phone with excellent signal and voice at both ends. rock-solid built. looks and feels noble. can last for at least 4 years.I bought it for my kid's usage during her University study.

It's the best phone I ever had. So far no problems with it. My most annoying issue was with the Skype mobile app under the old Symbian OS. The phone was slow and unresponsive if you leave the app open for two long. I believe the app had memory leak issues and/or other bugs. No problems so far with other apps (and no more issues with Skype under Belle) - works perfect right out of the box.So far my disappointments:- Amazon doesn't ship it with a 16 GB micro SD card (as stated on the Nokia USA site).- It doesn't support T-Mobile's UMA (WiFi calling without using your minutes and having WiFi reception at areas with bad coverage). This was important to me, as my previous Nokia 6301 had UMA and I was with the impression that this one will support it as well. Keep this in mind if you're planning to use it on US T-mobile.- No SWIPE keyboard - not a big deal but still ... (Fixed after software update)- No standard QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode. I believe this can be enabled through the settings (haven't done it yet), so it's not a huge issue for me. (Fixed after software update)- The inbuilt browser is a bit clunky. Opera Mini is much better and has an outstanding keyboard - a must have. (Fixed after software update)So far what I like:- Great call quality for both voice and video calls.- Excellent signal/reception.- 12 MP camera with outstanding picture quality. Carl Zeiss lenses - it doesn't get much better than this! The flash is not that good but still get's the job done in close distance. Outdoor pics/videos are amazing. Side note: I just got back from Hawaii and took hundreds of pictures and movies. People don't believe me that those were taken with a phone. Outstanding quality. You just have to play a bit with the manual settings/scene modes and you get stunning results (if you know what you're doing). Does a good job even on auto though! Probably the best phone camera out there at the moment!- Video recording in HD - 30 fps.- Outstanding build quality.- Good battery life. It has power saving mode which gives you quite an extra usage.- HDMI out with 5.1 Dolby digital sound.- FM transmitter - scans the stations fast. No issues with it.- Good GPS which can be used in offline mode. Just download the maps that you need and you're good to go. Good voice commands - it warns you if you're speeding (unlike my old Garmin). The GPS (with screen on) drains the  battery quite a bit, but you can put the phone in stand by and only listen to the directions. It doesn't always pick the best route, but it get's you there in the end.- The CPU and Memory are not the best but the OS runs smoothly without hiccups. At least not with tons of apps loaded at the same time.I'd recommend the N8 to someone who's not so impressed with the eye candy OS features (see update below - the interface got a boost with the latest update) and prefers a simple clean design and a phone with outstanding hardware in it.5/5 from me!New Update: Feb 2012:Got the Nokia Belle OS today. It's like getting an entirely new and better phone.The interface got better and much more customizable.Improved HD video capture (30 fps).The the top info status bar (with the battery/WiFi/gadgets info) got a boost on the looks and functionality. You can now switch off the WiFi/packet data/blue tooth from there with a single touch. Very nice.I miss some of the old stuff though: I can't find the \"Show all open applications\" (found it - press and hold the button) and some apps do not work on the new OS, but I'm pretty sure the developers will catch up.This is an amazing OS upgrade. Probably a lot more things got improved - haven't had the time to check everything yet. There are rumors that in future it will support some windows apps... Outstanding job from Nokia!Old Update: Nov 2011:I installed the new Symbian Anna update today. Some key improvements came with it:QWERTY in portrait mode - finally :)The interface got a boost. The icons are not that square-ish anymore. The general colors changed from blue to black-dark gray theme. It'll take me some to get used to the new interface looks but in general - I like it.The browser got completely changed. The old sluggish navigation style is gone. Better menu and browsing experience. Still not as good as Opera Mini, but hey - huge improvement from the old stuff! Kudos!Improved navigation searching. Still hasn't completely tested it out, but it seems that the offline search algorithm is now improved.Overall - good job from Nokia. I thought they completely abandoned Symbian, but it looks like they're still strongly supporting it. As I heard, all changes are based on community feedback, which is very good!Old Update Aug 2011:GPS - maps searching: It turns out there is a small bug with OVI Maps. The online and offline search algorithms are different. When searching offline in the US, if you put the ZIP code, most of the time the search doesn't return results. City, Address, State, Country is the best way to search offline. In online mode, you can go the regular US standard address format - Address, City, State, ZIP. Not a big issue and it's good to know there's a workaround.WiFi - there is no central place from where to shut down the WiFi entirely. If any app requires online connection, the WiFi turns on automatically. Setting it up to Manual doesn't resolve this. Changing the connection priorities, using the battery power saving mode and setting all desktop apps to offline mode helps, but it's still not a good/intuitive solution. I'd like to have three settings for WiFi - Manual/Known WiFi Networks/Off.

For a company that was initially the world leader in mobile phone sales, having nearly twice the market share as its nearest competitor, Nokia has fallen way behind indeed as the leading technology innovator, in recent years. It's really all due to poor leadership. It began with copying all the bad habits of competitors (like placing loudspeaker grills at the backs instead of infront or at the sides of phones), and abandoning first principles (like no longer making products user friendly/very easy to use.) With the N8, the company is attempting to reclaim lost glory, and ground.Having literally thrown the N97 in the garbage a few times, I can honestly state that using the N8 is a vaaaaaaaaaaslty better experience. Although the software continues to be more complicated to use at times than it really ought to be, there is far more to like about the phone than dislike.For one, the software is a lot more stable, though not rock solid. There are still occasional bugs that annoy - try marking all text messages in a folder and scrolling, and the phone will freeze for a a minute or two before finally flinging the list of texts across the screen. When responding to a text in conversation mode, you literally have to hard \"tap\" the input area for the phone to respond. A light press of the finger won't do. In portrait mode, sometimes touching a symbol like a question mark or exclamation point for a text message, requires two or three presses, and almost never works with a thumb. An index or other finger is definitely preferred.Overall though, the capacitive touch experience is nearly on par with that of the Iphone, the screen is bright, everything on the phone works as it's supposed to, and all the programs installed are much more accessible than before. A particularly happy highlight is the process for setting up email accounts - a more straightforward process I do not know of.But perhaps the real genius of this phone are its photo and video abilities. I can't tell you the difference between HD and otherD, blue ray or dvd, but I can recognize a good photo when I see one or good video when I watch it. The phone's camera is so good you'll not only want to take more and more pictures, but it will make you believe you're actually a pretty decent photographer. It's just that good. The videos look like they were shot by a hollywood studio with a large production budget, and are *crystal* *clear!!!*Of course, with all that good stuff, those wonderful people at Nokia had to find *something* to screw up - the phone has only one loudspeaker port located on the back of the handset right next to the camera lens, on the protruding camera module...(eyes rolling.) The problem is that, because of its location, if you place the phone face up on a desk, table or other flat surface, the loudspeaker is automatically muffled to the point of uselessness.... And, if you just happen to lay the phone down on its back on something soft, like a couch, easy chair or bed, YOU CAN'T HEAR ANY SOUND. Not phone calls, text messages, email notificaions. Nothing. Yes. I know it's hard to believe but, the people at Nokia really are.that.stupid.You can't make perfection the enemy of the good so... it's still a great phone and one of Nokias best in a long, looooooong time, and I should know.

I've had the phone for about 3 weeks now and am loving it.

I switched from the 5800 Xpress Music and there is definitely a big difference but being that it is still a symbian system I haven't ran into anything that was too hard for me to figure out by myself, music sounds great and call quality is great as well. I added a 16gb memory card on top of what the phone comes with (16gb) so I'm more than happy with enough memory for whatever comes my way.

I wish to compare these two, as Nokia N900 is one of the greatest phones from Nokia.1) First let me go to internet browsing.Nokia N900 is the first phone to have full flash player and the major capability is it will play videos directly in the browser, for sites like youtube, facebook etc. Once facebook moved to latest flash player, N900 is not able to play the videos(eventhough there is a hack).Nokia N8, does not have full flash player, but it has flash lite. I was expecting that the youtube and facebook will not be able to play the videos directly in the browser. To my surprise, both the sites played the video in the site itself, thats really great.With respect to Nokia N900, every site determines it as a computer and hence will show the full page, instead of the mobile site, which is good, if the wifi or 3G is really good.With respect to Nokia N8, every site determines it as a mobile and hence will first display the mobile site, but if you re-route it to the full site, still it displays the sites like charm.Conclusion: with respect to internet browsing Nokia N8 does great.2) Playing videos.Nokia N900 has a resolution of 800x480, hence the videos look very good.Nokia N8 has a resolution of 640x360, so I expected videos(good videos like HD videos) will look less attractive, but to my surprise, it looks great in Nokia N8.Nokia N900 can almost play any video format directly, like wmv, avi etc, including flv. I am not sure whether any other phone can do/compete with this.Nokia N8 on the other hand, has the ability to play any video format, but for avi and flv there is a little trick. When you copy an avi file, your PC may complain that this device is not capable to play it, but you can still use it as a storage and say yes to it. To my surprise, media player picks and plays well. For .flv files, after you copy, the media player is not going to pick it, as if it doesn't support it. If you go to file manager and click on this .flv file, media player picks it and plays well. I haven't tried .mkv file yet, as the mkv files that I have are all big and it is not allowing me to copy those.Conclusion: Playing videos is very good in Nokia N8.3) Camera.Nokia N900 has 5MP camera and in this area, Nokia N8 stays way ahead with 12MP camera and xenon flash.Nokia N8 has xenon flash, which normal cameras use, still even normal cameras cannot take good pictures in dim night lighting. Similarly N8 photos come good, if taken in close shots in night. In daylight, photos come really good. The beauty with N8 is its photo and video editing softwares out of the box, which are really good.HD video recording in N8 is good, provided you don't show quick movements to turn the camera to a different angle and this is mainly due to the 25 frames per second video recording.Conclusion: Nokia N8 camera and its capabilities are one of the best.4) GPS.Nokia N900 is pretty dumb in this area too, as it doesn't have voice guidance out of box. So lets directly jump to Nokia N8.Nokia N8 has one of the best GPS with voice guidance, one major disadvantage that I came across is, it needs 3G connection to work(I am not sure whether this is correct, what I am quoting is just my experience). Once it connects, it works good. I just found two minor issues, one is it informs you to take a turn just when you are few feet away to take the turn, whereas Garmin GPS informs you well ahead. Similar way when you arrive at your destination, it says you arrived at destination, it does not say, whether your destination is on the right or left, whereas Garmin GPS tells which side your destination is going to be.Conclusion: Nokia N8 GPS is definitely good.5) Widgets.Nokia N900 stands out with respect to widgets and its definitely the best in the industry. You can place the widgets whereever you want, even one on top of the other. Widgets are really useful in N900.Nokia N8 on the other hand has fixed dimensions for widgets and you can't place it whereever you like. You need to place it in the designated places. The main drawback for this that I found is, in email widget, you don't get much required information from the widget, you still need to jump into the mail app to know what email came to you now. Still widgets look good in N8.Conclusion: Nokia N8 widgets are still good.6) Chat and Voip.Nokia N900 stands out in this area too, as Skype worked with Nokia to have the skype integrated into the contacts. Like that, google, yahoo, even sametime all are integrated into the contacts itself. You just need to go to contacts to see who is online. You can call that contact through various options, like gsm call or voip call using skype or skype to skype call or skype to skype video call, same way for google, yahoo etc. It is very powerful, none of the mobile has it integrated like this.With respect to Nokia N8, I believe it is not out of box and I am not sure whether I need to install anything to get a similar experience. Skype has an app, but still video calling is not available and speaker phone capabilities are not available.  Fring has video calling capabilities, but only between Fring to Fring.Conclusion: Nokia N8's capabilities in this area are still to be improved.7) Social networks.Nokia N900 has beautiful widgets and integration to contact well.Nokia N8 is not less to this. It has widgets and integration to contact also well.Conclusion: Nokia N8's social network capabilities are good.8) Bluetooth.Nokia N900 has the usual bluetooth version and it works good even with A2DP.Nokia N8 stands out in this, with latest bluetooth version 3.0. The transfers are really fast compared to the older version. The beauty comes with out of box drivers to support bluetooth devices like mouse, keyboard etc. Imagine, I paired my bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the phone and it reduced the time that I spent to do the typing, a lot. I don't have a monitor to connect using the HDMI port, if I have, then it becomes a complete system.Conclusion: This is one of the best in Nokia N8.9) Battery life.Nokia N900, in line with all the other powerful smartphones, with all the widgets constantly checking the internet and all the chat softwares too constantly checking internet, it comes for 75% of the day and you need to charge it after that.Nokia N8, to my surprise even with all the above said things, it is able to withstand for atleast 2 days.Conclusion: Battery is really good in N8.10) WebTV.Nokia N900 doesn't have this capability.Nokia N8: need to explore in this area.Conclusion: Need to explore in this area.11) Micro USB capabilities.Nokia N900, not much to say.Nokia N8, can read your memory stick out of the box and will show it as a drive in the file manager.Conclusion: Micro USB in Nokia N8 is capable of more things.12) Speakers.Nokia N900, has stereo speakers and it can produce loud sounds without any external speakers.Nokia N8, doesn't have stereo speakers, but to my surprise the sound is equally loud as N900, but I found only one problem in this area, as the speaker is in the camera compartment which directly comes in contact to the ground. If you keep the phone down on a desk, you will not be able to hear any sound, as the speaker is blocked by the desk. Similarly even the mic is on the same side, so if you talk over phone handsfree, by keeping the phone on the desk, both the parties are not going to hear properly.13) FM transmitter and internet radio.Nokia N900 is outstanding in this area. If you find to get your popular radio stations URL from internet, you just need to grab the URL and give it to the media player, then N900 can stream your radio station live from internet either using wifi or 3G, which means even if you are in any part of the world, you will be able to hear your favourite radio station live. Using the build-in FM transmitter, you can transmit to your own car radio.Nokia N8 has the FM transmitter, which is equally good to N900. Even though N8 has internet radio concept, it is basically app based, which means whatever stations the app is providing, thats what you are going to hear. If you want to do the same things as above(like grabbing an url and feeding it to media player), I am not sure how to do it.Conclusion: FM transmitter is really good, but internet radio needs some improvement.I hope, I covered the review of some distinct features apart from the usual ones.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Now with Belle it's quite good.", "Author": "Charles Z.

Started with a Nokia 9000 and went though the windows mobile and windows CE and the rise of HTC. I have been a dedicate iPhone user from 07 to my current iPhone 4 . I also have been using Android mostly Gingerbread and soon ice-cream sandwich on an Atrix-4G. To my latest addition a new Windows Mobile HTC Titan.So with this pile of smartphones on my desk I still prefer the Nokia N8.Here are some reasons why:1) It's built like a tank. Seriously it's my 1 year old son's favorite toy and it does not have a scratch or a dent on it.2) it's an amazing camera.3) it's the best phone I have used in a while. It has better signal strength and great voice quality and volume. People have noticed when I am using my other phones.4) The Nokia navigation app is one of the better ones.  I would says it's on par with Navigon for iOS and it's free.5) Nokia seems to be taking care of it's customers.. This phone was released back at the end of 2010! it's an old phone. Yet I have received two major OS updates to this phone.  Anna, and Belle and will soon get MS mobile office suite all for free from Nokia.6) Works well in a Microsoft environment. There is a lync client and MS communicator, full exchange support and soon the complete MS Mobile office.Now some of the issues:1) It's not an iPhone.. and it never will be.. If you want a cheap iPhone get a refurbished one.2) The keyboard is not smooth as an iPhone.3) You might not have all the apps you want. Most of them are there but don't expect to be updated as fast as Android or iOS will be.4) Opera and the Web app work well but do act up on certain pages. Here is my synopsis, if you want to have a amazing camera and very good phone that is rugged. And, you use mostly contacts and calendar by all means have a look at this phone. If want to have all the latest apps, with all the best of the best social networking integration. I would look in to iPhone,Windows mobile and Android in that order.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was Nervous, It Was Perfect. very glad. Suggested Apps", "Author": "T. Brzezinski", "ReviewID": "R1YH6MB7GNOP3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  After having my phone for about a month, a week into 9 weeks which I will be in India (for which I really needed my N8), my N8 has died. Shamefully, NokiaUSA will not offer any warranty support in India- not even credit for the difference they save by not having to repair my phone. This is honestly, especially for a global phone, disgraceful. In fact, I really can't afford to pay out of pocket for what is a manufacturer defect.  I am presently trying to beg and cajole every Nokiacare or Nokia representative I can find- simply to get support for my ONE MONTH OLD phone. The reason for updating my review so harshly, which I would not if this was a rare defect, is that in my online research this appears to be a very common motherboard defect. Especially in such instances of a known defect, they should make exceptions for a Nokia customer who is abroad. I figured it is only fair to update my review to 2 stars. Since my review (below) my experience has only been more and more positive with the phone, until this breaking. But for this kind of issue I think I should be getting support (it is worth noting the local Nokia store has been very kind and helpful, but cannot do much). So a final honest review will depend on what kind of support I actually get from the company in the next weeks, to give a full picture of the N8 product._____________________________UPDATE2: For me, it was a matter of contacting the right people in Nokia. I'm frustrated I hit walls at the early levels of customer support, but I was lucky to meet helpful people at their social media areas. I was redirected to people who were able to clear me getting help in India, where the N8 was fixed a few times (the dead symptoms would reappear). I was grateful to be able to use the phone for then majority of my time in India. Unfortunately I did have to send my phone back when I got to the U.S, for which amazon was helpful despite my extended delay. So all in all, I still love this phone, I just have to report bluntly that I had problems that are apparently isolated to a small run of the N8s. Still, it's frustrating when you get that rare problem.___________(Original review below)I want to keep my review relatively short because I'll go over board explaining the minute details of my reasons for wanting the N8. The short story was it was the combination of hardware and looks I really thought were perfect, but I was very nervous whether it would be usable or not. I've had it now for a week, as a gift from my parents (hence not amazon verified- but I've reviewed a few other items).To respond directly to the fears about crashing. I had two lockups the first day while I was simultaneously downloading and installing 5-6 apps at a time from the store. Since then, I have not had a single problem while heavily using it for the last week.  In fact, everything is better than I expected- even perfect. So this is a sweet relief, because I anticipated problems until the Anna update (coming soon). It should only improve symbian interface, which works very well for me.To give my phone background: I'm relatively geeky about my phones. Nokia phones have a certain feel to them for me, and although I was very seriously considering other phones, I realized the N8 was the first phone I felt could seriously do everything for me. I needed a phone to do GPS navigation offline (I don't have a data plan, $$$, and backpacking there aren't always cell towers), serious connections via wifi, and versatile camera use. The camera is N8 is exactly what I hoped. The pictures look nice but not too special on the screen, because the screen is *not* as high resolution as the iphone, but the actual photos are *much* better. This is quickly realized when you look at them on the computer. Other phones with reasonable 5mp cameras and mediocre (smaller) sensors do in fact look good-ish, but the N8 hits the threshold for photos that I actually really want to keep for the photo,  not just the photo representing something. What I mean, is the actual photo can stand on it's own with the N8, and that's not rarely the case with other cameraphones.  What this paragraph is supposed to explain is that I'm incredibly happy with how much the phone has filled the role as an attractive and versatile phone for my uses. It has great hardware; I haven't seen any of the fears I had realize (nope, the cpu is perfectly fine).To give some suggested apps. These apps really make everything come together.No.1 SWYPE (free). You should get this app. It's an amazing innovative text input app that is essentially T9 predictive input on a new dimension. You slide your fingers over the letters, and it \"magically\" figures out which letters that your finger slid over you wanted and which were not needed. On a level  above anything else. I am slower typing with regular touch than I was on my previous physical phone keyboard (E71), but with this I am in fact as fast or usually faster. That is a *big* deal for touch screens.(In no other particular order).Opera Mobile (free) (good browser)Joikuspot Lite (free) (lets your phone broadcast it's internet as a wifi AP)Sports Tracker (free) (Great for getting GPS routes of your run, and other sports gps functions)Astroller (1.99) (Shows you constellations! Surprisingly nice to know whats in the sky)Fring (free) (Great IM integration and voice / video calls)Panorama (free) (for those rare times taking a panorama picture, it helps)All Format Writer (free) or LightNotePad (free): **I can connect a usb keyboard (or bluetooth) to my phone via USB-on-the-go and use these as word processing tools. Will save computer battery life on flights, and in general is very nice. I tested it with a keyboard and works fine**EpocCam ($4.99). (My computer doesn't have an integrated webcam, this makes it very easy to use the N8 via usb cord).Nimbuzz/Vlingo/Skype (free) [Good VOIP calling apps]GvDial [Google Voice Dialer, helps with google voice]Yep, I use a few more apps for specific uses. But these were the more universally awesome apps.P.S*Works great for playing music*Battery life <E71, but MUCH better than almost any other smartphone. If you're coming from an iphone/bb, you will be very happy. Also has good power savers mode. Combination of big battery and more efficient OS.*Comes with surprisingly nice headphones! I have portapros and a pair of expensive seinheisser in-ear, and these aren't as good as the latter, but in fact quality buds (nicely styled as well).Phone comes with a substantial number of cables and connectors.

I was immediately blown away by the specs sheet of the N8. Still, after reading many biased reviews (even before its release), I almost turned away.. Besides, I've never owned a nokia phone before. I always went for SE brand but now their options are a bit limited.This is the one phone that has everything I need and more. Now Ive finally got it. Do I regret my decision? Not one bit. I simply love this phone. Sure the UI may not be as pretty as android and IOS but there are no seroius deficiencies on Symbian 3. Mulitmedia wise nothing out there comes close. This phone does many things the competition cannot, and does them well. For anyone who wants to get the N8, I say get the N8. Its a great phone that offers a lot. It may not be the cheapest but its way better value than the more expesive competitors. Not to mention the hardware. There's a real high end sturdy but elegant feel to it. This is the best phone Ive ever owned and overall may very well be the best multimedia phone available.UPDATE:After having this phone for a month, what can I say? It continues to impress. I havent used my 10MP point and shoot camera since because the N8 camera performs so well even indoors and in low light. It has so far outperformed all the point and shoots I have personally come across so far. Observers have stopped, taken note and admitted that this is 'as good as it gets'.

This phone runs the Symbian OS, which Nokia is abandoning for Windows Phone 7 (and Meego, perhaps). Symbian is not nearly as intuitive as its competitors, which is unfortunate because it is just as technically capable if not more so. The system is riddled with inconsistencies and haphazard placement of options. App availability and ease of installation is seriously lacking (the Ovi store is garbage).That said, multitasking is far superior compared to other systems, especially considering the hardware resources available on the N8. This is a byproduct of Symbian's longevity in the market (which is also the source of aforementioned consistency issues). Updates to the OS will be coming this year, but don't expect too much. Another byproduct of Symbian and the hardware is ridiculous battery life, considering the camera, flash, and various network connections.Think desktop Linux vs. Windows 7 or Mac OSX and you'll have an idea.Summary:Not many \"apps\" available. (Face it, most of you just download games anyway. Perhaps their lack of availability here will be a positive influence on your life.)Amazing camera (12MP, fast, real xenon flash), incredible at this price point. This alone makes the N8 a serious competitor for the price.Great battery life.GPS, maps, and navigation without an Internet connection for free. No more Google Maps failures when you were relying on it (see this constantly among iPhone users).Pentaband, works on any 3G/GSM network in the entire world (since you're buying an unlocked phone, this is probably an important consideration).Extremely durable casing with a Corning glass scratch resistant screen. With a rubber case you literally cannot break it unless you drop it in water.The only smartphone available in many different colors. Can you think of another smartphone that is orange, cyan, or magenta? Some really won't care about this, but I love that fact that it is orange. It is definitely not just another black rectangular solid.Need a phone that works everywhere, takes great pictures, has excellent battery life, is invincible, and can navigate in most countries of the world without a connection? Don't care about \"apps\"?If you meet that description, this phone is absolutely your best option at the moment.On an unrelated note, this phone proves Nokia still makes some of the best hardware out there. Microsoft made an excellent decision paying them a billion dollars (really) to switch to their platform. Don't write off Windows Phone yet.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Smart-Phone", "Author": "Steffenwolf", "ReviewID": "R1FU6HHDLLE9MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After close to a year (believe it or not) of research, I finally purchased this phone in March. I wanted a single device to do everything - media-player, PDA, Internet capabilities and a good camera. I had no intention to jump aboard the Apple bandwagon (although I understand why people love their I-Phones) and the Android platform phones weren't giving me what I needed hardware-wise.Finally I took the plunge and purchased my blue N8. I was very happy (and very lucky) NOT to receive one of the many defective units that a lot of other reviewers are complaining about. For those who might care, mine says \"Made in Finland.\" The phone worked straight out of the box. I played around with the basic functions for a couple of hours before installing the OVI software and doing a live-update via my computer. The OVI suite that came pre-installed for some reason didn't recognise the phone when I plugged it into the USB port, and I eventually had to download the software off the website and reinstall. It worked flawlessly afterwards. I'd strongly advise you update the firmware as soon as you get your phone - many complaints I've read here are resolved by this update.I won't get into specifics of the hardware as Amazon's product description covers everything you need to know. Here's simply a breakdown of what I LIKE:* The unit itself is very attractive and sturdy. For added protection (and if you pay US $399 for a phone you better be concerned), get an Otterbox case, which comes with a free screen protector.* Setting up email was quick and easy, as was my Facebook connection. Telephone contacts were easily downloaded from my SIM card and I can synchronise contacts with their respective Facebook profiles.* I get Quick-office which allows me to EDIT and CREATE files, not just view them.* Synching with my Outlook calendar is easy using the OVI suite.* The Wi-Fi wizard could not be easier to use. I don't have a data plan, but the speeds I get at the various hotspots are very good. I've been able to comfortably do live updates, install apps and send/receive photos and other attachments with no trouble.* Two years back I bought an Olympus 12MP camera and was very unhappy with the battery life and photo quality - I had previously owned an Olympus 5MP which took better pictures than its replacement. The N8 camera far surpasses my Olympus, especially with night shots. The on-board editing software is fantastic.* Video is high-definition. I don't need to spend extra $ on a digi-cam now.* FM transmitter! This was the deal-breaker for me. I can toss my CD case I've been carrying in my car for the last few years and put all my music on this phone to play through my car deck. The other phones I had previously short-listed for purchase (HTC and Motorola Droid X) didn't have this very handy feature.* The video player is compatible with most file formats. The display quality in unbelievable, making watching movies on this phone an absolute joy.* Battery life has been satisfactory so far. I do moderate browsing throughout the day but frequently use the music player/FM transmitter and a couple of other apps. No complaints here.So now we get to the SYMBIAN. I think it's a matter of personal preference when it comes to the OS/GUI on this phone. I've used Apple & Android phones enough to understand why people like them. While the OS on the N8 may not be as \"fun\" to use, it is simple to figure out, very responsive and gets the job done. I don't need more than that from a mobile phone OS. Actions such as pinch-and-zoom, scrolling, etc. are routinely performed with no problems whatsoever. I have experienced the occasional (i.e. infrequent) application \"seizure\" but no more so than on other smart-phones. I bought this phone primarily for the hardware and an OS that is simple and to the point. The fact that Nokia has discontinued Symbian development has not made me regret this decision. The OS is stable, and there are at least 2 major firmware releases due which will provide additional functionality (portrait QWERTY keyboard, etc.). As for 3rd-party apps, I have all the important ones I need from the OVI store. To be perfectly blunt, the majority of apps out there are frivolous nonsense that I can do without.All things considered, here are a few things to note (in the interest of lending balance to this review):* I am sure the OVI maps are great, providing you can get maps for your area. I live in the Caribbean and there are NO maps available for this part of the world. So, I'm unable to enjoy one of the features I was most looking forward to. I did download Google maps, but this of course requires an active Internet connection for the GPS.* The Music Player is VERY basic. I'd like to see Nokia improve on this in one of the updates. Same with the movie player.* The on-board battery meter can be misleading. Download the Nokia Battery Monitor utility (very nifty) and you'll notice that it routinely displays the charge with a 3-4 percent difference from the on-board meter.* The web browser isn't impressive. Get Opera mobile.* It would've been nice to have included a lanyard in the box.* The stereo headset I received looked really good, but unfortunately mine didn't work. I didn't bother to write Amazon on this, as it's not that big of a deal with me.* No e-book reader application. This was a disappointment, as the pre-installed PDF reader just doesn't do it for me.In summary, I've gotten a phone that can can do pretty much everything an I-Phone does WITH the best on-board camera on the market for considerably less money.

My latest device was the E71 (Unlocked version made in Finland) which I consider to be the best phone that the company has produced. Symbian operating system structure has never been an issue for me since I rather like a stable OS that has been proven efficient for several years now.I am a Mechanical Engineer which has held several positions requiring a very good attention to details, deep troubleshooting thinking process and analysis and evaluation of different types of equipment failures. Currently I held a position in the Nuclear Industry.So far I have gone through three (3) Nokia N8 in less than a month with all the units shown significant signs that this device is not being put together well. I will say that the Nokia N8, in my personal opinion, is a well design device that separates itself from the rest of mass produced devices currently in the market. The phone specs are very impressive and the materials guarantee a long durability. However all this looks wonderful on paper but what is coming out from the production line is far, far from what was conceived in the design table. This phone particular design, in my personal opinion, requires a very well controlled manufacturing process to maintain the quality of the finished device. This strict quality control appears to be missing at least on the units I have bought.All the phones I am referenced in here were bought at AMAZON.COM as brand new units and I received them with the Nokia seal intact on the shipped boxes. All the units I have received are MADE IN CHINA which I will not rush to conclude it is the main contributor to the phone issues but it probably is.The first unit was my first disappointment right out of the box. This device came with the unlock sliding key significantly loose and the rattling was very annoying (something that I might have live with it for a $100.00 phone but not for what is expected to be a high end product priced at over $500.00) . I also noted visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body. So I returned this unit without further use of it.The second unit kept showing what appears to be a trend on this product. I found two (2) visible marks on both sides of the phone cases next to the ring that appears to secure the phone screen (it appears that excessive effort had to be made to finalize the assembly of the screen on this particular unit). Also, the camera lens and the xenon flash are not centered (it appears that the finish Aluminum plate that is glued on top of the camera, flash and speakers area was not placed with care). Here again noted a visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body. I still have this unit on hand but probably will return it.The Third unit (which I felt so lucky I got it for $429.00 on Cyber Monday eve) was again another big disappointment. This one appears to be the worst one so far. The front camera appears to be missing its end cover which I can see on the other unit I still have at home. Here again noted a visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body with the top one significantly off-set showing a visible gap where the earpiece is located. The main camera has failed to close the lens twice while exiting from the camera main screen.As you can see most of the issues I have mentioned here are related to the manufacturing process of this device. As you might know already Nokia itself has admitted that the most talked issue that this phone is experiencing (the power down of the device without any previous action) is been tracked down to the manufacturing lines. So if so far this what we can see on the outside of the phone, What about the internal assembly of this device? How reliable these units can be? Again, this is considered a high end device designed to compete with the high ranked smart phones currently leading the market.As far as the reported performance of the new OS, all three phones have shown sudden slowdowns, sluggishness and a lot of inconsistencies. Maybe clocking up an all processor instead of using a new one was not the best choice made.To conclude I will say that the Nokia N8 is a marvelous device, in paper, worth the $549.00 retail price. The Nokia N8 coming out of the production lines is worth much, much, much less or maybe no worth at all for now.

Allen \"Don Allen\"", "ReviewID": "R3JD4X1CFWNEDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A bit of an introduction: I'm a retired computer professional, having written software and managed software projects for 45 years. I have been a vocal critic (on the Nokia forums) of Nokia's software failings in recent years (I had an E71, a beautiful piece of hardware, and my wife had an E62 and a 5800). Most of my objections were to their pathetic ovi.com website, the attempt to replace PC Suite with something else named ovi (which broke something that wasn't broke! I suspect \"ovi\" is Finnish for \"full of bugs\"), and their penchant for issuing \"upgrades\" that introduced more problems than they fixed.I had a two-year fling with Android, where I saw a serious mobile system gradually turn into a circus act; the latest version of Android on the top Samsung phones looks like a video game to me. They are obviously targeting the young, which is probably a smart business decision. But if you are a mature adult who wants a serious appliance that helps to keep you organized and to communicate via voice and message, all of this extraneous nonsense is a distraction and an annoyance. Yes, some of what bothered me could have been customized away, but there were other issues that led me to conclude that the latest Android was not for me.I had watched, with interest, the introduction of the N8 by Nokia and its impressive specifications, and the subsequent tribulations of the product, plagued by problems that resulted in too many dead devices. But two years after its introduction, with the price dropping and unhappy with the direction of Android, I decided to buy one. I've had the phone now for a little over a month, and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised.First of all, the hardware. It is typical Nokia, just beautifully made. It makes a difference, as it is not only a pleasure to hold something well-made, but it feels better in the hand than anything I've owned from other manufacturers (Motorola, Samsung). It was delivered with Symbian Anna, which exhibited some of the old, confusing user-interface design that has brought Nokia to the brink of extinction. After consultation with some folks on the Nokia forums, I decided to upgrade to Belle, about which the signals were mixed. I decided that the people who seemed to know what they were talking about liked the system and I went with their advice. This turned out to be a good decision. The user-interface is greatly improved and finally gives Symbian a look and work-flow that is competitive with Android or the iPhone. Unfortunately for Nokia and Symbian enthusiasts, it comes too late. But it's good, nonetheless. They also fixed some bugs that I cared about. For example, the FM radio application, which I use, did not work correctly in Anna, at least for me. The Belle version is fine. I am happy with everything else that I use -- contacts, calendar, email, browser, occasional text message. The camera is excellent. The only thing that does not work well, and never has, is Mail for Exchange, at least when you attempt to use it to sync with Google contacts/calendar. This software was broken three and four years ago and it's still broken. I have resorted to going back to maintaining my contacts, calendar and todos with Microsoft Outlook, which is an inconvenience for me, since I use Unix/Linux most of the time, not Windows. But Nokia's synchronization application works well, as does Google's application to sync their stuff with Outlook. A bit of a Rube Goldberg setup, but it works. It would have been far better for Nokia to have fixed Mail for Exchange -- they certainly had ample notice that it was bug-ridden -- but that won't happen now that they are fighting for their lives, hoping to be rescued by Windows 8.To summarize, if you want a superbly-made unlocked phone made for serious adults at a good price, this is a great choice. Be aware, though, that Nokia has, of course, abandoned Symbian (Accenture is maintaining it now) and it is unlikely that there will be any further development of the system. It's a dead-end for application writers as well, though there is a large body of Symbian applications already available. Whether they work well with Belle is a separate question (I purchased a financial calculator for my E71, and got the latest version for the N8. It worked fine with Anna, and while it works with Belle, the results appear in a font about 2 pixels high, and so it is unusable. I have contacted the author and he is unable to fix the problem, due to some authentication issue. It's obviously a side-effect of Symbian now being a dinosaur.)Update (3/24/2013):I've now had the N8 for almost 6 months, and my opinion of the phone has not changed. If anything, I'm even more impressed by its quality and usability. One issue: battery life. Running Belle, with light usage, the battery is exhausted by the end of the day and has to be recharged for the next day's use. However, there is a so-called \"power-saving mode\", and it works beautifully. With this enabled, the battery will last for days, at least the way I use the phone. For me, the phone is perfectly usable in this mode, and the improvement in battery life is a real plus. Before I discovered this, there were times when I was inconvenienced by having forgotten to put the phone on the charger overnight, needing to use it the next day, and finding it dead. Yes, it recharges quickly, but an inconvenience when I want to use it NOW. The tremendous improvement in battery life in power-saving mode essentially eliminates this problem.I would also mention that there is a battery monitor application available from the Nokia store that is quite useful, and I recommend it to anyone using an N8.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia has a winner on their hands", "Author": "Yoft", "ReviewID": "R37LIBARPGWF51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT: Today, (Feb 11, 2011) Nokia announced that it is moving to adopt the Windows Phone 7 platform.  That means that it is ditching the MeeGo system almost completely and will plan to phase out support for Symbian in the next year or two.  That isn't quite enough for me to change my review on the phone, because the phone still holds its own as the best hardware on the market right now.  But you'll have to keep in mind that Nokia will slowly stop rolling out updates for Symbian.  If you're still attracted by the hardware, I say still go for it definitely.  Like I state in my review, Symbian^3 is more than adequate, it is just slightly clunkier than it's competitors, but it CAN do everything that other OS's can do.  If you're not particularly in love with the hardware or hardware is less important to you, I would look elsewhere, or at least wait until Nokia starts rolling out the Windows Phone 7 mobile devices.  So this news really shouldn't affect either camp of potential buyers: those buyers that are looking for great hardware (like me), this phone is still a worthy investment; those buyers that are looking for the whole package and would be willing to make hardware sacrifices for a better OS, I would wait until Nokia starts making Windows phones and compare those to Android/iOS.Hardware:+ Very solid construction, the body is made out of solid aluminum and there are no loose parts whatsoever+ The screen is made out of gorilla glass, which is about as close to having a bulletproof glass cellphone screen as you'll ever get.  It's pretty much impossible to scratch this screen, trust me people have tried on youtube and failed.+ Capacitive touch screen with limited multitouch support (see software for further details)+ Amazing camera, as of this moment, this is pretty much indisputably the best camera phone on the market.  Gone are the days of inch thick camera phones that only output 8MP cameras with a much smaller sensor, the N8 takes 12MP photos with a sensor that is larger than many dedicated cameras.  Megapixels hardly tell the whole story, but the sensor size goes a long way to allowing your N8 to replace your dedicated camera.+ Built in xenon flash, the N8 uses a legitimate camera flash and in my anecdotal use, it has the same range of illumination as my point and shoot.  The LED flash on many other phones can't compare to a real xenon flash+ Video is very clear and can record in 720p resolution.  One of the best features of this phone's video capabilities is the fact that when zooming, it uses the fact that it can take up to 12MP frames so that when you zoom in video it maintains 720p resolution and uses more of the camera's capabilities.  For those of you who know how digital zoom works, that means that while digital zoom while taking pictures still is pretty much pointless, the N8 allows you to take full resolution 720p all the way through the zoom levels and isn't just a digital zoom of your original 720p frame.+ Built in FM transmitter means that you can play your music through a radio signal which your car's radio can pick up once you tune to that frequency.  You don't need to mess with adapters or cables.  The signal isn't extremely strong, so your mileage may vary depending on your phone's location relative to the antennae in your car.+ Built in GPS with FREE LIFETIME MAP UPDATES AND VOICE NAVIGATION.  That means essentially for the price, you are getting a built in GPS with your phone, that performs just like a standalone GPS.  You can use the GPS without a data plan with no problem at all, it picks up a signal quickly and is very accurate.  If you're worried about the phone accessing the data network accidentally, you can just turn off A-GPS (the only function that uses data).  The GPS will still work perfectly normal, it will just take slightly longer to pinpoint your position.- Since there is no LED, there is no video light available for the phone and that also means you can't use the phone as a flashlight, unless you use the screen with the application QTorch does nicely.- OVI maps (the GPS software) occasionally does weird routes that are not necessarily the best nor the fastest, but it will always take you to your destination, regardless.Software:+ Three completely personalizable home screens that you can swipe left or right to access.  You can provide a shortcut to any of your apps (including third party ones), put in a list of your favorite contacts in a scrollable bar as a widget, get access to email, music player, etc.+ Gallery is now much improved in that you can \"check\" multiple items at once for deletion or to email, instead of deleting one picture at a time, which was a huge problem in S60v5.+ General use is generally snappy in and out of menus.- Essentially what S60v5 should have been, it doesn't make huge changes other than the home screens, it just fixes up some of the bugs in S60 like the inconsistent double/single tap to open applications.- Occasionally phone felt slightly underpowered, but these cases were few and far between- Overall, the user interface (UI) is not as polished as Apple's iOS or Google's Android.  Things aren't always as intuitively placed as you would like.  But in terms of functionality, Symbian^3 can do everything that the above two OS's can do, it just doesn't really make all the features as accessible.Bottom Line:This phone is extremely well built and has pretty much all the hardware options you can ask for in terms of camera, video shooting, build quality/materials, FM transmitter, built in and free GPS.  In terms of software, Nokia's OS lags behind iOS and Android, but it is fully capable, just not as polished.  The main draw for this phone, however, is the fact that it is unlocked.  Which means if you don't need a data plan (more importantly, if you don't feel the need to pay and additional $30 per month), you do not have to get one for this phone.  Nowadays, every carrier will force you to get a data plan for your phone, which in the long run, comes out to be much more than the cost of buying this phone unlocked ($200 for an iPhone 4, plus $30 additional data plan for 24 months comes out to be $920 just for the data plan.  Not to specifically rag on the iPhone 4, just providing an example of buying any smartphone from a carrier).  That was the big draw for me, and then the amazing camera and free GPS were just bonus features.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "not a smartphone but a mobile computer", "Author": "spruggie", "ReviewID": "R27CNH0MICAHR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this little power house two weeks ago and i cant put it down it plays all my media files without me having to convert them, it gives me facebook updates every time i unlock the screen, and when i get a call i can see my contacts facebook status, its a great flashlight and quick office works great, i connects flash drives to it all the time and the paid apps work perfectly, i use the fm transmitter everyday on the way to work the call quality is great and the phone app is easy to use, the camera is amazing just point and click the pictures litterally come out great every time. my only complaints about it are the free apps are buggy and the music player doesn't have search other than that this is my favorite device", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Way better than Nokia N97", "Author": "Ariaboss", "ReviewID": "R3SS52UMOXXI3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first of all, I can't speak on the performance of this phone (Symbian 3) when compare to an IPhone 4 or an Android phone for that matter.

This phone has all I wanted. You can choose to stop mobile data (home country or abroad). You can also download any map over wifi for any country of your choice for free and use it for your GPS without the need of a any data plan or Internet! It works even without a sim card. To give you an example: I was on the cruise ship between Bahamas and Miami and I had my GPS functioning, which actually showed me that the ship was going 27 miles per hour! The camera is awesome: Carl Zeis lens, autofocus (allows you to take pictures of business cards, texts, text from TV or computer screen with 100% accuracy). Most of the phone cameras will not let you do this, since they have fixed focus only. Unlike other camera phones, this phone has a real flash light. Your pictures will be bright just as if you used your regular camera. HDMI works flawlessly and will let you see pictures and videos on your TV. FM transmitter will allow you to use your phone in any car not equipped with a bluetooth or an auxiliary input. Many folks complain that the FM transmitter does not work. It is because they do not transmit on the right frequency (adjustable). Google \"fm vacant frequencies\" and you will find the website, that will tell you which radio stations in your area have the weakest signal or if there any empty frequency slots. Then your phone will play music over the radio with no static.  It is also useful to know where your car radio antenna is.  For instance: some cars have it integrated in the rear window! So, if you sit on the rear seat you can transmit on any frequency you want, since you are close to the car's antenna. However, if you are on the front seat you need to select the most optimal frequency.  Overall, N8 is the best phone for the price with absolutely no doubt in my mind.

And its UI is very stable and easy to use. But, Apple never gives you enough and charges a lot. Long story short, I pulled the trigger and purchased Nokia N8. I have been using it for a week, and I really liked it. Yes, there are some flaws with Symbian 3. I had to consult google at least 5 times to set up stable wi-fi, emails and bluetooth with this phone.  You need some tricks - such as inserting another sim card to see yahoo mail set up option, and once you set up your yahoo email, you can put back your original sim car and it will work.  Also you can not accept meeting invite in exchange! Symbian developers missed that! Or, when in your car connected via bluetooth, the speakers of the phone will not work.  So you can use call funtion via car speakers, but if you want to listen to music from your phones speakers, your phone cant do that.  The phone defaults the speaker/headphone/bluetooth and it does not allow you to switch back and forth (maybe this function is burried somewhere in deeper options).

The first one I bought in early May. After only a few hours of use it powered off for no apparent reason. Then each time I tried to restart it, it would shut down again after about 30 seconds. I was disappointed because it really is a beautiful phone. I kept looking for another phone that had everything I wanted and I couldn't find one - mainly I wanted a GSM penta-band with a good camera and internet capabilities. There was no other phone but the top of the line Nokias. So I thought I would try the N8 again (because it has 12MP camera with auto focus - otherwise I would have gotten the E7 with the larger display and the QWERTY keyboard). I am so happy I did. The first N8 which I sent back was produced in Dec. 2010. This second one was produced in March 2011, so maybe the bugs where fixed with the later models.  I just know my new N8 is exactly what I hoped it would be.  The call quality is excellent and the camera works beautifully. The customizing capabilities of the Symbian OS allow me many personalizing options. The display is bright and clear, and even in direct sunlight it's still readable; touchscreen response is fine; photo/video record quality is superb for a mobile phone (especially if you use custom settings); FM transmitter is a nice extra; HDMI Dolby works great; and video play/web TV is good. Even the speaker produces pretty good sound and has high volume. So, what could be better: Well, even though the processor seems to work fine for general use, I notice the more demanding apps are slow to load. Also, the Ovi store apps download process is a bit slow, too. The battery life is excellent, though, so maybe that would be the tradeoff with a faster processor. The RAM usage for me averages about 60% but maybe those who play the advanced games and want to have several apps open at the same time would like more RAM. Other than that, I really can't think of anything else Nokia could improve on.

I love this phone and i will love the successor of this phone as well; the Nokia 808.Why this phone is great.I get to use my grandfathered att unlimited data for 10 bucks a month and i can tether with it for free.Free Nokia maps with voice guidance.Use of multiple internet browsers.Bluetooth that actually works. I,e you can transfer pictures, movies, and music to other devices free.Best camera phone on the market by far.Xenon flash to freeze night time shots.HDMI out to display all your phones content. Play videos, show pictures, browse the web right on your hdtv. My toddler loved to watch me play angry birds on the big screen. Of coarse i did it from the comfort of my coach using a Bluetooth Mouse.USB on the go. I can hook up a flash drive or an external hard drive to my n8. This has been extremely useful when there always isnt a computer available.The fact that you can add up to 32GB to the phone via the micro sd slot is nice.Sturdy and strong phone. I washed my first grey n8 in a large front load washing machine for a full cycle before i found it. I immediately got on amazon and over nighted the blue n8. After taking the soaking wet phone out of the washer and put it in a bag of white rice for a couple days to my amazement it charged up and turned on and worked perfectly!!!! I kept it as my spare still though.So if you want a toy go for a cheap droid or the Iphone. If you want a power house of a phone that is still lots of fun that could replace most peoples stand alone cameras then go for the Nokia.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not perfect but as close as you can get", "Author": "Andrew F.", "ReviewID": "R2AXJJFBACO1ZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Suspend what you have heard about the Nokia N8 for this review, give it a chance. I am a college student and I have used many different phones. When I bought the Nokia N8 I was coming from the Samsung Captivate android phone. I like my smartphones to have many useful features that can combine the features of multiple devices into one. The Nokia N8 does that for me, it is my phone, camera, MP3 player (and wireless transmitter), video player, and GPS all in one.Now most smartphones have all of these functions, but the N8 excels in all of these areas.1. As a phone it does it's job very well. The gorilla glass and aluminum case feel very solid and I am proud of the build quality. The operating system could use some work, yes, but for most people, including me, it is more than satisfactory. In terms of app's, it has all that I could want. The OVI store has everything that I need, games, video chat, swype, opera, etc. The multitasking system is epic, easily beats all the other operating systems in that respect. It is very useful when you are using an application or browsing the internet and you realize you need to make a call or send a text message, just minimize, complete your task, and return right where you left off.The features built into the phone meet or exceed other phones. It has HDMI out, USB (flash drive) support, 3.5 mm headphone jack, 16 gb internal memory and external SD card, etc. The battery life is amazing, I can literally go 4 days without charging, try that with an Android phone.2. The 12 mp camera with zenon flash IS the BEST out there. A good camera is important to me, and I know pixel count is not everything, Nokia knew that too. The camera performs very well, easily replacing my point and shoot camera. The zenon flash beats an LED flash hands down anyday. The 720p video recording is more than satisfactory for me. The dedicated, two stage camera button is also very good. Connecting the phone to the computer is very easy allows for easy transfer of files and pictures.3. One of the main reasons I cannot leave Nokia for another phone is because of the MP3 player with wireless transmission. Although it is not terribly strong, it replaces another device and comes in very handy. In addition to that, the bluetooth performs very well.4. I have many movies that I have copied over the years on many 16 gb memory cards and in many formats. The N8 plays most all of them very well. It struggles with high bitrate DivX but at least it can play that format, most phones can't. I have never had a problem with micro SD cards or playing a video.5. The final reason I can't leave the N8 is due to the lifetime OFFLINE navigation. Noone else includes that for free on their phones. I don't have a data plan with this phone (Wi-Fi is more than adequate) so the offline navigation is key. And it is not watered down at all, it has built in businesses and you can download updated maps for the US and elsewhere for free, forever. Easily replaces my car GPS.CONS:1. Lack of physical QWERTY keyboard.2. No PSX4DROID or higher quality games.3. Battery not easily replacable.So all in all, this phone is a great deal. Where else are you going to be able to pay ~400 dollars and get a phone, camera, GPS, and MP3/4 player? Phone works great with AT&T; and since I bought it unlocked I don't have to have a data plan (as long as AT&T; continues to think I don't have a smartphone, hint hint, block data on your account). With the N9 coming out (which looks amazing too BTW), this phone is only going to get cheaper in price. In addition, there is a major software update coming out in August for this phone that will fix some of the minor issues with it. The phone will be supported for a while in the future as well.

Guess what, the N8 is the new best phone of Nokia and as a person who used iPhones, Blackberry's, and Android powered phones (Droids, Samsungs and Lg's mostly) I can easily say that N8 is better than them all. Even though the Nokia Ovi App Store is not better than the other app stores, the fact remains that you can download an app from any website and simply install it on your phone with one easy step.

And on top of that a great deal, why might you ask? Because of Nokia's commitment on updating Symbian just like other mobile OSes (like Android, iOS.. etc)..It has a great camera! I'm using my current Nokia N8 (Orange one) for filming a couple of things (doing an online show)..This will be my second N8..The disadvantages are with some of the things in the software, like not remembering the camera settings, the slow browser, no multitouch keyboard, no portrait qwerty and some smaller issues.But again this is why it's great.. The N8 is going to have all that (including a brand new browser!) By Q1 of 2011! So very soon.. along with many other things that will make this device even better!!!  On top of that.. Nokia said that by H1 of 2011 it will have the brand new Qt UI.. so that's great too.. I personally dont care about the eye-candy stuff that other OSes has.. The current Symbian UI is simple and gets the job done.The thing that I really do miss from the S60v3 phones is the \"Home Media\" application... Which can play music/videos and even view photos from other devices on the network.. I wish they would bring that back..Overall, I'm satisfied with the device as is.. and I'm very excited on those updates that are coming soon to the N8.. :)Oh the OVi Maps.. locks on reallllyyyyyyyyyyyy fast compared to my older Nokia phones and is very accurate, I use it a lot! Great application.. (I downloaded the Ovi maps beta from Nokia Betalabs as that version on there is MUCHHH better than the one that comes stock with the N8, mainly because of the pinch-to-zoom seemlessly..I definately recommend this phone to anyone who loves to have a great camera on a phone and wants to get things done right out from the box. :)", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent voice phone, excellent camera, a lot of technology for a moderate price; difficult to master", "Author": "Bob Clark \"Frustrated gadgeteer\"", "ReviewID": "R2DS6991V8QU3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a device that requires a lot of time and energy to master. However, if your requirement is to have the capability to capture high quality images for a modest price then the Nokia N8-00 is worth considering. The user interface is not as easy to understand as iOS or even Android. The number of apps numbers in the tens of thousands.  That means there are only several hundred apps that will interest you. Basically to be happy with this handset you'll want the camera to the exclusion of all other capabilities.  It's a handset for those who can't or won't be locked into the Apple, Google, or Microsoft ecosystems.Consider that intro as my warning of \"here be monsters.\" If you are adventurous then continue on:In the box you'll find a Nokia N8-00 and all the trimmings. That is to say a charger, HDMI output cable, and USB cable. And the usual safety manuals.  The Nokia N8-00 ships with Symbian^3, a 2010-era operating system with a tough interface to master and memory management problems. The only good thing about Symbian^3 is you can get rid of it.To get rid of Symbian^3 you'll need a desktop PC or laptop running Windows XP or 7, a really high speed data connection, and the latest copy of Nokia Suite (available from Nokia). Plan to download about 1 GB of data in 300 MB chunks.  Before starting your upgrade adventure, spend several hours reading the information regarding the N8-00 at [...]. You'll also have to create a Nokia account to download maps and apps. Going from Symbian^3 to Nokia Belle takes about 6-10 hours of tinkering.After installing Nokia Suite, connect the handset to the computer and let the two devices get to know each other. When the drivers are synced up you can start the software upgrade process. Nokia Suite will offer to upgrade the software from Symbian^3 to Symbian Anna. After that is completed, the next upgrade is to Nokia Belle. During the upgrade to Nokia Belle you'll see warnings forbidding you from touching the handset. Heed that warning!Getting the handset to Nokia Belle is simultaneously the beginning and end of the journey. Click on SWUpdate and download whatever remaining apps and widgets Nokia thinks you are entitled to possess on your handset. And be sure to visit the Nokia store to pick up additional apps published by Nokia (e.g. \"Internet radio\").Nokia more or less abandoned Symbian/Nokia Belle in February 2011. From a user perspective this means the bugs in the handset's firmware are here to stay. You'll have to live with the bugs and quirks and work with them or around them. At one time Symbian was the most popular smartphone OS in the world. It was also the most targeted for malware. That software is still out there. You can operate the handset without an antivirus solution but depending upon your use case that might not be an acceptable mode of operation. Fortunately, anti-malware solutions are still available and maintained by their vendors.So why would anyone buy this handset in 2013? Well, besides the camera's unusual capabilities the handset can be used as a SIP phone to make VOIP calls, Nokia provides free software to listen to radio stations that stream on the Internet, the N8-00 has an FM radio, Bluetooth, and can play music via your vehicle's FM transmitter. Or, your hotel's FM radio. The HMDI output allows you to play 720p video on a television. Replacing the battery is a trivial operation.  Repairs cost about $100, so after a year if something goes wrong an out-of-warranty repair is relatively expensive. Finally, this is one of the handsets that implemented USB On-The-Go.In the end the camera is going to make or break this handset's experience for you.

The battery life is amazing compared to android handsets. I own Samsung Vibrant, HTC G1, and HP veer. Nokia N8 is really great for an entry level smart phone. If you rely heavily on Google services, this isn't the handset for you. If you want a device that is very good at the specific tasks of: Navigation, Taking Photos, Media Playback, texting, email and phone calls, this is a great choice. I load up my micro sd and listen to podcasts broadcast to the FM radio in my car on my daily commute. I never have to worry about charging my phone at work. The picture quality is fantastic in regular lighting. The set up was WAY more complicated than I have ever experienced on any handset. It is a good buy for a basic user. My biggest gripe is that there is no way to sort the app reviews in the App Store by language!

The recent Symbian Anna update has made the OS a bit more user friendly, although it's still far from iOS.Overall, this is a very good smartphone. Its main deficiencies are limited and somewhat clunky apps. But I don't need a phone for slick apps -- I have an iPad.

I've used the GPS for a trip down the East coast with great results. Call quality has been great where ever I've been and with the recent Belle upgrade to the Symbian OS, the N8 should be considered as an alternative to any phone out there. The free(no data plan required) GPS, great battery life and high quality camera are just head and shoulders above even the newest models offered by other manufacturers. I see that prices have not come down since I bought my phone and that has to be because of the demand for this phone. The quality is outstanding. I don't think you will ever regret buying the N8.First and foremost, you are buying a cell phone that gets excellent reception and sounds good on both ends of the call. That's why you buy a phone. Why this phone stood out to me is the extras you get. And since I don't consider a tad over 400 gold grinkles cheap, those extras better make it worth while. They did to me.1. You don't need a point and shoot. The camera on this phone is the best ever used on a cell phone. What you will be doing without is the telephoto capabilities, but the camera takes great pictures and is easy to use.2. You don't need a dedicated mp3 player and video player. The music player is very good.  You won't be giving up anything. Sound and video qualities are excellent.3. You don't need dedicated GPS unit. OVI maps are great. They come free with lifetime updates and give you spoken turn by turn directions with street names. You do not need a data plan for OVI maps to work like you do with other phone mapping programs. The screen is not as large as some of the other cell phones or GPS units out there but it is very legible never the less.4. The web browser stinks but Opera Mini takes care of that.5. It also comes with a dictionary that can work as a translator if you download (for free) other languages (up to 2 more) at the OVI store. Going to Madrid and Paris this year? Download Spanish and French. Going to Berlin next year? Dump one of the others and download German.6. You'll have to do your own research on the social stuff. I'm not into Twitter or Face Book.7. Battery life is outstanding. I used the GPS without a car charger for over an hour and the battery only went down one bar. That may be about 15% of the battery life but I'm not sure if the battery indicator is linear. Using the phone for calls and texts and a couple hours a day on the internet with wifi and it still goes a couple of days between charges. That would never happen with my Droid X.What's not so good about this phone is Symbian. Besides the Droid X, I own and old iPod Touch. Using either one of those operating systems is childs play compared to Symbian. It is not intuitive at all. Options are hidden inside other options in menus that make no sense.I am willing to put up with that because of everything else that sets this phone apart from other smart phones.Plus, being unlocked there's no contract and it will work anywhere in the world. It also comes with a good amount of memory and you get a couple of cables that would cost you a lot of money if you had to buy them separately.So add it all up and be conservative. It's a $100 point and shoot camera. It's a $100 video & mp3 player. It's a $100 GPS unit. It's a $100 phone. It's all these things in one and it costs about the same as buying them all separately.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "As good as I expected.", "Author": "Kaupo", "ReviewID": "R1WH2Q0NEMHUEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone works great for me, haven't experienced the constant hanging up etc that there have been complaints about.

It is organized and built differently from iPhones or Androids, but it is a Symbian. Having not used those devices as primary for myself but just friends and family who had android/iphones I can say that I still like the N8 for what it is with symbian. Partly probably because I have been using Symbian phones for the past 5-6 years and the way they work is like second nature already.

With latest OVI maps, you can download (using wifi may be) the maps for any state, and use the map anywhere even without data plan or signal. This is like a full fledged GPS which doesn't require a data connection to operate (Unlike most other smart phones).  > Camera : 12 MP camera is amazing. Picture quality is crisp and easy to operate. Video quality is very good. It also has an editor for pictures as well as video. For most of the occasions, you won't be needing a separate digital camera.  > Touch screen : We love the touch screen. Very very smooth. Compared with iPhone of my fried for Angry Bird game. No difference observed.  > Mini HDMI port : This is again very useful. Just plug your Nokia phone to your TV and watch pics, videos and stuff.  > Sound quality : audio/video sound quality is impressively clear and loud.  > Phone speed : Never felt slowness or hanging phone even with multiple apps running.Cons:  > Symbion OS - the only limitation can be OS which is a bit less intuitive for navigation though it's just matter of getting used to it. After some use, it's pretty smooth.I am personally a blackberry user for couple years and prefer a phone with keyboard (which I felt missing even with N8 :) but that's a different story and subjective to me. Please note that I have owned Nokia E63/E72 which do have keyboard). With this in back-ground, overall we are extremely impressed and satisfied with this phone and love it. We have used iPhone and Android phones and even shown this to a few iPhone crazy friends.

Waugh", "ReviewID": "R1TZTI627C524O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been very impressed with the phone (actually got two of them, one for myself and one for my wife) - no restarts required.  I'm not someone who needs to have my computer in my pocket and mostly wanted a phone with a very good camera (this phone as the best you can get) and would be easy to use for basic stuff, calling, texting and be able to do other stuff if needed (e-mail and web etc.).  The interface is smooth and responsive, the phone is smaller than I expected and fits very nicely in the hand or pocket (not a giant half tablet like alot of the newer smartphones).  Voice quality is excellent as well (ATT).In this respect and with the relatively low price for a smart phone with the features it has - it was an easy choice.This phone has the best camera of any phone at this point (Oct 2011) nor is a phone expected to surpass it in this respect.  The reason the camera is so good is that the sensor's size (not pixel count but actual physical sensor size) is about 50% larger than other phone cameras (grabs more light) and most stand alone point and shoot camera's.  Now its in a phone so its not going to replace your DSLR, but it is the best you can get in a phone.  The other nice thing about the phone is that it uses a real Zenon flash (like a normal standalone point and shoot) instead of a LED like on most phones - so the flash is more powerful.The colors are nice to add a bit of personality to your phone - and being an unlocked phone there's none of that ridiculous provider branding and glitchy applications you get when you get a phone from the wireless vendor store.Nokia just released an update to the operating system (called Anna) used in the phone for North America.  Another update called Belle will be coming in the future, so the OS will continue to be updated and improved.One note on the Anna update, I had an issue with the Symbian Anna 1/2 part failing to install (phone still worked), but if you get that here's what I did to get around the issue.  Find a PC/Mac and download and install the Nokia Ovi Suite ([...] go to support and get the Nokia Suite or Mac version) and use that to backup your phone first (contacts etc.).  Be sure to use the Windows PC Nokia Ovi Suite to back up your phone (cause your data is going to be deleted).  Now reset the phone Go to MENU => SETTINGS => PHONE =>PHONE MANAGEMENT => FACTORY SETTINGS => DELETE DATA AND RESTORE.  This wipes the phone relatively clean.  After restarting, go through the Ovi setup screen etc. that pop up.  Add your WiFi connection back in (I use this to keep from doing big downloads through my wireless provider).  Now do the update through the phone (main lighted button just below the screen and on the front - Applications - SW update) and make sure only the Symbian Anna 1/2 update is selected (meaning you'll have to un-select the Anna 2/2 update) and run the update.  After it succeeds, then do the 2/2 update etc. and you're good.  Run the Windows Novi Suite to restore your phone data and your done.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Dreaded Purple Rain", "Author": "beelzebub", "ReviewID": "R3LUH6T0UZU31U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "2012 UPDATE: Have now had the phone over a year & do not regret the purchase at all.  The Symbian Anna/Belle updates fixed the purple screen issue.  The N8 still works great: long battery life, good reception, excellent camera ... the only downside is that with Symbian on death row for 2016, the # of new apps are dwindling, so if having the latest is an issue for you, you may want to pass.  On the flip side, the price is now $100 less that what I paid making this an incredible deal for those who do not want to pay for a data plan.  The cheapest one is $20/mo so when the 2 year contract is up, you have pretty much made the $ back on the cost of phone.  Now that Nokia is switching over to Windows, which US carriers can detect & force you into a data plan, I would not hesitate to buy this phone if wifi is all you need.I have now had the phone all of 3 days when I noticed that I have the purple screen/tint issue that people have been complaining about since the N8's launch (search the web for details).  It was most notable on the unlock screen - half the clock was purple while the other half was black.  Altho the clock on the screensaver does not have this issue.Amazon's Help Section was anything but, as their directions on how to EXCHANGE sends you to the RETURN section, where exchanges are not an option.  I called & Amazon will be sending a replacement; the good news is, I do not have to return my phone immediately.  I can wait till the new N8 arrives, that way I am not phoneless.Otherwise, the N8 is great; I intended to use it more before I wrote a review but wanted to warn people that the purple issue still exists before they buy.  Some quick points: the Symbian OS is like the step-child of the mobile world but for me, & I suspect many, it works & does what it needs to do.  The build quality is superb & the phone is slimmer than I thought it would be.  So far no problems w/ the phone rebooting randomly (another common complaint).  Battery life is excellent.The reason I got this phone is bc I did not want to be forced into a data plan & so far this phone has worked great on just wi-fi.  Keep in mind that Nokia just said that they will soon stop selling unlocked phones so anyone else wanting to not be trapped into a data plan may want to buy soon.Hopefully the next phone has no issues & ships w/ Symbian Anna & not ^3 (crosses fingers). Then I will write another review or update this one w/ more details ...UPDATE: Just got the replacement phone & still the purple screen issue.  Grrrr ... !Amazon will not exchange the phone twice, they are now only offering a refund.  They got a Nokia rep on the phone with us who offered to have it fixed under warranty but that would leave me phoneless in the week or so that would take.  Neither is exactly an ideal situation (I would like to keep exchanging this brand new expensive phone until I got one that worked properly) but to Amazon's credit, they did put \"Item Under Review\" on the dark gray N8 & are not selling it at all until they have a look at it ...UPDATE 2: 6 months later & now on the Belle OS update.  The phone works just fine - does what it supposed to do.  The Anna update took away the purple tint & it is still gone.  AT&T; still has not forced me into a data plan. Do not regret purchasing this phone & recommend to anyone looking for a basic smartphone or dares to be different, especially now that it is $60 less than what I paid.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone in principle, mixed bag after first few days", "Author": "Adam \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "RFVFLWURCIN2J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got the silver/white version as it was the best deal this week ($359) and it is Made in China (was hoping for Made in Finland).

Have an annoying SIM card problem in the upper right corner of my phone, it keeps blinking and says SIM card memory full even though it is not the case. Not that big of a deal and I am sure I can remove it soon.Camera: Like the camera on it, was the main reason for my purchase, to replace my digital camera and have just one device to carry around. When I transfer the pics, they are around 1MB each, but when I choose to send them to an email address, they are downsized to only 70kb.Video: HD video recording is pristine, there are lots of pre-installed movie previews etc. which I hope I can remove. (Phone has around 10GB free space after maps installation and before removing unnecessary pre-installed apps).Connection: had some trouble figuring out the best settings for connecting to the internet. I am a T-Mobile prepaid monthly plan subscriber and don't have much data usage per month (might change that now), and I am still not sure when I am using the Edge/3G (uses data plan) or my home wireless network (free). Setting it up and connecting was easy but when I check the connection manager, it would say the wireless is inactive and I have the Edge or 3G symbol active on my upper left screen corner. I am sure I will eventually figure this out.Apps: installed some essential apps right away likeOpera browserSkype (so happy that I can use it on my phone now),a live TV app (watched France 24, pretty cool),Swype (had several installation errors until it somehow worked)The OVI store is full of apps, most of them seem not that useful.The OVI maps seem great, found my location automatically, downloaded upgrades.***UPDATES***SIM card blinking message problem is resolved, had to delete messages saved to the SIM card.Camera pictures are only great when not using the flash, flash indoors makes all pictures hazy/white foggy. The 9MP is the standard and it is widescreen but the 12MP is only 4:3.Major letdown and a reason to give one star less is the poor battery life. I charged it full last night and when I woke up it went down to 14%, not sure why. It was in power saver setting, every other tip from the User Manual regarding battery life was applied, so will test it out and then eventually will have to send it back because what good is it if the battery won't last?***UPDATES*** June 1, 2011The battery life has improved a great deal thanks to many tips on Nokia's website and dedicated Nokia N8 forums. Some tips that drain the battery: bright homescreens, mail server synch/fetch, constant wireless scanning, etc. You can turn all these off or disable them temporarily and right now I am still at 100% after having it charged 14 hours ago, although  have not used it much but this is a huge improvement from last week.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Practical phone - functionally strong - less dependencies", "Author": "ireview", "ReviewID": "R2BA5NZ09TVRDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had an experience of using both iphone 4 and Nokia N8 phone; While iphone 4 is unbeatable interms of some of the features like the amazing \"Retina\" display etc., Nokia N8 stands out just because of the flexibility it offers; To simply put - it gives me much more freedom while using the phone - in terms of basic functions which a common (smart phone) user like me does..- Got a good song to hear - just DOWNLOAD it (instantly) to your phone - to play it whenever you want (even when no network - or without worrying about the Datacharges)- Copy files to & from the Nokia device - without the need to rely on the proprietory utilities - You do not even need a computer to transfer - it allows transfer to Pen-drives directly using the supplied cables- Carry the phone to anypart of the world - without the headache of unlocking or breaking the version etc.,- Gives me flexibility to have 48 GB memory with no extra cost..- To listen to music using the amazing headphones (that comes along with the device) is truly great - I feel like listening the songs from a theater.- MOST IMPORTANT - the 12 MP in-built camera - WOW! what an amazing feature - this device is awesome in the pictures..- the advantage of Nokia - interms of Sturdy nature, long battery time - are all there - unsung...On top of these - after using the symbian OS in the earlier smart phones like the Nokia E71 - I am getting a much surprising stunning experience while using the OS in Nokia N8 - Dowload speeds is really admirable;I am very happy with this device and more happy that I have returned the iphone 4 - within the 30 day return period", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Notes from the field", "Author": "Rich", "ReviewID": "RUBNTYVU6YJ5L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone back in early March to use in the Middle East. I have not had the oppurtunity to use it on a US network. I have not used any of the location-based apps. I wanted to wait a couple of months before offering my personal opinion because initial impressions usually focus on the positives.Positives:* Camera! Wow! 12MP on a phone. It takes great pictures. The videos are above-average for a phone.* USB-to-Go. Comes in handy.* Real Multi-tasking. You can surf the web and listen to music.* Ability to add up to 32GB of additional memory. I would recommend sticking to 16GB cards because 2 are cheaper than one 32GB card.* Bluetooth works great with my Motorola 305 Headphones and Keyboard. Way better connection than with the iPhone 3GS.* Free Ovi Maps for life.* HDMI-Out.* Total control of phone (file manager, themes, ringtones, etc)Needs improvements:* The OS needs some improvements (when compared to Android and the iPhone).* The Web Browser is super slow. Luckily, Opera is offered in the Ovi Store.* 95% of the apps plain suck. My previous phones were mostly iPhones, the King of Apps. The N8 apps are slow, in my opinion, when compared to the iPhone. Must have something to do with the \"slower processor\" on the N8.* No eReader app* Movies played off external drive (ie. flash drive) routinely skip. Even with all other programs closed on the N8. I found myself having to copy the movie from the drive onto the phone or SD card. The transfer rate is incredibly slow. It took about 10 minutes to transfer a 700mb movie file.* Music player sucks. It looks pretty. But, it gets hung up sometimes. And, there are no other music players for this mobile OS.* Interface with Mac OS needs improvement. Syncing music and playlists doesn't work as well as originally thought. I have smart playlists on iTunes that continually update (ie. Podcasts, new albums). On the N8, I have to delete the playlist first before syncing with my smart playlists.* Occassionally restarts on its on for no apparent reason. I'll contact Nokia when I get back to the US.Other notes:* The N8 could not run one of my external hard drives (Transcend 640GB) because it needed more power to run spin the drive. However, I ended up attaching an external power source (Scosche SolBAT II Solar Powered Backup Battery and Charger) to the hard drive and the hard drive to the N8. It worked.Bottom Line:  Would I buy this phone again? Not for $400. I purchased the phone when it was $400 from Amazon.com. I waited a few months for it to go down from $500. The N8 is a great phone for $300, in my opinion. The camera, HDMI-out, and USB-to-GO are worth $400 if the OS and apps were up to par. Some of the annoyances can be overlooked if you have another form of \"entertainment\" (ie. iPad).

Having used both, I cant say which one is \"better\" as there are pros and cons to each, and each person has their own preference. Like other decisions, this one involves trade offs that the buyer must make. I chose the N8 because: Solid construction, gorilla glass, 12MP camera, HD video, FM transmitter, HDMI & TV out, 16GB storage, bluetooth 3.0, Nokia legendary reliability and the battery last days (not hours). If you are willing to forgo all these for the android experience, that's personal preference. In my opinion a pretty UI is not everything and Symbian ^3 is fast and responsive!

The handset itself is light but very very solidly built. The touch interface feels very smooth. The buttons actually depress down when touched and this is very useful to know that the handset received your input. The phone is jam packed with features; which anybody can look up on the net. I will tell you what it means for me most.The phone has excellent connectivity. The moment you switch it on it will ask if you want to copy the contacts from your old phone via bluetooth. Did that and it probably took about a minute and half to transfer 350+ contact, my entire calendar. Email set up is easy. Settings are very intuitive to use especially more if you come from a symbian background. But i would expect anybody to understand it as easily as me since I am not a mobile technoguru or anything. The handset has three desktop like screens which you can customize with applications of your choice. Mine has my email accounts, to do lists, frequently called contacts etc and let me tell you it is a wonderful experience. The camera takes awesome pictures and videos. Sound from this set is loud and I mean loud but not tinny like other handsets. It is a pleasure to listen to.The phone can take a couple of seconds to switch from portrait to landscape modes but that does not happen frequently and definitely does not hamper the user experience. The phone comes with a headset with adapters for specific ear types; an HDMI cable; a USB cable and one more USB connector. The battery holds charge for about 1.5 days and this is after extensive usage with wifi, camera and playing around. I would expect it to hold charge later too and will update again at a later date.Overall, for anybody looking for a feature rich phone at an affordable price, you can not go wrong with the N8.

I've never seen it in any phone I have owned.The second is apparent incompatibility of some of the voice guidance files with the maps. My UK voice guidance works fine, but not US with street names, which is silent. Standard Nokia Tech advice - do hard reset. I wonder why Nokia even bothers employing Tech Support people. After dealing with them for 20 years I find them pretty much useless.The biggest problem that is not software related (I think - Nokia helpers have no clue - do a hard reset they say ?!) is very poor flash performance. My N82 has N8 beaten hands down. At 10ft distance my N82 photo is nice and sharp; the N8 photo is grainy. This despite of supposedly bigger N8 sensor and 12 MP versus 5MP.The HD video though works great, except for low light conditions again, and flash will not work with video.Overall I am sufficiently happy with the purchase to keep it.

The reviews were brilliant and all, but it was a different story after it arrived. I've had it for five (5) months now. I use a MacBook Pro for syncing contacts and calendars and I have had no issues with that.The OS (Symbian 3) is very sluggish, sometimes outright unresponsive. There was some improvement after installing the update released in February by Nokia, however I'm still having to restart the phone ever so often and because of that I've installed only two (2) apps on my phone: Skype and Opera, both of which work really well. After installing whatsapp via the Ovi store and having my phone crash repeatedly to the point where I had to have it replaced, there is a reluctance to install applications (despite my doing the necessary research) - and this undermines the original intent of the purchase.The battery life is a lot less than what I had come to expect of Nokia. Recent models I've had include the N76, E50, and E73. Nokia ought to have done way better.The phone's WiFi drops connections ever so often.On the upside, the screen is really nice, the body is sturdy and feels of really good quality, very attractive on the whole. The bluetooth has a really long range which was a pleasant surprise. It is nice how the screens are customizable. The hardware specs are really good, impressive actually, but Nokia fell down badly in terms of the quality of the N8 firmware to allow users to make the most of it.I would not purchase a Nokia smartphone again.

I have owned lots of Nokia phones (e71, e75, 5800, C6-01, 701), and two Android phones (original Nexus and the Google Nexus Galaxy GSM) so I have a pretty good idea of the difference between Android and Symbian. I've never owned an iPhone, but I do have a new iPad and a touch, so I have a pretty good idea of what iOS5 is like.The main advantages of the N8 is the build quality (I've never seen a company build hardware that's as nicely put together as Nokia) and the incredible flexibility of the phone and operating system. I mean this phone has an FM radio, FM transmitter for use when you rent a car or need to make a quick connection to a car radio that doesn't have Bluetooth or inputs, USB input, hdmi output, and what is without a doubt the best camera in a cell phone until the 808 came out.  Symbian Belle is in many ways more flexible than Android (and certainly more flexible than iOS which forces you to use the wretched iTunes and makes it a pain to import or export anything from it). The phone itself is pentaband so you can use it in almost all of the world where GSM is available. It has 16 gb of memory built in and you can add a microSD card for even more storage - unlike the iPhone or many newer Android phones, and the size is perfect. My newer Nexus has a 4.7 inch screen and feels like a tablet when I hold it to my head.The problem is that as they did with the N97 the self destructive folks at Nokia hobbled this phone with an extremely slow processor and only 256mb of program memory. In spite of the efficiency of Symbian, this lack of hardware guarantees that your phone will run sluggishly (if not when new shortly thereafter as you use it) and that installing any new software (such as the mobile Microsoft Office that was just released) will be a nightmare, requiring you to try to decide what you're going to have to remove to make it fit.  The 701 which I also owned had double the processor speed and program memory and it made the exact same Belle software run much more smoothly and gave you enough program memory to not have to worry about it.  For the life of me, why Nokia would design a phone that originally sold for about $600 and save a few cents by not including the appropriate processor and memory is impossible to understand.  It's not like they hadn't seen what that did to the N97 and the damage it caused to Nokia's reputation, but for some reason as a company Nokia was incapable of listening to any criticism or learning from their mistakes.So, I use my Nokia when I'm in an area where I need navigation but can't get data (Nokia maps has world wide free maps that you can download and use without a data connection, even now Google maps only let's you pre download a very small area), and when I think I will want to take pictures since the camera is good enough to replace a point and shoot camera. Yup, in a word, it's the perfect vacation phone. However, when I need a phone to actually get work done with or want to have access to some of the more popular apps like Netflix or Pandora I use my Nexus. It is a complete shame, because if Nokia had tried even a little bit the n8 could have been a real contender. For a while the popularity of Nokia in India and China allowed them to survive, but now with their switch to Windows 8 and the popularity of Android in those countries it seems like final curtain calls for Nokia.  So, at the current price if you want a good phone to travel with and an example of what could have been, this is a good purchase, but if you are only going to have one phone that you have to use day to day unfortunately even at these fire sale prices you're probably much better off buying the Google Nexus.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost 2 years...Still good", "Author": "Julz", "ReviewID": "R1UQUYOAZO0KRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the best Nokia phones for real.My Experiences with the N8Camera - The camera is amazing!

I still use a cable to play games on the big screen though.Gaming - Most other platforms have more games than symbian, but it's not a desert here, there are good games and the phone's hardware handles them well.Browsing - Stock browser even in Symbian Belle is not up to par.

Whereas, the latest update out there as of 2/11/2012 is Symbian Belle. If you haven't updated to Belle already, I recommend doing so ASAP because this is a HUGE software improvement over Symbian^3 where Nokia branded phones were mostly being complained at.From here on out... my review is based on Belle.First off, Belle is BEAUTIFUL! Putting Belle side by side with an Android and iOS device and Belle stands out clearly in terms of color vibrant and icons sorting styles.:Responsiveness:Belle is VERY fast as compared to her sister Anna and Symbian^3. Kinetic scrolling has been improved where scrolling feels a lot more natural and fluid.:Drop/Pull down bar:Swiping the phone from top edge down will pull down the notifications bar with 4 most used buttons: Mobile Data On/Off, Wi-fi On/Off, Bluetooth On/Off, and Silent Mode. Below are your miss call event notifications, active apps, and current data usage. Just like Android's drop down bar, but looks a lot neater and easier to the eye.:Widgets:This is the sweet spot of Symbian OS.Email, Maps Location (ver 3.09), and Facebook (ver 1.5) widgets are speechlessly beautiful. Update constantly right on the home screen. So useful to glance at them for a quick moment without the need to open up the app itself.:Battery:Lasted me the whole day from 7:30 AM to 10:30 PM in a single charge, with heavy usage of music playing (aux connection with my car speaker while driving). Medium usage of browsing Facebook and Nokia Store during my lunch/break time at school and at work. My brightness setting is set to Medium-High. Yet the phone survived the entire day without even hitting the 10% mark at night.:GPS/Navigation/Driving Experience:How do you Call + GPS + Music almost at the same time while driving? If you haven't done so already, download Nokia Carmode from the Nokia Store. Under this mode, EVERYTHING is simplified into 3 most used functions while driving: Call + GPS + Music. 3 huge buttons are on the screen for easy one tap accessing to reduce distraction to the driver.:Social Apps:The new updated Facebook version (1.5) now comes with Notification. A huge improvement from previous version that came with Anna. The self-updating/self-rotating home screen widget is now improved with a larger display and crisper looking. This large display takes half of a home screen now display 10 top recent news feed from Facebook with the scrolling capability for the user to view at their will. The bottom, right after the 10th news feed would now be the Refresh button.Version 1.5 did not come together with Belle update. You have to manually search for \"Social Networking Client\" in the Nokia Store and download it to update yourself.With Belle, i am now very proud of my N8.

The N8 has also worked with every mobile network I've bought a SIM for, so it has excellent call reception both in the US and in every European country I've tried.Some people try to malign the N8 for its Symbian operating system, but I really don't find it a major problem.  The user interface I find more or less as easy to use as Android, and there have been several UI improvements, with more on the way.  There are not as many apps in the Nokia Ovi Store as there are in the Android Marketplace, but the apps available are most often of high quality and utility.

It doesn't really matter for people who already know my permanent email address. It's just I don't want new recipients putting this yahoo address in their database rather than my permanent address. The touchscreen is a nuisance to use, especially with the browsers when links on pages are too close together. But it works well enough. I don't do a lot of texting. I'm running the PR1.2 version, dated 2011-03-01, which supposedly fixes most of the bugs in the earlier versions. I just go the phone two days ago, and so there is probably many features I am unaware of. But I am very happy with what I have so far. BTW I use ATT pay-as-you-go with an add-on data package here in the United States and plan to use the phone with a local SIM when I am in Europe, as I do for 3 months each year. Finally, battery life is great.Followup: I added this thing called mycalculs60 by kylom.com, which gives me a much better calculator (financial and scientific functions) than the quickoffice calculator. What I'm finding is that I mostly use the phone, camera, maps, calculator, alarm and calendar. So the half-ass browser and hard-to-use keyboard really isn't that big a deal. If I want to do serious internet browsing or data entry, I do so on a laptop. Using the internet on the phone is just for emergencies when I can't get to a laptop. Also, there is a way to get what I want with yahoo email. Namely, use the Opera mobile browser to goto the Yahoo mobile site rather than using the Nokia email.Bottom line: if you're looking for a good PHONE/CAMERA/MAPS/CALCULATOR combo, this is probably the best available. If you mostly want to play Angry Birds and have snappy performance due to a dual-core processor, along with lousy battery life due to that same dual-core processor, then get an Iphone or Android. More seriously, if you absolutely need some of the Iphone or Android apps, then yes, you won't be able to use this Nokia. That's the only real shortcoming.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quirky", "Author": "Christoffer", "ReviewID": "R2L444C3YYVH5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Nokia n8 a bit over half a year now. It works great when I'm either in Europe or America. I took all my vacation pictures using it, as well as video, and they tuned out great! I shared them via the HDMI cable with family. I constantly listen to the internet radio with it, and have about 12gb of music I listen to everyday. When I go for a run, I have an app that tells me where I've gone, how far, and how many calories I've burned. I have games, but I rarely have time to play them. What don't I have? It's been an amazing ride so far with it. I had an issue that it would freeze, but it was fixed by soft resetting it. I found my phone, and I love it-- even it's sometimes quirky behavior (rarely happens). Yes, I can safely recommend this phone. I've come to appreciate using Symbian after hearing about those tracking and privacy things lately. Although, I payed the full 550-- I don't regret it. I hope to keep this phone for a long time-- it does everything. Now that I am used to the Symbian^3, I love it as well-- I can quickly navigate to whatever I need and it's quite customizable.

Prior to this I had a Nokia Nuron (T-Mobile) and it was nice, but being a carrier branded phone, the OS was, in my opinion, crippled from having full functionality.However, this is not the case with the N8. Being unlocked, unbranded, and untouched by any carrier, allows this phone to have all of the functions it came with. Symbian^3 is a nice platform. Very easy to navigate, the included apps are very nice. The glass touch screen is as responsive as any other capacitive touch screen I've tried. The colors and graphics are bright crisp, and very clear. Nokia's Ovi Store has a lot of apps to choose from, and the selection is getting better. Its not Apple's App Store, but its good enough for me. The camera is amazing. With 12mp resolution and 720p video, I found the photos, and videos extremely nice. I've been a hobby photographer for 25+ yrs, and this is as good as any point & shoot out there, and you can make calls on it too.Overall, I recommend this device. I am sure there are nicer phones out there, but for my money, this is one of the best phones available.UPDATE (6-15-2011): I am having issues with the device after 2 months of ownership. Ovi Maps has a bug, and it is now crashing after charging overnight. Ovi Maps is not using its own updated traffic information to re-route itself. The updated traffic info is correct, but its directions were not using this info. Charging my phone overnight is leading to having to initiate a reset (sometimes twice) because it powers itself off and won't turn back on.UPDATE (7-22-2011): This phone has turned out to be a huge waste of money. All of the other issues remain per the first update. On top of the problems I had, now I cant make calls in my house unless I go out in the driveway. This might be a tiny bit inconvenient in January here in NW PA, where last year it snowed 140 inches. The phone drops calls, whenever it thinks I've talked long enough to the party I called. If the call lasts longer than 5 minutes, its considered a long conversation. I bought this smart PHONE for use as a PHONE. If the phone part of this device is garbage, then the device falls way short. High res cameras, internet surfing, dont mean a thing to me, if I cant make a simple call. As stated before, I do photography. I already have nice cameras, I dont need another one. I just wanted a device that was a solid PHONE. The rest of the features, are gimmicks. They are nice to have, but when the phone part is junk, it doesn't matter.UPDATE (9-13-2011): It appears I was a tad hasty in my scorn for this device. Seems the issues with this device were provider related. Changing from T-Mobile to AT&T; has changed the behavior of the phone dramatically. Cellular coverage obviously is a huge factor to device function, and I should have tried that when I started having call issues. That said, it is working like a smart PHONE. Call reliability, and quality have improved. I now access internet where ever I am, whenever I need to. It still has some quirks, but what phone is perfect?UPDATE (12-5-2011): As much as I liked this phone, Nokia has some things to sort out. When they finally offered Symbian Anna (about 1-1/2 months ago), I did the update, then called them because it toasted my device. Their software bricked my phone. I dont know how or why, and I'm not an expert on these devices. Prior to this, the N8 was a great device. However calling them was futile, because I tried everything they recommended, and nothing worked. I gave up on this device. Enter Apple iPhone 4S.UPDATE (7-24-2013): I acquired another (brand new) N8. This time the OS update was for Symbian Belle. Nokia seems to have gotten it right. Smoother, faster, bigger icons (better for older fingers) and less crashes.Is is perfect? No. Has any company made a perfect smart phone? Not yet. Because its all dependent on what the user wants out of the device. That said, I will say the updates to Nokia Maps is sweet. It rivals my dedicated GPS unit for the car. The Ovi Store is not as expansive as the App Store by Apple, but I got this device as a backup phone (prepaid service), so that is really not an issue. Its sad that this device is no longer produced, because what it offers (12mp camera, great maps app, nice mp3 player, decent browser, decent email) is fairly solid, and because its Nokia's OS on Nokia's hardware, the device remains pretty stable.If you can find one brand new give it a try.

Just to you have an idea of what I'm saying, I spent at least four weeks analyzing a bunch of alternatives to this phone not limited to the smartphones category.Finally, I decided for N8 for the following reasons:1 - The well known Nokia battery lifetime (just don't wanted to pick an Apple/Moto and need daily charges (I use to charge once a week, low usage of course);2 - The camera, I thought: now we have an acceptable one that somehow can be a regular camera substitute (real substitute, take a look at the macros!);3 - GPS for free, period!4 - High end specs such as Bluetooth 3.0, amazing sound quality, wide range operating frequencies, USB on the go, Amoled, data modem, RDS, etc.5 - HDMI out. The possibility to run a HD video from a small piece of hardware into a wide LCD is just exciting!To be perfect:- Could have a ISDN digital signal, such as Galaxy S;- The camera could have a optical zoom;- Browser is the poorly one (can be fixed with updates);- Doesn't have a vertical keyboard (updates please);- Although the battery is great, it could be a dream with a 1800mAh (ok, now I'm overreacting);Well, in my point of view, we're very near from a complete hand entertaining system, and this product is the closest one.My preferred word: convergency (all in one)!I'm very happy with that!", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A SUPERB AN AMAZING PHONE AND A GADGET!", "Author": "Troy", "ReviewID": "R111Y6KG52XSX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the blue N8 from Amazon and after one week I received it in excellent condition. I heard some of the N8 phones have been made in China but my phone was made in Finland, if this is something matter. As soon as I turned on it asked me for the software and firmware updates and I updated by just pressing \"yes.\"  I have been using it about a month now and it works like a charm. The photos and HD videos I took with it are amazing! The phone conversation quality is excellent. It is made of a sturdy light aluminum material and feels very well made. All the buttons are placed well and very accessible. When you take photos or videos you either use the hard button to activate or deactivate it or you can just tap on the screen. It has a real flash (not with video though) and picture quality is stunning! N8 comes with built in 16 GB and expandable to 48 GB memory with micro SDHC card. I tried the GPS function and it worked without any problem. I also use it to go to the web sites like gmail, yahoo, facebook etc., and it works flawlessly. The first time when I visited the facebook it asked me for a facebook Nokia app. After that you just tap to FB app in applications menu and it immediately connects. Same thing with gmail. I am a long time Symbian OS user and found Symbian^3 OS to be very powerful and advanced. Yes, it needs a little bit polishing here and there but in no sense lesser than rivals IOS, Android or Microsoft Mobile 7. I was aware the fact that Nokia was in negotiations with Microsoft to use their OS on the next generations of cell phones before I ordered the N8 but it did not affect my decision. I think Nokia's decision is a big mistake but it is a subject of a totally different discussion. In any case, Nokia N8 is a superb phone and a gadget. I am a Mac user and it perfectly communicates and synchronizes through bluetooth connection. I have read some other users complaints here, such as \"phone is not turning on,\" \"freezes,\" \"shuts off,\" or problems with interaction with software etc. May be I'm fortunate but none of those happened to me and Symbian^3  is a superior and very fast OS. It is a true multi-tasking device. You can leave one application open to go to another and than return. I use the N8 with my T-mobile connection and did not experience any problems either. I just took out the T-mobile sim card from my old phone and slide it into the N8. That is it! I have a very reasonably priced old t-zone data connection account with T-mobile and all web connections go through it without any problem. I also tried the wi-fi and it also works perfect. N8 has a decent built in FM radio transmitter and works very good. I covered the phone with OtterBox Impact Case for Nokia N8 . It gives it a negligible bulk but it also provides a good protection.

This is one of the reasons I bought this phone.HDMI - Amazing to view the images directly on TV and the details are really nice, but I dont use much this part.Camera - The best camera you can get in a phone and the big screen is great to deal with the photos. Also, the picture manager is very good to crop and change your photos.Solid - the phone is very solid, beautiful, I prefer much more the dark gray version.GPS - its great to have GPS in a cell phone, it gives the name and number of where you are or where you are looking for.Multitasking - REAL MULTITASKING, you can leave your application opened and do other things and get back to that download you were doing.Cons:OS - Good and bad... Very unstable and a little bit hard to use. As an ipod user, I feel that iphone has a much nicer and fast OS than N8. There are many apps for N8, but lets face it, iphone is much better in this part. Also, I really feel that this phone is slow and the interface really doesnt help most times. Photos disapear when I connect N8 to my computer.Texting - texting IS HORRIBLE in this phone. Seriously, I always make mistakes since N8 is not very responsive and the space bar is TOO much close the letter N. Also, you dont have QWERTY in straight position, so you gotta change it to horizontal, which is a pain sometimes when you wanna do things fast.GPS - its good and bad. Sometimes it changes de language for no reason.Reset - During calls my phone resetsOverall, I think its a good phone.

Music player interface was too clunky (can't play find/play a song only artist from shuffle mode), automatic Bluetooth connection with my Acura was too hit or miss (E71 is consistently rock solid with the same car)and QuickOffice not included (must be purchased separately). eMail w/ embedded HTML still does not work within Mail for Exchange.Liked the fullscreen email and browser, but the navigation was clunky (not just different, unintuitive). Having the larger screen does make browsing and emails much easiser to read and reply to.  The screen is great both for reading and typing.

I've got mine in no time and excellent conditions. The phone is awesome looking and it's built with the excellence of Nokia hardware. The battery will last 3 to 4 days on a modest usage, and 1 and half days when using lots of apps and data transactions. 0 complaints in this area.Call and SMS. Great call quality, great loudspeaker quality and the SMS app or \"Conversatios\" as it's called are great. So, purely on the cell phone aspect, this is truly one of the best (compared to my wife's iPhone 4, 0 dropped calls or bad calls).Camera and Video Recorder. This is THE strong point of this phone. Great pictures and the video is gorgeous (720 HD). Has a couple of editing tools (for both images and video), but, you know, nothing you didn't have already on your PC. Score a solid 10 on this.GPS. I had an XpressMusic 5800 before this, and this was one of my favorite qualities (one of very few). In this phone the navigation (using ONLY gps) is faster and overall, it's awesome. Love the fact that data connection is totally optional and the tools and maps are being updated often. So another big 10 on this aspect.Radio & FM Transmitter. Not that they are directly related, but the two worked great. No problems at all on the radio side (I use it on a daily basis). On the FM Transmitter I did have problems of connection at first, but all it took was to change the default frequency (in my case from 90.0 to 90.5) and that was it, worked great! Another 10!Video viewer. I love the fact that I can see (in excellent quality) movies here and, if needed, transmit them (via HDMI) to a TV. The formats, well, I copied an M4V file (ripped one of my DVD's using HandBreak) to the phone and ended up converting it, automatically, to WMV, so it took like an hour to do this, but maybe there are easier ways :P. Anyways, another 10.Apps. The truth is that although there are a lot of applications (some good, some not so much), it doesn't compare (and it probably will never) to either the store of Apple or Android. But it does have most basic stuff. Lets call this a not to solid 7.O.S. Well, now we come to the REAL aspect in which this phone falls way back. So, for starters this is way faster and responsive than the XpressMusic (if any users are thinking on upgrading), but to be honest, the real valid comparison should be to, for example, a Nexus One (Android) or iPhone 4. I mention this two because I have tried both. So, I'm just gonna say that the OS is like half the speed of the Nexus One and a third of the stability of the iPhone 4 :SBut let's not compare, shall we, or we'll go through a dark and very popular path. Lets just say that with the first software update (PR1.1) most instabilities and errors have been fixed. The phone it's 80% of the time pretty \"fluid\" while navigating through the interface and using most apps. Still has some \"hanging\" problems (reset not needed, only needs some seconds people :P), but not as bad as the beginning (I would say that at first it was only fluid 60% of the time). I'm hoping that further updates will keep refining the overall OS.And, FYI, although Nokia has made a partnership with Microsoft, they have said (and clarify it in BIG BOLD letters), they will continue to maintain the Symbian's phones, so I'm pretty sure updates will still come (at least a couple more). Oh yeah, for anyone who cares, this whole OS thing, well I give it a 7 (with update considered).So anyways, just to sum up my review, this phone (as you can see from the \"scores\") is a very interesting smart phone with great features and although in the OS department it falls way short to some of its main competition, it still has great strong advantages.Lets say that if you mainly use the calendar, email (sync both to your outlook and/or Gmail!), camera, video recorder, video viewer, PURE GPS navigating, calling/SMS (duh!) and minor to mild usage of apps, this phone is a great option.If you mainly want it to have great (or the best) apps and because of it need the phone to run flawlessly, spend and extra 150 to 200 dollars and buy an Nexus One, HTC Desire or an iPhone 4.In my case, I'm in the first group, so, I'm pretty happy the phone.Hope it helps.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good cell phone!", "Author": "princess9191", "ReviewID": "R15PC8ILLJHC0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has been working perfect for me.

I doubt we will ever reach smartphone perfection and no single device will ever satisfy all of us, but if you take an honest look at the specifications and functions across the smartphone world at the moment the Nokia N8 may actually be the closest thing to perfection available today.As I stated in my earlier hands-on article, existing Symbian fans will love the Nokia N8 while people who have used iOS, webOS, and Android devices may not like the Symbian operating system. Given that the operating system people prefer is highly subjective to what you are used to and what you need to do with a device, let's take a look at the hardware specifications and functionality outside of the user interface to see why the Nokia N8 stands out above the rest.There is a TON packed into the Nokia N8 and these specs and features listed here are just those that are above and beyond what we see in other devices today:Penta-band 3G wireless radio: You can use the N8 on T-Mobile, AT&T;, and other carriers around the world (850/900/1700/1900 & 2100 MHz frequencies supported) and currently only the latest Nokia Symbian ^3 devices have this capability.Bluetooth 3.012 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics and largest sensor found in a camera phone. A Xenon flash is also found to make photographs look fantastic with 720p video capture that includes fabulous zoom capability.Dual microphones for audio recording qualityHDMI port with FULL TV out of everything on the deviceUSB on-the-go so you can connect USB flash drives, hard drives, and other peripheralsAluminum body in five stylish colorsFree Ovi Maps with offline navigation and maps for countries around the world. I never travel to a foreign country without a Nokia device preloaded with maps so I can navigate offline with no data plan required.FM radio and FM transmitter: Once you have an FM transmitter in your phone you realize how awesome it is to listen to podcasts and your music in the car and at home without any wires.You might find one or two of these specs in a device, but the Nokia N8 includes ALL of them in a single device that is available for just $549 in a SIM-unlocked manner with NO contract obligation. It is available in amazon for $449 now or You can regularly find it popping up on other websites for less too. I am also a fan of the 3.5 inch OLED display that is fully usable in sunlight. You also cannot beat Nokia for RF reception and phone calls are crystal clear with the phone not dropping calls like so many now just expect with the latest smartphones. I also like that I have 16GB internal with the ability to add a 32GB microSD card.There are also some hidden features in the Nokia N8 that Nokia never tells you about and these include the ability to use your Zune Pass subscription music and view Amazon Video On Demand movies and TV shows right on the Nokia N8.The one specification that doesn't appear to lead the pack, on paper at least, is the 680 MHz processor. Today's high end smartphones sport 1 GHz processors, but I honestly have not seen any lag in my N8 and the processor has not been an issue. The processor performance is highly dependent on the rest of the hardware and the operating system. Also, keep in mind the N8 has a graphics processor that takes some of the heavy lifting off of the main phone processor.The N8 also does not support the newest HSPA+ data networks.

I bought the phone for its amazing features. It has the best camera (or atleast one of the top three) available on it, which is a HUGE plus for me. It has USB to go, an HDMI out, decent amount of memory with the capability to add more (upto 32gb via mini sdHC cards); in short I was really excited to get the phone. When I got it though, I wasn't impressed at all, it came with the orignal symbian s^3 OS, which was laggy and slow, and simply made me annoyed. I thought the phone is slow, or it doesnt have enough processing power. And I really wanted to get rid of it, until Anna was finally released. Anna is the fastest operating system I've used on any phone (other being iOS, and android). It runs smooth and seemlessly, and is simple to use. Made me fall in love with the phone all over again. Fast forward a few months, and Belle came along. Another WoW! Its simply beautiful, and I love how customizable it is. You can set each home screen however you want, and have custom settings for the horizontal and vertical orientations, with icons and widgets of different sizes. Belle, atleast for me, doesn't run as fast as Anna, but it isn't bad at all considering it was built for phones with twice the memory and processing power. Also, it only takes time to load when you're looking at something for the first time. For example, say you haven't checked your second,(or 3rd or,4th, or 5th, or 6th)home screen in a while (about 15 min to an hour). When you swipe to see the home screen, it takes about 1 or 2 seconds to load and update all the widgets you have on that particular home screen. Once its loaded, you can swipe back and forth seemlessly, and everything will be loaded & ready for you. The reason it takes a few seconds the first time is becuase it avoids storing un-needed information for prolonged periods in your RAM. This in turn saves your battery, and thats the reason I can get by a day or two or more without having to re-charge whereas my sister who uses android can't go any more than a few hours or a day with the same kind of usage.In short, Now I have a mini-HDMI to DVI-D converter (bought it at amazon), and also Nokia's RCA Cable (Fits in the 3.5mm jack on top). So I can hook up a monitor, an old TV, or a new HD tv to my phone. Connect my phone to a Keyboard and mouse via USB or bluetooth and I have a fully funtional computer that I can use to make assignments & presentation. Its a perfect balance of work and play, thats basically what I got the phone for, and I'm very happy with it.After seeing Belle, I really hope Nokia would keep making symbian phones, atleast for the high-end market, coz there is truly nothing as good out there (although I've heard good things about Meego too, but I've never personally used it).Cheers to the hardware & software makers of the N8, Anna, & Belle!", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still a worthy handset, with more worth to come...", "Author": "SA", "ReviewID": "R2FL9US9L6X28U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had waited a while for this phone to be released when Nokia first announced it with the Symbian 3 OS. It has an unbeatable feature set and arguable the best camera to be found on a mobile phone, rivaling standalone point & shoot cameras. However, Symbian 3 proved to be quite a disappointment compared to the new operating systems around by then. That being said, for anyone used to Nokia phones, it was still an improvement.Quality of construction is superb, and it exudes an air of class about it including the choice of colours. Connectivity is unmatched with USB-on-the-go, HDMI output to TV which is amazing and shows great detail, and an FM transmitter that works better than many standalone FM transmitters on the market !! I streamed music through a car stereo recently, and could swear it was connected via cable, with no disruption whatsoever !! That may have a lot to do with us having no stations near the 90.0 band where I had it set, but once you find a channel that is free, this thing works in a jaw dropping manner !The whole major selling point of this phone has been the camera and it does not disappoint. It has now also been enhanced by the Symbian Anna update and now has continuous auto-focus in video recording.I finally decided to buy this phone over a year since its release for a couple of reasons which now make it a good bargain...Firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand;Secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and..Thirdly and very importantly, the new Symbian Belle OS update has been promised for this phone and other Symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the N8 running on Belle shows a modern 'Android'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a Symbian phone. That update alone would make the N8 feel like a product just released and give it some value to come, along with the pending Microsoft Productivity Suite updates.As it is, Symbian remains very efficient on power use which means long battery life, and good at true multitasking. The current update reduces the amount of freezing experienced, and Belle should make a world of difference, that alone makes this phone a good value-for-money proposition especially with Amazon's price !", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first Touchscreen Phone", "Author": "R.

The iPhone is a great phone but just not the one of my taste.Why did I choose the N8? well, it has all that I wanted.I am currently outside the US and the 3G frequency here is 850MHz which narrows my options.The HTC: Only specific models has the HSPDA 850MHz (A8182 & A8183) which are quite difficult to find on Amazon, in fact I was not able to find one!The Samsung: Checked with a friend's phone and the signal coverage was not that good.The Motorola: Great phone (xenon flash, HDMI out, HD Video capability), but a bit too big to fit confortably in my handI currently own a Nokia E51 and it is a great phone, in over 2 years no issues at all and the signal coverage is amazing (My wife works at a school out in the mountain area, and where all the other phones(Samsung, LG, Motorola) have failed with the network coverage(screen shows searching for network) this one wins by far (80% signal strenght)Purchased the phone on \"Cyber Monday\" for $429. Got the \"Made in china\" one and was a bit worried based on the reviews I saw, but I've had no issues at all with the phone(most of our electronic devices are made in China anyway). It even came with the updated firmware(RM596) and all the software updated as well (OVI suite shows \"No updates available\")Only some minor annoyances so far:1. Sometimes (less now than before) The screen will not respond to touch. I tap and tap and tap again and nothing, as if it was not aware that I was tapping or maybe I am not doing it correctly.2. Sometimes when I flip the phone, the screen will not rotate, I have to return it to portrait and then flip it and then it will rotate the screen. Amazingly, if the phone is on the table, as soon as I pick it up, the screen rotates!3. The home screen is a bit simple and you cannot place widgets side by side. Solved by installing SPB Mobile Shell4. The browser is not that bright so I use Opera Mobile 10 instead.5. No QWERTY keyboard in Portrait mode (weird as when using Opera, you get the QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode)6. No \"custom\" setting for equalizer as my E51 hasBedides these, which I can live with, the phone is working great. I get 100% battery after 1 complete day of usage. Power Saving Mode is nice to cutdown battery dain.Played Angry Birds, Neef For Speed Shift, Real Golf 2011 and Galaxy On Fire and they all ran flawlessly.Now, I can leave my Zen Multimedia Player(N8 Headphones have a great sound) and my Panasonic Lumix Camera at home as I have both features in the N8, plus, I can use it to make and receive calls.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product for the price!", "Author": "Christian", "ReviewID": "R2JBDKGNIVYJ2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Nokia N8 and i think you get a great product for the price you pay. Maybe it is not as fancy and hyped as an iPhone or an Android based phone but it is really cool and you get a lot of stuff that clearly exceeds the iPhone or an HTC Android phone.To put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the Samsung Galaxy S and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:In the Nokia N8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting HD video and also capable of displaying it on a TV really easily thanks to its HDMI socket and cable included in the bundle package. Besides you get a Xenon Flash.In the Samsung Galaxy you get a 5 mega pixel camera WITH NO flash y with no capacity to shoot HD video.On the other side, the internet navigation is much better on the Samsung Galaxy, it is as smoth as if you were on your PC, while on the N8 it is sluggish and sometimes the phone crashes. But this only happens when you try to load big web pages. If you are trying to read your mail o read some light web sites the N8 will work just as well.The screen is almost the same on both phones in terms of brightness and sharpness, the only difference is that it's a little bigger on the Samsung, but they are almost the same.Anoter thing that i think it's better on the Galaxy is the Android Market, you get thousands of Apps there, while on the Ovi site you get a lot of Apps but they are not as diverse and cool as the Android ones, but i think this is going to get better with time, Nokia still has a lot of work to do in this field and i think they are in the right direction.Finally i would like to comment this, the overall quality of the phones is way much better in the Nokia N8. And let me explain why,In the Nokia N8 you get a hard cased phone thanks to its anodized aluminium case with gorilla crystal on the screen, so this means that your phone can take a beat and come out intact. While on the other hand, in the Samsung you get a phone that comes with a plastic case really light but really fragile and i'm not sure, but the screen doesn't look like a gorilla one. So this phone is going to be really damaged if you don't handle it with care.The price for both phones is very similar, so the decision would have to lie on what do you prefer the most. A tough really well made phone with a lot of functionalities and superb multimedia features such as a HD camera or a fragile but really agile and quick web surfing phone with a very powerfull Operating System such as the Samsung Galaxy.If it was up to me, i would make myself a Nokia N8 with the Android OS.

This is your phone.  The display in on pars with other smart phones such as Android and iPhone4, which use AMOLED display with a notable exception of iPhone4's retinal display.  Night shots with N8 are not comparable to say a dedicated camera that is equipped with a much more powerful xenon flash.  In other words, if you do not resize the pics you snapped at night, then you will see noise (even my DSLR Nikon shows a little noise in poor lighting -- can you imagine a phone that is equipped with a much smaller xenon flash).  Call quality is outstanding with ear-piece volume really loud so no need to crank up the volume to max when you are in a noisy place.  UI is a little dated especially coming from Nexus One, but no worries you can download Nokia's Midnight theme to spice up UI and there are 50 improvements for Symbian ^3 on the way to make users experience even more commendable.  The virtual qwerty keyboard is a little slow like the Android 2.1 version.  With Android 2.2 version, it seems much faster than N8.  Like I pointed out, there are 50 improvements on the way, and one of these improvements might or might not address the issue with responsiveness of the qwerty keyboard.Now for quality control.  You have to be patient with N8 b/c you might end up a bad power management unit that is fully recognized by Nokia Corp. (just google it) and read the articles.  My first N8 was silver color and it would not even power on, so I had to exchange it (Amazon was very nice about this b/c they sent it overnight for the replacement -- that's customer service).  Unfortunately, the replacement, though works, had cosmetic issue on the inner bezel.  The blemish was naked eye visible that can be seen under bright lights, so I had to return the phone.  I ordered a black one now in the hopes that the black one is a later batch that Nokia may have addressed major issues.  The black ones seem to be purchased at higher demand and hence Amazon might have a new batch in their inventory.

I was expecting it would come with Symbian Anna OS, however the model I received product code: 059D0V2) came with Symbian 3 (PR 1.2 v. 14.002, released March 2011) - a real dinosaur of a software. No sign of Anna, not even when I searched for updates. S^3 OS is very buggy (phone freezes, randomly reboots, etc.). I contacted Nokia support a couple of times but they said that this is the latest version of software for the model I have. I question the quality of Nokia's support given that they were not able to help me get a much-needed software update for the phone._________________UPDATE: I asked Amazon for a replacement and while they couldn't tell me whether the phone would have Anna OS installed, fortunately it did. So far the OS does seem much faster and more stable. Amazon service has been great: they sent the replacement phone in two days (and didn't even ask me to first return the old one). On the other hand, I am skeptical of Nokia's customer service who should have been able to help me update the software from S^3 to Symbian Anna in the first place. For this I had to give the phone four stars._________________My impressions so far:Pros- Beautiful detailing and solid construction- High-quality camera, very good at taking close-ups- GPS with voice-guided driving and walking navigation with multiple language support; works quite well provided there is adequate satellite reception. Unlike Google maps it does not require internet connection if maps are preloaded.- The mp3 player music quality is very good with one exception (see below)- Loudspeaker quality is very good (positioning is problematic though - see below)- Plays all video formats- Certain aspects of the software seem to be well thought-through (e.g. super easy to e-mail photos: select the photos and then the e-mail option, the e-mail application opens up with the photos already attached)- Simple, graphically-pleasing interface.- Interface is quite flexible overall (e.g. settings menu is impressive, offering much control over different aspects of phone functionality). You can easily add icons to homescreens and define different profiles. Most folders can easily be reorganized (except for the Settings menu).- The virtual qwerty keyboard is quite easy to use and you can install the Swype app for added predictive text functionality and foreign languages.- Fun features: FM transmitter which allows you to stream music from the phone to an FM radio (e.g. in your car) works quite well.Cons- Camera shutter is quite loud and there is no way to turn off the sound. I was only able to turn off the shutter sound after I installed the CameraPro app, unfortunately the app has issues (bugs) of its own so I am not sure if I will keep it on the phone. Either that or you gotta use your finger to block the loudspeaker (crude but works pretty well).- Camera auto-focus red LED light (different from the flash) is quite bright and disturbing to subjects looking towards the camera (even my cat was annoyed by it). While it is possible to disable the light with the CameraPro app, the photos come out quite blurry without it so the LED light sadly seems necessary. Fortunately, the light only seems to come on in low-light conditions.- There is a perceptible static noise with some wired headphones (e.g. Creative in-the-ear buds EP-630 and 660). The noise level is quite low so it is perceptible only inbetween songs or when there is no other sound coming from the phone. From what I read online, this seems to be a hardware design issue. Fortunately, the noise is not present when the screen is off, nor is it perceptible with the included headphones. The problem is also eliminated with Bluetooth headphones (because you are no longer using the jack).- Loudspeaker is partially obstructed when phone is lying down on table (has a considerable impact on speaker loudness)- There is no way to prevent the phone from automatically connecting to Wi-Fi when you start an app; specifying \"Always ask\" for \"Data use in home country\" under Settings > Connectivity > Settings does not work. The only work-around is to change the priority of your internet connections under Destinations > Internet.- You have to remember to check for fingerprints before taking a photo, because when you hold the phone your fingers end up on the camera lens.- The phone comes with an astounding number of different settings (a good thing) however the settings folder is poorly organized and thus difficult to navigate. I have a very hard time remembering where to find what. Unfortunately the settings structure is not customizable.- The positioning and shape of the menu key on the tapered part of the phone in the bottom left corner is awkward.- The phone feels a bit slippery as is, however I bought Nokia's silicone cover on Amazon and the cover works very well.NOTE: It takes a little more pressure than usual to get the headphone cable into the jack all the way. I initially thought that the headphones that came with the phone did not work until I realized that I was not pushing them into the jack far enough. You will know they are all the way in if you feel a click. After I did this, they worked fine.In summary, hardware is great and with the Symbian Anna OS, the software is much improved. This phone is like a mini computer - it can do much more than I expected when buying the phone.

Finally bought other brand that had to go back then a second other brand that did not arrive, then decided that I have had 3 or 4 Nokia with no issue to get the N8. Not disappointed when it arrived great look and feel and after a couple weeks I am getting use to the UI and finding way around.Great wifi connectivity, gets mail instantly and web surfing zooms too, just a little limited in what you see.Initially I was having trouble with the wifi not shutting off as it should by the manual but see from other user that it will not shut off, found work around and that is put phone in offline mode, problem there you can not get phone calls.Other gripe is related to document capabilities, as I big on pdf reading find that the pdf reader is inferior to my 5yr HP Ipac, uses a lot of the screen prorifery which reduces the actual available view screen and has no overflow mode, can work around and maybe there is an AP that will fix this.Now find the battery may be way off spec, I have turned off all key tones and vib stuff as well as on GSM only, charge at night down to one bar in morning in normal setting! In offline mode with no calls and little other use the battery will go 5days (~100hrs) always have full bars reception via AT&T.;I have done more investigation and have changed the mail settings way down to 12hr sync and a lot of the other stuff they mention in the manual under extending battery life. If this works I will give back a star otherwise I will look to return the phone.Six months now!Now had this phone over six months, I have had to put that extra star up as I managed to sort out the battery life. I keep the phone in power save mode and the phone goes most of the week without recharge.Love the GPS as long as I do not need to navigate about a big CBD (inner city area), I found that the screen goes into standby mode which was a worry, but the GPS does reawaken before any directional change.The one minor annoyance with wifi in power save mode is that the ISP connection must reload every time you change pages, open email or the like. Not a problem unless you have an account that must be logged into everytime you connect, one of my networks is like this but I am currently trying a new authentication system which should fix this.Found Quick Office APP for pdf reading with reflow (US$9.95) like I want, loaded easy only not full function removed as advised now have issue with some setting cruption. Will have to go through factory reset that includes saving all data and wiping current custom phone config, what a hassle!!!*** Remember to ask either your ISP provider, your mobile network provider, your APP provider or Nokia techies for assistance if you have issues as they are usual able to assist and should find most genuine to help, maybe some newbies will give grief but work through for piece of mind ***All in all I am really happy with this phone, it looks cool, it has what I need, it was a reasonable price and I can use my own mobile provider.

Me, ...tired of that life style, prepare myself for something new.I had a really bad and annoying experience with a Nokia 5800 :S It looks so FAT, screen sucks and feel so plastic! Besides that, the Symbian it uses fed me up. The menu or process for doing anything is maddening. It ask for everything. Makes me feel stupid.I did a very detailed research of this device before I placed my order. I read every single review on amazon and from other websites. At first, I was REALLY scare of the Sleep Of Dead [SOD] that happens on some units but I assume de risk and hope not to use the \"return\" option.Here are my POSSITIVE impressions of the Nokia N8:+ Penta Band 3G: Wherever I go, USA, Europe, Caribbean I'll have 3G access! That's cool.+ AMOLED screen: Looks great and it's nice to know that it has gorilla scratch resistant. Of course iF4 and must of Android devices has better graphics.+ Housing/Design: Perfect! The aluminium finish, nice material and the silver color makes a great balance.+ Camera/Xenon Flash: Much better than all Windows Mobile, Android that I've used. I cant compare to iphone4 since I haven't use it.+ FM Radio wRDS and Transmitter: Nowadays it's not common to listen FM stations but I've found the FM Transmitter very useful! The only issue is that must be really close to the radio in order to work better.+ Signal: Great. I've experience this talking volume in Blackberry devices. The sound is adequate.+ Battery: Great so far :D Gives more than a day. With Android devices battery last 6-12hrs...+ USB On the Go: Havent test it but It's really cool to know It's on your device!+ HDMI: Havent test it but It's really cool to know It's on your device!NEGATIVE Impressions from other REVIEWS and my fixes:- Virtual Keyboard: Yes, it's bad at first. Need some time to get used to it but It's good using Spanish language. We'll have an update soon, so, we hope Nokia do something with this! There is also another keyboard called \"DAYHAND\" just google it... It seems that is not available any more.- Browser: IT REALLY SUCKS!!! Try Opera and use Opera Link to have your Favorite websites linked.- No OFFICE Documents Edit: Yes, This was fixed with an update... Anyways I don't use it.- Video Recording has no light: So? Some other devices don't have it either... Im so satisfied with the Xenon that I don't really care of LED.- Battery is not User friendly replaceable: So?!?!?! With Symbian there is no need of flash-a-holic and do some crazy app installations. Just press the power button for a few seconds and I'll restart.- Poor Application Store: It's right, it's not the best. But must of the application I use are available. Too bad Developers are not motivated :(- GPS: I can't use OVI MAPS in my country. Looking for google maps for Symbian...EXPECTATIONS1) Announcement of the next update with fixes of all software issued including new keyboard!.2) Hope my N8 dont DIE!!!

I'll admit, there were more than a few negative reviews here that had me wondering. Even the best of products will have a certain percentage of \"lemons\" - and folks who get those are, understandably, much more likely to vent here than a satisfied user. But tons of these have already been sold in a pretty short period of time.I decided to go ahead and give the N8 a try - and am thrilled with it. I did immediately do the recently released firmware upgrade before actually using the N8...and have had no problems at all. The update is easy once you download the Ovi Suite onto your PC. It walks you right through it.Since the Amazon product description is very complete - and accurate, I'll focus here on some questions I had when considering the N8.The N8 is a solidly built machine - and since I was an N82 owner, I was already familiar with the Symbian OS, and was \"right at home\". I like the improvements made on the Symbian^3 version. Maybe it was my familiarity with the OS already - but after testing IPhone 4 and a Droid - the N8 was still my choice. I guess I don't \"run with the herd\" as they say. I find my N8 as fast and responsive as the other two I tested - and with more features.Update 10-30-2011: Nokia has offered two software updates to the operating system- now up to Symbian Anna - with a \"Belle\" upgrade expected in a few more weeks. It keeps getting better:)I've been completely satisfied with this purchase. Absolutely incredible camera/video on this. I always have a GREAT voice-guided GPS unit, digital camera, video camera, web browser, email AND PHONE with me...all-in-one. I have not experienced the negative issues others have mentioned in their reviews.-End Update Section-I've been showing it off to friends with IPhone 4s and Droids - all of whom have been VERY impressed with the N8 features, software and apps that I've added from the Nokia run Ovi Store; useful apps - as opposed to the fluff and sometimes goofy apps offered for the other systems.Internet use on the phone is not something I do a lot of - but I find it works very well. I like the fact that this is an unlocked phone. Mine arrived already set up for AT&T; wireless if you're going in that direction. But, since I'm not a heavy user, it's less expensive for me to use the now nationwide mobile virtual network operator, Consumer Cellular. It is a company that buys bulk air/data time from AT&T.; I have been with them for several years and wanted a phone that would work with their service. I programmed the N8 using the Consumer Cellular settings & SIM card to handle voice calls, text and picture messaging and data/internet. It all works great!My favorite app from Ovi Store is Best Profiles - for automatic switching between silent, normal and other modes during the day. It works beautifully on the N8. I also have added Google Latitude/Maps - again, functioning perfectly on the N8, and updating my location every 10 minutes or so on average.I've converted some classic TV shows from my DVDs to mp4 files and loaded them onto the N8. Playback of videos is excellent.I am very, very pleased with my new N8. I got the gray one (yes, it's made in China) and it is a good, solid, well built device. I also bought a 32GB class 4 microSDHC card to add to the phone, and the Commuter Series Otter Box case, which is awesome. The Otter Box case preserves the good look of the N8. It comes with the silicon cover/wrap, (which you could use on its own), a screen protector, and the outer plastic shell which fits over the silicon wrap.

No, it doesn't have the most simple or flashy user interface, and if you only browse the web and download games, better stick with something simpler. But if you want some power-user features, this fits the bill nicely.The camera is most impressive. I recently compared it to my Panasonic TS1 camera, which isn't shabby itself, and the N8 got better-looking photos, with better sharpness, contrast and color accuracy, not to mention vastly more detail in low light and no annoying chroma noise. Also love the bright wide-angle lens, and the Xenon flash. I only wish it had better dynamic range in the highlights. Make no mistake - it leaves any other phone camera in the dust.The OS is packed with features like a file browser, Bluetooth file transfers, photo editor, HD video recording, turn-by-turn navigation, mass storage \"drag and drop\" support, and more. The interface is intuitive and easy enough to use. I know a lot of people complain how it's not as \"slick\" and \"polished\" compared to Apple's, but I personally find Apple's interface disgustingly limiting and restrictive, thus I prefer a more capable OS.I also love the multi-tasking abilities. I can follow turn-by-turn navigation while listening to music while taking photos at the same time with this phone, and it performs without a hiccup.The multi-media capabilities are quite nice too. With 16GB internal storage and powerful hardware, I can simply copy movies from my computer to the phone, and it plays them back flawlessly. The music player has an easy to use interface and the sound quality is excellent. It also comes with a good-sounding headset, which can control the player.It has 3G on every band, which means I can have a fast connection with any GSM carrier.The keyboard is ok, but I still prefer a hardware keyboard.While it offers plenty of features, it's missing some abilities compared to my older Nokia E71. It can't create a custom EQ preset, can't edit ID3 tags, can't edit office documents without a paid upgrade (Edit - as of January 2011, a firmware update enabled office document editing), and can't encrypt the memory (Edit - the upgrade to Symbian Belle enabled memory encryption). At least it has a passcode lock, and while locked, you can't access the phone via the USB port, so that should stop all but the most determined hackers and crackers.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone.

For a company that was initially the world leader in mobile phone sales, having nearly twice the market share as its nearest competitor, Nokia has fallen way behind indeed as the leading technology innovator, in recent years. It's really all due to poor leadership. It began with copying all the bad habits of competitors (like placing loudspeaker grills at the backs instead of infront or at the sides of phones), and abandoning first principles (like no longer making products user friendly/very easy to use.) With the N8, the company is attempting to reclaim lost glory, and ground.Having literally thrown the N97 in the garbage a few times, I can honestly state that using the N8 is a vaaaaaaaaaaslty better experience. Although the software continues to be more complicated to use at times than it really ought to be, there is far more to like about the phone than dislike.For one, the software is a lot more stable, though not rock solid. There are still occasional bugs that annoy - try marking all text messages in a folder and scrolling, and the phone will freeze for a a minute or two before finally flinging the list of texts across the screen. When responding to a text in conversation mode, you literally have to hard \"tap\" the input area for the phone to respond. A light press of the finger won't do. In portrait mode, sometimes touching a symbol like a question mark or exclamation point for a text message, requires two or three presses, and almost never works with a thumb. An index or other finger is definitely preferred.Overall though, the capacitive touch experience is nearly on par with that of the Iphone, the screen is bright, everything on the phone works as it's supposed to, and all the programs installed are much more accessible than before. A particularly happy highlight is the process for setting up email accounts - a more straightforward process I do not know of. Push email actually works!!!!But perhaps the real genius of this phone are its photo and video abilities. I can't tell you the difference between HD and otherD, blue ray or dvd, but I can recognize a good photo when I see one or good video when I watch it. The phone's camera is so good you'll not only want to take more and more pictures, but it will make you believe you're actually a pretty decent photographer. It's just that good. The videos look like they were shot by a hollywood studio with a large production budget, and are *crystal* *clear!!!*Of course, with all that good stuff, those wonderful people at Nokia had to find *something* to screw up - the phone has only one loudspeaker port located on the back of the handset right next to the camera lens, on the protruding camera module...(eyes rolling.) The problem is that, because of its location, if you place the phone face up on a desk, table or other flat surface, the loudspeaker is automatically muffled to the point of uselessness.... And, if you just happen to lay the phone down on its back on something soft, like a couch, easy chair or bed, YOU CAN'T HEAR ANY SOUND. Not phone calls, text messages, email notificaions. Nothing. Yes. I know it's hard to believe but, the people at Nokia really are.that.stupid.You can't make perfection the enemy of the good so... it's still a great phone and one of Nokias best in a long, looooooong time, and I should know.

I'd definitely grown to appreciate the N8 in this time, having upgraded from a strictly call-and-text phone, but I couldn't shake my curiosity for the open-source Android OS.  So on T-Mobile's sale day, I went and grabbed a Samsung Galaxy S II for \"free\" (still $400 over a 2 year contract) -- probably the most powerful phone you can currently buy, and with the flashy Android platform, it should have been instant love... but it only took one evening to realize the N8 already had everything I wanted, and actually does some stuff better.I'm not crazy about Google to begin with (privacy policy stuff) so I was disappointed to discover that with Android you're basically forced to use your Google account to access many of the applications, including the app market.  Besides that, it just felt like too much phone.  And contrary to popular belief, I didn't find the Android OS to be any easier to use than Nokia's Symbian OS, and in fact for the most part they look pretty similar.  Plus, Nokia is known to make beautiful hardware, and the N8 is a great example -- eye catching design, functional buttons, and the weighty feeling of a quality product.  I'm only slightly disappointed with the Ovi store, which doesn't boast as many apps as the other guys.  But as someone else said, it has the ones you need and not the ones you don't (but let me know if you find one for a dvorak keyboard...).Everything else I've played with so far has worked wonderfully, including maps (with GPS and a compass), music player, web browsing (use Opera Mobile), and the camera is better than any I've had before, digital or otherwise.  Bottom line is, Nokia is still the best in the business, and Symbian OS is plenty adequate for doing stuff on a phone.  Don't buy into the hype of Android phones (or the iPhone, for that matter) because you'll probably end up returning it after one day like I did.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWESOME CAMERA PHONE", "Author": "Bugman", "ReviewID": "RFOWIXN11CJPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for the camera... and it has not disappointed.  It's wonderful.  It blows away my Olympus point and shoot. After seeing the pictures on my screen, my friends all thought this phone was a nice camera.  They were surprised when they found out it was actually a phone.  The Nokia apps are a bit limited compared to Android and iphone, but there are plenty and I have yet to say \"I wish there was an app for this!\"  Nokia GPS has performed VERY well too, even re-routing us around a road closure shortly after a huge wreck!The only thing the US version is lacking is Asian language support.  Nokia has dropped the ball by limiting language.  Evidently there are fixes, though it's not easy.The camera takes consistently great pictures, and video quality is good.  Two issues, though.  There is no LED light to light up dark scenes for video.  The camera flash is great, but red-eye is pretty bad.

I endup accidentally disconnecting/muting the call by touching the screen. I understood that this problem exists in other brands which sport proximity sensor. Also the phone's loud speaker is housed in the camera/flash compartment which protrudes outward like a bump. So if you keep the phone faceup on soft bed or couch, chances are that you will not hear the phone ringing. Also the speaker is mono, no dual speakers for stereo as Nokia N900 has.Overall it is a very good device to own and I am completely enjoying the product.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very usable smartphone and quite fun!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Techno Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RZ8E7HXINT9YL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this phone for over a month and I am quite happy I got it. It works great on T Mobile service. Why get this phone instead of others? I did not want to be tied to a service that had limited data plan and T Mobile had unlimited data plan that was very reasonable in price. Since iPhone4 does not work well with T Mobile, that cut the choices to a few.I had prior experiences with Nokia phones and how bullet proof was and I so I went with this one especially when it showed up during Christmas' Lightning Deals. Nokia makes great hardware but software could be their weak spot. This phone is already over year old and that means the Symbian OS for this phone will have most of the bugs out. I was an early adopter for the N900 and that is the lesson I learned. There are many annoyances and aggravations if you are an early adopter. I will make some comparison between this N8 and N900 that I had for 2 years.I am an amateur photographer and love snapping pictures and having a good camera was a must. The N8 filled that bill. I know that 12 megapixels for a small lens was overkill but boy do the pictures come out good! The HD videos from this phone is beyond impressive. I took night videos of Christmas light and they came out crisp and sharp. Photographing at night still is limited and shows high noise and that is not a surprise given the small lens diameter. The larger diameter lens you have, the better light gathering capability you have. That is why DSLR is the best camera to have if you want to take pictures in the dark with no flash (and a very steady hand or tripod! and a very fast lens!). The N8 comes with Zeiss Tessar lens with 2.8 aperture and that gives you the edge on pictures taking that other smartphone camera will fail. There has been a feature film shown in movie theater that had been shot totally with the Nokia N8. Albeit done with a Canon lens in front of it with adapters that seem to be custom made. I have Canon lens and looking for adapters for it myself!! The N900 had a great camera cover that one manually opened to use the camera and kept the lens clean. The N8 is exposed and therefore got dirty. I was looking into a protective film and read that it was not a good idea. So I have to clean that front lens quite frequently when taking pictures. There are several apps available for camera and I do like one app that can morph and do funny things to the photo while taking it. I had lots of fun with my friends that way. The N8 own camera app had good integration with Facebook and I was able to share easily with my friends and they are amazed how the pictures look. HD video is not easy to share if it is more than certain size for obvious reason.The main purpose of a phone is able to make phone calls, right? In this way this phone excels. The speakerphone is clear and sharp and very loud (necessary for me as I have hearing impairment). I do not like holding phone next to my ear because I get radiation burn on my skin where the phone was. The ability to make phone call is easy on this phone. One could set up one touch dial to call a frequently called number or even do speech command.Emails on this phone is great. I was able to set up Google and Yahoo quite easily. On N900 I could not get Yahoo has I did not have POP Yahoo mail (that was for an extra fee for Yahoo POP Mail). For some reason on the N8 I could set up Yahoo which is great! The N8 also gives you options for other emails like Hotmail etc. The emails were very readable and the new Anna update made emails even better by highlighting the ones not read yet. For entering text, I do miss the physical keyboard of the N900 but the screen keyboard using Swype is just great. Swype I heard is available on Android too.Screen: The screen is very readable and pretty responsible to touch. Occasionally I have noted some freeze up and I had to shut if off and restart. It seems to be happening less often the more I use it. I try to be very careful which app I am going to add to prevent issues. This Nokia N8 has the same chip as the older N900 (which is more than 2 yrs old) but I find it is FASTER and more responsive than the older N900. Which shows you the effect of a lean and mean OS has on the usability of the product. The older N900 had higher screen resolution than the N8 and yet the N8 seems to be brighter and more readable. The N8 screen was difficult to see in sunlight while N900 was easy to read. So this is a step backward.Battery life is excellent! Can run whole day and charge it at night. Nice thing is that it has two ways to charge it. Via the microUSB or the Nokia proprietary jack that was previously used in old Nokia cell phones. Nice thing is if you are using the microUSB for something like hooking up with an external hard drive or for a keyboard, you can still charge it.Why 4 stars instead of 5? Like I said, the software sometimes freezes and I have to do a hard shutdown.ADDENDUM Feb-2012: Nokia upgraded the N8 Symbian software to the Belle and I did upgrade to it and it is like getting a new phone!! I love how easy it is to shut off the Bluetooth and WIFI to lengthen the battery life when you do not need it. The phone is so much fun to use!! I had been taking lots of pictures with it and the night time shots without flash is just amazing!! The Belle also upgraded the desktop to six different ones that you can put your own shortcuts and widgets. The email app is excellent. The Facebook app is also excellent and very usable. The Swype method typing is just great and it makes my texting so much easier so that I do not miss the tactile keyboard that I thought I would miss. Battery life is still excellent. Way better than any smartphones I had used. One still needs to charge every night to make sure you do not have a dead phone next day. The Belle upgrade also upgraded the camera app and it is so good that I do not feel I need another app for taking pictures.Addendum March-2012: I had experienced some freezing issues when I was editing pictures that I had taken with the cell phone camera. It was simply solved by using the main power button and holding it until it shuts off then restarting again. The photo app comes with editing suite that includes adding bubble text, graphics and changing contrast settings and so forth. So you can do some few Photoshop type tricks on your cell phone pictures. I just love this feature of this camera phone! I think for around three hundred dollars and a few change, you get one of the best pocketable camera with video plus one of the best GPS with voice instructions with free updated maps for MOST countries in the world for no extra charge, plus phone that actually works great and a much better bluetooth implementation. The bluetooth is so sensitive that I was able to be in a restaurant and the bluetooth speaker in the car parked in the lot still was able to be in contact with my phone. Of course this is not what you want but it demonstrates the sensitivity of bluetooth for this phone that was not there in many other phones.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia N8", "Author": "Drew", "ReviewID": "R3AFDKAGFFLV3N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well I have owned Nokia's for about 15 years. Each Nokia has lasted me around 4 years. My last Nokia (which I still have and use as a internet device aroudn the house) was the Nokia N95-3. This was the greatest phone ever created at the time (in my opinion) and set the bar for phones to follow. This revolutionized my subway travel experience and I would listen to music, play a game, send texts, and go online all at once and it was a pleasure to use. It did have a few problems with shutting off without notice and rebooting which was annoying but the pro's greatly outweighed the con's. Up until recently I ordered the Nokia N8. I have followed all the reviews on this phone and personally, when i get a phone I am in it for the long haul because I hate to constantlty refigure the settings, music etc...so my choice had to be as close to optinal as possible. My Nokia N95 took many videos of my family events and vacations in near DVD quality video and had an on board video and photo editor that many people could not believe I did the work I did on my phone riding the NYC subways. So to pick a new phone is like picking a new technological relationship. I chose the Nokia N8 because of the advanced 12 mp photography and Xenon flash. I know that other people had interface and software problems but I wanted to wait until the Anna update was in place and somewhat tried. When my phone arrived, it had Anna pre-installed which I was happy about as it was unclear that it was being shipped with Anna. So, here is my review of the N8.The User interface is something to get used to coming from a dual slider N95. It is slightly overly responsive and takes some getting used to. I am used to the Symbian system so setting up book marks cuts down on the tap'age that is needed to do simple tasks. The Rhapsody interface was a problem at first but when in doubt, erase and re-add usually does the trick for licensed music. Multi-tasking does not seem to lag despite the lower RAM. I am very power conscious and usually do not keep more than 3 or 4 programs open at one time. Camera is brilliant. Have not taken any videos yet but will do so soon. I am expecting 30 fps with Anna. Internet is very good and reasonably fast (faster than my N95). Screen is great but again, Touch is a new thing and takes some getting used to. The phone itself is a work of art but slippery so I ordered a case for it. Short cuts are key so set them up asap. Power management is pretty good. I expect about 1 day of heavy use which I have gotten for the past few days and with time I will need to charge during the day i am sure. Have not tried the GPS but I am sure it will work ok. N95 was a little basic but did the job so hopefully N8 will be better. One very annoying thing is the voice dialing. On N95 it was a tinny computer voice that was fairly rough sounding but worked. i had expcected the N8 to have an updated clearer voice but it is the same, if not more tinny than the N95! After 4 years, not clearer? Voice commands are a must. That needs improvement. Text in portriat mode also needs to be a little bigger. A little difficulty to type but maybe that will get easier in time. All in all, I am happy with the N8. You just need to customize it to your liking. Flashlight would be great if it had a spare workable LED.  I was waiting for an optical zoom to come out and actually today I think I heard there is one coming next year from Nokia. I am a Nokia Loyalist so hopefully in another 4 years there will be all I want and more. Other phones do a nice job but the Nokia, I think, is still built to last. I would like to give 5 stars but I will save that for a better operating system and software. Symbian 3^ just feels like an upgraded version of the N95 Symbian that looks a little nicer but has the same engine under the hood. My wife mentioned that when I got the N95 I was so amazed by the device and she noticed that after I had this one, I looked underwhelmed. Maybe but to be fair, N8 is still very new and I do like it but as a testomonial to the N95, it has big shoes to fill in terms of being an easy to use workhorse. I do miss playing Chess on N95. Touch screen Chess without a Styulis pen is very difficult. I looked at the N9 but the high price, questionable compatibility with T-mobile, Micro Sim, lack of expandable memory, and lower resolution and flash quality made me opt for the N8. Amazon reviews helped me with my decision so I hope this review helps others.

Coming from a long line of Nokia products, I was fully prepared for some of the typical Nokia glitches/characteristics.  The N8 has a phenomenal camera, which I used extensively.  However, after sampling an Android OS smartphone, I felt a bit cheated (read: jealous) that such as powerful, high quality device like the N8 didn't have certain applications or support from its software developers.  Nokia's OVI store has come a long way from my previous E50 and E71, but at the end of the day, I felt like something was missing.  Most touch screen phones are usually easy to operate, but this one required far more (and almost unnecessary) key strokes and steps to accomplish every task, that it became exhausting to do anything.  Previous Symbian powered devices run circles around it with their old school hardware keys.  I did not experience any of the shut downs or problems may others did.  Conversely, this had so many great Nokia features and hardware I hated to return it because I'm such a Nokia fan...but with the recent withdrawal of Nokia from the US market I felt abandoned as a long term customer.Likes: excellent camera, alarm clock that works even if you power the phone off, built in OVI maps (not reliant upon the buggy network carrier), battery life, screen resolution and build quality.Dislikes: cost, lack of popular applications available for download, buggy processor at times, and extremely difficult data input method.If the E7 would have the N8's camera, or the N8 the E7's keyboard I suspect it would've been easier to live with.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone!", "Author": "Oscar Pozos Saldivar \"Oscar_Pozos\"", "ReviewID": "R1730U6GA8Z4A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia N8 is an excellent phone.It will take a couple of hours to figure out everything about how the phone works but once it's set up the phone offers the following features:- Multitasking: Once you set up all the icons, shortcuts and menus in the different customizable screens in the phone, you actually see how each application is working without affecting the phone performance. For example, you may be playing a song (and its application window shows song, controls, etc), then below that window you can have you email that updates as new email comes, in another window you can see your social media updates and activity on real time, etc. and the phone works like that in all applications.- Camera: Excellent picture quality in photos and video (12 M / 720 p)- Full customizable screens, icons, short cuts, menus, etc. No limits!- All 3G and GSM Bands possible- SIM LOCK FREE! This means, that when you travel internationally, you can buy a \"Pay as you go\" SIM Card and use the mobile phone locally (also to use wireless data and use Skype or any other application)- Many applications (productivity tools) that Apple and Android would sell you, are free in Nokia OVI- Great battery duration, excellent voice quality and very, very stable- Very productive phone: It gives you many options for any application, for example, it lets you choose what to do and how, for example, if you are going to play your music files, you can choose to transmit that music in FM to your car stereo, etc- HDMI output, so if you load a movie, video, etc. or simply watching videos from the phone, you can connect a HDTV monitor or TV straight from the phone!The only feed back that I have for Nokia is they need to update the Youtube application, of course, Nokia didn't developed it since Symbian is too open and independent developers can upload those applications, but besides that, it is in general terms....BETTER THAN iPhone 4: I have BOTH phones> iPhone 4 with AT&T; and Nokia N8 with T-Mobile....and guess which is more productive?

(Safe from the dangers within my purse such as keys)- True multi-tasking. The phone doesn't heat up or slow down when I have many programs open.- HDMI port- Supports many video and audio codecs. Transfer videos from your computer to your phone via bluetooth and then watch it. Save the time to recode the videos :)- Browser supports adobe flash- Free GPS navigation with voice!Cons:- Doesn't support Netflix or Hulu so I can't watch at my convenience.- Youtube videos are not HD-quality when you watch it in full screen.- The phone freezes up sometimes because of the WIFI. Happened three times so far...- MAJOR CON: I consider the battery life too short. You have to be consistent in charging it daily. Moreover, the battery is built in so it is not removable. Using features such as playing games or watching movies can really drain the battery life.Overall, the pros really outweigh the cons.

In order for a phone to be a first class communication device, it must be joined by both performance, reliability, but most importantly usability.  I believe that this phone would be an outstanding smart phone anywhere around the world, minus the U.S.  I believe that Apple, Google, and even Windows Phone 7 has way surpassed Nokia Symbian^3 in UI.  That being said I'd like to offer up my viewpoints of the N8 having come from Iphone 4.PROs1. Hardware built quality, reliability, reception performance, call quality, speaker phone, noise cancellation, battery life are all something that comes to mind immediately2. Overall build quality is exceptional, unlike Samsung, LGs of the world, this phone is built to last.  Even HTC does not measure up in terms of quality build.3. AMOLED screen is nice and bright, color contrast is pretty good, minus the resolution4. Reception and call quality is great, coming from the Iphone4, the N8 is a God send. I no longer have dropped calls, callers can hear me, and I can actually use the speaker phone function and have no issues with callers not being able to hear me.  The Iphone had a major problem in this area in that it can't reliabily connect to a bluetooth headset, or use the speaker phone without your voice breaking up or the callers.  Bluetooth connected on the N8 without incident.5. Noise cancellation is an area that I think Nokia has perfected, I get better noise cancellation with Nokia period than any other I've tried, ie iphone4, HTC, LG or Samsung.6. battery life for a smart phone is surprising good.  Unlike my iphone 4 or HTC having to charge constantly7. if you are a world traveller, you will appreciate the Nokia maps.  It allows you to travel the world and have navigation map capabilities withou wifi. I mean anywhere Nokia has a map for that country.  It is also nice that domestically when you travel to an area without wifi or cell signal, I can still find my way around with Nokia maps, unlike google maps or Microsoft bing maps will stop functioning or provide directions.CONs1. Small screen @ 3.5 inch. spec wise the same as Iphone4, but in reality smaller.2. Low, inadequate resolution @640x360, in today's market, it's a joke.3. The UI on Symbian^3 is just not right for the US market.  We live in a society where we are only concerned about having, and not about conserving.  Nokia really lost out in this market.  I can understand why Nokia is strong elsewhere, but have absolutely been drowned out here in the US.  I'm not so sure that Windows Phone 7 or 8 can change that because they will now also be restricted by the same software heavy, resource intensive burden everyone else has to deal with, and that is more cpu power=lower battery life.4. web browser is not the greatest, it is spotty and doesn't allow for decent browsing, even with Opera, it's still why behind the web experience of an Iphone45. A serious lack of main stream application support by US companies, I can't even get Pandora, or speedtest for symbian.  Of course Google maps is only half functioning on Symbian^3.  So don't expect a great many useful apps for Symbian^3.  Nokia has completely lost sight at the wheel on this.6. Processor speed at 680Mhz ARM 11 is simply not speedy.  It gets the job done, but come on... a faster processor would help a lot.7. Nokia has tray away from their core and has made a phone that just takes too many step just to make a call.  they took out the hard call button that worked real well.  A number shows up on screen, click call, that's it.  Now instead, you have to push one button to retrieve one number than click on the number then you can call.  That also holds true with many other parts of the Nokia Symbian^3 os.  boy, they definitely need help there.I'm sorry but the reason we have such crap products these days is that all companies are trying to do is compete on price point.  They keep scaling back on everything to meet a price point instead of just doing it right by building the right phone.  While I understand economics, but companies have become way too profit driven on the other end.  We need to promote and demand more consumer centric innovation, and not profit focus.Now having said all of the above, I think the N8 is still a great communicator, from a phone standpoint. I'm torn between having a phone that is well built + a nice 7\" tablet or 10\" if permits; or have one massive crammed smartphone at 4.5in. I loved everything about the iphone4 except the simple inability of Apple to provide reliable bluetooth headset connectivity; or something as simple as being able to use the speaker phone that actually works in real life, usable is all I ask.  How tough is that.  I hope Steve Jobs will not try and rush a product for profit, and ruin a loyal following over the years based on merits of his products.  All the other phones out there are all trying to throw as many buzz technology to lure customers, but non will last very long, or perform like a Nokia phone.  So I'm one frustrated user where I'd like many aspects of a Nokia in its reliability and performance of a phone, but not so good with web and apps.Hope all this would help someone else making a decision", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of Symbian so far", "Author": "bwhat \"bwhat\"", "ReviewID": "RW2AC14WY2OPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a solid phone.  I've only had it a month, and I haven't had time nor inclination to play with all the capabilities.  But, long-time or old-time Symbian users (including me) will appreciate the familiar menus and methodologies in a more up-to-date capacitive touch screen interface device.  I don't love this phone, but I really like it - Having come from the N900, and still floating back and forth, I find the web-browsing on this phone to be mostly tolerable when using the third party Opera browser available free in Nokia's Ovi store.  The built-in browser is passable, but the Opera browser takes the n8 to \"tolerable\".  Compared to the iPhone, various Android devices, or Nokia's own N900, the browsing overall is a bit weak.  I'm annoyed by being forced to Google's \"mobile\" webpages, when the N900 can render the full Gmail webclient on the built-in browser.  The on-screen keyboard is taxing to those acclimated to a physical keyboard, but Swype is available for free from Ovi, and this mediates the issue of touch-screen typing a bit.  Syncing Gmail and Google Calendar or Microsoft Exchange is possible, but detailed to configure (and only one service provider can be configured).  Syncing info from an older Nokia phone, such as the N900 in my case, is possible, and worked flawlessly.  The camera rivals my point-and-click, and is quite commendable, though I had higher expectations of the Xenon flash. The mp3 player is acceptable (a bit quirky, but, again familiar), and the phone package came with a headset that includes a microphone and player controls on the cord.  The video capability of the phone includes recording at 720P and sending video over a built-in HDMI output (and an included cable), but I haven't tried these features.  One truly unique feature of this phone is the penta band radio which will allow it to work 3G on both ATT and T-Mobile (unless/until the merger goes through).  So for those that value choice of carrier, it's good for a little while for either carrier, not to mention overseas carriers.  Some have made issue of the \"non-removeable\" battery, but, unlike the iPhone, the battery is removable by simply removing two screws and sliding it out.  This is most likely a space and weight saving design, and really of little consequence to battery maintenance.Generally, the things that are expected of a smart phone are represented here with the exception of iTunes store or  Android Marketplace.  But Symbian has been around a long time, and the apps available in Nokia's Ovi Store, as well as those floating around all over the Internet, testify to that fact.  For example, Angry Birds is available, but Doodle Jump is not. This differentiates Nokia in the smartphone arena - this integration with their own Ovi store and services, and in the smartphone world, this is important.  But Symbian has been around longer than either iTunes or Android, and there is still a big following worldwide.The N8's map application, Ovi Maps, is excellent, and is a vast improvement over the built-in Map application on the N900 (which was so bad that a third party application was written).  The N8 is a pretty fair GPS device, and can operate in offline mode, if the maps for the current area have been preloaded.  And preloading maps, though not strictly necessary when connectivity is present, is a snap from within the map application itself (preferably over WiFi), or from Nokia's companion PC Suite. This is a handy feature for poor/no service areas.  And the maps are free from Nokia and don't take up that much room if they're loaded judiciously.  The N8 Map application can operate in compass mode, which is nice when traveling.Overall, this is a recommendable device, especially for those that have used Symbian-based phones before (there have been a number of manufacturers that have used Symbian in the past).  It's very configurable, has modern smartphone hardware and capabilities, has vast support on the Internet from countless users worldwide, and solid support from the Ovi service and store.UPDATE:After using this phone for a few months, I'm still quite pleased with it, even after it was drenched in a swimming pool (and then disassembled and dried).  Symbian is a very stable OS, and I've not had to reboot this phone, except when drying it out after the unfortunate water incident.  Now, of course, it's not water resistant and I was quite lucky, but I can't help but think the new encased battery design might have helped prevent shorting the battery by trapping air pockets.  The foregoing was a lead-in to say that if/when this one gives out from water damage in the next few months, I will very likely replace it with an orange one just like it.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "excelente inversi\u00f3n funciona perfecto en mi pa\u00eds lo recomiendo", "Author": "Alejandra Porras", "ReviewID": "R2LON5CA2JRKFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "s\u00ed quieres algo de f\u00e1cil uso pero con clase y sofisticado a la vez unete a la \u00faltima tecnolog\u00eda de nokia", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific hardware hamstrung by its software", "Author": "M. Messinger", "ReviewID": "R1V51NIYLXVSXW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The N8 is my second Nokia phone, after the E71. Granted, I'm finding it challenging to move from the E71's QWERTY keyboard to the virtual keyboard on the N8. But, the challenges don't end there. Let me back up and say, first off, both that I really wanted to love the N8 and also that its hardware gives a lot to be loved.The phone feels great in the hand. The camera is all you've probably heard about, and more (plus, third party developers are now releasing apps that really unleash the camera's capabilities to the amateur photographer). Battery life is pretty good - not exceptional, but really good for a smart phone. I use this phone a lot and only occasionally have I had to put it on a USB or car charger, in the late afternoon. 3.5MM headphone jack is welcome. MicroSDHC slot puts the N8 ahead of the E7, in my opinion. Despite the modest clock speed of its CPU, I rarely experience sluggish behavior from this phone.Personally, I think Microsoft made a good move, in their alliance with Nokia; this phone proves Nokia's hardware is among the top of smart phones available today. The WindowsPhone OS can only go up, whereas I've about given up hope that Nokia's software development will ever improve. While Symbian^3 is a significant improvement over particularly the touchscreen capabilities of its Symbian predecessors, Nokia is not breaking any land-speed records with it's OS development cycle. Integration with PC-and cloud-based calendar, contacts, tasks, and other apps is really bad. Nokia's decision to prohibit the newest versions of Nokia PC Suite from syncing with the N8 - forcing N8 users to rely upon the awful and fatally buggy Nokia Ovi Suite - frankly illustrates some arrogant disregard Nokia holds for its customer base. Nokia Ovi Suite is but one reason why Nokia is failing in the market for higher-end phones. Perhaps Microsoft can help shore up Nokia's fortunes in this area; it's hard to imagine the alliance with Microsoft making the software situation with Nokia much worse.Both the portrait and landscape keyboards are finicky; even Swype (while a big improvement over the delivered landscape keyboard) lags behind Android and iOS keyboards. Third party developers, such as mobileways.de, which develop the excellent Twitter app, \"Gravity,\" have proven keyboard design can be much better, on Symbian (in fact, Gravity proves there's much that can be done with the entire Symbian UI, if Nokia only applied itself).Nokia continues to only partially implement significant enhancements - it allows users to designate an alternate browser, as the default, then never calls the default browser; only using its lackluster native browser (although update PR2.0, expected in March or April, 2011, is expected to produce an improved browser). Particularly if Opera Mobile adds pinch-to-zoom, I expect even Nokia's updated browser will find itself not listed as most user's default web browsers. Symbian^3 allows for multiple calendars to be created, but there's no way to accept appointments received as iCal files attached to emails into one specific calendar; they only go to the default and have to be manually moved to another calendar, if desired. Symbian still has no notion of \"categories\" for appointments, tasks, contacts, or as a file attribute (a feature the Palm OS had, more than a decade ago). Don't expect to sync categories from Outlook, for example, to your Nokia phone. The calendar on the N8 is the worst calendar I've ever seen on a smart phone. No agenda view; no way to exclude tasks from what few views offered; an awful month-at-a-glance view. . . the calendar on the N8 is a real step backwards, even when compared to the old E71. Here again is an example where the WindowsPhone OS can only produce better functionality. It is astonishing to me that, even now, no third party developer has released a calendar app that beats the awful calendar shipped on the N8.As of this writing, there is no ereader app available for commercial ebook formats such as the Kindle, eReader.com, MobiPocket, or Nook. This is but one example of the considerable disregard of the Symbian^3 OS held by the commercial developer marketplace. I fear this is one area where the Microsoft alliance will pose a challenge; will developers continue to work with Symbian, even after the phone is updated to Symbian^4, with the possibility the WP OS will spell the future for high-end Nokia phones?Nokia continues efforts at developing innovative new apps, through its Beta Labs, but it is not rolling out needed updates to basic products such as Nokia Ovi Suite, fast enough.There are some things Symbian^3 does do very well. It's multitasking capabilities and memory management are head-and-shoulders above other mobile OS', in my opinion. While Nokia has implemented copy-and-paste relatively poorly, in the N8, that feature and many others are available. Ovi Maps is one standout application that ships with the phone (and its turn-by-turn navigation is a real value-added feature to this phone). The music app isn't half bad (but, Nokia, why do you make it possible for me to edit photos and video directly on the phone, but make it impossible to edit MP3 tags?) and the video playback is very good, whether on the phone or using its HDMI output.I could go on, but I should probably instead get to the bottom line: Do I recommend this phone? Yes and No. If you are already familiar with Symbian - the good and the bad - then you'll probably find a lot to like, in the N8. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in tinkering with your phone, you might want to seriously consider the iPhone, one of the many Android phones or (for those of you looking for a business-oriented phone) a Blackberry. Every week or two, I debate about whether I'm going to sell my N8 and return to the trusty E71; if you go with the N8, you need to do so after looking at both the good and the bad. And maybe PR2.0 and the other promised updates in 2011 actually will improve the prospects for this Symbian device. At least, that is, until Nokia's phones sporting the WindowsPhone - Nokia style - start to hit the street.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best phone in existence.", "Author": "Diego Pazos", "ReviewID": "R3VELMSDBQGSL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While it's true that other mobile OSes might have UI features some people might miss on Symbian, the N8 is the best phone ever built. If you want a fancy UI, you're probably better off with an iPhone or a Galaxy S, but if you want the most feature-packed phone ever made, there is no other choice.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "owned 1 1/2 years unbiased review", "Author": "Eduardo Otero Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1DZZ8EWH4R6ZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone back in March 2011 so I am going to give as detailed of a review as I can.Case-Let me start with the exterior of the phone, this phone has probably the toughest casing I have ever had of any of my phones. Granted I have used a silicone cover since the day I have owned it, but I have dropped this thing more times than I care to remember and from various heights, except for a few minor surface scratches you couldn't tell.Screen-The screen's durability is the best I have seen to date. The very first day I had the phone in my hands my son knocked it right onto my gravel driveway screen first. It still had the factory screen protector on it but it was a mess, it looked as if there were a dozen chip marks on the screen from the rocks but once I pulled off the protector it was perfectly fine. The glare from the sun does make it difficult to see if set at really low brightness levels. I don't care for resolution specs but for this phone they are low. I had no problem viewing anything on it due to the low resolution, however videos and pictures will not be the greatest if viewed through the phone.Connections and Buttons-Starting from the top left hand corner you have the 3.5 MM jack input. I use this every single day and it is a wonderful thing to have on this phone. After dropping the phone numerous times even with the cover I noticed that this jack was starting to crack around the entry point, operation hasn't been affected what so ever though. HDMI out is probably one of the coolest features on this phone in my opinion. I have not used it as much as I would have liked to but it is indispensable, especially when sharing homemade movies or pictures with family and friends. Because of this phone I have made HMDI out a standard for any other phone I ever purchase. The power button, directly to the right of the HDMI out. This button in my opinion the phone could have done without, the home key on the front of the phone would have done it's job just as well. The volume toggle button, I have had a love hate relationship with this button. I am glad that it is there but at the same time it has not been that easy to manipulate, especially with a cover on the phone. The phone slide lock, this is again like the power button, absolutely useless. It is much easier to hit the home button on the front of the phone than it is to try and slide this thing, again especially with a phone cover. Camera/shutter button, this is essential in order to use the camera as you would intend to use a camera but I would have appreciated it more if Nokia would have made it more pronounced on the phone. I often found myself searching for it with my finger and constantly dropping the phone down to double check that I was directly on it because the slightest loss of pressure would take you out of focus. 2.0 mm Nokia charging port, I found this charging port to be more reliable than the Micro 5 USB port on the left hand side of the phone. I believe that it was primarily do to both locations of each port. The location of the 2.0mm port was more convenient for my everyday use of the phone, where as the USB port would get in the way and make the phone awkward to handle, and it is a very loose, unstable connection. SD and SIM card slots, these two have come in very handy for me in the time that I have owned this phone. I travel quite often so the ease of swapping SIM cards and SD cards makes me very happy. If I had one thing to change about the SIM and SD card slots it would be for the covers to not be connected so that I can access one at a time. Lastly, the Home button, this button should replace the power and slide lock buttons because it does most of what they do anyway.Battery-The battery life on this phone is quite amazing. I calculated 14 hours of moderate use on normal power settings from unplugging it from the charger until it died completely. Moderate for me is , 3g connection, listening to music from the 3.5 mm jack or the built-in speaker for a few hours, constant texting through out the day, some web browsing, occasional video watching, lowest screen brightness, and viberate function on. Now on battery saver mode I have gone 16-18 hours with the same type of usage. Swapping the battery out on this phone is not the easiest but can be essential if you travel a lot and or use the GPS frequently which brings me to my next point. Using the GPS on this phone will KO your battery in a few hours, so if you are an avid user of the GPS feature then I highly suggest you get a spare battery and a tool kit to install it with or just keep it charged while you use the GPS.Camera-I do not want to really talk about the camera a whole lot because you can find that information anywhere on the web so I am going to give my input on it from my experience. The pictures are for the most part amazing but they can be pretty bad depending on the conditions, I have learned to use the different scene modes to get the affect I was seeking for all my pictures. The speed of the camera could be a lot better, and switching from stills to video takes a long time as well. Keep the glass on the outside of the lens clean or else you will take repeated pictures and wonder why they look like hot garbage. The settings I feel could be easier to get to, especially for what is supposed to be a snap and go camera. The flash is more than adequate for every situation, I have found myself not using it most of the time. The autofocus is extremely picky and takes a few tries to get the picture just right. If you get a cover for the phone make sure to get one that covers the entire camera area because since this area is more pronounced on the phone it is more susceptible to scratches and dirt.Built-in Speaker-I love the speaker on this phone! I believe it is the most abused piece of hardware on my phone since the day I received it. It is exceptionally loud and I learned that if you place the phone caddy cornered with the speaker facing the wall or surface it will give a surround sound intensifying effect to the volume.Processor-This phone is not fast or snappy to say the least. It cannot be burdened with Apps or it will fall on it's face. This phone is more for the conservative type, those who like to text, check email, facebook, use a calculator, run a widget or two, and maybe play a game, any more than that and this thing goes to sleep on you. This is the biggest complaint I have about this phone, overall speed. You can tell when you slide your home screens with your finger, it takes a while to load all your icons which is not acceptable by today's standards.PROs--Screen-Case-HDMI out-12mp Camera-Nokia maps works great online and offline, works better than standard GPS systems sold at retailers-battery life-built-in speaker-WIFI, if you travel and have fast internet on this phone I suggest you download the Joikuspot app, it lets you create a wifi signal for your laptop, I use this quite often.Cons--power button (useless)-Slide lock button (extremely useless)-camera button (Not big enough)-volume toggle button (not big enough, should be 2 individual buttons in my opinion)-USB port in odd location and difficult to use as charge port-processor too slow to enjoy the phones full potential-camera not as fast as it should be, or as easy to use.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replacement phone from AMAZON has been perfect!", "Author": "Old Radio Guy", "ReviewID": "R53ICDFJCGC0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I promise that this will be my last review of this phone. I was very disappointed that the first one failed in 31 days. However, Amazon refunded ALL my money, and I made a point of buying another one from them, rather than a slightly cheaper one from an Amazon affiliate store. BIG difference! The replacement phone was NEW, as opposed to \"used\" as was the one from the Amazon affiliate store. I know that because:1. The box on the Amazon replacement phone was sealed with a little blue \"Nokia\" factory seal.2. ALL of the accessories were in the box, and they were all sealed in bags. Both of the 6-inch long USB adapters were missing from the first phone, and the bags that were in there were sealed with Scotch tape.3. The protective stick-ons were super tight on the AMAZON phone. The ones on the \"affiliate store\" phone had been obviously re-applied, with large air bubbles under them.4. Last but NOT least: The games on the phone that failed were already set up for the German language, and the menus and screen display said \"T-Mobile.\" I had to do all that setup stuff from scratch with the new N8 from AMAZON.The first phone also had the \"No camera sound\" option, but the American market one from Amazon did not. That means the first one was a Euro market phone.So it's all good now. The phone is amazing, and the photos embarrass those from other smartphones. Sometimes the interface gets a little sluggish, and the screen goes black for a few seconds, but my son's iPhone 4s screen freezes, forcing him to turn it off and back on (I have to do that sometimes too). Part of my problem is that I have over 800 photos on my phone, and a lot of apps, which burden the processor. Did you know that the sensor in the N8 is .802 inches diagonal (21.5mm), not under a half-inch like those in other smart phones and even most point-and-shoot megazooms? So the digital zoom on the N8 works well without excessive pixilation. And then there's the great and fast offline GPS, and the 802g/n WiFi, and the build quality, and the FM broadcast, and the 16 gb internal memory, and the extra memory card capability, and the standard, replaceable battery.STANDARD, REPLACEABLE BATTERY, you're thinking. Is this guy mad? No,look on youtube, or download the free Nokia N8 service manual. If you can change your car's tail light bulb, you can do it. You just need a small Torx screwdriver, and some basic fine motor skills. The battery is an off-the-shelf BL-4D. Another thing that most people don't know is that the flash on the N8 will trigger a Xenon \"slave\" flash, which greatly improves picture quality in dark settings. I use a little Vivitar DF-120 flash that's about a third the size of the N8 (but it's thicker). It worked perfectly at a party in a Marriott banquet room, which got me designated the official cell phone photographer. You know that TV commercial where the Samsung Galaxy III owners touch phones to exchange playlists, while the iPhone users look on in amazement and jealousy? You should have seen my co-workers at that party when I used my N8 and my shirt-pocket Vivitar slave flash. You can even hold the slave flash at arm's length to avoid the red/white eye problem that haunts most phone cameras. The FM broadcast blows them away, too. Our office pool cars have basic FM stereo radios, but no matter! I just tune to an unused station slot, queue up one of my favorite playlists, or Internet radio, and rock on! You just have to set the phone somewhere near the radio. How do other smartphone owners survive without that feature?TWO must-have apps: Joiku WiFi hotspot, and Camera Pro. Trust me. I have the last version of Symbian ANNA on my phone, and they work great. The Joiku hotspot app is the best I've ever used. Very fast throughput and a cool, useful control panel. Camera Pro takes awesome pix (same as the OEM app), and you can turn off the red pre-focus light and the shutter sound.UPDATE JUNE 21: I now regret purchasing this capable but \"glitchy\" phone. My next phone will not be a Nokia. ONE DAY after my 30-day return period with AMAZON ended, the bottom 2mm charging socket went dead. The USB mini-port still charges, but in 2 days I head to Ocean City for a week, so now I have to buy a universal USB charger kit at BB so I can use the phone on vacation. Then it's back to Nokia because Amazon won't take it back unless I agree to take a bath on the credit. I'm a professional engineer, so this was not abused (ie: I don't throw my phone around or beat people on the head with it), and I only charged it at home or in my office with the approved Nokia charger. Resetting the phone only cost me my shortcuts: It had no effect on the charging pin. I repaired over 300 laptops when I worked for a computer company called Odyssey, and I've rebuilt or repaired numerous cellphones, iPods, and iPhones, so I'm very familiar with small electronic devices. The pin socket is not loose or damaged. This appears to be a board-level component failure. My web research indicates that there are fusible links on the main board that can open up, and this is most likely the cause. My Nokia chargers work great with my Nokia-China made N82, which thankfully I kept. I thought the Finnish factory phones were better quality?In the beginning, the only thing that acted weird was the flash on the camera: It didn't work at first, but then it started working great, and that ushered in a 4-week period when everything was good. AT&T; did discover that I was using a \"Smartphone\" with a standard SIM card, but they allowed me to do the $10/month unlimited data plan because I'm the primary accountholder and I've been with them forever.All-in-all, this phone is a big disappointment. The N9 is probably just as bad. It's time for me to ditch Nokia!By the way, after the factory reset a lot of built-in applications like the photo viewer and camera button didn't work. After playing with the settings, they magically started working again. Also, when I received the phone, the stick-on labels had obviously been re-applied by a previous owner. When people return devices within their 30-day free trial, Amazon and its sellers should be honest and label them \"refurbished\" like the cell phone carriers do.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is my first touchscreen-only phone, and I'm still in a learning curve. But it's not the phone's fault. I have very dry skin, so every touch screen I've tried, including the iPhone, is buggy with me. I restore vintage electronic tube gear, so the dry skin has probably saved my life a couple times.From a build quality standpoint, this phone very solid. The little plastic doors for the SIM and memory cards are typical cell phone quality, but the case is very solid. WARNING: the case is very slick, so when you order the phone, order an Otterbox or similar case at the same time, or you WILL drop the phone.Here are some pros and cons:PROs:- Real GPS that finds satellites even in the men's room at my office. I downloaded the entire US and Canada for free in about 2 minutes using my home network.- Real WiFi, that works for free in a million malls, fast food places, coffee shops, and the like all over the country. Why pay for the cow when you can get the milk for free?- Great signal strength if you go to Settings and set it to 3G. Until I did that, mine didn't get reception down in my basement clubroom. Now it gets 3-5 bars.- Loud, clear speakerphone. I use my phone for small meetings sometimes so this was important.- If you have a standard phone account, and you just slip in your SIM card, AT&T; doesn't call you and force you to buy a data plan. Also, the phone doesn't brick within 30 minutes. Stick a standard SIM card in an iPhone and you'll see what I mean. Just kidding, don't do that. You'll have to take it to the Apple Genius bar and have it reprogrammed.- The camera. Go to Flickr or some other photo sharing site and look up pictures taken with the Nokia N8. And the videos are the best 1280x720's I've seen, at least in a phone. Photo sharing sites don't do them justice unless you download the videos and view them from your computer's hard drive because Flickr, Youtube, and others can be jerky with videos. Outdoor pictures rival most pocket cameras. I used my N8 at my daughter's end-of-season soccer team party and no one can believe I was using a cell phone camera until they check \"properties\".- If you had an N82, ALL of your accessories will work with this phone.- Uses a 3.5mm headphone jack. Has an HDMI connector and the cable comes with it.- The phone charges from a charger or the mini USB cable.- The audio volume control is truly variable, instead of in \"steps\".- Has the same cool music player interface features as the iPod touch and iPhone, etc. Shows the dates of groups of pictures, the alphabet letter of music albums, and so forth.- All sorts of voice commands but I'm still learning about that.- 16 GB internal mass memory- The adaptive touch screen for texting is impressive.- It doesn't make that annoying \"dit-dit-ditdit\" sound when I send a text and I'm at my computer (like other phones do) so the shielding must be good.- BATTERY: This uses a standard BL-40 battery: It's just internal. All you need is a #4 Torx screwdriver. There dozens of diagrams with instructions online. Bottom Line: If you're smart enough to use a smartphone, you should be smart enough to change this battery.- Too many other features to discuss here, but the main ones are above.CONS:- Slippery case. Get a nice rubber skin case, or suffer the consequences.- The new Belle OS upgrade supposedly has a better texting keyboard, but it has bugs in other areas.- The audio volume for the Music player is too low, so you have to use high-efficency headphones. Even my UltraSones aren't as loud as I'd like.- The external speaker isn't as effective as the twin stereo speakers on the N82- I haven't found a way to alter the pre-set music equalizer settings, but there's probably an app for it.- No standard Bar Code reader, but there ARE several apps for that, including some that some claim are as fast as dedicated code readers.All in all, a great choice if you have an existing T-Mobile or AT&T; account and just want to buy a phone and slip in your SIM card. And the price is very good now that the N9 has gained a foothold. I still wish Nokia had finished their design for the \"N99\", because it had a keyboard, but I guess that was a pipe dream.By the way, when I see negative product reviews, I immediately read them to see if it's the product, or the reviewer.

Playing music off of an external flash drive/hard drive is problematic (can only select one song at a time). Do let me know if you know how to play folders from external devices.2. The phone freezes at times (did it with music player, web browser, etc), symbian^3 feels not very stable. I used N82 for 2+years (and 7610 for 4yrs before that), both were very stable (I do not remember if it froze even once).3. The phone sometimes would not turn back on for an extended period of time while connected to power (one time it took over 24 hours) after it turns itself off with low battery.4. When you talk, 'hold' or 'end call' buttons get clicked with my ear quite often, so you get disconnected. Not sure how to solve this except for not forgetting to use this 'lock' slider on a side of the phone.5. The 'settings / connectivity / wifi' sometimes just freezes and does not let to choose wifi network.6. The 'mail' application is hard to use and set up, there are obvious / well known bugs in the software, e.g. it will randomly not display option for custom / other mail setup (IMAP, etc) or any other predefined profiles (like gmail). I consider I got lucky 'custom' option eventually showed up after multiple resets and I was able to setup an account.7. 'Ovi store' periodically would not connect (with general 'connection error') which can be annoying.8. Automatic screen rotation is very shaky, takes too long to recognize rotation, e.g. from portrait to landscape, or just switches back to portrait mode while you are typing in landscape (it may be quite annoying at times as it just takes away your time).9. Keyboard in portrait mode is alphanumeric, so you can't type fast while in portrait mode. qwerty keyboard is only available in the landscape mode (this potentially can be fixed with some 3rd party keyboard applications).10. Default web browser is very user unfriendly. It takes some patience and a good amount of clicks before you finish typing an address into 'address bar'.After you press 'web' icon, (0) you see two bars, one 'address', the other 'search', you then (1) 'double tap' on the address bar (it takes some practice, the address bar requires 'precision' tapping), (2) the 'alphanumeric'! keyboard comes up so that you can punch in the web address, notice that there is no url history to help you here so you have to retype the entire address, (3) you have to click on that big green checkmark to confirm you input, (4) this brings to the same screen as in step (0)!, so (5) you click on 'go' button on the far right of the address bar, (6) the website starts loading.I have never seen anything quite like this before.Notice that if you prefer landscape QWERTY keyboard, you may need one more step in between (2) and (3) which is to 'rotate' your phone to bring up the QWERTY keyboard.Installing 'opera' browser can address these issues. Opera has its own *portrait* mode QWERTY keyboard, it's much better.11. 12mp camera is just fine, it takes practice to take pictures as it seems to be more sensitive to 'shaking' while taking pictures than 5mp on N82 (I have already gotten a good amount of blurry pictures on this 12mp camera).12. FM transmitter is relatively weak, needs to be right next to the radio, even then can be noisy (I used it in my car).Hope some of this may help! just wanted to share.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "UI sucks, not Unicode Font support, not really a \"WORLD PHONE\"", "Author": "Mike Woods", "ReviewID": "R153PJQCEXPG4G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I totally agree with other reviews about all good things of N8, such as fast boot, great camera, good signal,...I will not repeat here.I have two main problems with N8:1.

I know I can figure it out after searching/reading something (BTW, no paper manual with the package, you either use \"user guide\" on the phone, or googl search; using \"user guide\" is painfull too), but why should I spend time on making these basic features work?

I have big expectations from my phone, not in terms of apps etc, but in terms of reliability. I want something that is small, yet powerful, not a computer, but enough to get the essentials done. The E51, 4 years ago, was epic! It still is awesome, given its size, it is quite a useful device.Now coming to the N8, i read about it, and it seemed nice. I was hesitant about it since Nokia has backed out from Symbian, and the N9 is twice the price of the N8. But given the hardware specs, i decided to go along with it.----It has a 12MP/Carl Zeiss Optics camera, which is very good. It has a FM transmitter which is very rare these days. It has the other usual features you'd expect from a smartphone, though i do not expect as many apps as I would for an android/iphone. But i would say, at the price (290), it is a good deal if you like an unlocked phone.----The reason why i gave this phone the rating i have is this : I took the regular SIM card out of my E51, and pushed it into the N8. It worked, YAY! But as a sanity check, i wanted to put it back in the E51, and that was when it stuck me... the SIM card would not come out. Now i have taken the SIM card in and out of my E51 gazillions of times, so either the E51 was a defective design or the N8 is. I am going to return the phone with my SIM card in it (deactivated and erased) since I do not want to damage it and void the warranty. But its going to cost me to get a replacement SIM.----Just some Nokia bashing while I am at it. WHY??? Nokia used to be so reliable, what happened? I had a 3510i, a 6610i, E51, n810 and C6-01. These were/are awesome. I had a previous confrontation with Nokia when i ordered a n910 as a bargain on their website. They charged me twice, and then just didn't honor the order.

It is a familiar and typical iphone ringtone.  most of the people start fumbling their pockets or start looking at their(i)phone to check if its their phone ringing.  iphone has become real common commodity.., believe it or not..For those who really wants to be unique, especially from iphone users (as per my experience) and feel special about it, this is the phone for you.All right, sentiments apart...Here is my take on this phone.  I bought this phone from Amazon shortly after its launch and using it ever since.Since so many users have posted very good and accurate reviews about Nokia N8 with Pros and Cons here, I am focusing mainly on user experience and some WOW factors that other phones can not/do not offer (for free).- Only smartphone that dose not mandate you to subscribe a smart phone data plan without loosing most of its functionality (or without rooting/jailbreaking etc.) savings of $35 a month since day one....I bought this one at full price but its free after a year of use just because of data plan savings.  I still use low priced data plan and take full advantages of smartphone features like anywhere email, upload pic directly to facebook, local searches etc etc.-  Internet on the go anywhere anytime (with data plan subscription, of-course).  I just plug in my phone to my laptop using usb cable and my laptop is connected to internet.  I can also use my phone as wifi hot spot and tether data to my ipad hassle free.  saved few hundred dollars and bought only wifi version of ipad.  saved hundreds more when no data plan needed for ipad.  More savings.......and same great ipad experience!!!!-  Great camera, takes amazing natural looking pictures unlike other smartphones which tend to over saturate colors to look them better on phone screen.  I regularly use nokia n8 to take pictures at work and add it as a part of my presentation.  Looks really hi quality even if projected on big screen.  I did receive many complements from my (mostly iphone using) co-workers.-  Free GPS with no data plan requirement added spoken direction with street names in more than 30 languages, online traffic updates and many other bells and whistles...  Self explanatory....I never have to carry my gps while on the go, as true with any other smartphones.  Where n8 beats every one is native voice guided navigation in multiple languages without using a data plan (and using it if you want to)I set my route in the phone and let it sit somewhere on dashboard.  95% of the time I could navigate just by listening to the voice guidance without looking at the tiny map screen on the phone.  The voice guidance is very clear and spoken street names really makes the driving in unknown place a breeze as you are simply focusing on driving.  My wife is so jealous just because of this feature.- HDMI out -  I connect my phone to my lcd tv using the provided cable and play Need for Speed (free with phone).Can wirelessly connect to the Laptop !!  DLNA sharing app lets me connect and stream my pics and vids from my phone wirelessly to my laptop, which i connect to my tv and share my pics as a slide show to friends at home while me sitting on couch holding the phone in my hand.Well, these are the features and experiences that makes me love this phone, the part I love the most is that these things come with it at a substantially lower price upfront and significant lower monthly cost, not to mention freedom of using it over any GSM network and not having sign a two year contract.!!!!Obviously, this phone has its shortcomings and trade offs, and many reviews here describe them accurately.For me, the cons are,-  screen could have been larger,-  clunky user interface-  soon to be obsolete OS-  speaker on the back of the phone right below the camera module, significantly reduces the sound volume if the phone is lying on bed speaker facing downwards.-  App store experience could have been better.However, it has been more good experience than bad. Constantly attracting curious looks from people when they see me using this phone, and many of them drop their jaw when they hear that it has 12 MP camera.I dont mean to show iphone down by any means and I personally feel that iphone s user interface is much better.However I do not regret buying Nokia N8 at all.America is a country of freedom and this is the only device that gives me true freedom of choosing any service provider, choosing to opt for a smart phone data plan or not, not binding myself into two year contract and still able to enjoy a smartphone experience and not to forget freedom of using (free) GPS signals without paying for navigation service using the device you own.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but wait on the Nokia 808", "Author": "Debt Free \"Eric\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q5XCQ6FJM2WT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You are no doubt interested in this phone for it's camera - after all, it's really the only good reason to struggle with Symbian in 2012.

The talk quality is great, and with wifi and bluetooth, I can always stay connected. I like the 3 home screens, and and still finding apps to put on. So overall, this phone is better is than anything I have seen in other peoples hands. Screen colors are amazing. Plenty of memory available.Pros: Nokia quality construction, light (almost too), speed, and being unlocked so I am not a slave to a service!!

I also use a Google Nexus One and thought I would leave Nokia behind. I decided to replace my E72 (my work phone)with another hardware qwerty phone but AT&T; really didn't have a suitable replacement. Where I work, AT&T; has the strongest and most reliable signal. I was planning on waiting for the Nokia E7 but the price was a bit much. I took the plunge and ordered the N8 back in February thinking I could return it if I didn't like it. When I received the phone I was surprised at how good it looked. The press and blog photos don't do this phone justice, it is a sleek and handsome phone.The build quality puts most other phones to shame. Set up was straight forward and easy. I was up and running in minutes. I use Nokia's ovi service and synced my contacts and everything OTA. Nokia did a great job with symbian^3. It is fluid, fast and intuitive. There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to symbian but I experienced a similar learning curve with android. This is a big step up from symbian 1. The camera is great as the reviews have said. I thought I would miss the hardware keyboard but I found myself typing just as fast on the (according to the tech blogs) \"substandard\" on screen qwerty. I couldn't understand this because I struggled with the Nexus One even with swiftkey. The reason for this I think is that Nokia's touch screen is of a higher quality and thus more accurate than the N1.I installed swype and I love it. The only thing I miss (being a USA user) are local apps. No apps for programing my dvr etc. Nokia has released things like \"Sleeping Screen\" and other useful apps for this phone and a large UI upgrade is in store for summer.

I got soon a replacement phone which worked fine for one day and it started to have problems too; it died first after one day of use for 15 minutes, then it worked well for a while and died for one day; I could not turn the power on or off or do anything. I just had to wait until it randomly started to work again. The third replacement unit works well.I believe my review tells quite much same stories than everybody else; the 12 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss lenz and free GPS navigation are excellent! This is the reason why I pretty much chose my mobile; I like to carry good quality camera always with me. Free GPS is a very handy too as I am new in the country.The Symbian operating system feels slow and old fashioned compared to it's competitors iOS and Android. Also there's not so much applications available to N8 than to Symbian 3. However I haven't find this as a problem because I rarely play games etc. with my mobile phone. I prefer to use my computer for such activities.Web browsing is also slow and not so user friendly than e.g. in IPhone. I also had a problems with Nokia Ovi - Microsoft Outlook calendar sync; but I found a workaround; you have to install old version of PC Suite to get it working.In overall I am quite happy with this product.

Scalera \"BuddyS.\"", "ReviewID": "RUCBGXMX7FP88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a phone, the Nokia N8 offers an incredibly powerful camera and video package in a smartphone about the same size as an Apple iPhone. And for two weeks, I shot several hundred photos and dozens of videos on the smartphone's 16 Gb of internal memory.FULL DISCLOSURE: I borrowed the Nokia N8 and have returned it, as per the loan agreement. Nokia has given me no money or any other incentives, nor have they required me to write this or any other post. Nokia may be utilizing some of my photos and videos for their WOMWorld.com site, but that's about it. Anyway, enough with the disclosure stuff.The Nokia runs on Symbian, but it reminded me a lot of Android. It featured a large, bright screen and the Symbian version of an App Store. I rarely used any of these features, since I wasn't keeping the device.As a photographer, I was eager to see how the camera performed. Let me tell you, they really did a nice job with the interface. The full-auto mode usually took nice, crisp shots in most brightly lit situations. If it was a clear day and we were outdoors, the pictures were sharp and the color was crisp.Nokia N8 uses the Symbian OS. There were some advanced controls, but I mostly found myself adjusting the ISO and the flash settings. I appreciated how quickly I could navigate the menus with basic icons.In low-light situations, the camera struggled a bit. There was a Xenon flash, but as you might expect, it didn't offer much light. It was a straight-on flash, so you couldn't bounce it or anything, but not really a big problem. If you needed a flash in a dark room, it would pretty much fill the faces directly in front of the camera. I tend to correct a lot in Aperture, so as long as the picture isn't blurry, I figure I can make adjustments.I shot a few pictures with my dSLR and compared them with the Nokia. Overall, the dSLR gave me a wider shot and probably more options. But considering the size and speed of the Nokia, I really can't complain about the photos. I shot a bunch of photo reference pictures for my Facebook fan page, which people really seemed to like.The only quibble I had was with user interface. The camera was designed to be so sleek and smooth that it was tricky to get your fingers set properly for quick shots. People who picked it up often had trouble finding the shutter button. Several times, I missed a shot because I couldn't figure out which way to hold the camera.In fairness, I think it would have been easier if it had one of those rubberized cases, like we use on iPhones. Then you'd be able to figure it out based on the layout of the buttons.In the end, I was a bit bummed that I had to return it. The Nokia N8 offered an impressive camera with specs that rival some of the compact shooters on the market today. Since we all carry smartphones anyway, it may as be one with a built-in 12 Mp camera. This one was solid, handsome, and took darn-good pictures.Here's a link to the complete review: [...]", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "N8 Review", "Author": "baldoldgeek", "ReviewID": "RT74HNWE5US40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased Nokia N8 from Amazon.

Mattingly \"Au-master\"", "ReviewID": "R20RN4IOPLIAK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All right...Let me begin by stating that I am not very knowlegedable on the pros and cons of smart phones, but when I made the decision to upgrade my 6 year old Nokia, I started researching the kazillion newer phones on the market. Whew! I quickly became overwhelmed with what's out there and with the functions of these high tech devises. So confused and overwhelmed I was that I almost gave up looking before barely getting started. So...the first rule is: DECIDE WHAT FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS YOU WANT IN A NEW PHONE. Everybody's needs and wants are different, so, deciding what you're looking for a phone to do will GREATLY narrow your search!I always owned Nokia phones, so I started my search there. within minutes I found the phone for me...the Nokia N8. I read all I could find about this phone... on many website reviews...including here on Amazon, and there were many pros and con reviews. I paid close attention to the \"cons\" of this phone because I wanted to get a feel on what in particular those reviewers didn't like about it. Many of these people got a bit too technical for me, but I began to see a pattern developing. Almost everyone complained about the Symbian3 OS and how sluggish it could be compared to the Android phones. Many also complained that Symbian does not offer the multitude of apps that Android does. Some reviewers complained that you have to \"touch\"  too many icons on the Nokis N8 to find the application they were lookng for...that's about it.Since I've never owned an Android phone, nor am I interested in thousands of Apps that I'm sure most are usless, I kept going back to the Nokia N8. I liked that the N8 has an all aluminum anodized casing with it's Gorilla glass. The 12 megapixel camera was a major plus for me because I take a lot of photos, and being able to shoot videos in full HD sounded incredible. I liked that the Nokia N8 has a built in 16MB memory with a slot to add more external memory when needed. After watching many videos on Utube demonstrating the functons of this phone, I knew this was the one for me.I've had the Nokia N8 for only a few days now and am still learning it's capabilities, but let me tell you this...I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! This \"phone\"...it's really a mini computer...is INCREDIBLE. The few photos I've taken so far are indescribable...as if a professional photographer took them. And the one HD movie I've taken is just the same. I am selling my other two digital cameras, cause they're usless now.I have only one slight concern regarding this phone, and that is the Users Manual.It's programmed into the phone and I find it a bit difficult to learn the phone's functions from it. I found it much easier to access thd manual from NokiaUSA.com/support. Another great help is going to Utube and watching the demos on there. For me, visually seeing someone show you how to navigate through the N8 is much easier to understand.Each day, I'm finding out new information about the N8 and what it can do and I'm blown away. Today, I learned that you can \"tell\" the phone to call anyone in your contact list. You don't have to dial any numbers...just say the person's name and the phone repeats it to you and then dials the number itself! Just ask it \"What time is it?\" and it'll tell you!To sum this up. If anyone's looking for an extremely well built, multi-functional phone with an incredible 12 megapixel camera with a Carl Zeiss lens and HD video, this should be a serious contender.

For me, that says a lot because I've always been a cheap-o with telephones and I only broke down and bought this one because of the camera features that are useful for my line of work. Speaking of the camera features, the quality of the pictures and the video taken on this phone is superior to those of any cameras or video cameras that I've ever had. Also, the pictures and videos are consistently great and I am more likely to take a great picture on the first shot without having to worry about lighting and stuff like that. The flash is awesome and night pics come out like they were taken in the afternoon with full clarity of the target. I usually take of the flash in dim settings because I realized the lens didn't need the extra light and took even better pictures without it. THe music player, wifi, keyboard, and many other features combined with the cameras make this phone very underrated.

The negative reviews I've seen seem to come mostly either from people who are expecting an IPhone clone ( it just works ) or from people who don't know the Symbian ^3 OS .First , I should state that I'm not familiar with the IPhone, never used it , but I am familiar with Android ( MyTouch 3G Slide , G2 ) and RIM ( Blackberry Curve 8900 ) , but most of my smartphones have been Windows Mobile ( T-Mobile Dash , T-Mobile Dash 3G , HD2 ) , which may account for why Symbian ^3 seems so familiar and why I have no problem wth the occassional reboot . Now for the features ...Many people have dissed the N8 for the Symbian^3 UI  being clunky , which it is a bit . But I have no problem with it as it is very useful . As Rita El Khoury ( Google it ) put in an article , which I suggest you read  , \" Really there's nothing you can't do with Symbian once you know the drill . \" In this way , Symbian ^3 is very similar to WM .Reviewers have also slammed the Nokia browser too . It could use some improvement , but it's pretty good as is . It's a bit slower than the Google browser , though not much slower , and it does a good job with Flash , especially considering that the N8 has only FlashLite 4.1 . The rendering of pages could be better , though , and it really needs Flash 10.1 .Another sore point with reviewers is the keyboard , and they do have a few points here . The landscape QWERTY does have a rather odd key layout which does take some getting used to . Once used to it though , I find it to be a superior virtual KB . As to the the alphanumeric  portrait keyboard , I think Nokia needs to have a QWERTY option here ( Nokia , you need to take a hard look at the Opera Mobile 10.1 portrait QWERTY ; it's great !) . That said , there are situations ( logging in , for instance ) where the alphanumeric kb is useful .Camera on the N8 is terrific , no complaints ! Also love the video recording !  Not to forget that this is a superb multimedia device , great video and audio codec support ! Also love the  HDMI , though haven't used it lol , and the 3.5 mm AV port .Design on the N8 is first rate ! My only complaint here is that the battery is difficult to remove , but being able to disconnect the battery by an 8  second press on the power button does help . I like being able to access the SIM and micro SD cards from outside the phone , not to mention the hardware lock and camera buttons , fantastic ! Nor have I experienced any of the power or freezing issues reported by some users .Should you buy the Nokia N8 ? If you are willing to take the time to learn Symbian^3 , absolutely ! It'ss well worth the trouble and the N8  is a wonderful smartphone ! And don't forget the USB On -the - Go !Edit *****I've had my N8  for 6 months now and it's still awesome ! Here are my thoughts at 6 months .First , I should state that I'm a power user ; I use my n8 a lot , so some of the issues  I report may not be important to you and vice versa . Firdt the cons ...Proably the most annoying is that occassionally , the data connection won't engage when it should . This only happens every once in a while , but it requires  reboot , rather irritating . Nokia should really fix this IMHO .The second most annoying issue is that once in a while , the email client will stop downloading emaild for several hours .It always starts up again , and it's more of a nuisance than an issue for me , but for people who need reliable email , this woulf be an issue .Third is the new  Ovi Store , it does weird thing . U can't contact support , the emails don't go through . If u have a long list  after the first 10 items , the others display for a few seconds then disppear . The  IM for Nokia app doesn't update or install correctly . Nokia , pleaseee fixr these issues .Unlike many other N8 owners apparently , I use the Nokia browser as my chief browser . It's a great browser , just needs full Flash , better standard support !Finally , I still haven't really experienced the freezing and restart that some r reporting , other than the ones common to computers  e.g.  u have many windows open or the servers r messing up , things like that , but these r normal !One last thing , Nokia really needd to take better care of their current customers by getting the updates outrather sooner ,the new N8s have been shipping with the Anna update for almost 2 months now  yet current n8 users still don't have it !But I must ssy , the N8 is STILL  an awedome smartphone ,and I still highly recommend it !!!update 3-22-2012this is my third N8 but that`s no reflection on Nokia ; the original one was one of the infamous first batch, which had issues , just one of those things ; the second I downloaded a bad app ( cough , norton Smartphone Security , cough ) and it fried the software . Current one , no problems !One other thing , I DEFINITELY  reccommmend the Belle update , it makes the N8 even more awesome !One last thing lol .

The hardware of this device speaks for itself - those that also know how to take advantage of and feel familiar around Symbian will no doubt be entertained and satisfied.  As a precaution however, the N8 does NOT feel anything at all like an iPhone with respect to UI nor does it presume to command a similar resource rich environment as Apple's App Store.

Nevertheless, I'm addicted to Nokia Maps and their free voice navigation that is provided with lifetime updates for free.  This is my main reason for sticking with Symbian/Nokia -the minimalistic design of the OS suits me since I don't need all the glamour of other operating systems.  That said, the N8 has an amazing camera and took really beautiful pictures, while I had it.Unfortunately the phone was returned because of the following reasons:- Before the OS update that I did when I connected the phone via Ovi, everything worked fine -phone calls, SMS/MMS, native applications, GPS, etc.  AFTER the update however, everything went downhill, as the update changed everything to Chinese (next to English, this was the only available language), changed the phone's product code, and rendered MAPS and GPS unusable.  I couldn't even open Maps, nor install them via Ovi Suite...  How is this possible?- My lack of faith in the origin of the phone led me figure it out before all the aforementioned mayhem began.  I noted everything from the Device Manager such as the OS details, product code, firmware version etc.  Apparently, when the update installed itself, it recognized the original firmware that was preloaded on the phone, which was of Chinese origin, and installed the update atop it.  All this was checked via Nokia's own NaviFirm software.  Some effort was required in piecing the firmware information and product codes together, but what I ended up with was a CHINESE FIRMWARE (for an Orange N8 to top things off -mine was silver).  This all finally made sense, why the installed update changed everything around (it even included some native Chinese apps), including the phone's entire usability, and subsequently exposed the seller's real scheme.  Note that unless you \"flash\" your phone with a new firmware (and risk bricking the phone, and losing your warranty), you won't be able to use it due to its original firmware that comes preloaded on the phone.Furthermore, I have to add that the phone came with missing USB-on-the-Go and HDMI cable.  After reporting this to Amazon CS, Amazon was generous enough to offer a partial refund for the missing cables (You have love Amazon's customer service!).  Since I have been a longtime fan of Nokia, I still had my E75 and C7 (original) accessory cables lying around, and I compared the standard USB charging/data cable that came with my original phones and compared it with the N8 from My-Wish-List, and I couldn't believe my eyes how fake the N8 cable was, despite having NOKIA written on it.  The lettering and assembly seemed of poor quality, glued together, and the imprinted \"Nokia\" log wasn't straight nor was it of the same embossed quality.  This was the straw that broke the camel's back and didn't hesitate for a split second to return the phone (it was already going back for the GPS issue, but this just solidified my position on the matter even more).I promptly filed an RMA and got my refund ASAP - another great Amazon transaction (the product only fulfilled by them, not sourced, so Amazon's not to blame, but the actual seller).  I feel Amazon should no longer support My-Wish-List as their products are nothing more than a bunch of knock-offs made or refurbished in China!!!  If you plan on spending $300 on a fake phone or one of unknown origins, you've been warned -you're better off looking for something else, especially when spending some much money.

I think Nokia is on to something:  there may be a big market of people like me who will shell out serious bucks for a high quality well made camera-phone-computer to do everything they ever need to do plus take truly great pix, rather than just so they can be one with their peers at all times via Facebook and Twitter (which the N8 does very well if that's what you want).  We arent afraid of the slightly more complex Simbian OS than your average six year olds would want to learn.

Within minutes of getting off the plane my emails and texts came tumbling down. It took my companion some time to retrieve hers. On the train journey from Schiphol to southern Holland I was able to doze with the N8 providing me with constant music from an internet radio station in North America via the train's wifi. My companion found that her internet reception of streaming data was a problem. However the superior social networking features of the iPhone kept her occupied until we disembarked.The following morning, in a hire car in Eindhoven, the car's Tomtom refused to work and I resorted, in a slight sweat, to the N8 and found it had an absolutely brilliant sat-nav facility which was precise and accurate. I inputted the post-code and the nice lady guided us easily to our destination on an industrial estate on the city outskirts.So, to summarise, the N8 is superb and I have never had any problems with it.

I connect apple Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the phone and hook it to the my TV screen through HDMI and there I have a full computer for simple office use (e-mail, web , and games). I can hook in my hard drive to the micro USB and I can modify my files with the office apps provided.- I can talk at the same time browse the internet on 3g (that is not just and apple + at&t; as the advertisement claims);- tethering and sharing 3g connection via wifi;- a full use of the GPS capability with some free apps; Ovi MAP is outstanding- perfect sync with Gmail, google calendar and google contacts.The problems:- The HDMI cover cracked before I even used, this is apparently a common problem with N8.- ovi store and apps installation are really annoying, I cannot tell you how many time I had to re-install and update the CNN news app.- I gave up transferring my musics through ovi suite. I'd rather just do it manually- I gave up fixing/finding the MTP driver with windows 7 64bit- I'm annoyed that skype video does not exist for symbian.OLD REVIEWFirst off, I got it cheaper here so price/quality cannot be beaten compared to many smart phones.What I like:- Penta band 3.5 G connection: I'm on T-mobile in the U.S.(1700 / 2100Mhz), I have to switch to European bands (1900/2100) from time to time, and my country uses 850/2100 Mhz.- The camera: With this phone's Carl Zeiss lens (with 12 Megapixel ccd) I don't need a point and shoot camera in my pocket.- USB on the go: you can plug in USB flash drives and transfer files. I attached Sandisk multi-card reader and it works...- HDMI out: one of my DVD encoded documentary was 1.7 Gb; I thought it would not play but it was smooth...perfect.- The Fm receiver/ transmitter: I bought the car charger (Nokia D4) just for this. Now I play my music through fm radio transmitter.- The music player is a little \"wanna be\" apple's cover flow but it's good.- OVI map and voice guidance is excellent. I would rank it higher than Tom Tom's services besides it is free and does not require data coverage.- Full Office set: quickoffice, file manager, pdf reader, even a zip manager for free.- I can download any file, and send them as e-mail attachments- True multitasking, no question! (OVI map on + music on + transmitting through fm radio + wifi tethering)Some critics:- I think Symbian^3 interfaces are smooth, way better than the previous S60 but can be improved a lot. It is NOT snappy feel like iOS but good enough.- Symbian has less support and that is Nokia's responsibility especially now that they are moving away from its openness. On top of that windows mobile will be the next platform.- Voice command is not that good...web browser sucks, although there are some good implementation in app forms (eg \"AP news\" or \"Accuweather\")- Symbian OS takes a learning curve. If you expect something that just works and easy...you will be frustrated.- Switching between wifi and 3G connection and automatic turn on and off are sometimes problematic.My recommendation:Use Opera mobile instead of the nokia's web browserAPPS: Install internet radio, big screen for HDMI, Joikuspot for a 3g to WiFi tethering, swipe to improve on screen keyboard.Make sure there is not app that keeps your 3g connection on. Not only you have to pay the bill but it drains you battery really fast. When pairing with windows 7, make sure it does not automatically connect and backup, I experienced many crashes.If you use windows 7 64bit to pair with the N8's Bluetooth, I recommend you search on google \" ASUS Bluetooth driver\" and install it. That would activate many options including (1) use of your pc's speaker/micro phone as your headset (2) sim access or a direct call from your computer (3)...Last words: The hardware can handle all highly graphic demanding mobile 3d games (Need for speed, Real golf 2011,Galaxy on fire pre-installed) but I wonder what a superfast processor and high memory would improve.

The camera is amazing and takes fantastic pictures. What sets it apart from all, other camera phones is the Zennon Flash. Interior pictures requiring flah look amazing.

These other phones can not compare to the picture taking quality of Nokia N8. Below are my pro's and con's:Cons:- doesn't use android so there are not a lot of apps, games etcPros:- super amazing picture taking quality- Zennon flash revealing true colors not that blue LED color of all other smart phone pictures- tight tight sealed package, I dropped this phone into a sink full of water it sat submerged for 30 seconds it worked fine when retrieved no damage at all- battary charges incredibly fast using nokia charging port vs mini USB port charges 100% in 30 minutes- full office type software; word, excel, ppt- huge standard memory- FM RF transmitter can play music directly to any radio, use it all the time when on trips using rental cars- map software GPS doesn't require data connect, when traveling abroad I don't have to worry about data charges- wifi hot spot is amazing, it works well with Joikuspot, my cell service requires wifi tethering charges but this phone being unlocked gets around this. As long as whatever computer, ipad etc your using to access the web through the wifi hotspot appears to be mobile device your provider will not block it.- Has DLNA capability I can share videos and pictures wirelessly on my home network with one touch- essential applications are available for sharing amazing pictures and videos, Dropbox, Facebook, twitter etc...", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia N8", "Author": "Cesar", "ReviewID": "REOTLO797RDWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast delivery.The phone is very usefull and easy to use.The maps app is great.Lots of online content to download to the phone.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good home phone Nokia", "Author": "Ramon", "ReviewID": "R1DWWXCX8YWZD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A good home phone Nokia with multiple functions and easy to use.

So I waited till the price was right and purchased mine from Amazon. Nokia.com refers you to Amazon to make the purchase. I did not not want to jump on the iphone bandwagon. I wanted a phone I could use with my existing carriers plan without signing up for another contract. I have the unlimited $10 internet plan, the slow plan for non??? smart phones. It does everything I want to do. I get to connect by wifi for faster speeds. The camera is awesome. The GPS and maps are great. It does everything all the good reviews said it would do and I have not seen the problems others complain about. I have had it for a month now without any major problems. Like most computers, it requires an occasional restart, once or twice a week if I have been multitasking a lot. The apps are not as numerous as iphone, not something I needed. It comes with QuickOffice and will read Word, and Excel files. It is a basic version so I upgraded to the Pro version for $9.99, and it was well worth it. It will also open PDF files. Being able to use a 32g microSDHC card for the camera is wonderful. I know some reviewers said it is an iphone killer, well, it is no iphone, but I did not want an iphone, my wife has one and if that is what you want then buy it, but if you are looking for a nice sturdy phone, with a nice camera, free offline maps and basic internet to facebook, email, txt surf the web etc, then buy this.  If you want to hop on the phone carrier service you can still do that as well. They will always take your money. If you buy it from Amazon, you can now use your American Express and Discover points toward your purchases, so save up some points and let them help reduce the price.

As usual Amazon speedily ships my stuff in what is described as kinda simple basic packaging.This phone is what some consider a camera with a phone and it shows, fast AF, Xenon flash, 12 MP, 720p video- it's a pretty good/great phone-camera. The phone build is excellent, a 3 piece aluminum case with Gorilla Glass it feels heavy and solid. The specs isn't so much spectacular though in a market with 1Ghz 512MB models this is a bit sub spec or should I say mid spec but the Symbian^3 OS handles much with less CPU cycles and it's up to the task.The phone does lag in between but it's not frustrating, though one morning it completely froze on me and I had to restore it to factory defaults. Also had a phone call issue with it, callers would say that they hear a reverb on their end even when I have full bar signal strength and I was hearing them clearly. Amazon took care of that and re-issued me a replacement phone in one day flat!!! I still experience some call failures, but I decided to keep it I still have a full one year Nokia warranty so they can take care of it if needed. There are a lot of apps at the Ovi Store, enough to keep a guy happy since there is a lot of stuff pre installed on the phone when shipped. The built in maps are decent, you an also install maps from other countries if you decide to make a visit it's already there on your phone, spoken directions is nice and all free.HDMI out, USB on the go are some of the features that make this kick ass and it has built in FM receiver and FM transceiver, a lot of stuff under the hood. Geo tagging as well for taking a snapshot via camera and tagging it onto your maps is handy.The battery is excellent, since Symbian^3 is designed for lower CPUs it has great battery life compared to the Androids and iPhones. I work at a hospital and all my co-workers have Androids every single one and by half day they have to recharge the battery, not I. I don't have issues with my WIFI nor with my online widgets, they all work well RSS feeds, email no issues. Productivity is decent everything you need is pre installed on the phone- Quick Office, Adobe reader a highly customizable calendar.Closing off this review I would say that this phone is an excellent phone, I wished though that they would continue to support Symbian or at least release some polished updates as we now know that they are slowly closing the door on it. It has some quirks that I don't like in the UI too many steps to enter passwords while browsing the web etc.An update: I connected the phone to the Nokia PC Suite (2-13-2012)software to sync contacts etc, and got a recommendation from Nokia to update the phone's software to Symbian Belle. I went through the procedures, back up my phone etc and it began to install the Belle and then the PC Suite reported that it lost connection to the phone!!! The screen was completely blank and would not respond, holding down the power button did vibe the phone but it would not turn on.I really really wanted to use this phone but after all this I just lost confidence in buying/replacing it with another N8", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Work in Progress", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Rogier\"", "ReviewID": "RJOUUQSG0HF4J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, I replaced my trusty old N95, because it was finally breaking down, and just out of curiosity decided to see what Nokia is up to since then (having skipped the N97), and it's an unfortunate story of could have been.This is a great phone in the making, which would be OK if this came from a start-up, the kind of thing that might make you decide to buy their next phone, but it's not good enough from Nokia. Several firmware updates later (by 6/18/2011), I guess there's no hope that this phone will ever really work, and I'm giving up.The features in general are great, the design oozes quality, but overall the phone is way too buggy. It spontaneously reboots when I delete five contacts, when I page through my pictures for too long, when I try to navigate by the GPS, and it reboots unpredictably in all kinds of other odd conditions. All in all, it freezes up about 5-10 times a day and goes into a reboot. So this is not even Nokia's Windows Vista, this is all the way back to Windows 95, which was buggy as hell, so I can't wait for the next service update of Symbian^3. After 6 months of use I rate it a 2 on a scale from 1-5 and I've switched to a Motorola Atrix - and I've accomplished more convenience in 2-3 hours of setup time, than in six months of wrestling with the N8.

My recent devices were N95 8GB (which was excellent), internet tablet N810 (pretty good for what it's for) and N97 (for about 1.5 years and it was a real disaster). I've been looking for new device since I've got N97 and I've been following all forums posts and every single review about N8 to find out if this phone is reliable enough (obviously no other phone competes with N8 specs except display resolution).I've got so fed up with inability of N97 to perform properly that I've decided to give N8 a shot.Day 1. WOW!!!- Excellent camera, picture shots and videos are superb- quality of HDMI connection via receiver to my plasma TV is perfect- bluetooth works normally in my car (no drop calls so far like with my N97)- bluetooth connection with laptop and sync works fine, however I am having a problem using N8 as a modem to get 3G internet (maybe it's because N8 is connected to WIFI at the same time). Wifi works very fast btw.- GPS and Nokia maps are great. First I don't have problems with audio output like I had in N97, second GPS itself is very precise, I don't need to use an external GPS like before.- call quality is great- reception is excellent, I have full bar inside the house (not like on N97), and I was really surprised when I went to my basement and my skype call over AT&T; 3G was not disconnected.- screen is very responsive (again comparing to N97).- battery life seems great- screen size and resolution is actually good enough for a cell phone.Few 'minor' issues (at least I was expecting that):- phone rebooted twice in a first day while connected to my laptop via USB and then bluetooth (I was using it as a modem)- few times some screen menus did not respond to tapping. for example I couldn't tap 'Next' in Photos, but could click on 'Back'. so maybe it's a software issue with those programs.Bigger problem I discovered later today that phone did not ring and couldn't make a call. maybe it's after numerous abuses of connecting to laptop, desktop, car, USB, bluetooth, etc.  I had to restart a phone in order to fix it.Overall, for those like me who hesitate to buy this phone I would advise to go for it and give it a try. There is a chance it will work properly:)I will update my review if I find anything new. I've seen numerous scary reviews and reports of phone dying in a first two weeks.Please, Nokia don't fail!!!

This product general built is also very good quality, better than the crappies blackberries, huawei and motorolla, it does is. Camera quality it's the best of the best, very very clear pictures, but no so good in rooms with poor ligth. Adding memory you will have lot of space to record pics and videos. Some cons are the battery, it doesnt long more than 1 day, it's annoying having to charge it almost every day, it seems consuming too much power and doesnt like or know how to save it, software and functions get choppy when battery is dying. Software is too complex and confusing, i really hate this part, even considering switch to a less \"advanced\" phone with a simple software like Nokia E72 wich i owned, Applications and functions depend on internet speed, mine is very bad and slow so i can't take advantage of this, except to watch my Email's accounts, sending sms it's easy for the dictionary and size of the virtual keyboard, but responsiveness of screen vary acording to power stock, which is always dying whenever i need the phone, lol. Graphical power is good, games play as old NES and Music Videos look really really amazing, terrific colours, sound it's loud but mediocre. Web browsing is fast for me as much as i use the wifi.As corollary, regardin to battery life i think buying a brand new battery should fix the issue, and about connectivity well, i cant blame the cellular since my Telecomunications provider is the real guitly for its bad and unestable service.

My goal was to find a reasonable unlocked phone with exceptional camera if possible. This one fit my needs with it's excellent Carl Zeiss optics and more powerful Xenon flash. I only use this device for it's phone, camera, texting, calendar and sometimes email. For email and Internet I use my laptop. It is a dated phone but was top of the line when it came out in the fall of 2010. The Nokia N8 has an attractive aluminum case and Carl Zeiss 12 MP optics camera with Xenon flash. It has a Gorilla Glass screen which specs don't mention. The price was a big factor as well, I bought it from Amazon Warehouse deals. This phone even had all the protective plastic covers on and all cables in original box--everything in perfect condition.Update 4/12/2013: Before even getting used to the new phone I installed the Belle upgrade which is much simpler to understand. After sorting out all the new features of Belle I have my phone designed the way I want it now. With Belle up to 6 home screens are available with a finger push, plus instant access to all menu items. Everything is accessable with out digging. Very impressive.Update 9/15/2013 I have come to enjoy having an excellent 12 megapix camera with me at all times and not have to remember to take the regular one. So if your prioritiy is an excellent phone and camera with the bonus of zenon flash at a good price this is it. I didn't want a mini laptop disguised as a large phone. The free Belle upgrade is a must, makes this phone exceptional. If you want to impress everyone you can load up 6 home screens but Why? Since having it for 5 months I have deceided I only want 3 home screens.  I use it's full featured calender every day. I ordered and received a second N8 in June for my wife and got a better deal then the first one. Amazon Prime delivered both phones on time and in excellent condition.A minus note--the battery can go down unexpectedly sometimes. Rebooting seems to correct that problem. To save the battery I close all applications when not in use. I have installed the free Nokia battery monitor to keep close tabs on the battery.

The big screen Android phone seduced me with their svelte bodes and sexy black attire. After the solid functionality of my E71 and the propaganda of review writers, I succumbed. At first it was great, all the attention of constantly updating apps and the constant feed of all my Google data.Then sometimes, I remembered my first love, Symbian S60. Sturdy and uncomplicated, yet the quality was there, the smooth lines, the quick efficiency, and always there at the end of long day not being power hungry. The deceptively simple interface that allowed me to work quicker and still be entertained when I needed to unwind.More and more each month I missed only having to download an app once and have it become an integral part of my phone, instead of the needy whining of the android apps, update me update me.So when I saw this this Belle beauty calling out to me, and at a price I could justify, I relented.Ah the gorgeous  build of her body, the fast smooth exuberance of the operating system, I felt connected again in every way possible (except LTE).She responded to every touch smoothly almost too eager to take me where I wanted to go, Internet bam, mail scrolling in the widjet. She sounded loud and clear in every situation, always appropriate for the setting, her profiles at the touch of a button.Never asking where I'd been or what I've been up to, just taking care of my needs in a simple yet intelligent way.My (Symbian) Belle was back with a vengeance vieing for my affections.If you can find a newer Sybian Belle phone I highly recommend it. From what I've seen this puts android to shame. If your into cool factor, or can't really learn to use a smartphone for anything other than Facebook stay away!

And Nokia has turned it's back on Symbian.This review is actually for TWO N8's, one is the phone I purchased new, the other is a phone my sister purchased new.  Both phones have had many issues, but all turned up after the one year warranty expired.First let me say that I don't 'overwork' the phone, I've not downloaded any apps (ovi store is limited anyhow), or modified the OS in any way. Both phones are fully updated running Belle.  Doing full factory resets have not cleared up any of the below problems, and no, it's not a setting somewhere.List of problems:My phone-1.  Drops cell tower connection randomly, and never comes back on it's own, I have to restart. (won't recieve or make calls)2.  Screen will not light up while outdoors (sunlight) upon incoming call, which makes it impossible to answer call.3.  Cannot install the maps update, because phone is out of memory, 16 gigs of memory should be more than enough.Sisters old phone - (which I've been using)1.  Asks for a security code on start up (i just enter 1, it says fail, but unlocks anyway)2.  Battery life is horrible.  Still terrible with new battery (unplug at 7AM, completely dead by 4pm with no use at all, standby only) the other N8 will work about 1.5 days of moderate use before needing a recharge.3.  Update icon won't go away.  Even after checking for new updates (and it confirming it's fully updated) it still shows up.The phone is great when it works correctly, but considering that Nokia is shooting 0 for 2 on N8's, there will be no more Nokia's for Us.  My sister has moved on to a work provided Blackberry, and I'll probably make the move to Android.  At least there is support for them.

I ordered it and had it shipped to a friend's place so someone could hold on to it for me while I was out of town.  Delivery was prompt and everything looked fine at first.  Then I tried to turn on the phone and found that it was DOA.  I tried charging it with the included Nokia charger as well as with my E72 charger and a micro-USB charger.  Nothing worked even though I left it plugged in for more than 24 hours, the LED next to the micro-USB port to indicate active charging wouldn't even turn on.  I contacted Nokia Care and they advised me to return the device to Amazon after I explained the situation.  Fortunately, I have until 1/31/13 to return the item so I should be okay, but it is just such a disappointment.  Another facet of this situation that annoyed me is that apparently my supposedly new phone was out of warranty based on a check I did using the IMEI.

Notice above this review that I am a real customer and did buy this phone from Amazon.I so much wanted to like this phone because it is sleek, daddy Google/Apple isn't watching you, and it has a lot of nice features (16GB + memory slot, offline GPS with maps, HD camera/video.)  Unfortunately the phone is just unusable.When I received the phone first thing I did was charge it up.  Then I connected it to NokiaSuite to update the OVI maps.  Disconnected from PC and hooked into power supply and WIFI, did not put in sim card or memory card.  Tried to run OVI maps in offline mode... crash/reboot.  Updated OS (1.1, Anna?), tried again ... crash/reboot.  Updated OS again (1.2, Belle?) tried OVI maps again... CRASH/REBOOT!!!  Updated OVI maps through the OVI store, got further into new maps until I tried to download maps... REBOOT!!!  Tried OVI maps without being plugged into power supply, crash/reboot.  Tried Skype, same thing.  I did however change the language from automatic to English and this helped, was able to make a Skype call, however OVI maps still reboots.  Also ran the web browser after OS updates and this causes a reboot as well!!!I have not done a hard reset because I don't want to lose the apps that came installed on the phone, and you shouldn't have to do this anyway.Nokia knows there is an issue with the phone, but in my opinion they either don't know exactly what it is or don't want to fess up that it is a design flaw, so I don't want to roll the dice with Nokia support.  Many people mentioned sending it in for repair and getting it back still broken.  Working in the firmware field a device like mine is ideal since I can get it to reboot consistently, so it should be a fairly straightforward task for Nokia to figure out what the problem is!!For less money I might have kept it as a science experiment, but I need the cash to put toward a different phone.It is with a sad and heavy heart that I must confess I will be returning this phone.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "ovras", "Author": "ORLANDO RAMIREZ SABANDO", "ReviewID": "R2A5KD576T6GUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok ok ok ok Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice, very happy whit this product", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "RickB", "ReviewID": "R1XLXM6IX3MP3G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Phone with Belle update is an excellent device.Screen is vibrant and responsive, Call quality is excellent.Arguably the best GPS and camera in the smartphone business, great maps that don't need data plan, and pictures that rival a quality point and shoot camera.Nokia N8 build quality is exquisite.This phone hardware and features was years ahead of the competition, too bad it took such a long time for software to catch up...leaving Nokia in a pitiful competitive position.I don't care much about apps, but the phone and app world have the necessities.Obviously not the variety of A$$LE or Android, but still adequate.If you are looking for a great unlocked global phone, this one may be just the ticket.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "c", "Author": "isis seijas", "ReviewID": "R1LU0NAGJJ1VUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "le recomiendo este producto a todos, excelente atencion por parte del vendedor y mucha rapidez al entregar el paquete. muy bien", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Nokia n8", "Author": "Woody142", "ReviewID": "RGMXPGNXHG6T6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best Nokia n 8 I have .the battery last very long time the picture is every sharp.i do recomend to every one who want the battery last 2,3day then get Nokia n8.this is second phone Nokia n8  I buy it.the first one I got when 2years ago.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 star hardware with 1 star operating system", "Author": "Xpert", "ReviewID": "R3IF490NP494VL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the 50+ cell phones that I have personally used in the past, hands down Nokia still makes the best quality than the likes of BlackBerry, iPhone, Samsung or other smartphone manufactures.

I was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.The pros: Good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, Symbian OS may be outdated but saves on battery (if I don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iPhones), the GPS system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular SIM card, not micro, there is a micro SD slot and the total memory of 16GB is upgradable to a whole 48 GB - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and Carl Zeiss optics. It remains the phone with the best camera on the market. The Bluetooth works well.The cons: #1 shortcoming - the screen goes black and locks when you have to pick up a call, or when you initiate one. After all this is a PHONE, Nokia. It is hard to be unlocking the phone every time a call comes in. The same for an alarm. When it wakes you up, you can't just punch the \"snooze\" button, you have to unlock the phone's black screen by pushing down the side slide unlock button. BTW this problem affects a tremendous amount of N8's accross the world but Nokia seems to offer no solution or even recognition of the problem. 2. The phone does lock sometimes; 3. the \"Play via radio\" FM transmitter appears not to work. Although I've tried it on various FM receivers it simply does not connect, although the phone screen says it is transmitting. People point out lack of half a million aps for Symbian OS but I use only 3-4 of those, and I have found those I need. So this is not really a shortcoming.Conclusion: N8 is a smart phone with many qualities however the unresponsive screen, and the other glitches makes it a sort of a dud. I am too conservative and do not like the harsh way the tech industry is pushing people to become insane consumers of ever \"improving\" new technology. I usually look for a phone that will last at lest 3 or more years, so I was hoping the Nokia N8 would cut it. It did not. I am a long time Nokia user and have been impressed with their simplicity, durability, competitive prices and versatility. Not this time around, sorry.

It is buggy as hell and has been from a few months in. Now just opening my contact list can cause my phone to freeze and/ or doing just about anything else. Almost from the beginning I would get memory full messages even though I only have the apps that came with the phone ( I have a few hundred pictures stored but they are all on my 16gb memory card). My text messages stopped going out at one point and I would just get an error message. It resolved itself after about three weeks and I have never been able to figure out what was the cause.My camera stopped working for months. I would press the camera shutter or open the app and it would instantly crash. I tried every solution that I could find online to no avail. Finally I downloaded a panoramic camera app and this solved whatever the problem was. Calls drop all the time or the screen malfunctions and I can't end a call.There just seems to always be an issue with the phone and i'm tired watching my friends use their phones with such ease so im buying a new phone (hopefully a nexus 4). Below are some of my favorite pros of the N8:1) Build quality: This phone is an absolute dream to look at. It is thick, especially when compared with other phones but it is solid and has a nice weight to it. To be honest this phone has taken some serious falls lately like a tumble down stone steps hitting each one on the way down and a flying leap from my hands at ear level onto a tar pavement with only a few dents and scratches to show for it. Nothing beats the original Gorilla Glass!2) Camera: While I have since had issues with picture quality (possibly due to said falls somehow) this camera took the best pictures that I have seen on any phone to date. My friend's Iphone 4s had nothing on it! I bought a panasonic digital camera at the same time and ended up gifting it to my cousins, this baby got the job done much better :)3) Screensaver: I love being able to pick up or look over at my phone and see what time it is without touching anything. It sounds so simple but you would be suprised how convenient it is and I don't recall any other phone with this capability.4) Built in FM radio: I live in The Bahamas and I can tell you that during a power outage or storm that radio 'apps' won't cut it if there's no cell service. It is invaluable (although why i don't have a battery powered radio in my house under these circumstances would probably be a very good question).5) Battery life: I can consistently get at least a day's worth out of this phone. Even if this includes taking pictures (alot), making calls, messaging on what's app all day, listening to music or the radio and a little reading my pdf files.All in all it was good while it lasted but this phone is unable to keep up the times. A phone that will let you done with basic texting and calling capailties becomes just an expensive paperweight no matter how you look at it.

Nokia does not care about Symbian, so Belle Refresh is not yet available for US N8's, even though international N8 got it almost as soon as it was released in Aug 2012. This is still a good unlocked phone, but I wish Nokia would support it better.Also, for any warranty repair, the phone has to be shipped back to Nokia, and they will take the full 10 business days before even attempting to contact you and shipping it back.

Still have it and use it but it is not a smartphone and it's more of a \"house phone\" than a cell phone.  I did a lot of research and when it came down to the iphone or this, I chose this.  Sure, it is great for texting.  Takes decent picture but there is a lag on the shutter and even though it's a 10mp camera, it doesn't take all that great of pictures.This phone came with Symbian Anna.  I had no idea that Belle was possible for an upgrade until about a month later.  Belle greatly improved on Anna but certain features were missing, I lost all of the apps I previously downloaded for free on Anna but now have to pay for on Belle, and the ringtones are sub par compared to Anna.  That was fixable by going to a forum to download Anna's ringtones.  I added them to my phone so that was cool.  The system has plenty of apps, which is all fine and dandy but most new companies are only making apps for Android and iPhone.  They are not bothering to make compatible apps for Symbian interfaces.  I can't even access certain websites because I cannot download and use google chrome as a browser and cannot access google play.I'm not an app whore but there are certain apps by certain companies that I'd like to utilize and I can't and that is frustrating.This phone is good for texting.  Web surfing is a bit slow but suffices for what I need on a phone.  Sending images is also easy.  There are some pluses like meeting mode, offline and online mode, etc.Another issue that occurs a lot with this phone is that it freezes a lot, for no reason, and I don't even have that many apps or anything on my phone.  I have to hold the power button on the phone and sometimes that doesn't even work for shutting it off at first.  Sometimes, I just have to sit and wait a few minutes and try again.This phone was my second of this model.  The first I ordered had an imperfection on the camera lens and I had to exchange it.  That took 2-3 weeks to work itself out and I only had a 30 day window to try out the phone and see if all worked fine.Overall, I'm very disappointed with this phone.  I was a dedicated Nokia fan but now I'm in the market for a new phone and it's only been six months.  My last Nokia kept (still keeps) me happy and it's been four years.  Too bad it isn't a smart phone.  It's a shame.  The phone itself is rather sturdy and feels great in my hands.  Perfect size, pleasing to the eye.  It just doesn't fit my needs.I do not expect any of you to consider my opinion as my review is not a techie rant but there are some valid points and I thought I'd share.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great allrounder - Nokia I will miss you", "Author": "Lars Haubold", "ReviewID": "R1MCKK6CARZS0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Plenty of reviews have been written and I don't want to go into technical details here. I love the phone. It is a perfect replacement for my aging N82. It's my first touchscreen phone and it took me only a few days to get used to it (I never read manuals). I probably only use half of its features and do not download plenty of apps. Therefore I am not a good judge. One fun feature is you can remote control the phone with your Wii remote and watch HD pictures on your TV through HDMI output, amazing! But what I was looking for in a phone is a built-in GPS, a nice camera, good call quality, decent battery life and large memory. The N8 has all of that. The only thing I am missing is the lens cover my N82 had. Sometimes I take a picture and then notice some blur on the picture due to dirt on the lens. One thing I didn't like, Nokia went through 2 operating system changes within 1 year. Each time most of my apps were gone and I had to re-install everything, kind of annoying.

Also it can print the screen of the phone onto the screen, which enables that you can have a much larger screen for your phone when you are using it to web or even play games.Nokia PC Suit is so powerful.

I purchased this phone a couple weeks after Easter, and it's already dead. I paid almost 500.00$ for the phone on here. Was walking back from a volunteer thing and it started raining a little, put it in my zipped jacket pocket, took it out, it was dead. Barely had any moisture near it and it died. I tried flushing it with de-mineralized water like they told me to on nokia's twitter account, now it won't even turn on.Noticed that they split the price down by a little over 100.00$ now and it sucks that there's nothing that can be done about my phone :(.

Without a case, it seems the N8 would easily slip out of the hand, so I need to hold it tight, but the thin form factor make it difficult and uncomfortable to hold.  Does anyone else  feel this way?  Definitely needs a case for more bulk.  A pack of cigarettes is more comfortable to hold because there is some thickness to grip.Another thing I noticed was that the phone was very warm to the touch after making a 20 minute call.  Don't know if this is typical of this model.What I am trying to figure out is how I can get on the Internet with this phone if I do not have a data plan.  From all the comments that I have read prior to buying the phone, I still don't know.  I have cable broadband at home, and a wi-fi router.  I tried to set up my gmail but it would not take.  How can one send and receive email without a data plan?I have AT&T; Wireless--they are forcing me to change out of my Nokia 6310i due to \"system upgrades\", and want to discontinue my grandfathered early evenings (after 7:00 PM) plan.  I have been with AT&T; for 13 years.  I went to T-Mobile and they said I could still use my Nokia 6310i on their plan, and tested my phone with their SIM card--so why does AT&T; say I won't be able to use my old phone anymore?  I used to have web access on my old phone, and texting, but AT&T; discontinued them due to their \"system upgrades.\"Some comments indicated that with an unlocked phone like the N8, one does not need to subscribe to a data plan.  How does that work?  The premise is that the unlocked phone's unsubsidized price would be made up by savings on the data plan.  But how?After I have some time with the N8, I will write a review of it, but right now, I am perplexed about how to access the Internet and email without a data plan.  I will keep it if I can have such access.  Otherwise, I am not sure, even though I am partial to Nokia phones--got 9 years out of my trusty 6310i with no problems, whatsoever, and still going strong, but for AT&T.;  I have a hard-wired Nokia car kit with speaker, handset and antenna, so I was and am reluctant to change out--it is so convenient to just plug the 6310i into the holder and have it charging while making hands free calls.Any advice and comments would be appreciated.>>>>>>Now that I have had the phone for a while, and with the Anna update, which was so frustratingly slow to be released, the phone is fine.A problem is that when making a call, if one's cheek touches the screen, get disconnected.They should have designed it so the battery can be easily swapped, since the phone needs daily charge.  On my Nokia 6310i, I kept extra batteries and just swapped batteries at will.As an unlocked phone, with pre-paid T-mobile and wireless, it is working out fine.

SMS looks good though again, the lousy on screen keyboard tarnishes the experience.battery life: i do not use 3G. just wifi. the battery lasts a day with some inet surfing and light gaming. i am mostly pleased with battery though it is a shame it is not user replaceable. a minor thing.apps: not what i got the nokia 8 for but still, i went to the ovi store and downloaded quite a few apps. some games (angry birds and fruit ninja and some other games) and some apps (flashlight and eggtimer for example). ovi store not near the apple or android store but was good enough for my wants.overall, i am pleased with this purchase. the value for money quotient is very high for this device and i am loving it and hope it gets even better in future software updates.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia N8 Unlocked", "Author": "Jay Serrano", "ReviewID": "R3FXFE6PC1I74C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A very good unlocked phone with very good reception and voice .

However, I think Nokia redeemed itself with this new device. The screen is like something I have never seen, the devices works super fast, the weight is unbelievable for such a big screen, and although I must say I was impressed with MAEMO's operating system, until they don't really work that one out, I think this new Symbian is a great option.The only thing that really socked me was to fnd out that the device has no battery, not a removable one, its battery is internal so because it is still new i still haven't had the need to get the battery out, however if your device gets freezed, just press the turn off button for like ten seconds and it will reboot itself. On the positive side, this is exactly what makes this phone so light in weight. I bought mine in silver, I think it just gives it more elegance and style. I must say I have dropped the phone a few times because I still don't get used to having such a thing light device, so you might want to be extra carefull and buy a case. This is the first time that I ever use an only virtual keyboard phone, but the keyboard is so great and easy to use, that after three days I am using it like a pro. The OVI Maps are fast, exact and functional. This phone is very proffessional, unlike the Androids and other brands, that are made for the games obsessed, etc. This is a phone made for people whose needs go beyond games, applications, etc. It works well as a gps device, organizer, social networking, storing microsoft documents, getting awesome pictures, fast internet, and the possibility of using it around the world for its wide range of communication bands. So if you are an executive who travels a lot this is your phone!.I can't say how great the pictures are on this phone. You really don't need a camera for your trips so that is a PLUS that no other phones have.I totally recommend this device, once you get and OVI account there's just not enough of the things you will be able to do and get on your phone.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Frederick69", "ReviewID": "R22JC5WVS5QBJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Nokia 5230 Nuron and liked it so well I decided to step up to the N8.

The Nokia rep I spoke to said there is no option for local walk-in repair, phone must be mailed to the center in Texas. Yeaaaa no. Opted to get a replacement sent by Amazon and I'm hoping my phone doesn't completely die before the replacement arrives.Even with this inconvenience, the recent Symbian news (notice the price drop) and possible implications for software update time lines and new apps the news may have, I opted for a replacement and not a refund because:Compatibility with T-mobile and it's 3G network, while being unlocked, at the price bracketMy first smart/touch phone so I have no bias towards any particular OS or navigation layout. Also has the support the the apps I could see myself using.Sturdiness of the phone's construction (somewhat ironic). Seems solidly built when held.Camera and HDMI out. I've found that much situations arise when I need to record or take quality photos, with flash.*UPDATE*Replacement phone is functioning correctly.Phone home screens, icon order and hardware settings can be highly customized so any task can be completed with minimal inputs. E.g. one press launching of camera, voice recorder, live inbox status of multiple emails and social networks and a side-scrollable bar of key contacts.With the Situations app you can further customizes profiles allowing you to maximize battery life.Syncing files, messages and contacts with computer is swift and simple.Skype voicecalls workAdding words to the dictionary is problematic.

I've owned this phone for a little over a month now and although the hardware is great, Nokia's OS (symbian 3) has been a real disappointment. Coming from a Nokia N95, I'd been very impressed with Nokia products for years. The OS on this phone in my opinion was not ready for release. It's feels more beta than finished with several items not working correctly. I needed a phone with basic email functionality and this phone just does not preform to a level i'm satisfied with. The following is my short list of issues I've submitted to Nokia:1) Push notification does not work for gmail, my personal or my work email accounts (all worked on N95).2) Email notification icon on home screen does not work.3) While in the first main screen, there is no visual indication of unread mail in a particular mailbox.4) I can't see size or spec of the individual email messages in header.5) Mail tool appears to be very slow to display a simple text formatted message.6) Once messages are received, picture or graphs often do not come through.7) Reply is not the first selection to edit an email under \"options.\"8) Why is there a different screen for composing then reading a message?9) No way to scrolls a message being edited.10) When composing, while addressing, why doesn't the default email address of individuals come up first? And why not display contact pict from address book?11) Can not set a default to auto BCC myself.12) No visual indication the mail is being sent (no progress bar).You can read more about the issues at Nokia's support page. look up the discussion area: Discussions Main Page > Tips and Troubleshooting > Messaging", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Something special& Different:", "Author": "Karkoor", "ReviewID": "R2B4Z03K16PCVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice and sleek.

MCCAFFERTY \"Rarereview\"", "ReviewID": "R2LZ6AXD52SLP5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The title of the review may be confusing for some, but let me explain. I have been a die hard nokia user for the best part of my adult life, since mobile phones really came into the mainstream. Pretty much every phone I have owned has been a nokia. Prior to the smartphone era, Nokia's were hands-down the best phones out there. The user interface was easy to use and understand, and the menu format, typing, etc were all the least fiddly of the phones on the market.Then came the smartphone era. I can't profess to having owned LOADS of different phones, so I can only give my own personal point of view. The 2 Symbian phones I owned were a 5800 and an N8, using 2 different versions of Symbian - S60 and S^3, which was touted as being a great improvement over S60. I stuck with these phones through thick and thin, determined to stand by Nokia, with a firm belief they were still the best out there.My experience with Symbian has been this. Nokia has certain trump cards for its smartphones that no-one else out there can profess to. Nokia Maps for one. It may not beat the likes of Google Maps for ease of use ability to find what you're looking for, but to have extensive offline maps of pretty much any country you want is amazing. Joikuspot, the free mobile hotspot software is also amazing, there are a few others which escape me, but suffice to say, there are several things available to Nokia users which iOS, Android and Blackberry users cannot say they have an equivalent.BUT, when you just need your phone to get something done quickly. Say, pulling up a map with pubs, restaurants, shoe shops, whatever, in the vicinity of where you are, get you the website, the phone number, directions etc. Android and iOS users will have Nokia beat every time. Doing tasks like this would take me twice, three times as long on my Nokia than someone with an Android or iPhone. My phone just wouldn't find what I wanted, or it would freeze, or it would reboot itself right at a crucial time when you really didn't want it to. And this is why I finally gave up on Nokia. Their hardware is SECOND TO NONE. The N8 is a beautiful phone, it's solid, tactile, the anodized aluminium body feels great. The camera is AMAZING. I took pictures on that and people didn't believe I didn't take them with my DSLR. Video on the N8 is amazing too - all the built in editing functions are unbelievable, it's virtually and HD camcorder in a phone. But as a smartphone, it just doesn't cut it. And I put the blame fully on Nokia's insistence (at the time) to cling on to Symbian. Even S^3 is unstable in my opinion. Freezing and crashing shouldn't happen on a top phone manufacturers flagship phone. Period. Maybe the partnership with Microsoft will bring something better to the table.So in the end, I ditched my unlocked N8 with pay monthly AT&T;, got a 2 year AT&T; contract, a $150 Motorola Atrix 4G running Android 2.2 on Amazon Wireless, and it's the best decision Ive made in a long time.

Coming to the heart break part, the OS and the touch response of the phone is just not up to par for modern standards, IOS and Android are miles ahead, truth be told I use my phone more for the apps than for any other thing, even calling :) for which i use Skype.These days the UI has to be fluid and well thought out with a mix of widgets icons etc, IMHO it has to aggregate the huge amount of information phone users consume these days and present it in the most concise and speedy way possible, and Symbiam^3 achieves none of those.

Ever since I got the N95 I was hooked. Then I got the N97 and it was a total disaster. Constant freeze ups, totally unusable web browser, and horrible battery. All the while I would always return to my Iphone which I've considered to be the best phone ever made. Ive had my Nokia N8 for about 2 week now and I can say......that this is the best phone Nokia has ever made. The construction of the phone is industrially elegant, with amazing lines and a very beautiful screen. Don't be fooled by the low resolution compared to the Iphone, this screen is BEAUTIFUL, and pictures, movies are bright vivid and super sharp. I have the Iphone 4 now and honestly I think the colors are better on the Nokia N8. The most impressive part of this phone is that camera. Pics are insanely beautiful and I don't mean they are great for a camera phone. They are great PERIOD. I would put this up against my Nikon D60 DSLR camera and it would be hard to tell the difference. I have several high end digital cameras and the N8 performs amazingly in bright light as well in low light. I went out to a club last night, and it was pretty dim. With the xenon flash the pics were super clear, bright, and sharp with no fogging or graininess you would typically see on an Iphone 4 in a dark environment. The macro mode is TERRIBLE though. Close up shots about 4 to 5 inches away are a blurry mess. The Iphone 4 however takes AMAZING close up shots. This was a complete surprise to me as I thought the N8 would take super sharp close up shots. Ok moving on to the battery. What can i say....if your using the phone for internet, calls, and Facebook  that battery is ok and will last you from 8am to 5 or 6pm, pretty typical of a smart phone. However once you start taking pics with the flash on that battery gets sucked dry in about 60-70 pics which is cool for a night out, however you pretty much have to have the phone charged up before you hit the town. Then again I run wifi on, bluetooth on, and screen brightness on full at all times, so im sure you can get more juice of it than me. The pics and videos that play on the phone are super sharp and have great color. Ok now moving on to where this phone gets starts off speeding up the hill but ends up getting stuck in the mud. The internet experience is better than the N97. Its faster for sure, however when you click links the screen doesn't always respond the first time. I ofter have to press multiple times. Also when a page loads, its a bit slower than the Iphone 4 but on wifi they are about the same.. Scrolling is ok and kinda laggy Pinch to zoom works well. There is no youtube client for the phone, just a link that takes you to the youtube.com website. Youtube videos are horribly laggy and jerky and not even worth using unless you like constant stopping and stuttering in audio and video. Im sure they will come out with a native Youtube client soon, or if not, that would just plain suck. I use youtube a lot. The Ihone 4 kills the N8 in the youtube experience. The sound from the ONE speaker is actually pretty nice. Doesn't sond tinny. Sound is mid ranged with focus in the higher frequency spectrum. Lows are only apparant when you use headphones. The headphones that come with it are not bad but nothing you'll be impressed with. Iphone headphones are much better.  I use a pair of 15$ seinnheisers and they sound amazing. Bluetooth with this phone is the best I have ever seen. I am typing this review using an Apple bluetooth keayboard with my Nokia N8 and its an amazingly simple and easy thing to do. It works GREAT. I hooked up my N8 to the HDMI on my LCD TV, and what can i say. I was blown away. I played pics I took at a night club and the sample videos that it comes with and they look like Blueray quality on my TV 1080p kind of quality. Really amazing. The radio transmitter works very well and pulls in stations with no distortion. reading ebooks on this thing is just a pure headache. Im not even going to get into that......Ill stick to my Iphone 4 and Ipad for that.  Ok, I almost forgot the 2nd best thing about this phone. The navigation is FANTASTIC. I have Tom Tom on my Iphone - garbage. I have a magellan GPS - ok. I have a Pioneer N3 navigation deck in my Landcruiser- awesome. I would say the navigation is just as good as the pioneer navigation which is ALWAYS spot on. The free voice giuded navigation that says all the street names is great. and you can download for free EVERY language you can think of. Trust me.....They are all there no matter how oscure. I even downloaded a surfer guys voice that makes lame jokes. Playing games on the N8 is a joke. Games are violently laggy, jerky, and overall TERRIBLE. I give the game playing ability 2 stars compared to 10 stars to the Iphone. Dont get this phone if you want to play games, you would be able to. The Nokia OVI store is still the same useless thing it was back in the days of the N97, There were like 5 useful applications I could download for free. Everything else is either COMPLETELY useless or just some lame theme you have to pay for. You know with all the shortcomings of this phone, I like it a lot. I love the camera, GPS, and HDMI output. However the internet browsing, game playing are like 5 years behind the times, which will make this a secondary phone for me to take with me when i go out to clubs, bars, or travel the world so I can use the amazing xenon flash, and GPS. The Iphone will still be my primary phone. Come on Nokia you have such a great phone, why cant you just redesign a new operating system? Symbian is terribly outdated. Well thats all I got.

It also has a fantastic and fun 12 megapixel camera that is easy to use as a standalone capture device, and also has an HDMI output and connectors for hi definition transmission.The screen looks great, case is metallic, durable, and overall weight of the device in hand feels great and the slim sleek lines add to its appeal. It also features a lower resolution front video cam for video calling (that I'm hearing isn't available on North American networks). And alongside the iOS and Android mainstream competitors, features an ambient light sensor and accelerometer, with features and apps that utilize this tech to the fullest.Call quality is excellent and along with sound playback, is crystal clear and better than any smartphone I've been on to date.Where does it lack?Hardware:  The processor is a tad sluggish. If you're hoping to do some gaming on this device, I'd skip to another model.Software and Store:  Everything is menu driven. So if you're used to using the home button (iOS) to go back and choose options, or the back/ return key for the same  (Android), then this think will feel like using Linux on a Mac; quant, but redundant.The store?  Lacks the diversity of iTunes and the Google Play store by far, and so is limited in the array of applications available to it. Also, the sync is nowhere near as intuitive as the Android system, or the iOS for that matter.Overall:Good | Great call quality and a great component system.  Works on any non CDMA network.  Devoted Nokia followers will probably find the navigation improved to previous models and be ok with the store selection.Bad | The operating system and processor just doesn't compete with others in its class. As a smartphone, unless you're only using Ovi Suite (available exclusively to PC), you're going to be left out in the cold when it comes to syncing all of your information seamlessly.Bottom Line | If you have a Nokia fetish, buy this.

I heard their quality started going downhill, but I though I would give them a chance anyway, as this isn't a one of the windows phone. Big mistake.The first phone I received was a dead brick.  However, I believe this was Amazon's fault and not Nokia's. These phones use NiMH batteries. When allowed to completely discharge, like when left sitting in a warehouse for a year, a NiMH battery cannot be recharged.  This was the only time I had to use Amazon's return/ exchange, and they were excellent. They sent me the replacement and set up and scheduled the UPS pickup of the defective phone.The replacement phone arrived in two days. It also was very close to being completely discharged, but not quite.  After leaving it plugged in all evening and overnight (about 12 hours), it finally had enough charge to light the red charging indicator light.  It than took about another 4 hours to completely charge. After than all the software problems started showing up and it was all downhill from there.The first thing you see after starting the phone is a prompt to setup a Nokia OVI store account. After telling it to cancel until later, the phone immedietly tries to download updates - through the cellular data connection. Someone needs to tell Nokia that not everyone has unlimited data plans and they should let us set the phone up before running up our bills.  I immediately canceled the downloads, and then could proceed to setup my wireless network for the data use and then I let the phone do updates. But of course, another stupid design decision from Nokia prevented the updates.  You have to be logged into the OVI account to get updates, but I could not setup or log into an OVI account from the phone until I got the Nokia store update. So I had to setup the account on my computer through their website, download and install the Nokia software, and through there, push the Nokia Store update to the phone.  Now a week after receiving the fist phone, I finally have a somewhat working phone.While the telephone is usable, many of the features and applications are not.  When trying to load Nokia maps, the phone will completely freeze 3 out of 4 times.  During the freeze, all of the buttons are unresponsive, including the hard reset.  The only solution is to let the phone sit for 20 to 30 minutes, at which point it will restart itself. This restart, however, takes about a half hour to completely load.  So don't thr to use the Nokia maps unless you don't need to make a phone call for at-least an hour.The phone has a built in FM transmitter, which I love for playing my MP3's through my car stereo. Unfortunately, after about half an hour (doesn't matter if your using the transmitter or not) the music player begins to report every file as having an error and being unplayable.  The only way to play music at this point is to reboot the phone, which takes 5 or 6 minutes.  If you insist on trying to play more mp3s without restarting the phone, the phone will freeze up for a few seconds and then reboot itself.As if that isn't enough, the phone randomly reboots itself about once a day without warning, each time taking 5 or 6 minutes to fully restart.If you do a Google search, you will find many, many people having these and numerous other problems.  The phone work fine for some people, others have one or a few problems, and others have a phone that's only good for a paperweight.  There are a few reports of Nokia tech support saying they are aware of at least some of the problems and are working on fixes, but there have been no updates since Symbian Belle was released in Feb 2012 - and Belle caused most of these problems.  I had the random reboot issues form the start, which was why I updated the software to Belle, which caused the other problems I have but did not fix the restart issue. And once you update to Belle, there is no going back.This phone has been so bad that I would replace it if I could afford too, and will never buy another Nokia product again.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still love it, two years on.", "Author": "C.

The camera takes damn good pictures (others are finally catching up) and GPS plus turn-by-turn navigation without a data plan (yes, really!) has been awesome. The GPS component is pretty sharp too: the refresh rate or processing speed keeps it from falling behind (ever had a GPS tell you to turn just after you pass that intersection?) and the level of accuracy can distinguish which side of the road I was on when using the Sports Tracker workout app. All that and 16GB onboard and room to grow via microSD.Just noticed I neglected to mention call quality -- it's superb, both signal and clarity, both incoming and outgoing. I still use this as a phone, so this is important to me. It also works pretty well for Skype calling, though I have yet to exploit the front-facing camera.This thing was months/years ahead of the competition, and it makes me sad that Nokia didn't market these better.

I have received many compliments from other people about this phone's awesome performance in camera & video quality as well as fast accurate GPS while driving across North America.

Another very convenient feature is you can connect this phone directly to a TV via a built-in HDMI port to watch videos/photos/playgames. HDMI out is a rare feature in most phones.I have shot photos using Nokia N8 with stunning detail from quarter mile away using an optical zoom lens (that you buy separately as an attachment for about $20).Make sure to apply the latest \"Belle\" software update/patch from Nokia's website.The built-in GPS works without cell tower signal and is very fast in recalculating even in remote areas.

The Map database is so awesome and complete that you can pretty much download free map data from any continent.It seems many of the negative comments here on Amazon are from people who have not yet applied the latest \"Belle\" software update from Nokia, or who are new to smartphones in general or don't know how to use advanced features of this phone or haven't been patient enough to spend decent time to figure out how to use it properly or just have bad mobile phone carriers with poor signal reception.Nokia N8 is still recommended as an unlocked phone as long as one is committed to learn to use it properly.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst phone I have ever got", "Author": "AH \"NoShadowOfDoubt\"", "ReviewID": "R3GH9PRHAPZ478", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it seems like Nokia designed this phone on another planet away from all other touch phones, and of course a dummy like me trusted Nokia and bought it.

Connect a flash drive, keyboard, mouse, etc.QuickOffice included for editing Microsoft Office documents.HDMI out with an adapter included from micro HDMI is nice.The included headset it very nice and has media player controls.Nokia build quality is unparalleled. Really.Some CONs:Symbian Belle looks nice, but it is a bit clunky compared to S60, i think. Not as easy to get around nor as customizable an interface.No WiFi broadcast app from the factory (Joikuspot costs $12)App availability not very extense.The browser is lame (with the exception being how it handles YouTube - no need for a YouTube app), but Opera is free.The resolution could be a bit higher, but the quality of the display is very good.The battery is replaceable, but it might be scary for some to undertake.Music player interface (in Belle OS) is very strange. Portrait vs. landscape interface is COMPLETELY different. In landscape, only the albums view is accessible. No playlists, no artists, no genres, NO ALL SONGS. i can not understand this at all. Sure, i could turn the phone upright and get it all back, but how was this overlooked?It really could use a couple more physical buttons... i am not really a touchscreen fanatic.All things considered, this phone is just not intended for the way i use phones. That would be the E Series. However, if you are a multimedia-oriented user (and a Nokia/Symbian fan), you WILL be stoked on this phone. The rich media experience is amazing and i DO think this phone is cool. It just is not my go-to for day-to-day use. i am going back to using the E6 for my daily driver, with this phone being my camera/music player/video device.

The manual will tell you to turn a screw to take off the back cover so that you could slide a SIM sleeve in an opening direction to insert the card. This is not the actual case. The instructions on the manual appear to be related to something entirely different. Good thing there's YouTube. Nothing to do with screws.Secondly, after I inserted the SIM card, charged the phone, and turned it on--after it loaded, it buzzed and turned off again. But when I removed the SIM card and turned the phone on--it worked. And it was wonderful.Until my third issue came up.The following link will take you to a photobucket album containing two pictures of a page. Both pictures are not all that great, but one is better than the other. The incredibly blurry one was taken by the NOKIA N8 phone that is supposedly 12 megapixels.

The Symbian belle update will cause the phone to not play flash content such as videos that are on your favorite websites like youtube.com(desktop version) so if watching flash videos are your thing then right now this not gonna do that for you. i have no complaints as it relates to the hardware of the device, it feels really solid. the Belle update works good too minus the inability to load flash content, funny enough you will see ad banners work, but if you wanted to stream a embedded video its a no go for that, its been 6-7 months since the release of the Belle update and still Nokia has not corrected the adobe flash problem so im not sure what happening there. I do wish that Nokia gave it more memory on the C: drive. The tiny 256Mb is a joke when the mass memory has some 14Gb of storage...lol, i wonder what is the reasoning behind that???? oh the front camera not that great either. it does take picture but it would seem like a 0.3 or 1 mega-pixel, a 1.3 mega-pxl would have compliment the rear 12mp. Well like i said its a good phone, but Nokia has yet to fix the issue of playing embedded flash content and the C: drive or phone memory is too low (256Mb), im a keep mine for now and see if Nokia gonna fix the Flash issue.-UPDATESo in regards to the flash player, im not sure if there will be an update for the Belle that will allow us to watch flash content embedded on websites or stream from youtube desktop site as the current flash lite 4 does not support those contents. if you get the phone stick to Anna DO NOT update, or you wont be able to play flash.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "love the phone", "Author": "wizdom247", "ReviewID": "RTEKJH6ERAZP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Nokia customer for a long time and this phone has not disappointed me.

GPS is matched only by google maps, with better turn-by-turn directions and the option to store maps offline so you don't use data when you're out and about (great for prepaid and for those no-longer 'unlimited' data plans).5. solid build quality/aesthetics (i have the orange and it looks amazing)6. amazing quality screen7. impressive OS flexibility*CONS1. related to pro #2 - the snappy UI comes about because the system it's built on is ancient. For polish/intuitiveness, you can't beat iPhone/Android, even Windows Phone 7 or WebOS.2. GPS search is abysmal compared to google maps. Though comparable to car GPS systems.3. screen has low resolution**4. OVI store is not nearly as solid as Windows Phone 7/WebOS or as massive as Android Market/App Store.SPECIAL NOTES* the OS is really capable, with features built-in you wouldn't find on other phones. It's got an FM transmitter (so you can broadcast your music to your car radio). It can function as a network interface for tethering your computer. It's got a solid bluetooth implementation so you can drop files onto it wirelessly (can't do that on iPhone/iPad). Nokia also builds syncing software; not as polished as iTunes, but way better than what other companies provide; the mac syncing stuff that nokia has hooks into iCal, iPhoto, iTunes to boot.** the screen has really low resolution, but is still vibrant and crisp. because of the display, blacks are PURE black (darkness) and not backlit. you really have to see it in person to know what i mean.overall, despite its shortcomings, if you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed. especially for the price you get for this at amazon, the GPS/camera alone make it worth more than any HD android phone out there for anyone who doesn't like to be under contract.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia N8", "Author": "Serafin@", "ReviewID": "R1BPK9UZXA4UYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent Nokia N8, your camera is amazing I recommend it from the store ovi can download an unlimited number of applications for all uses social networking, entertainment or work.In short, the Nokia N8 is very comprehensive and I recommend it is also completely free to use anywhere in the world.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid built, magnificent camera, a smartphone that stands out in the crowd", "Author": "Junior10", "ReviewID": "RZQTYXDE9IYOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best nokia phone ever, the camera is better than most point and shoot digital cameras, and i like the way the phone lays when placed on the table because of the camera protrusion, it does feel unique.

The representative said they're new to the Nokia Care and don't even have any parts available.  They could fix my phone free of charge (under warranty) but it'd take them weeks since they have to apply for parts from Nokia, wait for shipment, then fix the phone.  Or, they said I could pay $200  and they'd order screens from their own vendor here in the U.S.  They also said the battery is defective since it heats up so quickly, and that I'd also have to pay extra if I don't want to wait for them to \"apply\" to Nokia.  Like I'm going to pay $200 on top of the $400 I just paid for my brand new phone?  Needless to say, I returned the phone to Amazon immediately, and thankfully they refunded my account in full.It's too bad, this is really a good phone.  I've done extensive research on smart phones, and I thought N8 would best suit my needs and life style.  I don't do social network, or want to pay for expensive data plans.  I just want a good quality phone with strong reception and loud speaker, that has a very good camera (I don't have a digital camera), with many connection options (USB on the go, bluetooth for file transferring, etc), and can also act as a PDA (calendar, contacts, notes, all sync with Google).  Basically  I want the swiss army knife version of a smart phone without the bloat data plan.  And N8 would've been it.  Unfortunately Nokia has completely dropped the ball on quality control.  This incident also made me realize that Nokia has NO PRESENCE whatsoever in the U.S.  Apparently they don't care about this market, and that if something happen to the product I purchased from them, I'd have nowhere to turn to except their mediocre \"care center\", which can't even function properly because of all the bureaucracy.  I heard Nokia is taking a different turn with Windows Phone 7, where they'll focus more on the North American market.  I hope they do.  I've always liked Nokia phone because of the excellent reception and hardware built; I even like Symbian for what it's worth.  But I'm not going to put my hard-earned money to buy a piece of technology then get little to no support when it breaks (within warranty).

Once the phone booted up again, all my settings on my phone was reverted.KEYBOARD? 0 starsI never got used to the phone. Yes it does have swype, BUT only horizontally. Whats the point of swype in that position? its not like you can swype with 2 fingers to make words. So your stuck with typing out words without auto-text, and with a screen keyboard thatl make you retype words. If you wanna try to get comfortable typing like this be my guest.Overall feel? 0 starsI tried very hard to like this phone. I gave it lots of chances. I think i was too amazed by the 12 megapixel camera attached to it that i decided to stay with the phone. But in the end if you don't count the camera, the phone is not great. Maybe the phone being faulty was a godsend. Heres to hoping amazon refunds.P.S.Theres a reason why most people use typically the same type of phone, and its because its reliable.

I may even have to consider getting a new phone after 3 years because of the battery even I dont want to, I normally use my cellphones for 5 years or more, since the most I need them for if calling and texting.Im really upset.

I needed a phone to travel outside of the states; I am a happy Verizon iPhone user in the US.  I did have a Droid Pro which Verizon unlocked for me but it will not work in the states or anywhere CDMA is available except on Verizon...( it cannot run gsm if CDMA is available).  I decided to get something different and always liked Nokia products back in the early phone days.The n-8 is built very well IMO, solid, great materials and a great size-fits very comfortably in my hand.  The screen is just ok but sometimes difficult to read.  Speed is just ok...nowhere near that of the iPhone. Call quality is good and like others have said, the camera is amazing.  All in all I like the phone alot and want to like it even more because it is so interesting- it definitely requires a learning curve versus the Apple and Android phones as its OS is not as intuitive but once mastered, it's fine.  One annoying problem is that I can not get my music from my Mac onto this phone as the required plug-in does not work with the latest Apple software-hopefully an oversight Nokia will fix promptly.  In addition, the app store, OVI, is limited-not even a NY Times app.I know Nokia has had many problems of late but I feel that product wise they are pretty close to the leaders..perhaps they should continue to focus on Symbian before \"giving it up to Windows\" in the upcoming models.I was about to return the phone but it's quirkiness and my need for a true unlocked/world phone is making me consider keeping it.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "magnifico", "Author": "lindberg", "ReviewID": "R2LNPFOQHIL7Q5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "La compra fue de la mas segura y confiable, el objecto comprado aunque era usado llego en perfecto estado y funcionando a lo maximo", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "carlos diaz", "ReviewID": "R1CKNWY6IYG1Z2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "me parece un celular excelente, pero me gustar\u00eda saber si se puede activar en ecuador , ya que estoy interesado en adquirir uno...! en ecuador funcionan las telef\u00f3nicas de claro y movistar en una frecuencia me parece de 850...!", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia N8", "Author": "Khamphan Vong", "ReviewID": "R64U7XKPYP41S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Gray)I loved it, this the best phone I ever own.Best camera.I did not have any issue with this .", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia rocks", "Author": "big daddy", "ReviewID": "ROX16V0YLHQHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought 2 Nokia N8 for my self and my wife.

I see the prices for them new are going down to $160, which seems like a pretty good deal for one now, even if there is no more \"support\" for it from Nokia.It has features that most other smartphones *still* do not have, such as a micro-SD card slot, FM transmitter, 12mp camera, and HDMI output.Because of the AMOLED screen, it can show you the TIME when the thing goes into stand-by, so it's also a clock.The battery life is pretty good. Standby lasts 4 days if you don't use it much.The camera is by far the best camera you will find in a phone.They re-added the timed profiles feature which I found missing in earlier revisions of the Symbian^3The media player is greatly improved after upgrading to Belle. You can create playlists with it.The built-in FM transmitter means you can play music anywhere that there is a radio.That means your car doesn't need bluetooth or even a AUX IN jack, and you can hook up lots of boomboxes to throw an outdoor party with it.I don't see this feature in very many newer smartphones. I guess it is assumed all cars have bluetooth in them and you wouldn't need it for any other reason.The Location/Maps application works great. Sometimes it takes a while to get a fix if you don't have a data plan, but it does work without a data plan!! You can download all the maps offline and search offline.It is a little slower than the modern phones of today, and for web browsing or e-mail the screen is too small, but I don't want a big tablet in my pocket all the time!It's a camera you can keep with you and leave ON and in standby without sapping too much juice.And it does HD video too. Not to mention its HDMI output which may be handy if you have some video or presentation you want to give.Oh, and did I mention it's a pretty good phone too?I wish Nokia still made phones like these.You can't install any android or ios apps, but there are still tons of good apps for it.My biggest gripe is this: I wish the battery was removable.

My Bose headphones do not feel deprived.- HDMI output, just works.- Can access USB devices directly.- FM transmitter.- Great battery life.Cons:- UI is dated.- App store does not have content to match other eco-systems.- The task/memory manager is very basic. Since it supports true multi-tasking, a heavy user can tend to eat up the RAM pretty fast. Need to remember to close apps.- Battery is not removable.- Can be a bit sluggish at times.

I upgraded from a Nokia N82, so I am pretty familiar with the symbian platform. But even compare symbian^3 with iOS and Android, it falls very very short on the usability standard. Below is a list of my rants:1. My face hangs up the call very often, the proximity sensor is installed on the right side of phone, so it is even easier to hang up the phone with your face if you hold the phone in your left hand.2. The camera is 12mp, but image-stabilization is very poor. I swear my 3 years old n82 takes overall better picture than n8.3. I can type pretty fast with t9 on the alphanumeric keyboard, but its text prediction just sucks. When I type in \"was\", it comes out as \"Zar\" and other strange word choices. The phone also has a tendency to prioritize capitalized words in the middle of the sentence, such as \"And\" instead of \"and\", \"Good\" instead of \"good\", and etc. The landscape QWERTY keyboard works well if you turn on autocorrect.4. The built in web browser is pretty bad, so most people opt for Opera mobile instead. But native applications still automatically open the native browser.5. Ovi Map is hard to use, the check in option can rarely locate the store or restaurant I'm in.6. NOkia has ditched Symbian for Microsoft, so don't really expect there to be much upgrade in the future.7. Lack of app developers for symbian.8. The phone hangs and freezes too often. There have been several times that the touch screen becomes unresponsive when I tried to answer an incoming call.Overall, it is entirely the software that is to blame. The hardware is very good.

GUD NOKIA  AWESOME GIVE RATING 5 STAR", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "JUST DISAPPOINTING WITH PERFORMANCE", "Author": "duny white", "ReviewID": "R13UNFLE6H535V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Cons&Bugs; with N8&Symbian; ^3PLEASE DO NOT VOTE WITHOUT READING ALL AND WATCHING VIDEO FOR PROOFS!If a technology lover guy looks just its specifications before getting the phone, he can put N8 to the first place among the all available phones in the market. Yes except its very poor screen resolution, everything seems greatest! However if he gets it and then use it just a couple hours; he will be so disappointed with its lots of bugs and very miserable performance, like me!1. Restarting: The phone is restarting itself, suddenly you do not understand why... Even if you do not do anything that bug occurs so often. It is killing battery of phone, making annoying.2. Ovi Store: It is saying unable to connect to Ovi Store(or service). I do not understand how such a bug occurs! It is your official application store!!!Even if it connects, sometimes disconnecting suddenly!3. Internet Connection: There are always internet connection problems. It says unable to connect to service! Or unable to perform operation!4. Ovi maps: The Ovi maps do not work properly! Generally it is so slow!  Ovi maps has a lot of ways to go! Ovi maps is 1000 times worse than Google Maps.Its search engine is not working properly, either.5. Gps: It gives wrong results. Whenever I write a store name, farther ones come first! Look where is the other Walmart, which is just half distance from other the nearest one!Where is the first one on Steelyard? Walmart is the number one in the world, if gps can not find it properly, I can not imagine JcPenney, Macy`s, Target or Petco Stores...The gps of the phone found second one as the nearest one and furthermore after clicking that one and then choosing details I shocked one more time: it was showing third one`s address. I mean gps could not find Steelyard Walmart but it found Mayfield Walmart. However I chose Mayfield one and then I checked its address it was showing Brookpark Walmart. What an idiot device! How can we trust it?It is one of the biggest disappointing for me. It found the nearest Bestbuy Store 318miles from my home. What a stupid gps!6. Light sensor: Sensor does not work properly. At night screen resolution/brightness drops! If I use the phone in daytime or in place with plenty of light, it increases! Stupid sensor it should be reverse!!!!!!!!!7. Proximity sensor for auto turn-off:  It works improperly while talking. While talking the screen light always becomes off and on. It is killing battery; it should always be off! Look the picture it is on while I am talking.8. Camera: It seems the best camera but it has the worst properties! If you change its settings for your personal preferences and then if you go to menu, and then if you return to the camera, you see old factory settings! Such a stupid problem only can be done by stupid Symbian!9. Voice of camera: It is impossible to shut down its voice. Why? I do not want to hear any voice while taking pictures. However you do not permit my wishes!10. Flash: While taking pictures I am turn offing it, after turning to menu and then back to flash it is turning to the factory setting; it is on again. However I closed it earlier. Who changed my preference?11. Red light of flash: It is impossible to turn off its red light even in the daytime. Why? I generally do not want to use either flash or its red light. Why do not you consider the customers like me?12. Games: While playing games, it frozen a lot of times! Sometimes its sensitiveness for touches died, too.13. Internet preferences: I have data plan and home internet. I generally prefer home but the device wants to connect AT&T.; (I change settings, too) Why? Furthermore the software does not permit me do those: I want to use home internet but if it dies suddenly, it should connect to AT&T; internet without doing anything. Whenever it comes back, it should reconnect to home internet without doing anything. By that way, it prevents disconnection.14. Battery: In old Nokia phones, battery was warning us earlier. I mean if the battery reaches to die it was warning us. However n8 battery is warning me so late. It is so so late that after its warning a couple minutes later it is dying suddenly. I mean its warning means it is so late, even I am running for charger but it is turning off itself before reaching the charger!15. Accelerometer sensor for UI auto-rotate: Accelerometer sensor does not work properly; especially while typing messages. Even if you keep half an hour horizon its screen keyboard insists on vertical stand. Actually none of the sensors working properly in this phone!16. Factory Settings: After having a lot of problems, I searched and I saw that a lot of people having similar problems. And then I reset my phone with someone`s suggestions. Actually an employee, Mr. Jay, from Nokia customer care suggested the same thing. Unfortunately it did not work. However I noticed that I lost all information which came originally with the phone. Some photos, apps, videos... What happened? I was thinking, I would get the original settings by resetting.17. Mail: It is good to connect all mails to one place. However you have another problem. Whenever I get new mails generally I cannot see those mails on my screen but I can see on my PC. I mean it does not refresh&update; itself on time!18. Clock:  If you put so many apps; sometimes clock does not work it stops a moment. Just a moment later it works properly. However that bugs only occurs whenever I put a lot of apps.19. Surfing on the internet: While surfing on the internet it frozen a lot of times!20. Hdmi: While playing game on the TV with hdmi, it is not good for my eyes. I am having pain. I mean our eyes are being dazzled! My phone settings are ok and my hdmi cable is the best!21. Disconnection while talking: While speaking on the phone; everything seems ok but you can not hear other party`s voice! That bug occurred when your employee Julian called me, too. It is happening so often recently! The first weeks I did not have this problem.22. Message strips: They are getting lost. It occurs very rarely!23. Touchscreen: It is not good enough; it could be better like HTC phones or iphone 4.24. Screen: Material for touchscreen is bad, keeping my fingerprints! It seems dirty after a couple touches. Furthermore that 3.5 inch screen of  N8  ACTUALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN OTHER PHONES WITH 3.5 SCREEN.e.gN8 with 16/9 ratio:  77.5 mm x 43.6 mm  =  3377 mm2iPhone 4 with 4/3 ratio: 71.1 mm x 53.3 mm  =  3792 mm2the iPhone's display is 12.3 % larger than the N8's.25. Screen resolution: Screen resolution is horrible. It is 3 times less than iphone 4; %50 less than galaxy s series, or HTC desire evo 4g, or Sony xperia x10!26. Place of speaker: It has the best speaker among all new ones but it is in the back and on the higher part. It is in such a horrible place that when you put the phone on paper or on clothes, it prevents the voice of ringtones to come through. Even if I put highest volume sometimes I can not here its voice. Since that designing bug, my friends blame me why do not you respond our calls on time!!!27. Invalid server name: It does not connect to internet and gives that bug very often. However I noticed that it was very common bug with old symbian models, too. On the other hand it generally occurs if I try to connect a router without a password. It less occurs with secured routers.28. Router passwords: The phone is not keeping old router passwords. Why?29. HD video: you say live in HD but your HD video is not good like iphone 4. Colors seem artificial!30. Very poor application store. It is 100 times less than Apple, 35 times less than Google. I downloaded  more than 80% of all free ones. Just there are a couple nice applications and games. They are swype, skype, google maps, fring, agry birds, whatisapp messenger, converter, forecaweather, road to hell 3d, opera mobile, led-it, Qtorch, fingerprint, brainvita, candle, gomoku, mobile geek. Those are all!youtube app is horrible!!!31. Unknown bugs: The phone sometimes temporarily dies. It shows some very different, unfamiliar bugs, too.32. A couple times I lost my contact list. However it was temporarily; a couple hours later it returned back.33. Gadgets: They do not work thoroughly. They always say unable to get content or loading(but never loads'))); even if wireless wizard says connected to internet.34. Managing files: On the menu part there are games or applications files. If I download some apps or games from ovi store, they are going to the files randomly.  I mean I downloading a game from ovi`s game part but the phone putting it to apps file. And if I download an application from ovi`s apps part, the phone putting it to games file. What a stupid thing! Furthermore the software does not permit me put some of games to the first 3 steps.35. Managing home screen: The phone does not permit managing home screen; it has 3 steps but I want to put 3 more steps. I could not do that.36. Tethering: It is good to use the phone as modem. However I could not use the phone`s data plan with its bluetooth. I mean I connected to internet on my laptop using usb cable and phone`s data plan. However I wanted to connect to the phone with bluetooth and then I wanted to put the device to the corner of window. Nevertheless I can not blame N8 directly, because the bluetooth of my laptop has problems, either. Nonetheless it is good if you have unlimited data. The internet connection is not either slow or fast but ok.37. Icons: They seem very poorly designed. Actually just the icons are enough to show how Nokia so behind the innovations or other OS platforms. They seem like windows 98 or earlier versions of Microsoft. No creativity. They are not cool or attractive.38. Delivery reports: I could not get any delivery reports with AT&T.; It always says pending!39. Power problems: If you put the phone to the charger with zero battery, it never shows it is full. I mean if the device was shut down with depleted battery, phone screen always shows as charging.40. Voip. With other smartphones I connect to internet on the phone and then I sign in to my voip provider to make international calls. And then I chose phone-to-phone option. I put my number to there and then I put my destination number. However I could not get incoming call with that phone! I always got an unknown message and then a new voice message from my destination party. S/he was saying hello hello etc.I mean if you connect the internet on the phone, the phone can not get incoming voip call!41. Browser: Absolutely it has the ugliest and the most problematic one ever.42. Social integrations: Facebook, Twitter and Youtube are can not be worse!43. The phone is so slower than recent smartphones.44. Finally in my opinion the most important thing the phone or symbian OS can not make us addictive to it. I mean if I do not have the phone on my pocket, I do not feel its necessity or scarcity.I can write maybe 30 more! That is absolutely crap phone actually crap designed with horrible OS. I was an old Nokia user and loyal customer but not anymore. Some people compare symbian vs IOS, Android or Blackberry OS... What a big shame for those companies being compared with crap software! Nokia, your software is absolutely the worst! Maybe it can be compared with Palm OS. However it can not be compared even one year old Bada OS.Please designer guys look HTC phones like desire hd, evo 4g, mozart 7 or look Apple iphone 4 or Blackberry Torch, or Sony Erc. Xperia Arc  and then look your design. You can understand there are very long way to reach them! Recently there is only one good designed Nokia phone. It is e7. Nevertheless it can not get success for you! Because it has Symbian OS again. Most of the Nokia  phones are horribly designed!As I said I was an old customer and I am very familiar with Nokia and its apps. But every year you are going back more! Future will not be brighter!When I purchased 3-4 hours later I thought that is not a good phone and can not get the success for the company. Even if you did great advertising and with the cheapest pricing, I was sure it would not be successful. Recently I saw n8 with about 380$ price on newegg.com! What a big shame for Nokia! Your phones were the most expensive ones 4-5 years ago! 380 $ is a gps or 12 mp camera price! What a big shame for Nokia being not preferred even if with half price! 4 years ago your market share was about 60% right now it is about 28%. And your price are much cheaper than the past.I do not want to see Symbian anymore! It is certain that is my last Symbian until die and I am sure that phone will be 99.99% my last Nokia, too.Nevertheless there are some positive sides of the phone. Those should be mentioned, too: build and material quality for drops, hits. Longer battery than other similar ones. (The reason of longer battery is very poor screen resolution and actually smaller size of other 3.5 inch phones.)That is all.IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT BUGS JUST WRITE THOSE TO GOOGLE:invalid server name with n8unable to connect to service with n8restarting problem with n8unable to connect to ovi store with n8power problem with n8battery problem with n8camera settings problem with n8UI auto-rotate with n8sensor problem/bugs with n8One more thing they think themselves so intelligent.

However, it seems like they're falling behind, especially for the US market at least. That's why I started looking at other phones that suits my needs and then started using various phones with android OS.Ever since I saw this the N8 announced I was excited and looked forward to getting one. When it finally went on sale I bought a black one last year to replace my android phone (had a htc legend at the time).First impression was I absolutely loved this phone's feel and look and how simple everything was. Then after a couple of weeks, I got bored of this phone and its lack of usable apps.Things I liked about this phone- Feels and looks great, very solid phone- Has all the bands/frequencies to be used world wide- Awesome camera for a phone- Xenon flash, even tho I don't use it lol- Simple to use- Great battery life- Very nice screen and I like that pulsing light thing on the buttonThings I didn't like about this phone- Whenever I'm talking on the phone, sometimes the screen doesn't turn off and I guess somehow my cheeks touched the end button and disconnects the call. Happens quite often and was very annoying.- Picture taken from this camera looks great but once I upload it from phone to facebook, the quality was pretty crappy- Don't have Pandora- Lack of good apps- I won't always get my emails, will need to restart phone then start receiving emails again- Phone lags sometimes when going through menu or using one of their useless appsAnother thing I hated was that I spent $2.99 to buy the angry bird game and it didn't even have as many levels as the ones for android, which was FREE! That was quite disappointing. Not phone's fault, just symbian I guess.Ended up selling this phone and went back to android, got the galaxy s, which by the way has been one of the best phones I've ever used so far. Thought I give Nokia a try again but symbian just seems so behind. I'm not saying the N8 is a bad phone, it's just not for me. If this phone has android OS, it would be my perfect phone!

The product now ships with Anna and maybe Belle but is easily upgraded.  There is even some third-party upgrades that bring this phone into 2013.  I purchased it in April 2013 as a replacement to an earlier N8 that I had damaged.  BUT: I Originally ordered a Nokia 808.  It had a defective memory card-slot. I then ordered three N8s.  Two were defective in that the HDMI output didn't work, the third had a defective camera shutter button.  I ordered a fourth one from PUT Group after writing them to make sure they weren't a business operating under the same name as the other four companies.  Prompt response, helpful information and a promise that I could return it if there was a problem. This N8 is fine.  PUT Group is an excellent source to buy the phones.  The same cannot be said for XIV Wireless, My Wish-List and  Hassle-Free Cell.  I'm not complaining about their service.  They promptly refunded my purchase. Maybe I just got lucky with PUT but there seems to be some consistent issues with Nokia quality control so make sure you can return the phone if it fails to work.

It's still a great phone but I'm totally disappointed with Nokia quality control or the way that some resellers are handling their products.First I must say this is a terrific phone.  Consider buying for all the reasons you've read.  But don't buy it until Nokia releases the Anna (and preferably the Belle) operating system update.  The current one is a bit buggy.  Much of the rest of the world has received the update but Nokia in their wisdom has not (as of September 20, 2011) released it for US versions.  There is even some suggestion that the US will not ever get the update since Nokia wants to push their upcoming Microsoft products.  Until Nokia releases Anna and Belle you should stay away from this phone.  For that matter you should consider their customer service attitude toward US customers when you considering buying any Nokia phone.  They just don't seem to care about their existing customers - at least those in North America.

It was, and is, my first smartphone. My Verizon CDMA dumb phone isn'tcompatible with EU networks. But I was in a hurry and didn't do my research.Comments:-I found an unexpected plethora of mobile phone carrier selection. Had I waited to get a phone until we arrived, I could have gotten a dumb phone for \u00a317 including VAT and \u00a310 usage credit. Pay as you go plans are plentiful and can be SIM only, phone & SIM, or one can get a US style plan.-I paid $300 for the N8 and saw it for sale at \u00a3300 (say close to $500) in London-however, I could never connect to the net except through wifi, don't know if it was the phone or the carrier-it was very tedious to text on a touchscreen after using thumbs on buttons, maybe a different phone or more experience would cure me-operating system was alien & counterintuitive. will get Android or Windows opsys for next smartphone-ringer was short & weak, dropped almost every call that came in. bad because incoming calls are free-vibrate mode also short & weak and no reminder buzzes-it is cute but that's not enough reason to buy when there are better choices out there****Later. I am positive the 'unhelpfuls' are Nokia plants, as I was careful to lay out what I did and did not like about the phone. Manufacturers are getting aggressive about negative Amazon reviews, as was the case with a $2000 gaming computer my husband had that bricked at one month. It sat in repair shop for over a month, then was told 6 more weeks for computer co. to ship a hard drive. A computer company. The person in charge of low Amazon reviews found his review and the harddrive was overnighted and we now have a working laptop again. Of course I'm sure computer company wants him to revise his review as a quid pro quo.

I could use it internationally 3.) it had free gps 4.) it had a really good camera w/ video.This thing has been nothing but a nightmare & I will never buy another Nokia product ever again because of it. The hardware seems to be pretty good, if only the software worked so I could use it. I have never spent so much time trying to trouble shoot with an electronic device.1.) I need to connect via wifi because I don't have a data plan. After the latest update, wifi will simply not work for any native Nokia application, furthermore every application I try hangs & only tells you \"connection failed\" after several minutes preventing you from even using the phone for anything else. However, for some reason the Opera browser will connect to the internet because it has it's own wifi prompt within the application, so I know it's not a problem with the modem wherever I am.2.) I was able to use the gps inititially, but with the last update my maps disappeared & I have no way of getting them back (because wifi doesn't work & you can only update maps on a Windows computer, not on a Mac).3.) When it was working I installed some free applications from Nokia's webstore & all of them just wreeked havoc on the phone. I wish I could go back to the way the phone was when I first bought it but...4.) There is no way to \"restore\" your phone to factory settings. There's no dvd you can install original software onto it as you can with an iphone. Once the phone has been updated, you can't go back.5.) The phone doesn't save info when you update. I thought I did, but when it happened, it wouldn't update contacts etc. When I type in a number someone's name come's up after I've already typed the full number....so the information is hiding in there somewhere, but it won't load into contacts, nor doestyping a single number prompt any contacts because the contacts app is blank.6.) Nokia's customer service is poor. Get ready to peruse many user forums to find answers to everything.7.) GPS is spotty. Sometimes it loads the address you type in, but many times it doesn't....Sometimes shaking your phone helps to make gps work, sometimes it doesn't....and sometimes after you've given up & thrown the thing on the floor & it's been lying there for ten minutes, half way into your trip a voice suddenly tells you to turn left.8.)

Opel \"-Tib\"", "ReviewID": "R3MEI3JTUEXAHX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After owning a Nokia N900, I find this phone very disappointing.I knew I wasn't going to like not having a physical keyboard, but I found it almost impossible to type on this phone. Some of you may find this as a plus if you forget to lock your phone, but the heat sensitive touch-screen really doesn't work well for me. I find that every other letter I type is missed because I am used to tapping with my fingernails, it allows for more precision. Being forced to use my finger tips, not only am I struggling to hit every character, but every other one I do hit, is the wrong one, because the buttons are too small to use the tips of my fingers.I am also extremely disappointed in the fact that the battery is embeded and therefor not replaceable. I have always found solace in the fact that I can pick up a spare battery for a few dollars if the current one isn't holding a good charge. I also like keeping a spare battery around for every phone I own, in case for some reason the phone dies and I can't find my charger, or similar problems. And just to iterate the importance of being able to change a battery, the last N900 I owned, the charger port quit working, and broke completely lose. It was a pain, but I was still able to use the phone, due to keeping a spare battery and an external battery charger. If something along those lines happened with this N8, that would be impossible.Then there is the fact that they have reverted from the standard micro-usb charger port to the little dinky nokia charger. I used to be okay with that little dinky plug for nokia phones, I kind of liked the fact that a lot of their phones had the same  charger, while other companies had different chargers for almost every phone. However, after having gotten used to the new standard micro-usb charging port that almost every new phone has, I have not been too worried about forgetting my charger. To go back to having to remember to haul a charger around all the time would be quite annoying and unnecessary in my opinion.Overall, I am disappointed with the N8, originally I was willing to step down and accept a phone that I think is lacking some serious technology, because I love Nokia. But, when it comes to reality, look at HTC's phones... Nokia is charging the same price for a single core 1ghz processor while HTC has dual core 1.2ghz processors in their phone. Nokia is also behind in the fact that they don't have a single 4G phone, or an android phone. Nokia has a little more ram, but what use is that if the phone can't handle enough programs to use that ram. And the thing that made the N900 so amazing, is the Maemo operating system. To go back to the Symbian OS, I felt confined. I would take Android over Symbian any day. Now Nokia is going to drop Symbian for the Microsoft Windows Mobile 7 OS? YUCK! The one thing nokia has going for their phones, is the cameras. But once again, lets be real, it's nice to be able to snap a good shot when I'm on the road or something, but any photo I want to come out nice, I pull out my nice camera. The cameras on phones just aren't high enough quality yet to be able to take the same kind of pictures that a stand-alone camera can. A decent phone camera can only go so far, it doesn't make or break the sale in my opinion.As for looks, the phone looks great, the camera looks great, if I was only going for show and not usability, this would be a good phone.

I heard about the N8 and became extremely excited about it.

I go to nokia.com to order the phone and a problem occurs and the order is canceled... ok I'll just order again right... NO I can't because the order was canceled Nokia won't let me order it for another month cause no one can tell the system what to do (especially in India) so my account is on some sort of system hold.

I give it an hour and it turns on. Right away I plug it into the comp and reinstall the software version just in case then I sync it on OVI.

I call Nokia and explain again all that has happened, and add that I've read others are having similar issues. \"Ok sir what we recommend is exchanging it where you purchased it from and hopefully we will come out with an update to fix the problem from happening again in the future\".ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!!

I had to go in and uninstall almost everything I could find (most of which was installed on the F:\\ drive, which has 16GB), including my work email.  This rendered the whole point of having the phone moot.It also has the SIM and extra memory slots on the side covered by a flimsy rubber cover.  So, any pressure will lead the phone to think you've ejected your extra memory, leading to another ubiquitous error message.

My Nokia E71 has never let me down and I am a huge Nokia supporter.1) The touch screen constantly picks the wrong numbers or letters you type even with software update 1.2 installed on the phone.  If you have small fingers then this is not as much of an issue.  You have to hit the touch screen perfectly to get the correct letter on number that you selected. Very frustrating. Emails and texting are almost impossible on this phone.  To many errors with keystrokes.  When you try to reply to a email you have to touch the area in the email where your reply goes to start typing.  But the problem is that sometimes the phone will not open the window for you to type the reply message in.  You have to hit the typing area more than one time for the phone to get into reply mode for an email.  This is in inexcusable problem for a smartphone.  The are no touch screen settings to fix this issue.2) When you make a call and you have to use the touchscreen for touch tone input for a phone systems automated attendant menu prompt, 99% of business calls today will require touch tone input, the phone will dial a number in the contacts list instead of just inputting the touch tones as any normal phone would do.  It searches the contacts as you type the digits, and about 50% of the time it will call the number related to the keys that you just imputed instead off just entering the keystrokes tones for the automated attendant prompts.3) You can not run more than one email account at a time on this phone with out severely effecting the phones performance.  If you run a pop account and a Exchange account on the default home screen.  The phone becomes so unresponsive it bogs down to anything you try and do from that point on.4) The signal reception on this phone is terrible compared to my Nokia E71.  It will go from a full signal to 1 or 2 bars for no reason at all.  Once again my Nokia E71 does not have this problem.5) If the signal gets really bad the phone will switch from 3G to Edge and then the phone will not switch back to 3G when you are in an area that supports it.  You have to reboot the phone to get it back into 3G mode.  This is a major issue when you are in an area with varying terrain. Once again my E71 does not do this either.6) I had the first phone's camera go bad.  The camera would take pictures and the image was all white and saturated like a fog white color.  No adjustment or a full camera reset on the phone fixed the problem, face recognition was off, auto white balance set to auto or manual did not help.  Set the flash to off and changed the exposure iris level and this helped a little but still white haze on all photo's.  This happened on a the second phone's camera that Amazon sent me and this phone was made in China and more buggy than the first one made in Finland.  Definitely a issue with this camera.7) The phone has to be checked for open applications to perform correctly.  Any unnecessary open apps kill this phones performance.8) You constantly hit the camera button on the side of the phone when you are making a phone call.  It is almost impossible not to hit this button by mistake and turn the camera feature on.MY first phone was made in Finland the Rma'ed phone that Amazon sent me was built in China.  The second phone was more buggy than the first with the sensors on the phone.  I had to switch them all off.For a $500 phone I was expecting way more from Nokia.  This phone is a huge disappointment and I sent them both back to Amazon for a full refund.Buyer beware if you are a power user and demand more from a phone you should look elsewhere.There are to many negatives that out way the positives of this phone.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "satisfy", "Author": "jangar", "ReviewID": "R20RIAY48XKSC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my very first android phone, before always used some cheap old scraps from nokia(compare to current N8).

If your phone gets stuck turn it off and back on.4.- The much advertised Ovi Store from time to time does not connect, so you try it later. 5.- With normal use the battery last bearly a day. Unfortunely these are daily incovenients so I am not very happy with this phone. Honestly, I expected a lot more from Nokia.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia abondoning the Symbian.

Excellent camera2. Excellent build quality3. Free stand alone GPS receiver and excellent ovi maps (No data plan or internet required to use maps)4. Excellent functionality of the Symbian (I am not a fan of flashy UI)5. Not carrier branded (i.e. not loaded with carrier bloat ware as well as not crippled by carriers. I just need wifi and do not need 3G. I am using this phone with AT&T; without data plan.)It is very sad that Nokia decided to go with WP7. This means that we will not have any mobile OS that is not restricted by carriers.Price on this phone was reduced by 30 bucks after the Nokia's announcement. I think the price will drop further.

It looks like it was designed by brilliant engineers, only to be taken away and ruined at the last minute by a horde of clueless pencil-pushers. It's like you can see Nokia's legendary infighting in action.This would be an amazing $350 phone. The form factor and build quality must be seen to be believed, and it does the basics very well (HDMI/composite out is a really cool feature but useless for me). But for the same price as the latest Android/iPhone? No way.The camera, while excellent has a huge Achilles heel: no lens cover, and no included lens cloth. What good is a Zeiss Tessar lens when it's covered with fingerprints and pocket fuzz (and just you wait until it gets scratched!)? Also, you can't silence the shutter tone (great for weddings!). The touchscreen can be buggy after unlocking via the slider - half the time you can't swipe from one home screen to the next, or it goes out of order. Oh, and the keyboard really is as bad as the reviews say.The default GMail app can't archive. No touch events/HTML5 for the Web browser, which is a moot point because even moderately intensive sites like Sladshdot slow the phone to an unbearable crawl. No multitouch at all besides pinch/zoom in the browser and photo viewer.

Used for app development (Qt), mostly.I haven't found any of the hardware issues reported, thankfully.It takes a little while to get over the initial user interface \"shock\". It's clunky, slow at times, the various apps have completely different looks and feels. Qt-based apps for example cannot touch-scroll. Others are a full screen contraption of user elements unrelated to any standard design form a user reasonably would expect. Many pre-installed apps do not seem to work, or require elaborate configuration, although that can be a plus, considering how Android apps can reach right into your contact and other information for \"convenient\" sign-up.I still hate the plastic shells at the top and bottom, negating the good impression of the aluminum case but the SIP integration remains a highlight, and so is pentaband 3G on this SIM unlocked device. I also despise the USB port at the side of the device. Didn't like it on the Droid (one of the reasons not to buy one), and sure isn't appreciated here.Great speaker. The camera dome provides the right amount of separation from a flat surface to sound great. Loud rings, so it is suitable to double as a SIP-based house or office phone.Outstanding camera. Unless I want to shot specifically nice pictures, I can leave my digital camera at home. Huge plus for me, personally.One personal aspect here that's quite the relief from the Android device I've recently used on a daily basis (NexusOne), is a reasonable assurance not to get \"spied on\" by Google like found on Android devices.Bottom line: Recommended only if you know what you're getting when buying a Symbian device.

This phone is a complete and total utter disappointment and p.o.s.! This phone has been nothing but headaches, drama and stress with less than two months of ownership! First of all, the phone freezes, shuts off and turns itself back on, downloads and app don't fucntion. The phone stalls when browsing the web and opening apps. I've had to reset the phone three times and finally, the phone had to be sent for service. Now I will be without the phone for another two weeks or more! Even the apps suck! They offer no mainstream, common American apps! Everything is either European or Pakistani or Middle Eastern! The app store is limited. Customer service isn't at all knowledgeable and they don't respond in a timely fashion when your issue has to be escalated to a higher level tech support. I had to wait almost a week to receive the prepaid UPS label to send my phone back for service! The only saving grace to the phone is the 12 megapixel cam! The pic quality is amazing. I haven't tried connecting the phone to my tv via the hdmi cable yet nor have I recorded video but I'm sure if those features function properly or are similar to the quality and functions of the camera, then I'm sure they're great. All in all, I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT recommend this phone! I would have given the phone a one and a half star rating which would have been between \"I hate it\" and \"I don't like it\" ONLY because of the quality of the cam. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and if you want an unlocked quality smartphone, just invest the extra $200-$375 and get the Iphone 4s, 5 or Samsung S3 or Note or Note 2! If the 12 megapixel cam is a must have, then you'll be sacrificing the other features and apps. Personally, I'll be ditching the N8 for the Samsung Note 2 and I'll have no problem spending the extra $375 for it unlocked! As far as the cam, 8 megapixel may or may not be a significant difference in quality than 12 but at least the Note 2 will have both a rear and front facing lens!

I'll start off buy saying that 2 weeks ago this phone completely died on me (wouldn't turn on, wouldn't charge). After this fiasco not only am I completely disappointed with the phone itself but I am just as disappointed with Nokia customer service. After waiting a long 2 weeks for a new phone they didn't even send me a proper refurb. They sent me a \"new\" phone with my old casing on it. Seeing as my old username was stored on there I am hesitant to even believe the inside of the phone itself is new. As an Apple employee (I should have an iPhone I know) this is ridiculous seeing as we replace customer's nonfuctional phones with new ones or refurbs that are like new. Not to mention the fact that the woman I spoke to on the phone was completely unsympathetic about my problem. Having paid over $400 for their crap product I feel as if though I should have received some better treatment. Especially since this is a know problem (I know someone else who's N8 has completely died on them) and Nokia has refused to address it I should have received better treatment. As for the phone itself, it is hardly worth the money. The operating system is slow, with many glitches and errors that are annoying and would be simple to fix. The camera is nothing special (the biggest reason to get the phone) at night. Night pictures look like pictures taken with any old cell phone. My friend with an Android gets better night shots than my N8. This phone is completely uncompatable with Macs except for the use of iSync (thank you Apple) which just adds to my frustration. The apps are no where near what is available for iPhones or Androids. Overall, this phone is not worth the money at all.

However, I just picked up this phone to do some testing as we're researching the viability of porting an App to Symbian (for a world-wide audience) or whether to wait for Windows to arrive at Nokia. And, wow. Holly crap, Symbian just hasn't come very far. The UI is just.. amateurish, its terrible. Absolutely terrible. After working with the iPhone and Android handsets, its hard to work on this piece of junk. I can't believe that people actually like this phone. Sorry, but I suspect those that do just haven't owned an Android or iPhone. Hell, even the Blackberry handsets are better than this.Now I understand Nokia's move to partner with Microsoft. I think Nokia is a sinking ship, and I seriously doubt bringing Windows to their phone will help given the dominance of Android/iOS/Blackberry. I suspect Nokia will kill Symbian and probably stick Windows 8 (once its ready) on their phones. I think they should have gone with Android, personally.But.. to be fair, the hardware is pretty good. Very good camera, it feels good to hold and is very light. Normally when phones are this light they feel cheap, but the metal case helps it feel solid. Screen is ok, at 640 x 360 its not exactly hi-res. But, crappy processor (680MHz Arm), in the age of dual-core 1GHz processors is like bringing a knife to a gun-fight.If they drop in a better processor, better screen and use Android OS then this phone might be able to compete.
