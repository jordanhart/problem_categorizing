{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works with Consumer Cellular", "Author": "djk1940 \"Don\"", "ReviewID": "R1YGSA7A9ZQLL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to upgrade my Motorola Bravo (purchased through Consumer Cellular) to an Atrix 4G, but no one would confirm that it was fully functional on thier network...with the ability to use their data network being at issue.  Consumer Cellular doesn't require a data connection for smart phones, allowing the use of wif-fi instead; however they offer a small 3G data package at a low price...for those times you happen to not be near a free wi-fi.Because I already had one of their phones, I was able to add a \"New APN\" through the phone's menu (Settings, Wireless & networks, Mobile networks, Access point names, menu) by coping what was in the Bravo phone.  Here is how one needs to fill those fields in:Name: Consumer CellularAPN: att.mvnoProxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.comPort: 80MMSC:[...]  Amazon doesn't allow a web-link in their reviews, but that is required here.  See below for some hints.MMS proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.comMMS port:  80MCC:  310MNC:  410APN type:  default,mms,supl,agps,fotaAPN protocol:  IPv4For the fields not listed above, they are left \"<not set>\".  The MMSC web-link above includes the words \"mmsc.cingular.com\", after the usual \"http...\",Getting voice connections only required removing the sim card from the Bravo and putting it in the Atrix.So far, I'm very happy with this phone, with the Atrix being an improvement over the Bravo, having a better camera with a flash, faster processor, more memory, an added rear-facing camera, slightly larger screen, and the Gingerbread 2.3 OS.  After 3 weeks of using the phone, I have never had to reboot it, as I sometimes did with the Bravo's 2.2 OS.I've now purchased the AT&T; Laptop Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G - Retail Packaging, the Motorola Standard Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G, and the Motorola HD Multimedia Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G-Motorola Retail Packaging and found a use for each. The standard dock turns the phone into an excellent, inexpensive clock and radio for my desk.  On trips, I'll always take with me the Laptop Dock.  Although it doesn't have the full capability of a laptop, it is so close that at times I could not tell the difference; yet it is so small and light weight that I'll certainly enjoy the convenience of it...plus it boots up much faster than a laptop.  I found that I could attach the Multimedia dock to my TVs and use their large screen as my monitor, but you need to purchase a HDMI to HDMI Type D Micro Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 M).  The included bluetooth mouse and keyboard and also work with the lapdock, especially the mouse making a nice accessory for it.  The USB ports on the two docks provide added capability to the Atrix 4G, including the ability to use any USB/wireless mouse. Both the lapdock and multimedia dock allow watching web-based video on a larger screen; however, there is a noticeable, but acceptable (if it is your only option) uneven motion in the video.  However, both video, music and photographs stored in the phone play very well from the phone onto the TV, with the phone making a very nice control device.Now if I can only find a use for the Motorola Vehicle Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G with Rapid Car Charger - Retail Packaging...Update: A reviewer on another site pointed out that \"older SIM cards (maybe 3-4 years old)\" may also need to be replaced with a newer SIM card for the data connection to work.  After 3 months, my Atrix 4G continues to work great, with the Standard and Laptop Docks being my \"must have\" accessories.Update2: Be careful and not get the international version of this phone....I could not get it to work with Consumer Cellular.  I purchased a 2nd phone for my wife from Unlocked CellPhoneKings (recently changed their name to Breed), and they shipped the the only version they said they had in stock...the international version.  My first Atrix 4G also came from CellPhoneKings.  The international versions comes with a Great Britain Plug, an adapter, and an Android 2.3.4 operating system  (vs 2.3.6 for the US version).  I could not get it to work with Consumer Cellular which doesn't support international use on their network.Update3: I've had this phone for nearly a year and not only do I continue to be satisfied with it, my wife now has one and I have expanded how I use mine to include the use of the Motorola Vehicle Dock for Motorola ATRIX 1 4G with Rapid Car Charger - Retail Packaging.  This dock makes for a very nice hands free cell phone system for my car that can also quickly convert to a GPS or source of music, even without Bluetooth built into the car.  I've mounted the dock to the car with the i.Trek IG-PSTARA Garmin Nuvi Sticky Mount, used the BlackBerry ACC-41596-001 Music Gateway - Retail Packaging - Black as a Bluetooth link, and the Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter for SD Card, USB Stick, Mp3 Players (iPod, Zune, Sansa) with Remote Control to transmit the music to my radio.  I'm now convinced I'll be happy with my older car for many more years.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3VUBW58Y5D026", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unlocked and very nice.

Blake \"NMGliderPilot\"", "ReviewID": "RM7K2L2WOWEXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had many phones, but this thing - for the money - is the best!  The dual-core processor rocks on - you won't be waiting on this phone to run your apps!  The voice commands are awesome, the screen is bright and very vivid, storage is awesome and the feel of the phone lets you know you are holding a Motorola - not some cheapo plastic toy phone!  The only thing that is a bit rough is battery life, but if you are used to having a fast phone, you already know that comes with a price in battery life.  I can only go one day on a charge, but I'm a heavy-hitter on the apps and Internet usage and I'm used to that no matter what phone I use.  I gave this thing 5 stars because I couldn't give it 6 or more!  That's how much I love it.  I do highly recommend that you get the standard dock for it as that sure makes a nice bedside alarm/charging station that you just drop the phone into.  Get it - you'll love it as I do!", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Johnny Perez", "ReviewID": "R9QC5LA119NEV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to confess that I was pretty nervous with this buy, since I wasn't sure about the many positive reviews that this phone had.

First the down volume button stopped working. Then the Camera burn out after heating the phone ridiculously for about 3 days in a row. Then battery problems, it keeps shutting off, or the amount of battery left fluctuates without anything being done to the phone. All of this started happening after the first month of normal use. In the end I got myself another phone. I contacted them and their only response was that she didn't know anything about it, that I should send it so one of their technicians could evaluate it.

After two months it was working perfectly and so I decided to buy one.After 4 months of not extremely heavy use the phone shut down and wouldn't turn on by the life of me.

The battery won't charge past 85% despite the calibration thus the stats wont refresh. Its constantly forcing apps to shut down. Its really frustrating.
