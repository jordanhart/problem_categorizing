THIS PHONE DOES REQUIRE A SIM CARD.  You can get a SIM card by calling ATT, and you only pay for the shipping.  If you walk into an ATT store, the SIM card is free.  I had no problem activating my BB 8310 Curve at the ATT store.(If you want to use Verizon as your carrier, you want the Blacberry 8330 Curve model.)I am in my 50's, and own a small, client-based business.  I travel weekly or daily, and need a reliable cell phone with good speech clarity and coverage, and a little more versatility than my flip phone.I love my IPod touch 5, but owning the IPod 5 has made me realize that I do NOT want to upgrade my flip-phone to an IPhone or anything similar...lol.  Since I can browse the web with my IPod or mini,  I don't need easy internet browsing to be a factor in choosing my business's cell phone.  But, I DO need a 'business workhorse', with great speech clarity, reliability, and easy email and texting.  And I wanted an actual, back-lit, qwerty keyboard.After doing a bit of research online, I decided on a Blackberry 8300 series Curve. ( I decided to try it out with a used one from a reliable seller with a return policy. )  My work cell phone is not used daily, so I chose to use ATT's GO Phone service while I try out the BB 8310 phone and the carrier range.  I pay only for the days I use the service.  This plan limits my access to data services, but so far I have rec'd text messages just fine.  The voice clarity and coverage in my rural area has been great here in Northern California.This phone feels great in my hand for use, charges quickly, and has a lot of accessories available.  Repair parts also seem easily available online, and the tools for installing, too.  As mentioned above, I ordered a used one to see if I liked the phone.  I used a seller with high ratings and a return policy/warranty.  (I was even able to find one in red.)  I feel that I found a great bargain.The camera works fine for a phone camera  (esp when compared to a flip phone!). It's not high resolution, but my IPod5 has camera, too, if I need better resolution.  I am trying out all of the bells and whistles BB was so famous for, and will update this review of the ATT model BB 8310 Curve phone after I have a chance to try out more of the data services, etc..The trackball works fine, and the auto on/off function works fine when I slide the phone in and out of the holster.  (I use the BB synthetic leather holster that Amazon sells as an ad-on item, with a BB skin case on the phone itself.)I have noticed that the voice dialing command feature understands my spoken words better than does SIRI on the IPod5.Overall, it's a really nice phone, with a LOT of memory and capabilities.  And these are really inexpensive these days, even if purchased new.  I like the fact that Blackberry is a North American company, too.I liked this 8310 Curve phone  so much, that I bought an unlocked Blackberry 8830 Curve Verizon phone to use with at home with our Verizon carrier!  (No red, though...I had to settle for pink.)", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Trying out the SECOND BB Curve  sent", "Author": "Classic City Cockatiels \"Classic City Tiels\"", "ReviewID": "R3JN6V3IQ20L6E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Mixed feelings..first one sent did not charge, My repair shop looked at and saw was broken charge port,could not replace it.

He already had a T-Mobile sim card from a flip phone, but hated texting on it.  First, his address did not open up in the Blackberry.

Since this phone was advertised as a unlocked phone, and the person purchasing it would be using an already existing sim card, THAT GPS THAT NEEDS WI-FI WOULD NOT BE LISTED AS A FEATURE. As far as I can tell, that means the GPS won't work either without a monthly package from T-Mobile.
