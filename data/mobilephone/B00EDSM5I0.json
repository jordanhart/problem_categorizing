After spending nearly a month with multiple retailers and dealing directly with AT&T; I was informed the phone could not be unlocked as whomever had it before had already exceeded the maximum number of \"unlock attempts\" for this device for a one year period which is 6.  I'm sure the phone would be great and is the music player and wifi worked beautifully, but it turned out to be a $200 paperweight for my daughters birthday.  The phone has been returned and fortunately the seller is going to also refund my cost of shipping for this inconvenience.  Other than that I can't rate the functionality of the phone and many of it's features.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "The phone not work.", "Author": "ernesto santos", "ReviewID": "R1BXDZGMBIF2HH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone not turn on. coming broken, and open box , It is not the phone I specter to arrive.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "It looks great, works fast", "Author": "Amanda Isaac", "ReviewID": "RASI5D5625ZJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the phone.

It was well refurbished and I've yet to find any problems with the device. It was also unlocked so I didn't have any problems on that end. I popped in my tmobile micro sim and was ready to go. Fast, simple, perfect. :)Now let me talk about the shipping though. It was shipped quickly once the order was placed, but there were problems with the delivery. Boy was it frustrating. The package was shipped through USPS, and boy was that a nightmare for me. It was suppose to arrive yesterday, and it didn't. You know what I found in my mailbox instead.....a \" sorry we missed you\" slip! I was home all day, waiting for the package to arrive like a hawk. Never did I hear a knock, nor doorbell ring for the package. I can see it all now. The lazy bum probably didn't want to walk down the street to my door to have me sign for the package. I bet this happens a lot. They figure, \"Hey, most of the time if I leave this slip, they'll just go get the package themselves at the post office, so I'll do just that.\"  >-<!!!!!!I decided to let it slide and just re schedule a delivery to let them know I don't plan on going to pick it up. So what, I do is, go online and re-schedule a delivery for today. I got my confirmation email yesterday that I'd get it today, and boom I was done....or so I thought. I waited for the mailman today and soon as he stopped by the mailboxes and left the mail, he left to the next mailboxes down the street. Seeing that he didn't come to my house, I was furious! >-<!!!I ran out the house and chased the guy where I confronted him about my package. He told me it wasn't him yesterday and it was a different mailman working that day. So I asked him where my package was, ( being that I had it re-scheduled to be delivered today ) and he tells me he doesn't have it.......................>.<......!!!!!Ay ya yayyy!Long story short ( even thought the story was long )I ended up going to the postal office today myself, and picked up it.USPS...why....just why....Anyway, sorry about my rant. Back to the phone, I appreciate the fast shipping, and \"just as describe\" iPhone.It actually came in better condition than I expected. That I liked. Like I said before, everything works and I couldn't be happier.I'll update my review in a couple of months to see whether or not this use/refurbished phone lasts.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$289.95", "Features": "Apple iPhone 4 8GB White Factory Unlocked", "Name": "Apple iPhone 4 8GB 3G White - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UnYrBwozL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EDSM5I0"}}
