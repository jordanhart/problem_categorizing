{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "richyboycaldo", "ReviewID": "R1YGBNQ57WV50Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that I waited  for this phone since it was announced in  december.The Good:Screen: The display is better than mi friends Galaxy S III ppi  is 316!! almost on par with iphone 5, and the AMOLED display colors are amazing.Speed: I haven't encountered any problems with the phone so far. 1 gb of ram is more than enought for widgets, background running aps and games (I haven't tried any heavy 3D games)Looks: The phone looks and feels  great, you can feel the quality, and for a price of 300.00 it can't be beat (with dual sims)Camera: Camera is OK,  the led is powerful, but sometimes the pictures looks too white/blu  because of the LED, specially on closer pics.The Bad:Battery: If you check your phone and play all the time, your battery will not last a day. its only 1600 so  have a charger in handAndroid: It comes with android 4.0 and you CANT upgrade it to 4.1 or 4.2Verdict:This is the best dual sim phone in the Americas market. I have 1 sim on at&t; and another on telcel mexico. the extra 500 mb RAM over the vivo 4.3 are well worth it.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "BLU 4.65 -> A good dual SIM phone", "Author": "Paquirissamy \"P radja\"", "ReviewID": "R1KPRO7JYW2E3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good point:For me, the main point is the dual Sim (for those who have a professional and personnal line) always available and ready.the performance is really good. No lag or freeze. Really fast, more than the Samsung galaxy S2 (I can compare with my wife phone)Really slim and good grip.Screen size perfect for the daily usage.Luminosity and color are beautiful. (HD of course)the battery can stay 2 days without charge, depending your usage, of course.Conclusion:Have a good phone with good performance, good finishing and dual sim is really uncommon. But this one is the good oneBad point:-USB plug is on the top . Not user friendly-At the minimal level, the speaker is still loud.-No specific cover.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Luis Henrique S.

It has Android 4.0 (ICS, Ice Cream Sandwich) installed and all features work very well.  Battery life is reasonable and the processor/graphic speed is more than acceptable.I got this for my daughter as a low cost alternative to a locked phone from a major carrier who charges a hefty monthly fee.  She uses it with PlatinumTel (Ptel) prepaid service.  The price of the phone was very reasonable and for the most part she has Wi-Fi available.  That coupled with Google Voice and Talkatone gives her access to free phone and text services.  She uses Ptel when she's away from Wi-Fi and the resulting total cost is very reasonable.  (BTW, I do the same with my Google Nexus 4 phone.)  I like the bright and vivid display of the Blu Vivo 4.65 HD much more than that of my Nexus 4.There are two drawbacks to this phone:1) There is no Android update available and I don't believe there ever will be.  You will be stuck with ICS forever - unless maybe you install a hacked update.2) There are no hard or soft molded cases for this phone.  Reasonably-priced screen protectors are only available from Germany.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it but...", "Author": "Robert G. Brooks", "ReviewID": "R2Z50HBE3JZNLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I rated this phone 4 stars because of the battery life. You can actually watch the battery drain as you use it. OK I'm exaggerating but honestly, a full charge last about 8.5 hours with the phone idle and if you never use it. If you use the phone frequently throughout the day you're looking at about 5-6 hours before the next charge is needed. Aside from the atrocious battery life the style and design of the phone is very good, if you can overlook the USB charging/data port being on top. The display is near excellent and the touchscreen very responsive. Other features of this phone puts it above or on par with other phones priced a little higher. What is a good selling point is the dual SIM feature and 8 megapixel camera, if these features are important to you. If this phone had a better battery life and NFC I would not have any problems giving it 5 stars.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just perfect", "Author": "Gizo Tsertsvadze", "ReviewID": "R3BCAQPEU75BT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is best for this price, and is best not for just this price.Phone is working perfectly and  capability of dual sim is excellent", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gret Smarthphone", "Author": "Hector L.
