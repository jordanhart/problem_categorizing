{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best of both worlds", "Author": "KSBAY", "ReviewID": "R3I43S4I5G47A4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "2012 called. It said it wanted it's triple duty device. Kept saying that it wanted a phone, a tablet and a notepad all in one or else.....Luckily, Samsung answered.The mobile phone / tablet market seems to be heading towards touchscreen only devices, styluses not included. Market leaders seem to have forgotten that some of us like to \"write\" instead of type. By limiting their input methods, they're forcing us to adapt to them, not making their products adapt to us. The Galaxy Note is a product that goes in the opposite direction. It allows you the flexibility to use it the way you want, whether you prefer to type, write or touch.I've purchased it unlocked and since I bought it, I leave my cell phone and tablet at home. I no longer need to carry them round. It was a hassle carrying around my tablet + a stylus for writing notes, my laptop for all the other stuff and a cellphone to make calls. The Galaxy Note replaced my tablet and cell phone in one easy swoop, with no adjustment issues. I still carry my laptop though ( for more demanding work)As a product, to me. the Note makes perfect sense. A 1280 x 800 resolution(285 pixels per inch - high pixel density) 5.3 inch SuperAMOLED screen ( bright, colorful, sharp ), makes The Note the perfect size for for quickly jotting down notes as well as carrying with you. Games and videos look brilliant on the 5.3 inch screen. Reading E-Books is fun and you don't have to squint to make out words like on a regular phone.Some reviewers have claimed that the phone isn't portable, that's not true. It fits easily in my pockets. I wear regular jeans though, not super skinny stop blood flow to my organs jeans. The Note is 178 grams, has a sleek profile and doesn't weigh you down.It's backed by other high end features like a dual core 1.4 ghz processor, 16 gb inbuilt memory + a micro SD card slot (Compatible with 32gb cards) GSM cell phone capabilities, 8 mp rear camera (1080 capable at 17mbps bitrate - clean crisp video), 2 mp front camera, and most importantly, the S - Pen. This makes the G-Note a capable notepad replacement. Need to jot down an idea quick? Make a shopping list? It's easy with the S-Pen. The S-Memo app that was specifically designed for taking notes with the S-Pen is smooth and responsive. It's perfect for using in conjunction with the S-Pen to write stuff down. However, in case you don't like the S-Memo app, you could download for your G-Note from the Amazon android market, apps like CATCH and SKITCH. Both are free, support the S-Pen and are great note taking / annotation tools.Battery life is brilliant, considering the screen and processor powering the G-Note it easily lasts for a 2 days if used heavily (Web browsing, emails, phone calls,Note taking, games) and goes up till 3 days if you stick to non-demanding activities such as phone calls and web browsing.Some of the \"real world\" ways in which I've used this phone areClick a photo, jot down notes on it, send it to an interior designer.Make annotations to an email.Jot down drawings.Write a shopping list.Make a Travel Expense planSurf the internet (with flash enabled on demand ) so if I want to watch a flash video, it's up to me. Not anyone else.Edit photosMake phone / Skype video callsRead Kindle booksConnect it to a PC monitor through a (MHL) USB to HDMI adapter and used a bluetooth keyboard to type out emails and watch movies. (Just for the heck of it - considering the G-Note has the specifications of a top of the line notebook from a few years ago, I wanted to test it out. If you feel like doing the same, you'll need a Menotek Micro USB to HDMI MHL Adapter for Samsung Galaxy S2, HTC Evo 3D, HTC Evo 4G Tablet, HTC Sensation 4G, Sprint Epic 4G Touch, Galaxy Nexus )For me, the Galaxy Note shows what Samsung is capable of and what other companies should / could do if they weren't too scared of giving a customer a complete product instead of making him buy 2 products to do the job of one. Brilliant engineering, great design and a solid, flexible product that takes the place of two products in one easy move. In my opinion, in 2012, this is truly, the best of both worlds. Pocketable, portable, capable and fast. I no longer feel the need to buy an iPad2 or a Galaxy Tab 10 or any other tablet. The Note goes with me everywhere, in my pocket and does whatever I need it to do. It definitely gets my vote for best mobile phone / hybrid tablet for 2012.

US Warranty? and etc.", "Author": "D. C. Eaton", "ReviewID": "R2TREUKJXVKE5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review was originally for the US Warranty Note, but when Amazon stopped claiming a US warranty, they renamed it the International Version. I will try to update this review from time to time.New update 3/22/12 at bottom of review.WarrantyIs it a Samsung warranty?  A previous reviewer called Samsung and their rep said it isn't, but did their tech rep have correct information?HassleFreeCell says they provide a 90 day warranty.So I chatted with an Amazon rep, and he was quite clear, but did he know anything?  You will have to judge.Here is his reply:You are now connected to Deepak from Amazon.com.Me:Concerning Samsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000 Unlocked Cellphone--US Warranty (Blue)What are the warranty details? Is this a Samsung warranty?Deepak :Hello, my name is Deepak. I'll be happy to help you.Me:OKDeepak :yes.  it will be honored by the manufacturer.Me:Is it a one year warranty?Deepak :Yes.Me:That is all. thank you.Deepak :Thanks for visiting Amazon.com. We hope to see you again soon. Happy Holidays!ColorThe phone back is a dark navy blue.SizeThe phone fits easily in all my pants pockets (jeans and dress).  The HTC Amaze feels like a brick in my pocket, and the Samsung Note is slightly heavier, but feels MUCH lighter - maybe this is because it is so thin.  It fits in my medium size man-hands, but I would not want it any larger.  I have never dropped a phone, but I am worried for the first time (see Cases, below).ScreenBig and beautiful.  What else can I say?StylusThis was a main reason I got this phone because I always used a stylus for typing accuracy on my old Palm (4 inch screen) and my Sony P1i (2.6 inch screen).  When I tried out phones with 4.3 inch screens I was not able to type accurately.  Surprise!  I find that I can type as fast with my finger since the 5.3 inch screen is so big, and I can go slightly faster with Swype.  Voice recognition is much better than I expected and for everyday words is the fastest method of text entry.  So my stylus sits unused.Clock appA Samsung clock app comes with the phone.  It is not well documented that you are required to select the icon at the top right of the screen to prevent the screen from timing out.  The clock allows a pre-alarm of nature sounds to help wake up.FM RadioAt least this version of the Samsung Note does have an FM radio and here in Indianapolis it receives about 30 stations.  Correction: It DOES have RDS (I just had it turned off), and you can rename stations.  As with all phones, headphones are required to act as the antenna.HeadphonesThe note comes with a set of ear-bud phones with microphone. Ear-bud phones depend on a good ear seal which can vary from person to person.  I get a good seal and I find them adequate for casual listening.StandsBoth the \"iZel Innovative Hands-free Stand\" and the \"iCarpus Stand\" fit the Note and hold it securely on a bedside table.  The Motorola wall charger works well, but is larger than the Samsung charger.CasesI first bought a cheap TPU case and was disappointed with the thin non resilient plastic which I think won't provide enough protection if dropped.  I then bought a TPU Gel case - the kind with an \"S\" design on the back.  Despite the name, this is not resilient either, but it has rough edges on either side to give a much better grip to prevent dropping. I have now changed to a Armor Dual Layer Cover sold by DayDeal.com.  It has a hard plastic outer layer and a soft silicone inner layer with extra protection on each corner, and it is very elegant with a red back and black accented sides.  This should give significant impact protection, but it is slightly bulkier than the TPU cases although it still fits in my pockets.Phone PlanThis is a GSM phone so it will only work with T-Mobile and AT&T; here in the US.  It has been claimed that AT&T; apparently will work with 4G data on this phone.  T-Mobile's frequencies currently allow only 2G data (but it has been reported that with the failure of the AT&T; takeover, T-Mobile may gain access to 4G data).  However, consider if you need data.  At home, work and almost every hotel I have access to wifi, and I use a TomTom for directions.  Since I don't use a lot of voice minutes, I happily use T-Mobile prepaid (pay as you go).  The 100 dollar prepaid card (1000 minutes/text messages, but no data) is good for one year and as long as I buy a new card before the end of the year, the minutes roll over.Update 1/5/12 (10 days use):  I still think that this is the best phone for someone who needs a large screen.  The only bad thing I can say is that I find the phone slippery, but with a case this is not a problem.  Battery life has been better than I expected - great.  I typically make a call, check email numerous times and view the internet for 1 hr.  I have gps enabled.  Also I am in a weak cell signal area which increases the power draw on the battery.  I write this as I am plugging it in for the night and the remaining battery is still an amazing 79%!  The only time I had a problem was when I had installed and then deleted several apps.  I thought that everything was OK until several hours later I discovered I had only 8% battery remaining (I shut it down, charged it and then restarted and everything was again fine).Added 5/23/12:  Watch out for battery apps!  I had a battery app that quickly drained my battery. Other apps that have caused battery drainage problems for me are pedometer and compass apps.  I deleted them.Update 1/13/12:Why get an unlocked phone?This decision is best based on individual circumstances.  In my case I mostly email and don't call or text much.  In fact I can get by on a $100/1000 min prepaid card for a whole year.  I find that I can use wifi for all my data use (at home, at work, at Meijer food stores, at my Honda dealer, at my Dad's house, etc).  Let's say that AT&T; has a contract price of $300 for the Note, and suppose you decide to get the AT&T; Note on contract.  So lets compare costs between you and me . . .You:$300 Samsung Note contract AT&T; cost + (per month) $40 voice + $25 2G data + $20 texts + $10 taxTotal for first year = $1440Total for second year =$1140Me:$750 Samsung Note phone + 100/1000 min + free wifi where I can find it (most places).Total for first year = $850Total for second year = $100Note:I have effectively paid off my phone in less than one year (compared to you) so I could throw my phone in the trash and buy a new phone next year while you are still stuck on a 2 year contract!Of course, the numbers will vary depending on the person, so you will have to calculate the difference based on your circumstances.Edit 1/19/2012There may be a BIG PROBLEM with updates for the US Warranty phone including Ice Cream Sandwich (Amazon no longer sells the so-called US warranty phone).Samsung is DENYING that they will provide any updates for ANY US unlocked phones.For more, see Customer Discussions (at the bottom of this product page below).EDIT 1/27/12Sigh.  I am sad.  I sent the phone back for a refund even though I love it!  It is important to me to be able to upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0), and I have come to the conclusion that Samsung will NOT upgrade any \"US unlocked\" phone.  If I decide to get the AT&T; version of the Note then I will have to sign a 2 year contract.  Because of the confusion concerning Samsung support for this phone, Amazon was very good about getting me a fast refund.  5 stars for the phone, 5 stars for Amazon, but 0 stars for Samsung's TERRIBLE US support.EDIT 3/22/12The Note I had was a so-called US version (which Amazon no longer appears to sell), and I never was able to get any updates from Samsung.  However, I noticed that some other Amazon reviewers claimed to have gotten updates, but they all had international import phones.  So I decided to try again.  This time I ordered from an Amazon store, PVCS 110-220 Electronics.  They shipped so fast that I got the phone before getting the \"phone has shipped\" notice!  Good thing I happened to be home to sign for the phone when the UPS man arrived. The phone box was sealed, but with an electrical converter plug in the package - a good sign.After putting in the battery and SIM card and turning it on, the intro screen was in German with 2 buttons at the bottom.  Luckily, I know enough German to realize I needed to press the right button to change languages.  I then went to settings to enter my wifi password, and immediately a notice came up telling me an update was available for download from Samsung!  HOORAY!  I am happy again.EDIT 6/2/12My Note has just been updated to Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  It was not as big an improvement as I had thought.Battery usage on the phone has been great (75% at the end of the day with light usage) for the most part.  However, about every 2 weeks the phone runs through its battery in about 6 hours even when only in my pocket (even with Android 4.0.3).  It may be due to an app, but I can't figure out which one.EDIT 7/10/12I am convinced that Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich)is NOT as efficient with battery usage as Gingerbread.  I still can go a whole day with light usage, but sometimes I am down to 30% after 16 hours use.  I have bought some generic batteries in case I run out 3X 2600mAh Battery + Dock Wall Charger for Samsung Galaxy Note i9220 GT-N7000.I also have started using a heavy duty case although it makes the phone much bigger (Super Cover /Silicone Case + Protector Cover) Hard Case for Samsung Galaxy Note i9220/N7000 WHITE.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!  THE BEST!", "Author": "Marla Braverman", "ReviewID": "R17YGII8JI6O6D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As soon as I read about this phone, I was fascinated and kept reading about it for weeks and finally decided to order it from Amazon (European version because it's not in the U.S. yet). I don't mind that I got the European version because I like having the physical home button. I just switched from the Galaxy SII which did not have the physical button and I like this better. I was an iphone user since the day the iphone came out years ago and have upgraded to new iphones every year. I liked it but definitely felt like I missed a lot of the functions I had with my pocket pc's (customization, etc.) If you don't care about customizing or a smaller display, nothing wrong with the iphone. Depends on what you like. A few months ago I switched from the iphone to the Galaxy SII and loved the change. Now a few months later, I switched again because this was the kind of phone I dreamed would be developed eventually. (kind of like the pocket pc's but with phone usage, more storage). Love having the S-pen (stylus) again. It's nice to be able to switch between using fingers and pen, depending on what you are doing.I am female, only 5'2\", small hands and was worried that the phone would look ridiculous. Either I ended up not caring because really who cares what other people think! Or what I really noticed was because I have long hair, when I talk on the phone, my hair is covering most of the phone anyway. I don't think anyone has noticed it looks any larger. I have definitely had friends ask me about it (when I was texting or checking emails) and thought they might wonder what in the world?? But all they have said is \"That is REALLY cool!\" So don't worry about it looking silly, I realized it was a silly thing to worry or think about.So comparing it to the Galaxy SII which I had for a few months, I would say it's pretty similar but larger screen, FASTER, better batter, has the S-pen, no negatives. I liked the Galaxy SII but LOVE this phone! The main thing I didn't like about the Galaxy SII was the battery did not last me all day and this phone does. I would say the battery lasts the same as the iphone, which is all day and then charge it at night. The display (to me) looks exactly like the Galaxy SII. I know they're a little different but I look at them side to side and the Galaxy Note does not seem any less colorful or bright than the SII, and the clarity is better on the Note.My apps that I used on the SII work just as well on the Note. Another thing I was worried about.If you're thinking of this phone and worried about the size, I\"m telling you, I am very small and absolutely ADORE the size. I want to play with this phone ALL THE TIME! It's a lot of fun and when I look at everyone's iphones now, they look teeny and drab.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "after 2 months of use.. the good and the bad...", "Author": "Dimitri Suraweera \"Dimi\"", "ReviewID": "R1MGL1E4EO7D9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after reading all the reviews I decided to settle on the Galaxy note eventually after much debate between this and the iphone...I bought it in early February and got it shipped to the UK as it was cheaper buying here in Euros than getting it on Amazon.co.uk. I've been using it extensively for the last 2 months. Other reviewers have made plenty of comments on the various features so i will try and keep that in summary form. I always want to know what's bad about a product when I buy it so I've focused more on mentioning the bad. However despite some of its shortcomings it is still the best phone I've ever used - the good outweighs the bad by miles.I must say that I travel between two coutries a lot and in my home country (Sri Lanka) I use this purely as a tablet with a sim that is only active for data. The other half of my time (I spend around 10 days every month in Bangladesh) I use this as my local mobile phone for calls and internet/email. However I donlt get that many calls on this when in Bangladesh compared to my regular phone.Please note that unless specified otherwise I am using all the `stock' programs for things like email that came with the Note.Firstly, what's great about it:1. Screen - excellent - the perfect size for reading emails, web browsing and especially great if you use it to read work related attachments such as spreadsheets because the screen size menas you have less scrolling around to do and the text is crisp and clear. I honestly cannot see and difference in resolution on this compared to the iphone's retina display although 'technically' the retina display has a higher resolution. If anyone can actually tell the difference i@d probably be willing to bet a lot of money that to the naked eye the difference is inconceivable. In terms of colours i think the colours on the note are actually brighter and more vivid.. but i might just be a bit biased here2. Watching Videos - Simply Awesome resolution and vibrancy etc. I've got a few HD videos which I've watched on it and it is awesome3. Wi-fi hotspot  - Just love the fact that I can share the data connection4. Kies Air - Samsung's excellent tool that allows you to transfer anything on to your phone form any laptop over the air (without the need for any cables).5. The Visidon Application (free) - this app uses your fornt camera to allow you to selectively lock certain apps using face recognition. Yes, I too was sceptical and thought that it would take a long time to recognise your face. However in bright light it takes less than half a second to do the facial recognition. It is a problem in low light but it has a password override feature. Now I give my phone to friends with no qualms - safe in the knowledge that they can play around with it, browse the net, watch youtube videos.. but cannot go and put in silly Facebook updates on my behalf because I have locked access to the facebook app. Because it allows you to select which apps you want to lock it is great. Even settings and things like access to your photos and files can be locked in this way. A must have app!!6. Contacts integration with FB and Gmail - works like a charm. I have phone numbers of people on FB and everything gets updates as long as they update their profile. It also logs activity of that person so you know what you've been doing with them.7. Portability - it is excellent to have something that is equally good as any tablet that I've used always on you. It just fits in your pocket and stays with you. Simply great!Neutral:1. Phone size - donlt believe anyone who says its too big. I've got just a 32 inch waist, am 5'10\" tall and weigh 68kg... so not a big person and the phone fits perfectly well in all the trouser/jean pockets that I've worn. ZERO discomfort. Once you've got used to the screen size on this baby you simply cannot go back to a smaller screen.2. Camera quality - is excellent in low light but I found that the iphone's quality is better. Not a problem for me because I rarely use it for snapshots and when I want good pictures I use my dslr.. not my phone! Works great for scanning business cards and even paper/magazine articles and advertisements.3. S-pen - I've used it a few times and was excited about the ability to just write down notes as opposed to carrying a book with me... but unfortunately it isn't that practical to do this. I have used this on occasion to take a photo and scribble on top of this photo (prices of things like floor tiles with an image when I was looking at refurbishing the house). Overall not used as much as I thought I would - I am not into sketching at all!!4. Siri-like voice assistance - not really used this much at all except when driving, but even that was occasionally only. A car with  good navigation/bluetooth system would be able to handle the outgoing calls equally well so this was not a particularly impressive feature for me.Things I don't like:1. In MS Exchange you cannot select which folders to sync it just syncs all your folders I think.  I would have liked to be able to sync every single email in my Inbox and `follow ups' folder. Unfortunately syncing `ALL' (date range) made the phone unusably slow. I have to then settle for syncing it for `one month'. Whilst this is not a major problem it would have been nice to be able to really individually select which folders to sync. I have found paid software available that allows you to do this, but I think the stock application should have catered to this.2. Cannot sync Outlook Notes - The `notes' in outlook just wont sync. I used to use this feature extensively but have now had to stop using it which is a bit of an annoyance. There is talk that ICS will include NOTES synchronisation for Outlook but I've not tested it yet so can't say for sure. For the moment I make do by installing Evernote, which has more functionality overall and also addresses my main need which is to have my notes synced across various devices. But it was still a disappointment3. Calendar doesn't auto sync(I've turned off the general autosync feature for applications) so when I look at the calendar I sometimes forget to sync it and there is a cance you could miss appointments. Not been an issue for me personally because I still get the reminders on my blackberry. But it has prevented me form moving completely away form the BB and using this as my primary phone.4. Email program has an annoying habit of not letting you open the attachments until body of email is downloaded. Sometimes embedded images in email bodies take ages to download especially if the email trail is long and there are 40 emails before it. This really seems silly to me.5. You cannot individually select which applications are allowed to auto sync, this is more a problem with Android than the Note though. I would have ideally like to have said that my Email program and my Gmail program are allowed to sync data automatically but for all other programs I would have preferred to do it manually. As far as I could see you can either ask all to sycy auto or none!6. On a few occasions there was an email or two that simply would not come on to the Note. It was showing on my Laptop in outlook as well as on my Blackberry torch, but it simply would not come on the note until I forwarded it fomr the BB back to myself... then It came!!!7. Battery Life - On the occasions I was using it as a phone cum tablet, the battery seemed to always die before I was ready to go to sleep. Even if you use it as only a tablet for emails and web browsing plus a bit of facebook the battery dies by evening time so i typically need to charge it again when i get back form work. I have found, however that by turning off WCDMA and leaving it only on GSM mode that the battery tends to last longer. The only downside of doing this is that web browsing and especially if you are lookingat youtube videos the speed gets slow.8. Google maps - unbelieveably accurate even in the asian countries I've been using it in like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What a lot of people might not know is that this has an additional GPS technology that allows it to communicate with more satellites than your average phone. (I cant remember what it is technically but imagine that usually you can get only the US satellites, so if you donlt have one close by.. your location accuracy gets affected.. the note has A-GP and Glonass technology which translates to better accuracywhen  pinpointing locations. Also the large screen is a definite advantage here!Conclusion:If there was an iphone with the same screen size would I have bought the iphone instead - most certainly yes!! Why? Because ios is still sleeker and less buggy and some of the apps are better. But, until Apple starts catering to people who actually want to have at least some options as opposed to ONE option in terms of form factor etc I'm sticking with my note! I donlt normally do reviews but this product was so great that I thought others deserved to know!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy This Phone From Global Mobiles/TRD-Trading GmbH", "Author": "BH", "ReviewID": "R3DS2TQ7M95947", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a seller to buy the unlocked International version of the Samsung Galaxy Note from I highly recommend buying from Global Mobiles/TRD-Trading GmbH fulfilled by Amazon.  The phone was brand new and factory sealed unlike some other sellers who try to sell refurbished phones as brand new in an unsealed box with missing components like headphones and power adapters.  My phone was in German when turned on for the first time but not a problem considering the seller was thoughtful enough to leave documentation of how to change languages and set up APNs - very easy to change.  Also, this seller shipped very fast and addressed my questions and concerns.  My phone is excellent - everything appears to be functioning perfectly though I've only had the phone for three days I can't put it down it is such an awesome phone and fun to use.  Unfortunately, Ice Cream Sandwich is not available for this phone but should be coming in the next month or two hopefully.  I also highly recommend an inexpensive thin/non-bulky TPU case made by Diztronic - nice because the buttons aren't covered up which could make pressing them awkward; I also bought a hard candy case from Speck but found it to be too bulky for pockets and the buttons are covered.  I also recommend the Ultra Oleophobic screen protectors from Spigen SGP.  Oh yeah, I put a Straight Talk/AT&T; SIM in the phone and now have unlimited everything for $45/mo!  This phone is not an LTE phone like the AT&T; branded phone, however, with the prepaid provider I have I'm getting up to 2100-4200 kbps down and 300-1700 up on HSPA+, HSPA, or 3G.  Not bad at all!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note GT-N7000: What to expect on Amazon Orders", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2USPA6BF1W0ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "6/4/12After reading multiple reviews and communicating with Amazon via email and phone regarding warranties and upgrades, I ordered the Samung Galaxy Note GT-N7000 International version in Blue. If you go to the main Amazon link below you'll find several options to order, a couple from Amazon Marketplace vendors and one that is sold by and shipping by Amazon with no intermediate vendor involved.[...]At this link, one of the vendors will be featured. The others appear on the right side of the page under more buying choices. The Amazon direct purchase is the one that is priced about $5 higher than the others. When I ordered it was $524.99. The others were $518 to $520.The reason I'm being so specific here is that comments on other reviews show a variety of experiences, claims, and surprizes. Some people received a phone where the language had to be reset to English. Some received a phone that had a separate adapter added to the order to fit the US power receptacle. Some phones went into setup and indicated that an operating system upgrade was immediately available. Claims have been made that the phones have no warranty or a third party warranty. Others claim that phones sold and shipped by Amazon are not upgradeable to Ice Cream Sandwich.Here's what I've learned about the phone I ordered that was sold and shipped by Amazon.Before ordering I had emailed Amazon with the warranty and upgrade questions. Receiving answers from first level reps at Amazon that didn't know what I was talking about I emailed back, whereupon I received an email requesting an evaluation of the service I had received and option to have Amazon call me immediately to answer my questions. I exercised that option and was immediately called by Sergio at Amazon. He said he would have to check with Samsung and called me back again after about a half hour assuring me the Amazon would handle any inquiries I had about warranted problems and upgrades. He followed up with an email, the germane part of which I have included below.Hello,I'm providing a follow-up e-mail to our conversation.As we discussed, if you purchase the Samsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000 Unlocked Phone--International Version you will have a 24 months warranty as long as you are within US.I hope this solution works for you. We hope to see you again soon.Thank you for your inquiry. Did I solve your problem?If you need further assistance, please visit: http://www.amazon.com/helpBest regards,Sergio M[...]So what happened when I received my phone?The phone was received in the original box, which was sealed with the usual stamp.All parts listed as being included were in the box, including a small power adapter with the US prongs. No separate adapter was needed.Included in the box were a small Samsung manual and warranty card, both in Spanish.When the phone battery was charged and it and my SIM card were inserted I turned on the phone and it went directly into the usual welcome screen showing the time and a picture. Having read the full online manual online, I knew about the screen lock and had to unlock the welcome screen by pulling the padlock icon out of the circle to get into the main icon screen. It opened in English. There was no need to reset the language.The online manual says that if it's the first time the phone is turned on it should enter a setup procedure. This never happened.At this point I went to register the product on the Samsung website where I had previously registered a couple other Samsung products, so I logged in with my usual login information. I was asked enter the name or model number of the product. I first enter GT-N7000. The model number wasn't recognized so I entered Galaxy Note and and it listed the model numbers of all the AT&T; versions of the phone (i717) but no GT-N7000. Above the response there was a link to click for products outside the US. Clicking on this presented two available downloads for the Kies softwere, one for MAC and one for Windows.Kies software is Samsung's analog to iTunes, which when installed on your computer allows you keep music, photo, and video files on your phone synced with files on your computer. As with iTunes, it also allows the firmware on your phone to be upgraded as new updates come out.When I installed and ran the Kies software and pluged the phone in the USB port of the computer using the included cable, it installed drivers and identified the phone with no problems. Included on the confirmation screen was a message that the firmware was the latest available, and giving the ID number of the firmware.Now this can mean on of two things: either the 4.0 upgrade to ICS is not available yet on this Spanish phone, which could, for all we know, be going to Columbia or some country way down on the upgrade list, or Samsung may never offer another upgrade. I guess time will tell. But, a least I know how to check for upgrades using Kies.As far as the phone goes, it is everything I expected after exhaustive research. I'm not sure I even need ICS. The phone is very fast and fluid, the screen is great, and all the apps I've downloaded went on without a hitch. It's definitely a keeper.If I don't receive any further updates, I'll take it up with Amazon since they've made a lot of promises that they better keep, or I'll demand it be replaced with the next version coming out at the end of the year. If I recieve the update I'll amend this post to let you know.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "No such thing as a US Warranty", "Author": "Neil H.", "ReviewID": "RQ2MY0PK1LTYB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Galaxy Note is an amazing device and I strongly recommend getting one.

I'm not about to do a review on this phone though I have a ton to say about it, because reviews on this phone are all over YouTube and the internet. So if you are looking to find out more, google for reviews. Instead, I'm gonna talk about some need-to-know before and after purchasing.The phone is big, but fits in most pockets. After using it for 2 weeks, I felt like all other phones are too small on it, even my previous phone (Samsung Omnia II) which was considered as moderately big-sized at the time it came out.Galaxy Note comes with a lot of \"hidden\" features, you need to spend some time messing with it before you can actually experience it's full potential. Good for reading and watching videos for the ginormous, clear high resolution Super AMOLED screen, also music playing is not bad. Gaming is awesome on the huge screen.Accessories are available all over Amazon, unlike my old Omnia II, so you don't have to worry about buying another rare model which you'll have to search and search then spend a fortune on buying just a protective case.After receiving your product, you might wanna check for faulty. For LCD and basic input test, go to \"phone\" and key in \"*#0*#\". Also, check your phone system information and try to register online for full warranty coverage.Note: International warranty provided by Samsung might not be available in the U.S. as I've read from previous reviews. So you might wanna check with Samsung before getting it if this is a big deal for you. Also, the phone I got I think, was shipped from Germany because the default language was in German, however the seller included instructions on how to change the settings. Most languages are available for system and input, except some major ones like Chinese and Japanese. However, there's only German, English, Spanish, French, and Italian for Text-to-speech. But language packs are available on download in Google Play Store, mostly free-of-charge.I especially recommend this phone for users that use phones not only for calling and texting, but also internet browsing, apps, other features. Get a data plan with it if you don't, or else it would be a waste getting this phone without a data plan. Really convenient for social networking and status updates. There's an app called Social Hub that comes with it which merges all your social networking accounts (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.) so you don't have to browse them separately, convenient to use. You don't need this phone if you only use your phone for calling and texting.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wheeeeeeewww! What a Phone!", "Author": "L. Breda \"L.\"", "ReviewID": "R1P76P53PXBJHU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone unlocked international version before it was available in the U.S to use on the AT&T; network. I got it despite the forums stating people where having trouble convincing AT&T; it was a phone and not a tablet, AT&T; was shutting down their data abilities.This phone without data would be pointless. The most genius aspect of this phone is its capabilities as a tablet and a multimedia station for on the go. Here are a list of its strong points--Stunning photographs that can be easily and very effectively edited and annotated right on the device and then shared via email, Facebook, text, or any other outlet you can think of.-The note-taking capability is EXTREMELY useful! If your one of those people (like me) who always keeps their phone by their side you will never have to search for a pencil and paper again to jot down a phone number or a memo.-The keyboard is very easy to use and very responsive. No product rivals Apples iPhone keyboard as of yet but this one comes close just because of the sheer size it makes typing easy and quick. I was bothered by people saying in forums it was too big to type on. If you use two hands and jab with your thumbs its extremely fast. Maybe one handed jotting is a bit difficult but are you really going to type a long email with one hand? Sorry people who text while driving (*disgust*) you will not fair well with this device!-The on the go capabilities are amazing! You can really work on this thing! unlike an iPhone or a droid the screen has enough real-estate to actually accomplish your work. You can also web browse very easily on this device.-It is VERY snappy! The rotation of the screen is quick, opening programs is quick! (also on a side note the drag down bar on the top has a quick button for locking screen rotation which I think is genius!)-If your in a pinch and on the road you can read your kindle content fairly easily on this device, or download and rent a movie on it very quickly!-Beautiful Screen! Wow Samsung knows how to make a nice looking screen! Bright and beautiful!Gosh there are so many pros! I am sure there are more pro's  so I will have to add to this list as they come to mind.Now here are some cons! Even though the device is well polished there are deff problems with the device.-I did have problems with the international device connecting to the HSPA+ network. I did get it connected but it was disappointingly slow. I also encountered problems sending picture messages. Weirdly this didn't happen until a week or so after I started using it. Before then I could sent picture message fine. I think that there are some compatibility issues with the international version on AT&T;, I strongly believe that with the version MADE for AT&T; and with there understanding and backing on the product these issues would all be resolved.-Battery  - this is a pro and a con because the battery was really quite decent. The phone is powerful and has a huge screen to power. If I turned the brightness down it would last but then I lost the beautiful va va voooooom screen I raved about in my pros! I also think because the pen input is so cool, the pictures are so easy to edit and upload, and the web browsing and productivity is so easy on this device you will find you have a hard time putting it down! I think if I had kept the device long enough to actually get so used to it I didn't care anymore and used it like a normal person.... I would have found I got much more out of the battery.-Size -  while I know this is what makes this thing so easy to use, I have to say everywhere I went people said HOLY COW what is that? Its not a phone?!?!?! I hate to be cliche and say what allot of others have said... but it is embarrassing to use as a phone. If I was a 6ft 3 basketball player and had a Motorola Razor it would look pretty silly small..... Well I am 5ft and female so holding this up to my head was comical. I think my mother said I was going to get cancer because it just engulfed my entire head in cancer causing cell phone waves. I found myself embarrassed to admit it was a phone, but I needed to keep my sim in it to send texts and upload videos to Facebook so I just avoided calling people and texted instead. To me any device that causes you to avoid the valuable function it is originally intended for (voice calling) maybe you have the wrong device?-The other con was the flimsy back -  I was scared to go into the back of the phone for fear I would break the back. I think it was more stable than I thought but It made me nervous. This made accessing the memory card nerve racking (I didn't keep it long enough to really care about extending the memory from its standard 16 GB but if I had kept it longer I would have needed more memory for sure ! Common Samsung why give us a device with this much multimedia capability and only 16 GB of internal memory?????)I am SURE just like there are PROS that are slipping my mind there are more CONS that are slipping my mind but  I will have to add them later.I also want to ad that this really is a great great phone. And to people who don't mind the largeness against their ears, or for people who primarily use bluetooth, or for people who mostly text this phone is phenomenal and can replace carrying around a bulky tablet and a cell phone while still maintaining high productivity on the road. I wanted so badly to keep the device as a second phone to my iPhone but other electronics where calling to me so I sold it. I also couldn't get over the loss of iMessage and FaceTime on my iPhone. Apple has such a large fan base that when you try to step out of the mold you will often find yourself incompatible with your friends and family. For me the largeness while talking on the device, the incompatibility with the iPhone (WHICH IS APPLES FAULT NOT SAMSUNGS) and the problems I experienced with the international device all caused me to switch back to my iPhone 4.

The metal roof in my office blocks all signal, but this phone is the only phone at my company that gets enough signal to make calls and receive text, so the receiver seems to be better than most phones. Great battery life compared to my HTC Sensation. I charge the phone every 2 days or more with normal usage. The pen works awesome. It comes with some exclusive apps for use of the pen. The camera and camcorder are great, I have no need to carry around a digital camera.Cons:No notification LED (not a huge deal to me). A really bad con for me is I can only use edge on T-Mobile which gets me around 25KBps, but luckily I'm usually around a Wi-Fi access point. Either way the phone is so awesome the trade off is worth it to me, eventually I may switch to at&t; or hopefully T-Mobile will use another band besides 1700mhz for data.Other Thoughts:It should be getting ICS update soon. The amoled hd display is amazing, better screen quality than the Galaxy S II. The phone is faster and better looking (display quality) than any phone I have owned. I've owned htc sensation, mytouch4g, mytouch3g, nokia 5230.

Yes, if you are living in US, then you won't be able to get 3G/4G/LTE on your GT-N7000 (International version) device. The reason being, in US, the 3G/4G/LET all works on a different bands that this international version doesn't support. I went to T-Mobile shop to get my $60 unlimitted plan with 2GB of data at 4G speed. The freak at the T-mobile shop told me right after buying their sim that this phone won't get 3G/4G speed as it's not compatible at their radio frequency. T-mobile operates it's 3G services at 1700MHZ band which this device doesn't support. If you have AT&T; version of this phone which is unlocked, you may get it working to get the 3G/4G services by hacking the note. But you running the risk of losing your device if something goes wrong. The hack they have right now was not tried in international version of this phone.Correction on 3G/4G: (06/01/2012)====================I have been trying with StraightTalk service $45 unlimitted text, call, data. It looks like I'm getting very good spead about 2.5 mbps to 4 mbps down and 2.5 mbps up. The network status keeps on changing from \"H\", \"H+\", and \"3 G\". So I don't really know if I can see \"4G\" but after some research it appears, \"4G\" is operating on \"HSPDA+\" that shows as \"H+\". So we can safely assume we can get \"4G\" speed if not \"4G\" status. Please note, it's on my note where I live. It could be different in differe places where the service is offered. So yes, it's possible you get resonable speed data on your Galaxy GT-N9000.*On wireless, it's blazing speed! A Monster!I haven't spoke to Samsung or the shipper to know more about this issue, but right now that's what everywhere on the internet.In simple term, if you are living in US, you can buy this device only if you are in love with it.

When I am out with friends and want to show them something on the internet, there is nothing worse than trying to show someone something on a tiny screen, but it isn't worth it to carry around a tablet just in case- for me anyway.  The screen on this phone is beautiful and huge.  This phone is great for showing people things on the internet or documents.  Everyone that sees it agrees that it is a great screen, the biggest concern is the size of the device in its entirety.This phone is comically huge.  Most people (myself included) laugh at the sight of someone holding the phone to my ear.  It looks and feels funny at first, but you get used to it and don't really think about it after a while.  People are also concerned about the portability of this phone.  I find that it fits in my work uniform pockets just fine.  I also carry a purse, so carrying it is no issue.  Men usually have larger pockets (unless they wear skinny jeans) and fitting the phone in there isn't an issue.The stylus is almost a novelty except that it works great!

I am not sure if it is possible for the phone to get downloads at 4G speeds without the upload frequency, but I will say that my internet is faster than EDGE (which is what the phone says I am getting).  I am able to stream videos with no problem and web pages load as quick as they ever did on my old 4G phone.

Love the big, bright HD screen; which is ultra sharp and good size.  The Atrix 4\" screen was too small for my old eyes.  Once you use the Note, you'll never go back to small phones.  I use the Kindle Ap to read ebooks on this and it is as good as our Kindle Touch.  Surfing the web and reading pdf documents is as good as any tablet, without the weight.  I no longer use our iPad for around-the-house web surfing or reading.  Try holding an iPad with one hand for more than a few minutes - doesn't happen (you'll need two hands, your lap or a stand).Positives:- Android - beats iPhone hands down for features & customization ability.  It is much closer to a PC than iPad.- the Note is a phone, tablet and eReader all in one so you just have to carry one thing. And it fits in your (men's) pants pocket.  When I travel now, it's just my cell phone and my laptop.  No more eReaders or tablets.  Best part, get the EasyTether Ap and you no longer have to pay for airport or hotel wifi.- big screen size- bigger screen size = bigger key board.  Much faster typing and fewer mistakes, almost like my old, big blackberries.- faster processor- real 4G speeds!- light weight and easily held with one hand- Samsung features are slightly different than Motorola's.  Some much better.- the pen is great for writing notes to myself (grocery list, etc.).  My kids love it for sketching.When I talk on it, my wife said it looked like I'm putting a calculator to my face.  But one side benefit of the bigger size (btw, very thin) is that the mic is closer to my mouth so I don't have to speak as loudly for the other party to hear me.Negative:  I could not buy this phone from Amazon.com (much cheaper) because of the web based ordering system; which forces one to select a new data plan (instead of keeping my old unlimited one).

I am a tech junkie and that means I love to collect phones and resell them. I have owned in the past: Nokia 6290, KIRF iPhone 4(lol), Samsung Galaxy S II GT-i9100, LG Thrill 4G, Samsung Focus i917, HTC Sensation 4G, Sony Tablet S 32GB. None of these can compare to the mere presence of the Galaxy Note.Build Quality 10/10: Has a very sturdy feel to it, choice of materials is your opinion. It is made out of plastic, but not anything cheap. I prefer the plastic b/c if Samsung had opted to choose a type of metal e.g. aluminum it would feel very heavy and uncomfortable in hand.Call Quality 9/10: Produces some very nice tones and clear vocals. The volume could be have higher volume output, but nothing that would make me hate it.Multimedia 10/10: Witht he Super AMOLED HD screen makes viewing pictures and videos a plus. Even encoded in 1080p videos are smooth and jitters, I don't know why somepeople do this b/c the resolution on the Note is 1280x800 not 1920x1080. Gaming is very smooth thanks to the Mali 400GPU.UI Speed 9/10: Smooth for the most part, but sometimes when switched on to a live wallpaper, it sometimes jitters a bit. Also, when getting an overview of all your items the transition is not real smooth. But everything else like scrolling and launching apps is smooth.Text Input 9/10: The keyboard is standard, nothing great about it. It is a delightful to type with two hands in landscape or potrait, but not with one hand unless you have insanely large fingers lol. I think they could have made better use if they put a number row on top since of the large real estate you get.Battery 9/10: I'm a big battery user and I get 5-6hrs. on it, if you're light user it'll probably last you a day or more. You get a 2500mah battery which is half the amount used in 10.1in. tablets.Internet 10/10: Very fast and of course like any Android out there supports flash. Very smooth and text is easy to read b/c of the WXGA resolution. No lag at all.Camera 10/10: This is a mobile phone is by far one of the best camera out there on a mobile handset. Pictures are crisp and colorful, no graininess well I haven't taken night pictures yet, only in daytime. Video capturing is a very awesome experience too with a smooth framerate in 1080p.Everyday Usage 10/10: Use it everyday.Display: One of the main reasons to get it of not the main reason. The Super AMOLED HD has a resolution of 1280x800 not 1280x720 like the Galaxy Nexus or Optimus LTE(ATT Nitro HD). 5.3in. makes browsing the internet and reading eBooks a pleasure.Overall I'd give this phone a 9.5/10 only b/c of not producing a Super AMOLED+ HD screen since it would look better, but the plus is not to get worked up over. Oh yes, another thing many users including I notice black splotches when putting on a completely back background. Their very tiny and you won't notice the splotches at all if you have other colors around. This is not just the Galaxy Note all other Super Amoled HD devices have it including the Motorola Razr/Droid Razr and the Galaxy Nexus.

Now after my own disastrous experience I am not surprised that 15% of all star-rated amazon reviews are unfavorable (i.e. 20 people gave 3,2,1 stars vs 107 giving 4,5  by end of 2012).  Would you buy an expensive item if you know you had a 15% chance of things going wrong? Here is my frustrating experience:-- FIRST (hardware and poor customer service): Only after a month with my Galaxy note it stopped charging.  Different to Apple, they do not have stores in high traffic locations, instead I drove to my nearest repair center 1h to drop off, 1 hr to collect!) They returned it after 2-3 weeks and the problem hadn't been fixed - still not charging!-- SECOND AND THIRD (hardware and poor customer service): Sent it again (this time by post) to fix the same charging issue. They returned it with very bad scratches on the screen.  I rang not once but 3 times arguing to get the screen replaced.  They were blaming the post man, I was blaming the very poor packaging conditions in which they returned it.-- FOURTH (software/hardware and poor customer service): just as I started to use it again (very disappointed as it had been half the time in repair) I noticed that the back key didn't work.  I was using any app and wanted to go back: impossible needed to switch off and back on. Useless, this is one of the most important keys.  So, sent it again.  Got it back after 1-2 weeks. This time, without the memory stick.  When I rang to ask about it.  They said: \"you should have not sent that we destroy everything\".  (what about sending it back to the customer who is the owner and paid for it?)-- FIFTH and probably not last (software and poor customer service): half way through an email all of a sudden it stops writing (email, sms etc). Horrendous switch off and back on.  I rang and they said:  \"you need to back-up and reset the handset and if it doesn't work, call us again\". I asked for a product replacement or my money back.  They said \"sorry but we can only fix it!\"Samsumg should have better customer services policies (if not able to have a more robust product)Samsung should be ashamed of a product that within a year of having been launched (and 6-7 months of usage) it has been 4 times in repair.When my friends see me with this huge phone they asked whether it is good.  I always say:  NO, do not go close to it. they say, well, at least it makes your face look smaller :)My Ipod Touch and my blackberry are much more robust you can even feel it when you have it in your hands.

The most practical thing is that it is portable tablet that fit in my hand, and I can go with it anywhere and have all my patient drawings in it, with sufficient memory. At the same time, I can put my clinical notes in a folder, along with the patients esthetic information. It is very thin and light and sometimes I don't notice that I have it in my pocket.

Armistead III", "ReviewID": "R2VUCYWMS5L3XP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most of the time I carry around a heavy laptop when all I really need to do is check email, write a simple text document, or do a quick update on my website.  With my Note I can do all that and more.  FINALLY I can ditch the laptop (at least most of the time).  Polaris Office that came pre-installed does most of what I need and Android has dozens of apps available to edit websites.  One of the things that makes this easy is the 5.3 inch screen.  I've been using a 2.5 inch screen on a smart phone for about 2 years and it's just not big enough for more than sending short text messages.  The screen is also perfect for watching movies or TV shows while you're on a long trip.I live in China and just got a 3G account at China Unicom.  The way I understand it, they're the only 3G provider that does WCDMA - a faster version of 3G the Note is designed for.  The speed is decent enough for reading the news and writing short articles on my website (I'd love to know how well this phone works on a 4G network).  One of the other things this phone comes in handy for is Chinese character practice or looking up characters in an electronic dictionary (I recommend Pleco for the serious student).  That's where the screen size comes in handy again and the stylus is a big bonus.  I can't think of any portable device that would work as well even if that's all you used it for.I have a friend who's an amateur artist and has been able to do some AMAZING things with the S Memo app and the stylus.  If you draw/sketch, this is a great phone to have with you.Now that I've just raved about the screen size I'll mention that it has drawbacks.  People have said that it feels like you're putting a small book to your ear and I'd have to agree a little.  It's not bad for a short conversation, but it's a little awkward.  I'd suggest a Bluetooth earpiece with good noise reduction especially if you ride on crowded Chinese buses.  And if you're as clumsy as I am you'll want a decent case with a good grip.  The case itself can get a little slippery and you don't want to drop this one.Battery life is an issue so I'd also advise considering an extra battery or an external battery pack/portable power pack.  The phone will last a good 12 - 14 hours, but don't plan on doing much surfing on WIFI/3G.  If you're not going to be able to plug in every night (train travel in Asia is like that) you'll need something to get you through until your next wall outlet.  I expected this.

So I have experienced a little bit glitch which really did not hurt much. But still, I didn't like not being told ahead of purchase that it'd been \"reconditioned\".Secondly this was a version specifically designed for the Chinese market. It is OK - but there are some popular Chinese apps I would rather do away with but couldn't remove them. Again, it didn't hurt any of my usage, it is just I prefer not to have native Chinese apps pre-installed.Thirdly, this one does not come with Swype keyboard pre-installed! Can you imagine that? What a silly move on Samsung's part. Good news is that there are free apps for that (and better too), so that didn't hurt either.Fourth - my biggest complaint:  it does not provide 3G when I inserted my T-Mobile sim card! Needless to say I was extremely sad about that. Come on, I am not looking for 4G!  But it takes a lot of troubles to get 3G so I kind of just skipped it. Just 2G then, since I am using a lot of WiFi anyway.Now the good things. I am a businessman so I need this for business. Forget a lot of reviews that keeps talking about security and compatibility to MS, etc. Android does not do that so either you buy 3rd party apps or put up with it.Firstly using email.  I tried various apps but K-9 always comes as the first and only choice. With a 5.3\" screen and an S-pen, the Galaxy Note makes emailing so much easier for you when you're not at your desk.  Plus, the powerful CPU makes sending and receiving much faster for you too. Since emailing is almost a number one thing for business people on the go, I have to give it a \"two thumbs up\".Secondly the usage of Skype video and calling. I keep contact with lots of business partness domestically and internationally via Skype, the enhanced camera (both front and back) makes it really good. I actaully can pick up skype calls while I am driving.  Not everyone thinks skype an important thing but I do for business purpose.Third, you can really rely on S-pen to take some serious notes now, and can really leave your ontepad at home. I know you can do this with iPad, but some times, you just don't have iPad near you.  So, here you go! You always have your phone, so you always have your digital notepad.Fourth, the entertainment features (video, game, camera, web surfing, etc) are just wonderful which lots people have written about already. This makes killing time easy (such as waiting for a bus or a flight).Fifth, the battery life is GREAT!  Very heavy users can get through a day fine. I am a medium user (I really don't use web on my phone that much but do watch videos), and by the time I go to bed at 11 PM I still got 30 - 50% juice left. There was a time when I used it really lightly for two days, and didn't charge it during the two days until the 2nd day's night. This is important, business folks.Overall, I have been using it for a couple of weeks and am happy about it.

All that came inside is the quick start guides in english and german. Don't know where in the supply chain the theft occurred. I wonder how anyone could have even known what was inside.  The outside brown packaging has no indication what may be inside...I have informed LASERSHIP management as well about this incident.But I want to caution others who order this...*please* be careful.

This phone will randomly shut off without reason, it will randomly freeze, it will lag.  It's a great idea but the software is just like stepping back in time to symbian or something.  Also, the build quality is pretty cheap.There are also stupid random limitations put forth by samsung like artificially low note lengths, only being able to send notes at jpg files etc.But really... The main problem is the software is just not reliable.Considering the price and supposed quality level, this is a one star phone.  It's not terrible, it's just okay.
