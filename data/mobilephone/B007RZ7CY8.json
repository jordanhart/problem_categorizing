Smoother than a Galaxy S3 with Android. I suspect its because windows phone is C++ while android is Java.

Luckily the cell phone is in fact unlocked and all accessories were included, also the driving and texting can wait sticker was there. I am very impressed on how thin this cell phone is and how fast it is, there is no lag at all.The camera takes awesome outdoor pictures, I mean I own a Samsung TL105 camera and cannot tell the difference. Battery life is good; after 12 hours I still have 66% left (no GPS, blutooth and batery saver on).Had to manually change the APN in order to get internet service running.I very satisfied and still have not found any cons so far.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone", "Author": "Elisha Watts", "ReviewID": "R2NH2F9CZH4WCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift and I love it my old phone dropped calls wouldn't ring glad I have this one", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Sure", "Author": "MK", "ReviewID": "R3H7GBRE65E4IW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product came with an issue.

This unit is showing up as a Blackberry unit, plus the IMEI number accessed via the keypad is \"00000000000\". I am communicating with the supplier but I think that Amazon should be aware of this and step in to do something about it. Changing the IMEI number of a cellphone is ILLEGAL in some countries and the resaons for so doing are suspicious to say the least.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung focus s", "Author": "Vano", "ReviewID": "R2LLO9M90D8QUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i liked this phone, not bed, good. thanks. but if worked this phone win8.0 then it would be excellent.  !", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "could b beter", "Author": "des", "ReviewID": "RZ77QFL4LQDY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It doesn't do all the things I expected being a windows phone  i dislike the not being able to get my free games like candy crush and pet rescue like on my old phone", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Android who/what?", "Author": "bj", "ReviewID": "R1UY225FHTHCT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely love this phone.

Plastic housing, plastic cover, lasted a month before the screen was inoperative. Not due to damage either, too much flex in the plastic body, superficial cracked screen in the LCD display, not on the surface though. Took it out of my pocket and that is what I got. Nice phone if your are a female that is going to lug it around in a purse, but not for a man who is going to put it in his pocket. Get the Flash instead, I have had one for 3 years, been dropped from two stories onto concrete, has hit the pavement a couple dozen times, swimming in mud holes. Takes a licking and keeps on ticking. My advice is to not buy this phone, nice phone, nice features, terrible build quality with no durability. Reminds me of an iPhone, first time you drop it on the floor, its shot. Samsung says \"not a warranty matter\", did not expect they would find it any other way. To me it is a classic case of defect in material which should be a warranty matter.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "its good", "Author": "vipulkumar bhalara", "ReviewID": "R39MTB19J7HLPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its good handy slim light....windows need  more work to be  done,after which it will be perfect. no doubt it.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great buy", "Author": "Tarah Mayers", "ReviewID": "RGMA3YX8W4ZT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone for my son and he totally loves it and it was a great price..
