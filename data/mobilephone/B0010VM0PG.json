This phone is awesome and worth every penny. I actually cannot stop looking and playing around with it. A couple of great things about this phone, you can hear it when it rings also the speaker quality is above and beyond. The camera is excellent! I can actually take photos at night and see them. You will love this phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Terrible phone.", "Author": "Meghan E. Davis", "ReviewID": "RE5BM6K1ZM0J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not buy my phone here and I do not have the pink one, mine is red. But neither of those things affects the problems I have with this crappy phone.This is the worst phone I've ever had. In one year, I've needed 3 replacements. I would have gotten another replacement but the warranty on my last replacement expired. When ATT replaces your phone for you, the warranty is good only for 3 months. Which is horrific for phones like this one that break constantly, but not always before 3 months.The original phone: The receiver died. No one could hear me talk.Second phone: The screen died. It started flashing solid red. Or solid white. Or changed ridiculous colors. Also the pound button (Also the space button) stopped working. And the coating on the keys wore off so you couldn't read them.Third replacement: Space button started dying again.On all phones, things started breaking while sliding the phone. It would get stuck while trying to open. Bits of rubbery adhesive would come out. Something inside pulled up the metal sheeting between the keys on one phone, so I had to clip that off and it looked ugly.I haven't had any phone long enough for the keys to crack, but I knew that was a problem so I was very careful while texting. The call quality is crappy, people can't hear me well and the background noise is ridiculous.I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. And about the only good thing I have to say about it is that it takes decent pictures. I hate the way the music is set up. I hate the bulky connector for headphones and charging.I recently accidentally submerged the phone in water and am relieved that I have an excuse to buy a new phone instead of having to wait until January when my contract renews.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Expensive Services-", "Author": "Martin A Hogan \"Marty From SF\"", "ReviewID": "R3QZ5UOORUNEF1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a slider phone, instead of a flip, so I can have it open on my car's dash and it's slim to fit in any pocket. The buttons are small, but we are all used to that by now. Sure it also has the obligatory camera and video, but it is 2.0 mega-pixels which is better than most. It provides support for \"PictBridge technology\" so you can print your photos without the need of a PC, but again, 2.0 mega-pixels is good for the internet, built not great for printing out.It is a Walkman that shuffles the songs with just a shake of your wrist. With the \"TrackID\" service, you just identify any song that you can hear by just recording a bit of the song (using the microphone, like at `Starbucks'). This features costs $3.99/month!!! Later, you can send the file for recognition. It gives you the name, artist and album right to your phone. That's cool.You have FM radio access and a slot for extra memory for songs, pics, video, etc. The ear buds are actually good quality and are attached along with a microphone (for hands free or finding that bit of song). It has all your high-speed mobile internet access, web browser, email, messaging, Java support needs and plenty of the basic games and is \"Bluetooth\" compatible. You need to buy UNLIMITED DATA USAGE from your server which can be about $20-$40/month!If you like listening to music while working out, the integrated motion sensor counts your steps, your calories and monitors your running speed, distance and time. Your workout results are stored in your phone so you can monitor your progress. This is free, thankfully.There is even a calendar, place for notes, an alarm, a calculator, stopwatch and timer! There are plenty of good free ring tones and more you can buy on-line. There's more you can BUY!But what I like best is this phone has one of the cleanest, clearest and brightest (adjustable for night) screens available. Great phone, but the extras will cost you!", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Have loved this phone", "Author": "Neeshka", "ReviewID": "R3DA74ZM91S3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for over 2 years. Looking for a replacement because I had to duct tape the cover for the battery on the back. If I didn't like it so much I wouldn't have taped it. I am eligible for an upgrade on my account, but cannot find anything similar. Some of the things I like- the music player, the camera, that it is compact and slim, that it slides open from top to bottom (not side to side). Seems fairly simple. I don't generally use a web browser but it is available. I like that it counts my steps as I walk throughout the day. It syncs with my Macintosh. Very disappointed that ATT doesn't carry any Sony Ericsson products.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not so great...", "Author": "H. Sineath", "ReviewID": "RKB44Z3LWD4BM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this in pink and mainly got it because it was cute. Big mistake.  The numbers crack within the first month.  The music button is sensitive and gets quite annoying when in your pocket it goes off.  I've had it for a year now (which is the only upside that it lasted that long) and it does occasionally freeze, drop phone calls, and i can now barely hear what the other person is saying with the volume all the way up. Its also not very durable.  If you get this phone get a warrenty.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "John Assam", "ReviewID": "R2SBRJELP5P42Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone if you are not into data plans. I purchased this phone to replace a broken (same kind) phone. It is hard to get a phone now without having to go into data.

This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as \"handsfree\" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red \"jewels\" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "ALEJANDRO ROJAS R", "ReviewID": "R1AFMUIT5V1LON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing phone, it comes with  FM radio tunner and is very usefull and it has a lot of extra features !!!", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony Ericsson W580i Walkman Cellular Phone Pink (unlocked)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BFzlafX%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0010VM0PG"}}
