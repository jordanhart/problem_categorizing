This phone has outstanding reception, routinely pulling in a full bar or more than my previous phones.The updated Symbian S60 3rd Edition with the recent service pack has eliminated the lag time between button pushes and screen response. Now you just press the key and the screen responds like a blazing desktop PC (or Mac for you fanboys).The screen is sparkling clear. The buttons have just the right feedback and are perfectly spaced. Since email and texting are secondary to me, they work just as well as in my previous phones.This puppy shines as a PHONE, and doubles as an FM radio/mp3 player.Perfect weight. Great graphics. Excellent tactile feel. This is the best phone yet, regardless of manufacturer.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "sleek,solid, and intuitive", "Author": "Drewbacca the Bookiee", "ReviewID": "R3OQ6DM0XP9WC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got one for my wife, so far I love this phone, the screen is crisp, bright, and a good size  for a phone (look elsewhere if you want a pda obviously).The software runs fast/flawlessly.Note: that to run apple isync a plugin is needed from the nokia website.The phone looks great (in black) and feels solid.  It's a great grown up phone that's very intuitive.  I love the conversions application, which has alot of basic science conversions (joules-hp-watts,atm-hg-pascals,knots-km/h-mph, etc)Reception, so far so good.  I'll update if that changes!FM,IR,WiFi (really easy to get on a network), I'm pleased with the camera too.Overall, It's very \"swiss-army-knife\" like.I'd buy another one for myself, but I want something with a bigger screen for pda's.", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "sweet little phone", "Author": "Becca", "ReviewID": "RXCV9XFIV997H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a month now and it's pretty awesome.  I've dropped it a couple times like most of my phones and it's held up great.  My husband and I are stationed in Europe with the military and needed a new phone after my old one ended up in the washer.  We had a friend in the states mail this to us and I'm very glad I took the time to do that.  The Wifi is great, I wanted this phone particularly because of it.  Now we can go to any wifi hotspot in the world and I can use my Vonage account to make free phone calls to the US. (Big Plus for military!)  The MP3 player is great.  I use this in place of a regular mp3 players or my runs and it sounds great, the speaker is pretty loud and sounds good too and you could literally use this as a juke box (if you can't wear headphones on base).  I haven't tried the GPS, I'm sure it would be great if you were a cyclist, but you have to buy a seperate receiver for it and I really don't want to run with something that heavy.This also has a cell phone version of microsoft office and Adobe Acrobat.  It seems pretty handy, but I haven't found a reason to use it yet.  Maybe if I had to look up a random regulation while not on a computer. . . not likely.  Over all a great phone and I've been extremely happy with it!  If you want a phone that has it all, this is it!", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Randall Kelley", "ReviewID": "R11PJ7SHAMJDAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this on AT&T; and it works great.

Fortunately though this phone was well worth it and will hopefully last a few years (5 if I'm lucky).I hate the idea of having to upgrade a phone that cost a lot a only a year later it seems pointless just because its not the latest look...I've tried most phones over the years and this one does everything, can be a little fiddly but thats more getting use to it then anything else.wifi is not bad, have installed skype beta and all is working ok this was the main reason for buying it, that and the fact I can use it all over the world.If you're looking at a phone that pretty much does everything then this will probably be the one for you....It's slim and compact and doesnt have the feel of it breaking in you hand if you knock it which is good.Great phone, solid build, does everything, but is a little fiddly initially...Use the PC software it comes with to make your life a lot easier...Good luck!", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "nokia rocks", "Author": "Joan A. Stanolis \"voider\"", "ReviewID": "R226XWG9DMNZSW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I loved my nokia e51. Notice I said loved.  It was beautiful and had great battery life and good WIFI, etc.  About 10 months after I bought my phone (which had worked perfectly) I had dropped it a very short distance and my key pad stopped working.  So I sent it back. It was under the standard one year warranty.  They sent me a new nokia e51. Well This new phone would not register my SIM card which I know for a fact worked. I sent this phone back and got another new nokia e51.  which suffered the same problem; so, I sent it back.  AND they sent me another new nokia e51.  I know this story is beginning to make the nokia e51 sound like the worst phone ever, but I promise there was a reason for it. This one still had the SIM card invalid message. So by now due to conflicting schedules I am over my one year warranty, but still suffering problems. Nokia had decided that since the e51 is not working well with me, they will trade out my model for a new (possibly refurbished) nokia e71 model. I will keep this updated, but I love nokia. My first phone (2002) was nokia and with customer service that just is perfect and nothing but helpful I will continue to use Nokia.  Their phones are great and offer many many applications and programs and their customer service is just amazing.  SO shop nokia. It was worth my time.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "E51 review", "Author": "Eggs", "ReviewID": "R3MW48EZQLZ4C5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A great phone.
