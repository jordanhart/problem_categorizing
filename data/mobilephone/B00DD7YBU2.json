{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not all Samsung Galaxy Mega's are the same...", "Author": "R.J.", "ReviewID": "R1VB8SDBTCID6A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Samsung Galaxy Mega and decided to upgrade a family member with this one.  I also ordered a case and accessories.  When the phone came, it looked a little different than mine.  I quickly realized the size was smaller.  It's not completely obvious the \"5.8\" in the name is the \"size\" of the device screen.  Apparently I have the 6.3 so this one is actually smaller than what I was expecting.  Again - not extremely obvious so thought I'd share that for anyone wanting a Samsung Galaxy Mega and expecting to get the large screen version.  Apart from that, the device is pretty similar to the 6.3 version but at the end-of-the day, it's really about screen size.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Dewitt", "ReviewID": "R3N4Z4WCRNNGGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

I went to Walmart and got the $60 Starter kit from Straight Talk, followed ALL the instructions and I was set and ready to make and receive calls and texts and had no issues with my WiFi or Data connections.So far there is nothing about this phone I don't like, one of my favorite features is Multi Window mode and the different modes on the camera. The phone comes with a USB charger but it has a funky looking adapter so I just removed that and used one of my adapters with the cord. It also comes with some Samsung ear buds, but I doubt they will last long so I will only use them for emergency backup as I already have my own over the ear.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone but was tricked.", "Author": "Esmeralda Sanchez", "ReviewID": "RJUCCEZ5NH639", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is great.
