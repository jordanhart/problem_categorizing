{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "W. Wolverton \"Rockdoggy\"", "ReviewID": "R2YDL8JKS99DZM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looks to be a sgh-i717 clone.  Very fast, awesome screen very bright and clear and well... BIG.  There reason for only 4 stars is that the first one I received from a different seller would not recognize the Sim card in slot one and wouldn't accept a Sim card in slot two.  I had to send it back.  But the second one I bought has had no problems at all.  Was able to sync via Bluetooth with my Ford truck with no problem.  This phone came with two 3800mah batteries, an extra back with attached front cover, USB charge cable, international plug with USA adapter, headphones, some instructions.  The guy at the AT&T; store was impressed to say the least.  He had a Samsung Note 2 and was drooling over this phone.  I will say that finding a case for this beast has been a bit troublesome.  I wanted something where I could put it on my hip and can't seem to find a case big enough.  I was able to find a couple of nice leather cases for it but not one I could hang on my belt.  I found some that were very close that probably would have worked but I figure if I just wait a little while there will be more on the market.  If you buy this phone and need a protective case, do a search on sgh-i717 and that should get you going in the right direction.  Has android 4.2.1 installed.  Did a system test and memory is split between ROM RAM and SD Card.  Not sure what's up with that as there is no SDCard installed.  Showed that way on 2 different apps.  Doesn't matter as this thing is fast and I have plenty of memory so I am a happy camper.  Wifi works well, has 320 dpi screen (720p).  Plenty of default installed apps to get you going.  I would definitely recommend this phone.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EXFF94K"}}
