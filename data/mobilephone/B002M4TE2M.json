{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A near perfect slider from Nokia", "Author": "D. Reed", "ReviewID": "RQN6R8R6V98JK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nokia 6700 Slide is to me pretty much the perfect phone, and I've had a lot of phones. First, the size, it's a joy to hold and the construction is rock solid, the whole phone is made out of metal aside the very top and bottom which is high end grade plastic. Literally this phone is tough, yet at a reasonable weight too, not too heavy but not too light either. The sliding mechanism is so nice, takes little effort at all to slide open and close, and has a nice spring action to it, by far the best IMO. The buttons are easy to press, and the keypad has a  good feel to it. Overall I'm impressed with the build quality, sturdy, not wobbling or creaking whatsoever. Now I'm used to Sony Ericsson interfaces, so crossing over to Nokia took a minute for me to navigate thru( this is a smart phone ), and once I finished that going thru the menus was never easier. I like the stand-by screen too how you can add your favorite contacts, shortcuts in a row( I'm used to pressing up,down,left and right on the D-pad ), Calender and Photo sharing. The 5mp is pretty good, no complaints there, as well as the video performance. As a phone though call quality is quite excellent, from earpiece and speaker, and the other end hears me just fine with a hitch. Reception is good, being able to get a signal in most places. Overall I'm happy with this phone, quite the keeper. There may be some things this phone lacks compared to the rest of the competition, and that is Wi-Fi and a 3.5mm input jack. Wi-fi I can kinda deal without, but the 3.5mm jack is what really got me, I mean it does come with a 2.5mm input but the 3.5mm just makes it so much easier to put whatever headphones you desire in the phone. Oh well. Well If your looking for a really good slider and don't need wi-fi and a 3.5mm jack, this phone literally has it all, and to me it's closest competitor is the Sony Ericsson w995 IMO, good phone as I have tried it too, but I like the Nokia a lot better.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade to the 6500 Slide.

Abiraj", "ReviewID": "R1OYJZBLCI5ETJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Nokia 6700 Slide to replace a 6500 Slide which the LCD had gone blank. This phone is a nice upgrade. Its slimmer, modern and still feels sturdy as the 6500. It's not a smart phone so don't expect super features. Wifi would have been a nice upgrade but its not available.

Here are my impressions.Pros:-Very solid and well built-Nicely weighted-Attractive design-\"Buttery\" smooth slider mechanism-Decent reception-Good call quality-Decent earpiece volume-Loud speakerphone-Charging possible through micro USB-Keypad looks flat but is actually very easy to use-Very customizable-Screen is decent despite the specs-Accepts micro SD cards-Generally snappy performanceCons:-Hinge is a little wobbly (if other online review are to be believed, this plagues a number of units)-No 3.5mm headphone jack, nor is a 2.5mm adapter included in the box-I just couldn't get into the Symbian OS, just seems clunky IMO-No volume rocker is a minor annoyance-Top edge of the phone can dig into your ear if you're pressing the phone close to your ear (ie in a noisy environment)-No flashlight function even with that dual LED flash?All in all I really did what to like this phone.  It is so solid and well built but at the end of the day, I just don't really like the OS.  To each their own, I suppose.*Edit: returned the phone for something else.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Cutest Sleekest Phone Ever! ^_^", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R2Q8RPBMMOCAMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Haha, so I exaggerated the title a little, but I'm overjoyed since buying this phone.The problem with phones nowadays is everyone is trying to make it \"smart.\"Hence, smartphones keep getting bigger and bigger.After I got the HTC HD2, with its 4.3\" screen, I knew that that was it. And by that I mean that phones have crossed that threshold of portability. At that size, it is no longer a phone, but a mini-tablet computer with phone functions.So I got the Samsung Vibrant after that. At 4\", the screen was comparatively smaller, but still uncomfortable for regular usage.So I got the iPhone 4 after that, and have not looked back since.However, there was still a part of me that was longing for the days of yore, when the trend was about shrinkage, and the smaller the phone, the cooler you seemed.Phones like the Nokia 8210, and then the 8250 after that, still hold a special place in my heart, just because it was so stylish and adorable.Not to mention, tough as nails!So that brings me back to this phone. I have been eyeing the Nokia X6 and its inferior twin the X3 for a while now, but didn't feel like devolving back to the Symbian OS (the Nokia N94, N85, and 5800 have taught me enough).But when I saw this 6700 slide, I knew I just had to have it.If you are new to the Symbian OS, there's not much to say than it's serviceable. But it is no Apple iOS, or even Android. So if you're a app freak like me, Symbian is not for you. The user interface is slow and quite lacking.But none of this matters to me, as I have my iPhone 4 and Nokia N900 as my main phones, and since I have several lines for my businesses, I need my secondary phones to be as light and small as possible. I don't need it to watch videos, check the Internet, etc. I just need a PHONE.So this makes a perfect secondary phone, or a good travel phone (because it's unlocked) where you are afraid to lose an expensive phone.FYI- I got mine used from the Warehouse Deals portion of Amazon, because the new ones were double the price at $200. If you don't need a brand new phone, I recommend the Warehouse Deals, because when they say \"Used, Like New,\" they really mean it. My phone was nearly flawless - not a scratch or mark anywhere, just some unpeeled edges of the OEM protection stickers as signs of usage.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia 6700s", "Author": "Chris Liu", "ReviewID": "RIQ3EB98V1B3L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone, but have two main gripes and one minor:1. The internet browser is cluttered and hard to use, to the point where it is useless.2. The GPS is via triangulation only. There is no GPS receiver in this phone.3. Must use Nokia OVI to push music to the phone. You can mount the phone as a Mass Storage Device and copy songs over, but the phone will not recognize.Otherwise, Symbian OS keeps things quick and smooth, mp3/radio playback is crystal clear, and the camera (with flash) takes better pictures than my digicam.I think I used this phone on average 1 hour a day for texting and it went a whole week without needing a charge. Bluetooth connected first time with no problem.The case is a nice durable aluminum finish (although USB port is covered by flimsy plastic that feels like it will break off). Buttons are firm and provide excellent tactile response.Very nice ringtones (typical Nokia) and a good price round out this phone for people who want a durable reliable phone, with capabilities of (occasional) internet.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do NOT waste your money or energy on this phone!", "Author": "Yvonne Hernandez \"Ivy\"", "ReviewID": "R3G9C9KESX306X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone looks sleek and stylish.

I don't want the full \"huge smartphone in your pocket\" experience and I do miss the days when phones were super cool little designs.However, this phone does have some smartphone features. Email, calendar, syncing, an OS (Symbian) that allows apps.I run a blog that offers help and perspectives and how-to's for the 6700 Slide. It could be handy for you to check out the pluses and minuses and solutions that I've found after configuring and working with it for a while.Overall, a B-plus I think is the appropriate grade here.

I've owned a long string of tiny-but-powerful Nokia phones, the last one being the Nokia 6300 Unlocked Triband Camera Business Phone (Black), which had solid features and physically was nearly indestructible. The features were feeling dated and I was a afraid it would be smashed one time to many, so I \"upgraded\" to the Nokia 6700 slide. I had high expectations (surely three years will bring lots of technology improvements, right?). My expectations were not met.I'm essentially comparing the Nokia 6700 slide with the Nokia 6300. Let's start with the bad:* The UI works much differently. You'll have to be careful or you'll delete a character when you want to cancel, or delete a contact when you want to delete a character, or something similar. Things that should be simple, such as adding a detail to a contact, is somehow difficult.* The interface is slow, slow, slow! Let's say you hit \"Contacts\" and start typing \"sam\". The interface is so slow that it skips the \"s\" and enters \"a\". So you hit \"erase\". Oops, that was the cancel button. So you try again. There's the name. You try to scroll down and select the number. The interface lags, so you select the wrong one. You hit \"back\", but then you're in the list not where you were to begin with, so you have to start all over.* It tries to get fancy and insert spaces in the number, assuming you're in the US, which makes, for example, local Brazilian numbers hard to recognize.* It doesn't recognize the contact of an incoming call from an eight-digit local Brazilian number on the SIM card. This may be a deal breaker---anyone who calls my while I'm in Brazil with a TIM SIM card will come in as the number, not the contact, and I have no idea who is calling. The 6300 was so smart it matching any trailing digits---even the eight-digit form with the full international number form.* There are no smileys. Yes, you read that right. You cannot insert or see smileys in text messages---you have to remember your :'s and )'s and do it manually.* When browsing your contacts, there is no way to view a contact detail. Let's say that you are viewing \"Sam Smith\" and that contact has a long email address or a multi-line note. There is no way (as was possible with the 6300) to select \"View\" to view the detail---you have to edit the contact to see the full detail contents (and try not to accidentally modify anything).* There is no missed call indicator. The 6300 blinked its little blue light on the side if you had been in the shower when someone sent you a message or tried to call you. The 6700 slide has nifty little lights on the front that would have been perfect for this, but it doesn't use them. You could go all day not knowing someone tried to reach you.* The media interface is completely dumbified. You can't browse by folders---you're stuck with the phone's decision of how it wants to arrange your photos and music on the SD card. In the 6300 I could go directly to which folder I wanted.* You can't change the type of a phone number (e.g. from \"home\" to \"mobile\") as in the 6300---you have to cut and paste.* You can't easily zoom a photo, if a all. This was quickly available in the 6300 via one or two keypresses.* The home page is cluttered with odd menus (why do I want a \"share your photos link?\") that, depending on which one you happen to have accidentally selected, changes what the keys do when you slide open the phone.* The SD card doesn't have a \"push-to-insert, push-to-remove\" functionality. You can push it all day, and it won't spring out. I seriously have to get out a pair of tweezers to remove the card. I am not kidding. And before you think I'm doing something wrong, try it yourself!There are some good things:* Even though advertised as using US 3G frequencies, it does UMTS just fine in Brazil on TIM.* The camera is a huge step up from the 6300. Pictures taken on a bright day aren't bad.* It is a neat feature that you can hold down the big button and the clock will come on---once you figure it out.* The alarms, although at first seemingly less powerful than the 6300, offer more options---once you figure it out.The phone is just a little too thick. It feels just a little too cheap---if I were betting, I'd say it couldn't hold up after being dropped as many times as the 6300, but we'll see. The missing features (no SIM contact identification for eight-digit numbers; no smileys; no message indicator light) may be a deal-breaker for me. I'll give it a few more weeks.Update 2011-03-19: I finally sent this phone back. I couldn't stand it anymore. Luckily I found the Nokia C3-01 Silver, which is a more worthy upgrade from the Nokia 6300. I'm pretty happy with it. It corrects most of the problems I mention above, and it even adds a few nifty features such as conversation view for messages. It has a touch-screen, which is sort of gimmicky but not too bad. About the only shortcoming of the C3-01 is that it can't send text messages with all international characters, and makes you switch to French or Spanish composition mode (the only two other language modes it offers) just to get those characters. Overall, though, I wouldn't hesitate second in recommending the C3-01 over the 6700. (For some reason, I couldn't enter a product link to the actually C3-01 I purchased; look it up with Amazon Product ID B0046RE9DM.)", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not the best", "Author": "dennis mwangi", "ReviewID": "R1WXNTNYGE23M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wouldt recomended it for nokia lovers.

Standard Symbian phone buttons are well-placed and have a positive feel. Feels slightly awkward when open and texting with one hand, but this is more than made up for by the small size and excellent build quality.Camera is auto-focus but not particularly good, although adequate for a phone of this price. It's generally very fast for a phone camera. When open the camera launch button doubles as the shutter - nice design. Camera works well when scanning 2D and 1D barcodes with the Upcode program. Built-in browser works well. Contact sync with Google Sync works over browsing-only data service (and syncs contact photos as well as contact info) but calendar sync does not (requires software from Nokia that's no longer available). However, the third-party Googasync program works for the calendar.Display is clear and bright. Default settings for ambient light sensor (automatically adjusts the screen brightness) are a little dim, but easy to adjust.Summary: I love this phone.
