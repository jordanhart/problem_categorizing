{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Please read before purchasing this phone!", "Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "R3J3DNI8EMF7U5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been chomping at the bit to write this review.  There is some confusion regarding the Atrix 2 phones sold by this vendor and I'm writing this review to clear up some of the confusion.The Atrix 2 phones sold by this vendor are phones from a variety of international sources.  This is very common in the discounted cell phone market, but there are a few things you should know before taking the leap and purchasing one of them.  The country of origin can lead to some limitations, and in some cases, network or feature incompatibilities, if you intend to configure this phone yourself.The Atrix 2 is manufactured by Motorola in two flavors and five different firmware versions.  Motorola manufactures the MB865 and the ME865.  The MB865 has three different firmware versions.  The ME865 has two different firmware versions.  These phones differ to accommodate three geographic regions: Asia, Europe, and the US.  While all versions of the Atrix 2 are largely the same, there are differences in the GPS and WiFi chip sets that support the technologies used in the locations where they are marketed, hence the reason for all the different firmware versions.  If you update the firmware, you can't interchange the MB firmware with the ME firmware.This vendor advertises that it sells the MB865.  I received an Asian-based ME865 with the Hong Kong firmware installed.  The phone was unlocked, as advertised, but some people have complained of receiving a locked phone.I, personally, would not recommend purchasing from this vendor unless you are technically savvy and don't mind possibly having to do some firmware/OS upgrades to the phone to get it configured for your region.  If you're happy with 2G access, then you should be fine, and I'd definitely recommend buying from this vendor.  If you're interested in using this phone with T-Mobile as your carrier, just be aware that it's not capable of communicating at the frequencies necessary for 3G and 4G speeds through T-Mobile.  It works fine operating 2G through T-Mobile.If you are technically savvy and hope to root the phone when you receive it, then read on.  Rooting is when you configure the phone for superuser access.  To manually upgrade the OS, you have to root the phone, which is done using a rooting program on a laptop with the phone attached by a USB cable.  If you root the phone, it will no longer update itself.  You will, from that point forward, be committing yourself to manually updating the OS periodically, as needed.  If you are technically inclined and not leery of doing this, by all means, go for it.If you receive an ME865 Atrix 2 that has Hong Kong firmware installed, you won't be able to root it.  You'll have to upgrade the firmware by flashing the alternate China Retail firmware first, then you can root the phone using a specific rooting program for the China Retail firmware.  When you first use the phone after purchase, the OS will upgrade you to Android 4.0.4 (ICS, a.k.a. Ice Cream Sandwich) automatically.  Let it do this, then install the new firmware, then root, then install the Android 4.1.2 (JB, a.k.a. Jelly Bean) OS for the Atrix 2.  You'll then have to research to locate the rooting software for Jelly Bean on the Atrix 2 running the China Retail firmware.  You won't be able to root it again without first using Boot Swapper to flash over the ICS boot.img file, then root, and then flash back the JB boot.img file.I don't mean to lose people here.  I'm going into some detailed technical information that will probably confuse many readers.  My primary message to all readers of this review is, be aware of what you may be receiving if you order this phone.  You may end up with a great phone.  You may end up with an International phone that requires tweaking.  It's a roll of the dice.  You get what you pay for.  This vendor sells these phones at an excellent price--they're cheap!  Amazon is very good about returns, and you have the option to return it, especially if you received an ME865 as opposed to an MB865.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  I'll do my best to help, if I can.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing device", "Author": "Carlos J Alba P", "ReviewID": "R28SIT962909UT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is really what you might expect from the hardware specs (dual core , 1MB RAM, HSPA+,...), I do not stop wondering such computing power on your hands just shows one more time Moore's law in action.The phone is really responsive and delivers fast data connectivity, I confirm good mobile network download speed with Movistar Colombia, usually over 2M but at least 1M, upload around 500K.Display is great, even under sunlight.Sound quality, excellentUser interface , intuitive.Areas of improvement:1. Still pictures, specifically under low light conditions, but is enough for  on the road pictures and videos (Full HD videos and 8MB camera by the way)2. Battery (1735mAh) is good, but could be exhausted by end of the day if  used  extensively,  this depend on usage profile.3. Accessories, should include a micro HDMI cable ( Order Motorola Standard HDMI Cable for Motorola DROID X, ATRIX 4G, and XOOM). The box contains the phone with a 2GB micro SDHC card already inserted, USB wall charger and a micro USB cable (for wall charger and to a computer connection/charge as well).Still need to test display over full HD screen, will update later on this and  many other features/functions.In summary: Is a excellent deal, price wise I found the best option  and definitely I have not regretted at all, the complete opposite.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Atrix 2 Review - Engineering Student", "Author": "name", "ReviewID": "R25SLG3PRHPFUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I go to Purdue University studying engineering, I would consider myself technologically savvy.  This phone is amazing, if you are considering this or an Iphone, Go with the Android.  I had an Iphone 4s and it was a convenient and useful device, It had many features and was very useful, however it had limitations.  The point of the Android OS is to remove those limitations.  This phone has a fast reliable camera that quickly takes hi resolution pictures and beautiful HD video.  This phone is extremely fast and reliable.  If you buy it i highly recommend the Otter Box Commuter case, it is a sturdy case and well designed for going in and out of your pocket when you need it.Overall, if you're considering buying this phone or an iphone, trust a user who has had both, go with the Atrix 2.  you wont be disappointed.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Surpassed my expectations", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXY6HRRNXR1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a very tough critic when it comes to anything related to technology.  I had yet to come across a phone that could keep up with my pace on how I use my phones, that is until I met the Android Motorola Atrix & Atrix 2.  I've had the fortunate luck of being able to use both phones and have been pleased with the performance levels and durability of both.  The battery life goes pretty quickly with heavy use, but that is to be expected since you are pretty much working the Dual Core processor it has and the phone does really well at keeping up with extreme use (texting, emailing, checking in, web use, downloading, uploading, camera usage, video camera usage, etc.)  The multi tasking ability on the phone is fantastic and display is crystal clear.Highly recommended for any of you tech geeks out there or the average tech user who likes fast & fun electronic toys.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible, this phone isn't unlocked!", "Author": "Andres Corral", "ReviewID": "R10J8JX7IAFQ66", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because it was unlocked, but when I received it the phone required an unlock pin.

The colors while not as vibrant and saturated as some of the Samsung amloed phones like the galaxy s2 do look very good and are more natural looking then the s2 which over saturates it colors.  The phone also is very bright in terms of screen brightness I find my self mostly using it at the lowest brightness settings while indoors during the day maybe turning it up to 25% max if there's some light shinning through a window or from a light overhead on on my phone or I just want a brighter looking image.  At night without any lights on I have to use an app called screen filter to darken the screen further or its hurts my eyes even at the lowest settings!  Outdoor visibility in direct sunlight is pretty good as long as you turn the screen brightness up which is the only case when I will use 100% screen brightness.Speed and StabilityThanks to its speedy 1ghz dual core processor its is fast enough to do anything you would want on the phone.  switching between the home screens feels very responsive and has pretty smooth animations but there's a slight lag but nothing detrimental at all.  I'm running alot of widgets on my home screen in addition to running a live wallpaper so that probably contributes to that although it means you don't have to worry to much about loading the home screens with whatever you want going its not going to slow down the phone to an unbearable level like slower phones.  Stability wise the phone is very good in that regard freezes and crashes are rare so far only had like 4 in the 2 and a half months I've had it and been using it alot each day.Edit: The bit of lag when switching between homescreen was due to the live wall paper I was.  Switching to a static wall paper and the animation becomes incredible smooth close to 60fps movement even with 31 widgets on my 5 home screens and the rest of the space filled with app icons.  I also tried other live wall papers to see if they how they compared and they where all still alot smoother then the planetscapes live paper.GamesIf you play alot of games then the Atrix 2 will be great for you the gpu in this phone is strong enough to easily power advanced 3D games at the phones quarter HD resolution providing great image quality in games(games really do look fanatic on this phone screen better then psp and ds)such as Samurai Vengeance 2 or Muffin Knight while still providing a very smooth gameplay experience almost all of the games I have are running at a silky smooth 60fps or close to it.Build QualityThe Build Quality of this phone is decent it looks nice and is an all plastic design but its very durable I've dropped this quite alot without any case and other then some superficial damage on the sides the phone is still in perfect working order.  The phone is not as thin as some other phones at only 10mm(iPhone 4s is 9mm in comparison) its defiantly not a thick phone by any means and the extra thickness gives you more to hold onto and feels nicer in your hands for extended use then some of these super thin phones(the textured back also helps with that providing a good grip and feels nice to the touch).  The phone is a good weight its not super light but not heavy either it gives it a solid feel when you pick it up that super light phones don't provide.CameraThe camera is good nothing amazing its about on par with what other similar priced phones are offering but can't compete with higher end phone cameras but still much better then the crappy cameras you find on lowerend phones.  It has an 8mp sensor and records with led flash and is in full 1080p.  Outdoor shots during the day and indoor shots in well lit rooms are great on this phone its in low light conditions where it falters the quality isn't that good even with the flash.  The camera also has some focusing issues where some photos taken are blurry and out of focus making you retake them.  The video recording quality is great as long as there enough light no complaints there it records at a smooth a 30fps at 1080p and played back on an hdtv or just the phone it self looks great.ConnectivityYou got your standard 3.5mm headphone jack a micro usb port for charging and transferring data over usb to your phone from your computer as well as a micro hdmi cable which can be used to mirror the image on your phone to your hdtv for sharing images,videos.  There is also the option to buy a car dock as well as the laptop dock don't have any of those so can't comment on how well they work.StorageIt comes with 8gb of internal storage which is lower then I would have liked but acceptable but you can use up to a 32gb micro sd card for more storage.  4.5gb of that 8gb is available to use for user downloaded apps that's plenty for most people I have 274 apps installed on my phone right now(went a little app crazy when i first got it) and still have 1.4gb left over.  One problem I had was apps where uninstalling them selves when installed on the sd card the solution was to move all apps to the phone and that fixed the problem for now not sure if its my SD card or a software issue.  At&t; just released an update for this phone haven't installed it yet but when I do will report back if that fixed it.  For most people this won't be a issue as you can fit several hundreds of apps on the internal storage before you run out.Battery LifeFor me the battery life is very good heavy use of the phone will kill the battery within 5-8 hours depending on what I was doing(3D games and videos kill battery faster then just web browsing or 2d apps and games).  More moderate use with a combination of web browsing,gaming,music, and watching videos through out the day I can get between 12-18 hours of use out of before I need to charge it.  Now bare in mind this is using wifi only with Bluetooth and GPS turned off permanently and using 0% brightness the large majority of the time I don't have a data plan so don't know how much enabling 3G would negatively affect battery life.Call qualityI had no problems with the call quality can very easily here what people and saying and no one had any problems hearing me speak.Sound QualityThe speaker phone on this phone is better then most I have heard its get louder then most other phones and does so while sounding clearer sound quality and not having as much of a piercing shrill sound quality that's painful to hear that most phones have especially when played at louder volumes obviously don't expect much bass out of a speaker so small or anything amazing sound quality just good by speaker phone standard which aren't very high at all if you want good sound you need to use headphones.  Now as for the headphone jack sound quality is decent on par with most of other android phones around this price.  The amplifier in the phone is pretty strong and has no audible hiss.  So low impedance headphones and ear buds will get plenty loud even with just a few notches up on the volume.  At the highest volume settings my ad700 become portable speakers!  Also By default there is a bunch of audio processing turned on that degrades sound you can turn off in the settings>sound>Media audio effect>wired stereo devices.  There are some equalizer settings but there all presets without anyway to custom them there is an equalization app you can download that will work on all sounds but only has 5 bands poweramp offers ten bar equalizer a real preamp among other thing and is $5 in the market but will only work for the music your play through it.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Jonathan D.

Again, I know this isn't the best, but it's pretty darn good.  Text on here looks so much better than my ipad 2 and mini, it's quite a big difference to my eye.  This phone is all that I need.  I'm not doing crazy stuff like rooting it or whatever, it just works.  It does the basics rather nicely.  I've never had an Android phone, but I really like what I've seen.  The phone is snappy to respond and with the addition of a program called Swiftkey, typing on the thing is so fun.  I wish they would make something like this for the Ipad.  The only issue I had at first, was that some of the searches resultes in me typing in Chinese or something.  It was so weird.  I'm thinking of flashing the thing with a AT&T; firmware, because as of right now the firmware is Chinese.

This was my first smartphone and my wife's second and so far they are great.  I received two brand new phones from portable guy and out of the box they updated to ICS 4.0.4 which is a nice OS for general users.  Both of the phones I received had the Hong Kong/Taiwan retail firmware and they had no issues working in the US on Net10 using AT&T; compatible SIM cards.  I was paranoid to begin with and went ahead and got all the tools needed to flash CM10.1 but it isn't needed.  One small quirk though on the whole 3G, 4G thing.  The phones have issues picking up 3G and 4G (H and H+) when the WIFI is turned on in settings.  I thought something was wrong because I wasn't picking it up but it was because I was on my home WIFI and I had to turn it off in settings to get the H+.  It may have just been operator error, like I said this is my first go around with a smartphone.  I am into technology and work on computers for a living but that threw me off after reading all of the reviews on these phones.

I'm a phone and gadget nut so I usually buy a new(er) unlocked phone every 9 months to a year if the price is right. This is a great phone so far, HOWEVER; I thought when I ordered it that the model Amazon featured said it was upgrade-able to ICS though it came with Gingerbread on it. Turns out that the rom on the phone I got was a South American version, so even though the phone was unlocked as stated and there is English available as a language option besides Spanish, the phone could not be upgraded to ICS. Motorola told me so; Motorola also told me that if I wanted them to upgrade the rom, I could send it to them and pay them $150. Absurd. Fortunately, I've flashed roms before and finding out how to root it and flash the stock AT&T; ICS rom to it was not difficult for me, so I did just that. It works great now. There's no chance of an official or even a custom JB rom that is stable going forward but that's ok with me.

I used the Atrix 2 for just over 2 years, without any hardware issues or significant software problems, and am retiring this noble candy-bar smartphone as a completely satisfied user (and with a bit of sadness in my heart since it has been such a steady phone).Here are the major strengths of this phone:-Reliable and durable: It is not an exaggeration to say that I dropped this phone at least 50 times. Concrete, carpet, metal, wood, you name it. The phone held up (granted, I did have the Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for those drops). The phone never developed a crack, stays mostly scratch-free, and always turned on when I needed it.-Good display: the Atrix 2 is a dated smartphone. Yet the display is still beautiful and beats the lower tier of current smartphones by and far. Colors are rich, the picture is relatively sharp, and viewing angles are good.-Aesthetics: Perhaps I am the exception, but I do not like having the same phone as everyone else and their mother. The Atrix 2 was--and still is--a good looking remedy to the problem of phone clones. By itself the phone looks great, and paired with the Diztronic black TPU case it looks amazing; Kind of an industrial, professional, simple appearance. It is of course locked into the traditional smartphone shape, but still achieves a unique look.-Performance: Now, when looking at the specs of this phone, in the current realm of smartphones, the Atrix 2 is nothing special. When it was released over 2 years ago it was top dog. Today, the phone can still hold its own ground when it is loaded with ICS and not too many power hungry background apps. It will indeed slowdown if it's running many resource-intensive background apps, but hey, this phone is old. Give it a break. It's a budget smartphone in today's economy.Just a few negative things...-Audio: It is just bleh. Nothing special, nothing bad. Simply mediocre. Go with a different phone if audio fidelity is important to you.Battery: It started out pretty good, lasting for a day with moderate usage. But it tapered off the longer I had it until, at the end of my 2 years, I barely am able to get a full day's worth of usage from it without a short in-between charge. It's not a deal breaker, just be prepared to give it a bit of extra juice during the afternoon if you are an all day heavy user.\\-Back Cover: This is not necessarily a fault but still deserves a mention--the back cover will likely be scratched, even with a case on the phone. There is a spot on my Atrix 2 that is pretty much bare and void of the ridges that were once there because some dirt got in-between the case and the Atrix's cover. Maybe that was my fault. In the end, just try to be careful with the back of the phone.This is a solid phone if you're looking for one on a budget.

I bought a net10 stand alone sim, straight talk would work too, same company basically. The phone is unlocked but still at&t; branded all the way. Alot of negative feedbacks are coming from people thinking that the phone is rooted. I did this too. Not really the same thing. first i downloaded and installed apn backup and restore on the phone from google play store. free.this let me delete all the locked at&t; preset apn's. these would semi work for the net10 sim but not for mms. so i deleted the presets and made a new apn and put in net10 settings and all worked. nice. next thing i wanted was to root the phone for tethering purposes. i dont get into overclocking, or messing around with the operating system files. i just wanted to be able to install and run a tethering app. but you have to be really careful using this, cause too much data useage and you will get flagged and maybe cut off entirely. keep the data low. for me its under 2gigs a month. the tethering built into the phone will not let you because at&t; won't allow it. in order for your 3rd party tethering app to work your phone has to be rooted. i looked it up and did this. there is software called 2.3.6root. this is the os that came on the phone. so this is what worked for me. i just googled it. it was easy to use. but keep in mind very dangerous too. can cause a bricked phone. so you have been warned. you dont need a rooted phone. but if you are haveing mms problems you need to install the apn backup and restore app. its pretty much safe. the phone is awesome.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent battery life and superb smartphone", "Author": "techyguy", "ReviewID": "R1TVUHT921K7B3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Atrix 2 by Motorola is a smartphone that totally rocks! My story: Just before Christmas I wanted to take advantage of my option to upgrade. I had a great HTC Tilt 2, which is a great smartphone except for the WinMobile 6.5 os from Microsoft windows which developers basically stopped supporting from way back. I was pretty much going for the iPhone 4s and could have saved $30 with a promo at RadioShack. When I visited the store, I mentioned that the most important thing for me is the battery life and reliability to get streaming data for my business use. My prior phone had to be re-charged after just 4 hours of use with data streaming into my business app. My only solution then was to swap out batteries.The agent, Harry, told me that battery life with the iphone 4s could be an issue. He showed me his own first generation Atrix, which also had fingerprint security. The Atrix and the Atrix 2 has a dual processor, over a gig of RAM and all the rest is very top quality. There was a promo at the time, so I got this great phone for $0 cost. I elected to get the replacement insurance from them for 7 or 8 bucks a month and it's good except if you lose it, but there's no extra money for any problem.This thing is very fast. Maybe the iphone 4s loads websites a trifle faster, but the greatest thing is that my app works good on the 4G network ATT and the battery is still at 30% when I leave work and I can make it home before I need a charge. This is in situations where I have the intense app running nonstop all day and even when I am on certain phone calls simultaneously for several full hour or more phone calls.Android system is good. I avoid apps that use location of my phone, as these are known to drain the battery life.The screen is excellent, touch screen is very responsive, it is fun to look at and there's so much you can do with it, and I have barely scratched the surface of the variety of things available. I wanted to write this review for a while and I have just been way too busy, but the wait has only proven the phone to be better and better to me.It charges up pretty fast too.  Camera is truely excellent quality. I like to do close up photos of nature such as inside of flowers and such, woven fabrics, paintings, small print and this thing auto focuses and shoots super crisp photos. Sound quality is excellent too. I use it with a few free apps to record radio talks and conversations and such. Recording quality is magnificent. Playback is nice, full robust sound.I also have the iPad 2 with just wifi and that is super cool for sure. This phone is to me like a mini iPad. It even has the extra front facing camera also, so you have a 'mirror' if you need it and the 'facetime-ish' experience although I have yet to try any of that, but took some cool self front view pics with me and my gal.I could go on, but you can find the rest on other reviews. I must add that downloaded videos look and sound fantastic. I also checked out the Samsung Galaxy S2, which is also super fast and with all powers and more, with a slightly larger view surface, however I wasn't up for shelling out 300 to 400 to get that one. Zero was quite a good deal for all this phone can do. I put that money toward the Mac Airbook and wow that is super. The Apple Airbook blows away my windows laptops and I have a few. The screen experience is intense.I mention the Airbook together with the Atrix 2 because they are in the superior quality league compared to windows. I hear the new Windows phone is quite good, however who is really going to jump to create apps? I am sure there will be plenty, but compared to Android and the Apple ios iphone and ipad platform ...well it's rather apparent.So, if you want a super great smartphone, I recommend the Atrix 2. Thank you Harry of RadioShack store for going over all the details. Be sure to read the specifications, as that will truely show you the quality built in to this true computer phone. Oh, text messaging is great too: the message appears in the line at the top of your screen while you are doing other things on the phone , and the word suggestions while typing , are many and always pop up the full word I've started typing, so that saves tons of keystrokes. I'm going to load their voice controlled app that let's you speak your text messages in , and that is also reviewed as very good.Admittedly, I am a candidate for the upcoming next iphone but that's still a whole season away from being available. My gal has the original iphone and that thing is super as is! Still, for me to jump to the new one will cost me some serious money, which is all right, but I will still need the same great battery life  or  even better from that, because the new iphones are doing a lot more stuff on a continuing basis all the time they are on, and I really don't have the time or even a place to re-charge during the day. With my Atrix 2, I can buy an extra battery to keep handy if I can't charge it at the end of the day. That's not possible the the iphone since the battery on that isnt' removable.As to it not being unlockable as other reviewers say, I don't need to do that so far.

I have a 64 gb micro sd card in it so it makes a great mp3 player, especially in combination with a bluetooth speaker.The size is perfect for use as a gps. Even reading Kindle books on it isn't bad in a pinch. It's great for audio books also. I use \"easy voice recorder\" to capture our band when we're practicing and I want to hear what we sound like. The camera is 8mp.

It's been over three months now and I'm still searching. The phone isn't perfect, but the occasional glitches are so minor and so easily resolved, they aren't worth mentioning. I've read many of the negative reviews and don't understand most of the complaints. I suspect that a lot depends on the integrity of the vendor. Some of them seem to be selling used and refurbished phones as new with the battery being the only accessory.In this regard I must compliment JOYCELLS for delivering exactly what was advertised i.e. a new unlocked phone version MB865 in original packaging and accessories including USB cable, headset and A/C adapter.Based on my usage and some negative reviews, I wish to make the following comments.Do not buy a used or refurbished phone. It's just not worth the trouble.Choose your vendor wisely. Read the Ad carefully, not only for what it says but also what it does not say and while cost is important it should not be the only factor.Version MB865 is the recommended version for the Americas and the Caribbean. Some Ads do not indicate which version of the phone is being sold and I suspect this is one reason for some of the complaints.Battery life is a big issue for all smartphones and this one is no exception. Some of the comments however lead me to believe that some buyers have received defective phones or batteries. Let me say that I'm a moderate user, the phone isn't joined to my hip or hand and this is the main factor in determining how long it lasts on a single charge. If the phone is always in your face, obviously you'll need to charge more frequently. I charge my phone once a day (at night) and sometimes there's over 50% of the previous charge remaining.The factory installed OS is Gingerbread 2.3.5 not ICS or Jellybean. If you receive this phone with any version other than Gingerbread 2.3.5 then it's probably used. You can upgrade to ICS 4.0.4 if you wish.This phone is sold as unlocked which means it will work on any GSM network anywhere. If it does not, then you were sold a locked phone which is shameful on the part of the vendor.The internal memory is 8GB. Please note however that approx. 3.45GB is used for factory installations. You therefore have approx. 4.55 GB for your personal use which is a lot for downloading apps. I have so far installed over 50 apps and still have over 3GB of internal memory left. The external memory is great, up to 32GB.In conclusion, if you're looking for a mid level, fully functional phone with all the basic Android features, not too large and fits nicely in the hand with a reasonably large screen (4.3\") and high screen resolution, lots of internal memory for apps and lots of external memory for music, photos and video, you can't go wrong with this.

The important thing to realize is that few (if any) of these phones are truly 'NEW'.  I would call them refurbished.  I've ordered 3 of these from different sellers.  I don't understand why Amazon allows these to be advertised as new, when they clearly are not new.  What makes this even worse, is that some people get foreign market phones (my 1st order), locked phones (my 3rd order), or phones that don't work fully (3rd one-internet didn't function).So, The phone itself is great. You can read reviews and see that it's a solid phone.  It just seems like Amazon needs to police their sellers more, and encourage more accurate product description and require sellers to ship what the item description actually claims you are buying.I have to give the product 5 stars, because it's a great phone.  But if I were rating the sellers, I'd mark them down because they simply aren't being honest about what they are selling.  *New* is not the same as nearly new, almost new, refurbished, or broke as hell.

I settled with Straight Talk, and after much research into an \"older\" phone that has solid specs, reputation, and was reasonably up to date in its software, I went with the Atrix 2. I bought an AT@T sim card from them, and I've been up and running for several months(YES they will throttle you if you exceed 1.5 Gigs of usage per billing cycle. I am not a power user and don't stream)This phone came nicely packaged, with the typical accessories and users manual. I had previously bought a used Atrix 2 that was damaged, thinking I could replace the screen....long story short, I should have just bought new.It came with Gingerbread, but in late 2012 it was blessed with the Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.4) Android operating system which, in effect, updated the phone to 2012 software specs. The newest one is Jelly Bean. I downloaded all of the updates via Wifi shortly after unboxing the phone. Also, I am loving the fact that you can uninstall most of the AT@T apps easily, in turn clearing up space and memory. It also has a limiter that you can set to throttle yourself if you are on a limited data plan, which is great when seeing how much data you are using per app. It will warn you when data usage is getting close to your predefined limit.The performance of this phone has been excellent. Call quality is good, screen is vivid with nice colors, GPS (a biggie for me) locks onto satellites very quickly and keeps them. Yesterday I averaged 15 hours of moderate use on the device between charges. Voice calls, lots of texts, a little bit of GPS usage, took a few pics (great 1080 HD video BTW). Watching movies will burn through the battery quicker, but the experience is enjoyable and the sound from that little tiny speaker is actually quite clear. The dual core CPU, while not as impressive compared to the new quads coming out (obviously) crunches through the apps with vigor and is much faster than my old Droid Charge and HTC Incredible.The price here at Amazon is pretty fair considering the other vendors that I looked at, and the fact the phone is still a fairly mid-high end device that can be used on Straight Talk (if you already have a Sim), AT@T and possible T-mobile, are good traits.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Purchase", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3F3SVAICIDM14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a replacement for an exact same phone purchased from AT&T; which no longer worked.

This is the equivalent Atrix 2 for the Asian Market. I was very alarmed when I booted the phone for the first time only to see Chinese/Cantonese(I think) text. I managed to change the language in the first time use setup screen however, so no big deal.Just be warned, you may get an Asian model, and have to go through the pain of changing the language, as well as the keyboard settings, but other than that it's the same phone. Operates on the same bands etc.ASIDE FROM THAT. The phone's BANGIN'! Games like a beast, multitasks like a beast, does EVERYTHING like a beast...Including drink up that battery lol. If you're conscious about it, you can make it last about 18 hours, but that means no gaming and other battery saving things.That being said, the phone's well worth the price. It's great if you want an almost top of the line phone and don't have top of the line money.EDIT (August 4th, 2013)Having had the phone for half a year now I have a couple of things to add.1. The battery life got better after upgrading to Ice Cream Sandwich. (It gets even better if you flash it to the Leaked Jelly Bean 4.1.2 that was released earlier this year)2. I got the asian ME865 as I mentioned earlier, but particularly the one made for the Hong Kong/Taiwan market, meaning it was (previously) unable to be rooted. Because I have a phone marketed to an Asian market, I have found that certain apps are unavailable for me within Google's Play store (because of regional restrictions). Apps and Games that should be available to me where I am SHOULD be there but aren't.Since buying this phone there have been a few drawbacks, but I've worked around each one of them. If you're technically knowledgeable then you can.You CANNOT root this phone if it is the Hong Kong/Taiwan market ME865. You have to flash it over to the Asian Retail firmware, then root THAT.HOWEVER if you get your hands on the third(and final) leak of Jelly Bean 4.1.2 that was made for this phone, and you DO have an ME865, then you can safely flash it on, and then root that as well.It's about 97% stable, and rootable.I took off one star for all the hassle I had to go through because of the seller's unwillingness to STATE that he is selling Asian phones. I bought it from \"THE PORTABLE GUY\"In the end, the phone is still a wonderful phone and is a GREAT buy for the money (especially because it's now $90 less than when I bought it, I would buy it all over again)It just requires a bit of technical knowledge and know-how to get around the issues faced.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "signal problem", "Author": "Roland Hajderllari", "ReviewID": "R16A33QPIVKYW8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its the worse signal  cell reception I ever have.

In Latin America, only select carriers and countries received the update.All things as they are, I think this is a great phone and well worth the price.

I am not really wanting to root the phone, so I will stick with Gingerbread.  It is a fantastic phone, just be aware, you may never be able to update it without rooting it.My last phone was a Nokia N8.  I wanted the best of Android and a good phone.  My biggest disappointment with this phone is the quality of the pictures it takes.  They are nowhere near as good as the N8 was.  I really liked that the N8 could double as a point and Shoot in a pinch.  That is not something this phone is really capable of.Overall, I am very pleased, because I was aware of most of the limitations before I bought the phone.I would buy one again, because of the lower price point.
