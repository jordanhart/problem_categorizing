As the last iteration (unless HP gets a clue that they have a competitor for the almighty iPhone)Palm Pre 3 is even better than my original Palm Pre Plus. All the quirks in the previous versions have been addressed here. It does not pause, take an extended time to turn of and off, and has the battery life it should have had all along.CONS: It's not 4G. A tad larger than the original Palms. I would never buy an iPhone due to the size, I want a small phone that fits in my hand, despite the larger size which makes it difficult to fit in some women's jeans size is still very manageable. Limited applications but I have always found everything I needed.PROS: WebOS - what else can I say? A savvy world-phone with all the bells and whistles of the original Palm. As a previous Palm user I simply had to log into my Palm profile and everything was on my new phone, contacts, apps, email. Mobile hot spot at no extra cost.Do I love this phone, yes, yes, yes. I have no hope that HP will revise this little diamond so I can only hope someone develops a comparable 4G phone before I need a new phone.", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yes!", "Author": "determinedd", "ReviewID": "R1JDW966KBID6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works well and it's webOS!

McBride", "ReviewID": "R191JX1WA75C1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone long after it was suppose to be released.  It is not 4G and not as fast as some other phones.  Webos is far superior in its design it is a real shame that it has been kind of drop kicked to the curb.  It is not without its flaws but it is so far and away more intuitive than the other os's available that it is just hard to imagine why it fell through the cracks.  Oh well, maybe one day it will be picked up by someone and be revised and ran with.  For now I will just keep on trying to find the left over's of this amazing operating system.  The fact that it failed is truly an example of the fact that big money and the correct marketing wins every time.  And that people are sheep.

The operating system is THE BEST.  It feels nice, the keyboard is improved, and the resolution is good even for today's standards, but unfortunately the lack of support, thanks HP, made me leave this phone after 2 weeks.  In a world dependent on the cloud, having very few apps is a disservice even if the hardware is great.

I didn't think I'd come to like WebOS as much as I did. After a brief stint with Android (which I reluctantly went to after hearing of HP's stupidity in killing WebOS), I got fed up and went looking for another off-contract WebOS device. Lo and behold, I found a Verizon-compatible Pre 3!This phone is leaps and bounds ahead of my Pixi in terms of performance, as well as having the most up-to-date WebOS. The experience is incredibly smooth, and the higher-resolution screen is wonderful. Physically, the phone is perfectly constructed, with all of its pieces fitting tightly and uniformly. The sliding mechanism is a bit stiff at first, but I'm now comfortable with it. I expect this phone to hold up for a long while, hardware-wise. The OS version, 2.2.4, leaves a lot to be desired, particularly with Google Talk and Voice. Basically, there is no Google Voice application, so I must go back to carrier voicemail. Talk has problems staying logged in when I transfer from 3G to WiFi, or when I lose signal (which is quite often in my location), and it will not pull the latest IMs from Google once it does log back in. The 'logging out' issue is apparently a bug with WebOS 2.2.x, and was never resolved. Hopefully someone in the community can create a reliable fix. Aside from that, the phone is awesome. Running concurrent programs is as easy as any desktop OS, and access to WiFi, Bluetooth, VPN (which is built into the OS), and Airplane Mode can be had from any program simply by tapping the battery/signal area. This phone (and any WebOS phone, for that matter) never forgets that it is a phone first, and a PDA/Pocket PC second.kulaj promptly emailed me a tracking link for my express shipping (which was so cheap it seemed criminal not to get) in a timely manner, and packaged the product very securely. Everything was as the description said, with all the materials being present. Activating it on Verizon was something of a pain because of Verizon, but the phone did its part well. Be aware that adding the phone via Verizon's web account will likely cause them to insist upon you switching data plans; the plan they want you to \"switch\" to will be identical to your current plan (even with unlimited data, if you are grandfathered in).If you like WebOS, or are sick of Android/iOS/Windows Phone, I would wholeheartedly encourage you to buy the Pre 3. Its biggest flaw is a lack of support and programs, but with WebOS being open-sourced, we will likely see more developers creating programs and porting apps from other platforms.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "micrbbns", "ReviewID": "R2MGJ00SESD2B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Pre +, Pre 2 and now Pre 3. What this phone can do with my HP TouchPad is amazing. I was able to do touch to share and I could text over SMS. You can't do that with ipad and iphone.

However, if you are looking for a platform that just does everyday things well and efficiently then this a great choice.  With Preware installed, the phone can be tweaked and customized however you choose.  If you still have unlimited data with Verizon, then this is a great phone to utilize that - do keep in mind tethering is not \"officially\" supported.  If you are still on an older Pre, Pixi, or Pre2 then do yourself a favor and get this phone.  Two concerns to note: Skype works great, but having that account active takes a toll on the battery.  Wi-fi use also seems hard on the battery.  I did not have any activation issues.
