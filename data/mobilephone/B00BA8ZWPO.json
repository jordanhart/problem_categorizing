{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best smartphone so far", "Author": "jasonfoxfire", "ReviewID": "ROM5T26UVAM9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered from oppostyle website directly but no through amazon, received in 3 days. It is so beautiful and comfortable to use, I have not touched my old Nexus phone and tablet for a few days. I installed most of the apps I use, all worked out fine except a few that has compatibility issue. I'm not writing a comprehensive review but just leave a few points that may help others to decide in their purchase.Hardware: build quality is flawless, 5 inch screen has amazing color that blows all cheap Samsung Nexus phones away. It makes big difference in reading and would not make my eyes tired. A little bit heavier but not significant than other 4.* inch phones.Graphics:  rendering is smooth, but to be picky, a little bit lag when scrolling heavy web pages comparing to Nexus 7 tablet and iphone, this is due to its higher resolution.Network: Tmobile HSPA works with downloading speed 5Mbps for me.Sound: Amazing speaker but can't quite tell difference to other phones with earbuds.Camera: Much better than Galaxy Nexus but not super impressive, I think it has better hardware but software is not using best of it. Like the IQ better from the front camera.Battery: Excellent. With 3G turned on and normal daily phone calls, it can last at least a day. With wifi on and lots of network/video activities for a few hours the battery dropped half or so. My estimation is for normal usage it will be fine with nightly charge, but if you go out and plan to play with it all day you need a power bank.In general, I'm super happy with my purchase.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent alternative to the mainstream", "Author": "flash", "ReviewID": "R2YSQP0WGVHQ1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone directly from the Oppo website a couple months ago to make the switch from Verizon to Net10. Overall, I've been very pleased with my decision. This phone's screen is gorgeous. The body has a premium feel and a low profile, making it easy to slip in my pocket. Plus it's just a good-looking phone that is unique and reasonably priced. The stock UI is minimal and there's practically no useless bloatware. I've noticed mixed results with the camera, particularly with closer shots. It seems to have trouble auto-focusing. The battery life has been very good compared to the HTC Rezound I previously had, and gets through a day without a charge. Although this phone is 3G, my download speeds have been higher than I expected (6.81MBPS in my cubicle). The 4G signal was inconsistent on the Rezound at best, and generally the speeds on the Find 5 have been as good or faster. Oppo has also established a good reputation with the firmware updates, which you just don't experience with the bigger manufacturers. Phone calls could be louder but clear, and the speaker is ok. If you place a high priority on camera quality, I wouldn't recommend this phone when comparing it to flagships like the S4 or Sony's Experia Z (although there's a rumor swirling that Oppo is coming out with a camera, which could mean improvements in the next version). If you want a competitively-price phone that's unique and easy to root, this should be at the top of your list.UpdateAfter some more time with this phone, I've felt much better with the camera. However, Oppo has the N1 coming out very soon, and the R819 looks like a bargain. If I were in the market for an unlocked today, I would wait to see what the new Oppo N1 has to offer before getting the Find 5 (projected price is $480, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was $600). I'd imagine the Find 5 will see a price drop soon, which makes it an even better deal. My experience with this phone has made me a big fan of Oppo. This phone gives you reason to consider escaping the trap American carriers create with the outrageous contracts simply by demonstrating what you could be missing in a great phone.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Jianing Luo", "ReviewID": "R1C5JDT3UMMSGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No contract is one of the best thing for me.

It has the same specs as the Nexus 4, but with a larger display and can hold 32GB memory and not 16GB like Nexus 4, and the Xperia Z it has a 5 inch screen but the color really suck I sent mine back, it was like watching a TV from 1990, it is so washed out, and colors look all messed up, I would not want to look at that screen all day so I sent it back ASAP. Check out the YouTube video on that display also, it sucks! The Oppo Find 5 comes unlocked with AT&T; so you can use all those AT&T; monthly plans like Strait Talk $45 Month, ATT-GO $50 Month, for unlimited internet, SMS, MMS, unlimited calling. It dos not get better than that. This is the phone to get right here and all those $50 plans which make it really nice which I use right now AT&T; HSPA+, compared to paying for a 2 year contract and then you still have to pay $299 for your new phone that you will have for 2 years. Just get on YouTube and read the reviews of Oppo Find 5. You will know this is the phone for you. 1.UNLOCKED phone 2. 5 Inch Display 3. Quad Core S4Pro CPU4. Adreno 320 GPU, Beautiful Phone with that all black front display,it deffently get attention everywhere I go, I see people lookin! yeah its really a nice phone with the latest and greatest, and you wont find a better phone for the price, it so let me know. Like I said it works with AT&T; and T-Mobile and all their monthly plans same thing with T-Mobile I used to use the $30 T-Mobile monthly plan and the phone will pay itself off in less than a year. 1080p display 441 pixels, very loud, Dirac Stereo System, This is a top of the line phone selling for a decent price.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best smartphones on the market", "Author": "S.

This smartphone has a very good build quality. Its very speedy with a sharp display.You can install any widgets and apps that are available on the market.Great reception and great speakerphone. Not to mention that its design is outstanding. One of the best thinks is UNLOCKED from any carriers, it means no junk apps. This phone will give you the freedom of tethering.If you can get one, it will be one of a kind on American market with 100% freedom to do anything you want to do.

If you want a very nice phone this is it, it feels great to hold, and the solid black front looks so great everyone is always staring at it. This phone is a head turner for real. It also has all the specs to go worth it, same specs as the Nexus 4 and it has a larger screen at 5 inches, and it's a 1080p IPS Display not 720p on the Nexus 4 also, the Oppo Find 5 has 32 GB built in. The Nexus 4 only has 8 or 16 storage built in that's half Oppo's and the 16GB runs out quick. The Sony Xperia Z is a nice phone but its 200 more for the same thing and the screen looks all messed up and washed out, its fast as hell, it's the fastest phone I've ever used, including galaxy s3 and the note2 and One X Tegra3. The thing it is built like a tank, I swear to you I dropped it at least 6-7 times from pocket high and didn't even phase it. Get this phone you won't regret it. It works with all AT&T; monthly plans such as Straight Talk or T-Mobile works with all the same plans that's what I do I use my Oppo Find 5 with all of those monthly plans that are like $45 a month, basically after a year the phone pays for itself.

I used to have a mindset that products made in China are either low in quality or just a \"copy\" of another branded product, it does most of the time and I can't blame it. But this time, no way, high spec with it's own unique design, although it's a little heavier than similar spec flagship, but I love it. The best part is that it is priced mid range without contract. Comparing with Sonzy Xperia Z, I prefer Oppo Find 5 regardless of the weird name. Not saying Sonzy Xperia Z is not good, I like that too and it's water and dust resistant did attract my eyes. Still, comparing the price, I definitely prefer this for with my limited funds.
