Was really excited about using this phone. Here are the features which I like the most. Very good camera, excellent battery life - 2 days time, excellent performace.MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS PHONE HAS GOT SEVERE WI-FI ISSUE. WILL NOT CONNECT TO WIFI NETWORK IF YOU TRY SECOND TIME. DUE TO THIS, IT WILL CONNECT TO WIFI SUCCESSFULLY FIRST TIME ONLY. SEARCH IN GOOGLE. I AM TROUBLESHOOTING WITH HTC FOR THE PAST 2 MONTHS. NO SOLUTION TILL NOW. DON'T BUY IF YOU ARE MORE THAN 50% WIFI USER(MEANING: SWITCHING TO WIFI AT OFFICE, HOME, WHEREVER POSSIBLE). I CAME TO KNOW ABT THIS ISSUE ALMOST AFTER 3 MONTHS, WHEN I STOPPED MY 4G DATA PLAN FROM CARRIER. DUE TO THIS, I AM NOT ABLE TO USE IN HOSPITALS, HOME, OFFICE, HOTSPOTSPros:1. 16 MP Camera - takes really nice pictures with good sharpness, brightness and colors. Even at low lights,photos are good.2. Windows Phone - For the text in windows phone, Texts are so large so that you don't even need to strain yourself to read the messages, contacts, etc. Good to see contacts of gmail/hotmail, facebook. Its office app(word,excel,powerpoint) will make u easy to open files. Xbox integration is also superb.. light weight windows OS makes you feel like ur mobile is much free from background processes and feels like very fast irrespective of many apps installed.3. Battery Life: 1730 mAH. I use to browse internet for about max of 1 hr.. i may use wi-fi when at home, use cell data when out of home, 2 hrs of talk, 3-5 messages per day. With this, I am getting 2 days 2 hrs (almost 50 hrs of charge with 4% charge left)4. it is fast enough to respond while browsing with Internet Explorer.5. Dial pad is really big.. u can dial easy and faster.6. Wallpapers, text makes you a happy feel, that you have a very high resolution display.7. Touch is also much responsive.Cons:1. Eventhough dial pad is big, qwerty Keyboard is not utilizing the full width of the screen. keys in keyboard has slightly slim dimension which makes it slightly difficult for me(fat fingers) to type sms. Of about 40 characters typed, i may miss about 10 characters and retype. But I think, we can manage with third party app.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good with HTC Titan 2", "Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "R3HU5SSVOH7T1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First impressions are very good. Good 4G speeds and overall very easy to use. Nice big 4.7 inch screen. Great voice call quality and super loud speakerphone for conferencing.

The only way to get it working again is to ship it back to the manufacturer to replace the battery.  The first time it happened, it took almost 3 weeks for me to get it back....I had to have a phone...so I bought a different one.

Tried the \"patch\" that worked for some - placing a tiny piece of electrical tape over the external mic on the top, but it didn't help much. Decided to take a chance on the redesigned Titan ll and I'm so glad I did. It's running Windows 7.5 (there are ways to force the 7.8 update), but it serves my purpose as is and I don't want to risk \"bricking\" it for the smaller tiles and additional theme colors. I'm a longtime Blackberry user and will probably get the new Q10 or Z10 when my contract's up, but the Windows Phone OS is such a pleasure to use.
