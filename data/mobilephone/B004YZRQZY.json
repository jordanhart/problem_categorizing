After I gave it a couple of days it grew on me. Just remember you get what you pay for. In my opinion, the sliding keyboard is much more effective then the touchscreen. The touchscreen only offers the numbered keypad for texting and then there's the slide out keypad that's not too bad. I definitely like the conversation back and forth instead of the phone having an inbox separate from the outbox. I don't feel like I wasted my money on this phone anymore since I gave it a chance.

He wanted a phone that he could make calls with and text with. This phone does just that. This phone is capable of accessing the internet but my son has not tried it so I can't comment on how well it works. My son loves the QWERTY keyboard and the quality of the phone calls. I wanted to test the quality of the phone so I made a few phone calls and sent a few text messages. The sound is great; it doesn't sound tinny and the voices are clear and loud, not muffled at all. I loved the keyboard, too. I have an android phone with a virtual keyboard and using this phone made me yearn for a phone with a \"real\" QWERTY keyboard. The keys on the keyboard are responsive and do not stick at all. I also like that this phone slides open to reveal the keyboard. I find it better than the flip phones. My son found it quick and easy to load all of his contacts. The description indicates that this phone is unlocked and I was able to use it on the T-Mobile network. However, the phone has the AT&T; logo on it and it is also pre-loaded with AT&T; network phone numbers to check your balance and to do other things on their network. My son was able to delete all of these numbers without any problem. I would recommend this phone to anyone that wants a simple, non-android phone (feature phone).", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Choice", "Author": "BigD", "ReviewID": "R2NYKYL9MGMDMO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone. I read a lot of review on this phone, both good and bad. I decided to take a chance. I do not regret it. I ordered it for my new T-Mobile Account. It is an LG phone geared for the AT&T; network.  It work perfectly. Only thing is that it comes with AT&T; apps. Since I do not use it for 3G, no big deal; I ordered it work with my basic plan. Only bummer for me is that it does not send or receive picture messages because it is 3G technology. I can live with this. I ordered because of the flash. It does take good pictures - 3.2 MB camera. I have an SD card, so I can transfer the pictures I do take. Touch screen is great and fun.

Calling (reception, etc.) was great.  Using the keyboard for texting took some practice, as the keys are slippery, but eventually I got the hang of it.  The touch screen and operating system (menus, customizing icons, etc.) are well designed.The big problem, however, was that web services would not work on CC's network.  I suspect that since this phone was originally set up as an AT&T; phone, there were some settings that I could not find and change to make it work - despite sessions with CC and LG support and a perusal of Internet forums.  If I had, then I would have given this phone 4-4.5 stars, easily.

This phone is set up for ATT and expects you to use them as your provider. I went with Consumer Cellular and so far have not been able to connect to the internet. I haven't done any research to see how better to use the phone so it could be my fault.The battery life has been fair. Sound quality is good. The qwerty buttons are a bit difficult to use until you get used to them. The alarm clock feature has only one setting, unlike my previous phone which allowed me to set 3 separate times with distinct days for each. The camera is pretty good according to my daughter. It does the job but I'm not wild about the phone and will likely replace it with a \"smarter\" phone.

I also wanted a physical keyboard so I wouldn't have to mess with T9. This seemed to be the best available option.It's marginally better than some other dumb phones I've used, but the user interface leaves much to be desired. It can only store a couple of hundred text messages before its storage fills up and you have to start manually deleting them to clear space. Seriously? Browsing through recent contacts is a pain -- you try to scroll down and instead it starts calling the person whose name your finger landed on. Hold down the delete key a second too long when you're typing a text message, and it deletes the whole thing. Stuff like that.The really killer problem, though, is that the battery life is basically nonexistent. I have to charge the thing pretty much daily, even if I haven't made any phone calls. Lately I'll plug it in and it'll say it's done charging in a few minutes, which suggests it's no longer holding a charge. Mind you, I've only been using this phone for a few months, with very light usage.I wish there were a well-designed dumb phone, for those of us who don't want to jump on the smartphone bandwagon but would still be able to use text messaging and make phone calls in a normal human fashion.

This phone doesn't need to have dataplan and it's features are excellent!Touchscreen is pretty much similar to iPhone; it's very sensitive and scrolling the contacts or any other is very easy and similar to the scrolling in iPhone. I never felt like I missed my iPhone.The sliding keyboard is a very good design and I never need to worry about typing the wrong letter.All the icons are placed in the correct locations, very thoughtfully. For instance, I don't need to search 'where is the settings icon?' or 'where is the phone display icon?' or 'alarm icon?'. All the features are divided into 4 parts on the rightside tabs and it is very easy for me to directly go to the particular icon I am looking for. This saves a lot of time!I am not sure about surfing internet, because the screen is not that big of an iPhone, but, Texting/adding contacts should be very easy.Overall, I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for a phone without dataplan and have good touchscreen features", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone is OK but just get a smartphone for a bit more money!", "Author": "Jennifer L Vogt", "ReviewID": "R374JSU9B195TT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Phone is OK but not worth the $80.
