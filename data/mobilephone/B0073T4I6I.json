Porter", "ReviewID": "R286YCPP00WJNC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a fairly priced cellphone and settled on this one.  I really like Samsung but I couldn't afford the Galaxy SIII so I got this one.  This phone has the same menu options and apps as the S-series phones but it doesn't have near as much memory as the newer phones do.  You won't be able to download a lot of songs or apps.  That's my only complaint about the phone.  It has FM radio, Google, Internet, YouTube, texting, camera, e-mail, etc.  It's a good phone.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compared to my old phone, this is better", "Author": "jayem", "ReviewID": "R39EMEYROZ5L21", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using my old sliding phone (Nokia E66) for 3 years till it broke recently, so I had to look for a new one. Bought this Samsung Galaxy Ace and was excited to use it. When I got it, I enjoyed its features... For sure it was better than my previous phone, no doubt about it. HOWEVER, the internal memory is way too small. I had to uninstall some applications coz the memory got full. Then, the RAM also was limited. Some programs were running in the background when I'm not even using it. I tried closing the program, but it would run again. Then recently, it shut down by itself while I was at work. It was on my desk for 30 mins since I've last used it, and it was on screensaver mode. when I tried unlocking it, it wouldn't budge.. Tried turning it on or unlocking it to no avail. I took out the battery, put it back on then finally, it was able to turn on. The issue never reoccurred.Update: Its been almost a year since I've had this phone, when I use my external memory card, it would say \"unexpectedly remove\" even though I didn't take it out. The external memory card slot is probably loose thus effecting the programs. When I play music and skip some songs, it would hang then say \"unsupported format\"... After a 10-15 mins of shutting down the music program, it would work again properly. Because of this issue, I don't save programs/application to my memory card.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO PARECE SER ORIGINAL (NOT APPEAR TO BE ORIGINAL)", "Author": "lucio J. gonzalez U", "ReviewID": "R2PZKYKBD5W0DT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "LA CAJA DEL PRODUCTO NO ES LA ORIGINAL DEL GALAXY PARECE DE TELEFONO CHINO ADEMAS NO TRAJO LOS AUDIFONOS Y NI EL MANUAL Y LA BATERIA NO DICE SAMSUNG POR NINGUN LADO.PRODUCT BOX IS NOT THE ORIGINAL CHINESE PHONE GALAXY ALSO SEEMS NOT BROUGHT THE HEADPHONES AND NEITHER THE MANUAL SAYS NO BATTERY SAMSUNG FOR ANY SIDE.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Elixana Melchor", "ReviewID": "R3CMCZRW5ZS4E3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is working in a excellent way so far,and the shipment was on time.
