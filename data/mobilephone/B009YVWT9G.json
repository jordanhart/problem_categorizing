{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not your usual smartphone", "Author": "Bahston", "ReviewID": "R1PAFVP67WMY0N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a big smartphone: 5.5 x 3.5 inches. It's an odd shape; more square than the rectangular Samsung Galaxy Note, which it aims to compete with. I like the size/shape of the display for reading news and surfing the web. Some say it's too big to fit in one hand, but I don't find that to be the case. Graphics on the display are fair to middling. Apps load rather slowly too despite a quad core processor. This unlocked device came with French as the default language, so you'll need to change to English, and reset the clock and temperature settings also. I also had a freeze when doing a firmware update but I finally got it to update. Took a long time. So, not nearly as posh as a top-of-the line Samsung device, but I'm having fun with it for it now as a secondary device. I don't recommend it as your primary phone due to the size.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009YVWT9G"}}
