The phone does have a good feel and easy to use buttons and menues.  I ordered from Just cellular.  They were very eager to help me. BUT, they had to replace the phone three times.  They say that the phone was inspected and that they often break in transit.  Hmmmm, I am not sure if that explains the wrong charger they sent with the first one.

I took my phone (accidentally) into a lake with me. It seemed fine at first, the next morning I had black bars across the screen. By afternoon, the screen was done for. So the screen is done but, the rest of the phone works fine; that's the only reason I'm not giving it less stars, that and I really liked the phone up until then. I got a lot of compliments, some people even compared it to a morpher!

I wanted to love this phone, but it just didn't work. It is indestructible like they say. You can put it in water and throw it on the ground and it will keep working like the day you bought it. The only problem is that it didn't work very well on the day you bought it. The sound quality is horrible. My customers complained constantly that they couldn't hear me. There is a lag in the time that it takes for functions to change after pressing buttons. Example: If you hit the contact button, there will be about 2 seconds when you are still looking at the main screen before the contacts come to the screen. This phone would be awesome if it wasn't such a piece of junk.
