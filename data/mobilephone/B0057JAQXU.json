{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing Smart Phone", "Author": "Christian J. Fobian", "ReviewID": "RR3L89K4L4P54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to take the plunge and purchase a smartphone. After a lot of research I decided to go with T-Mobile's Samsung Dart and I must say, it is worth the price. Not only does this phone work as a contract phone, it works with prepaid plans. Since it runs on Droid software you have access to all the Droid apps. The wifi ability is simply amazing. Anywhere I go that has a wifi connection the phone will automatically use my wifi connection so that I don't use the data from my data plan, not to mention it's faster. I can also make calls through my wifi! The resolution is excellent, the sound quality is very clear, although I must admit that the iPod/iPhone does have a slightly better sound. The camera is a 3.1 megapixel camera which takes very clear and crisp photos. The GPS is just as good as my Garmin that I purchased last year. The phone comes with software to open pdf's and the Microsoft suite file types. The Swype keyboard software makes typing and texting FAST on a little digital keyboard, simply drag your finger from letter to letter and it will automatically figure out the words and throw in spaces for you.It's about time a good phone came out for us prepaid folk.Regardless weather your prepaid or contract, I highly recommend buying this phone if your looking for a smartphone to check email, Facebook, carry documents, listen to music, access the internet etc....UPDATE - 11/6/2011 (subtracting 1 star from rating)After owning this phone for almost 5 months I thought I would throw in an update that I felt people should know about. I love this phone, however, after owning it for awhile I did come across 1 issue that bugs me. The screen size is just a hair different than most smartphones. This makes a number of apps in the Android Market incompatible with this phone. Although there are not many apps that are incompatible, it is frustrating if you come across one.I would actually steer you towards the LG Optimus T if you want a prepaid/contract smartphone, as it does everything this phone does but is compatible with all the apps this phone can't handle. Other than that the phones are almost identical.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow!  Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Barnegat Bay", "ReviewID": "RX9VA1AHHT8R2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read many reviews prior to my decision to buy the Dart.  I was skeptical to say the least, as many reviews pooh-poohed the Dart.  As a pay-as you-go T-Mobile customer and owning a simple cell phone, I felt the need to step up and purchase a more versatile phone.  I didn't want to be so outdated.  The Dart being an \"entry level\" android smart phone at a very reasonable price seemed like a no-brainer.As a newbie in the world of smart phones, I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm sure most of the reviewers I've read own a far more superior smart phone than the Dart.  This may be the reason they were downplaying the Dart.  For $149, the screen resolution is better than expected.  The feel of the phone is nice.  The touch screen is wonderful.  The volume is very good.  The day pass to the web is $1.49 for 40MB of download at 3G speed.  After that it's 2G.  I don't need the web for business or any function other than occasional use, so the $1.49/3G/2G is fine with me.  The call quality is very good.  The QWERTY keyboard is very functionable, and  I haven't tried the Swype function yet.I upped the 2GB microSD card to 8GB so I can upload my MP3s, and photos, + other files from my computer.I can see why people get hooked on smart phones.  They are almost addictive.  I can't seem to put mine down.After I use the web, and other applications, and I think I have them closed, I see that my battery drains very fast.  One of the many useful shortcuts I added to my home page is \"Task Manager\".  I open this shortcut often and close all active applications.  My battery lasts much longer.Pros - Just about everything for the $149 in a \"pay as you go\" plan.Cons - The camera is somewhat adequate and video camera leaves much to be desired.  You need a steady and slow panning hand.  Quality - Eh!I recommend this phone.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent entry-level no-contract smartphone", "Author": "jokah", "ReviewID": "R2Z86WJZ59J7D6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the Dart on sale for $100 directly from T-Mobile and have had this phone for over a month.Battery life, as with most Android phones, is average.  With regular usage, I need to charge daily (I keep the charging USB cable in the office and the AC charger at home).  The camera isn't particularly good, but I don't mind since I have a dedicated point-and-shoot for doing serious photography.  If you are looking for 4G support, also note that this supports 3G only.  That said, I am using the Dart without a data plan, relying solely on wi-fi, which works great.The screen size on the Dart is smaller than most, but keep in mind that this phone has a very small footprint (see photo).  Having carried an LG Env2 previously, I opted for the Dart specifically because of its small size (see picture) as I wanted something that would fit comfortably in my pocket.  The downside of this, however, is that some applications (e.g. Words with Friends, AnyStop) are not supported by the Dart.I thought I would miss having a physical keyboard, but Swype works great for texting, and speech-to-text works reasonably well, too.PROS: small sizeCONS: average battery life, not-so-great camera[UPDATE 03/27/2012]I am still mostly satisfied with this phone (small size is its best feature IMO) but thought I'd add a few more observations.1. Internal app storage is somewhat lacking.  Naturally, I tried moving whatever apps I could to the microSD, but this is a limited solution.  I have not rooted the phone (and have no desire to do so) but am running the stock Android distribution.Running the DiskUsage app shows 177 Mb of internal memory, and I usually have about 20 Mb free, which is close to the threshold of triggering the low memory error.  I don't install an inordinately large amount of applications (Touchdown, Maps, Facebook, and ThinkFree Office are the biggest space users) so encountering the warning from time to time can be an annoyance.  I typically deal with this by clearing cache for various apps.2. I flip between using 3G and WiFi, disabling one or the other in an attempt to maximize battery life.  Sometimes this results in the phone entering a state where enabling WiFi returns an error repeatedly.  Usually, this can only be resolved by rebooting the phone.  I don't know if this is specific to Froyo or the Dart.3. I've dropped the phone on hard surfaces a few times (bare, no protective sleeve), and it works fine.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first smart phone--and I love it!", "Author": "S. King", "ReviewID": "R1YX1D7SNV5C8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally decided to join the smartphone bandwagon, but I refused to pay $70, $80 or even more for a data plan--like a lot of people I know do. I did a little research and found that T-Mobile had some very affordable plans (as do some other carriers), as long as you buy your own phone. Now, ever since I first owned a cell phone (around 1999), I have ALWAYS gotten the \"free\" phone that comes with a 1- or 2-year contract. But after comparing the cost of buying the phone from a 3rd party retailer (like Amazon) I realized I would be saving literally hundreds of dollars if I opted to forgoe the \"free\" phone route. This is of course because the identical plans that accompany \"free\" phones are basically $20/month more. Simple math: 24 months x $20 = $480!This review is supposed to be about the phone of course, but the point of why this phone is so great is tied into the fact that it is cheap, and allowed me a super-affordable entry into the world of smartphones. I'm not going to go into a ton of details about the phone, because I can't compare it side-by-side with other smartphones. But here are the things I really like about this phone:Design: It's really small and light, and yet very sturdy. The touch screen is amazingly precise, and the design of the operating system/software (whatever you want to call it) is fantastic. It's easy to use, and very intuitive. And it does a TON of things.Features: Again, I can't provide a detailed comparison with other phones, but I do know I love the features the Dart has. Some of them are basic, like quick checking of weather and news, the camera/camcorder, and access to the internet (ESPN, email, or anything else you want). But I was amazed by the voice-command function (which I didn't even realize it had until I bought it). This allows you to say basically anything into the phone (an address, a restaurant/store, or a website), and it very accurately displays what you say (I would estimate it gets 95% of what you say correctly, which I think is very impressive), and then displays links to maps or websites. I walked out of work the 2nd day I had the phone, spoke the name of a local deli, clicked the displayed phone number, and ordered my food. I thought that was pretty freaking cool! Other great features are the \"swype\" text feature, which makes texting super fast, the walking/driving navigation (which some people had told me costs extra money to activate for their phones--but this is free), and of course the android app store is great since there are so many free apps to download.I bought this phone for $143 from Amazon (I think I've seen it even cheaper since then), and I pay $50 a month for unlimited voice, text and data. It's true that I get only 100MB of data before the 3G speeds (which I find to be really fast) slow down to 2G. But I LOVE having no contract, and for my purposes even the 2G speeds are fine. The only substantial difference is that at 3G you can download videos and broadcasts quickly, and with 2G you are looking at several minutes for a 3-4 minute video). But everything else functions pretty well at even the 2G speed. And of couse I could upgrade my data plan by either: 1) going for the 2-year contract at the same $50/month, or 2) staying on the monthly plan and paying $60/month. For now, however, I am perfectly happy with my current plan, and I really love the phone.I finally entered the 21st century, and I'm doing it for $50/month!Quick Update 2/13/2012The phone also has Wi-Fi capability, so I'm able to connect with my wireless network at home and anywhere else there is an open Wi-Fi connection. When your Wi-Fi is enabled and connected the data usage does NOT count against your monthly allotment. This makes it very easy to stay under 100 MB/month.I've had the phone about 4 months now, and I still love it!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Functional Android Phone at great price", "Author": "Jon D. Knecht", "ReviewID": "R2WGGCCAPOZT29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the phone for a couple of months and at around a hundred bucks it is hard to say anything negative about this phone.  Of course it has battery issues it runs Android!!! Clear out apps with task manager, turn off automatic syncing and use the back key rather than the home key and you will be fine.  With wifi off it will go for a few days with out recharging.I use t-mobile pay as you go with no data plan and run wifi for data and email.  I had no issues with this it works for me, and I am not paying for that which I don't use.Update: the one thing that can be problematic with this phone is the main memory gets filled up rather quickly and apps like facebook/maps etc that do not write on the SD card take up the space quickly.  Other wise after well over year the phone has done everything I needed to do.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the camera and video quality.  The expandable memory is a big plus,  I have tons of music, pictures and use it transfer files from work and home when needed.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awful Phone and Terrible Tmobile Customer Service", "Author": "M. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R2XSH6AT7ZVK8J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two of the Tmobile (Samsung) Dart because I was considering switching from Sprint to T-mobile.  After I noticed several issues (which I'll discuss shortly), I returned them and purchased one more from Amazon.com a few weeks later, just to be make sure that I didn't get two from a bad batch.The phone has a nice form factor.  It is very small and thin, and takes up almost the same amount of space in my pocket as my very old Motorola RAZR.Unfortunately, the screen resolution is very poor, making it difficult to read text that appears in the default font.The battery tended to drain very quickly, which is surprising for a GSM phone.I also noticed that the Wifi data access was hit and miss.  Even though I had a strong Wifi connection, the phone would sometimes report having no data connection and then work again just as suddenly.I tested the two phones that I purchased and both experienced the same problem.  And then I purchased one more from Amazon.com, just to be sure.  The intermittent data connnectivity problems, low screen resolution, and poor battery life persisted.As bad as the phone is, however, the Tmobile customer service is even worse.  One of the features that really interested me was Tmobile's Wifi Calling feature, which lets you make and receive calls using your Wifi Access Point.  This is important to me because my house has very poor reception with all carriers.Although this phone is listed on Tmobile's web-site as supporting that feature (and the box specifically says that it is supported), I was never able to get it working.  Each time that I tried activating it, I received an error message (often a different one from the time before).I went online and found a number of complaints of similar problems in Tmobile's support forums.  Most had no solution posted, and the one that had a solution posted didn't work for me.I called T-mobile's technical support at least seven times in an effort to get the feature working.  In total, I spent over five hours, mostly on hold.  Most of them repeatedly asked questions that suggested that they didn't understand how the feature worked.  Each time that I called, I waited on hold for between 15 and 20 minutes before I was able to speak with a representative.  Most of the calls were answered by agents with heavy accents.During two of the seven calls, I was told that this phone doesn't support the Wifi Calling feature at all (even though the Tmobile's web-site says that it does and the phone has the app necessary to activate and configure the feature).One of the seven times that I called, I was actually transferred to five different representatives, with each one telling me that they couldn't help me, but that the next one could.  Ultimately, I ended up talking to a representative in the U.S. who said he could not help me either, but that he could transfer me back to the prior department (that had sent me to him).On two of my seven calls, the representative hung-up on me.  During two of the other calls, I asked that my call be escalated, and I was told that Tmobile technical support has no escalation procedures.On one of my calls, I was able to reach a supervisor.  She advised that the SIM card that I was using did not support Wifi calling and had me switch to another SIM Card.  After I switched, the service still didn't work.  She said that it could take up to two hours to provision, and that she would call me back in 2 hours.  She never called, and the service still does not work.I also attempted to call the local Tmobile retail store, and they told me that they could offer no assistance at all, other than referring me back to technical support.I also called Tmobile's corporate HQ in Bellevue, Washington, and was transferred to a Executive Customer Service Team voicemail, where I left a message that was not returned for several days.  Ultimately, a man called back.  He promised to investigate the matter and get back to me within a week.  Although I've called him back twice and left messages on his voicemail, I haven't heard from him since.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Add Skype subscription and you have unlimited everything!", "Author": "Ben Booker \"http://myspace.com/horriblecircuit\"", "ReviewID": "R2HCZCKSB9IX1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and I love it.

Still I want to share few things with you all. This is one of the best entry level smart phones that Samsung has introduced. Forget about the camera quality as you are just paying 120 bucks and for good quality pics one should always use digicam rather than mobile phones. As it is a android phone gmail and facebook just works perfectly. Web browser is also good. The entire android market is open for you so you can download and install the applications that you want. This wi fi featured phone has got one smart feature that is mobile hotsopt. You can share the mobile data i.e. 3G data to your laptop and other wi fi enabled devices. Go to Settings -> Tethering and portable hotspot -> Mobile AP setting and enable Mobile AP option.Do no forget to configure the key so that it is secured wireless connection. Isn't this feature is cool ?The another great feature is GPS. GPS is as good as any other GPS that you get for 70 to 80 bucks. do not forget to buy the car charger and car mounting kit as this mobile consumes lot of power for GPS.Considering all these things, I would say this is the phone which is value for money...!!!", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone For the Price!", "Author": "A Covarrubias", "ReviewID": "R360TDXMVGDS7L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a Android phone, but I didn't want to spend $300 more for one.  I paid $116 for this phone and for all the features this phone has that was a great price.  The description of this phone says the screen size is 3.1\" that is not true, but I knew that before I purchased it by reading the reviews.  The total screen size is 2 1/2 x 2\" and the size of the phone is 4 1/4 x 2 1/4.  Of course the screen size on this phone is not as large as the HTC Evo or I phone, but it suits me very well.  I wasn't expecting everything that you can do with this phone, so I was pleasantly surprised.  You can set up you email accounts and the phone will alert you to when you have new messages.  There is a gps that works pretty well even though the screen is small.  You can download apps for the android market.  I haven't downloaded but a few and so far I have had no problems.  I saw one review that said Angry Birds did not work for this phone because of the screen size, but I have no desire to play it on a screen this small.  I have downloaded UNO and it works pretty well.  The graphic of the screen are descent and the colors are bright.  The camera is not the best but it is not bad.  Pictures look best when you take them in bright light and are still. You can view pdf documents and make them larger.  Of course you have to move them around on the screen to see the whole document.  Calls are clear and the ringers are very loud.  The speaker phone is descent also.  You can hear the person you are talking to really well and they could hear me... so that was a plus.  One of my favorite things about this phone is I can say \"call Jackie\" and it dials the number for me!  You can also say something like \"directions to Nashville, TN\" and it pulls up the directions!  The keys are really small, but surprisingly input is pretty accurate.  This phone has the 'Swype' input system so that makes it really easy to type a text message.  Swype is an entry method where you place your finger on the first letter of the word you are typing and just slide it from letter to letter.  It works pretty well.  All in all I highly recommend this phone to anyone who does not want to dish out over $200.  It is well worth the price at $116, and I received overnight shipping for $3.99 with my Amazon Prime.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "battery sucks", "Author": "Drew", "ReviewID": "R2O5JLEDBET1IK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Battery will last about 8 hours at mininium usage and have not found a bigger battery like you can for other phones.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "info8675", "ReviewID": "R2G2FRFXVCXDP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone and could not be happier.Please keep in mind that this is my first smartphone.All of the touch screens work smoothly.

I have the LG Optimus T and for only a few bucks more, it has better screen resolution and a better camera with autofocus.  However, I bought this for my son, and for a kids first smartphone, I would say this is just fine.  For adults, no way, keep on looking for a better phone on sale.  What I do like is that this phone is responsive enough and feels peppy, the processor and memory are both adequate for a budget smartphone. Colors are also nice and bright.  And the price can't be beat for an android smartphone.  What I don't like, is the screen - the non clear text really gets to me - if i had bought it for myself, it would be a dealbreaker and I'd send it back and spend the extra to get a better phone.

I don't think it's just my phone. I could not make sense of the varying reports on the battery life and suspect it has to do with what apps you have installed. Also confirmed my suspicions when I read at the T-Mobile support site that third party apps can drain the battery. Try this solution if you can live without the apps and don't want to worry about your phone dying all the time. This is why I give it four stars. Ideally you could install apps without this limitation.

You can also SWIPE the keyboard, which also works great--Swipe is 10 times faster than typing and talking is 100 times faster!2.

Photos: Just fine for 2 mega pix--lots of bells and whistles for both camera and video options.5. Contact management is easy and fast--You can also speak your contacts into the phone.6. Some cool Aps pre-loaded--GPS Directions, You-tube, News and Weather--Not much extra junk is included--just order your own.7. Most of the screens scroll left to right instead of just up and down---I like that.8. Battery charges with standard USB--I like that; don't you just hate proprietary plugs!!9.

The phone is inexpensive, yet it works better than some of the $500 Samsung models from last year. Frankly, I get burned out on a phone by the end of  one  year; I hate two year contracts.

I ordered it specifically because it is supposed to access WiFi.After I had activated my SIM card at a T-Mobile retail store, the first thing I did was check the WiFi; it said \"disconnected,\" even though it recognized the WiFi that's available in my house. I searched online and found that this seems to be a common problem among Samsung phones in the U.S. I tried all the solutions that other people had suggested in forums: \"forgetting\" the wireless network and re-inputting it, rebooting the phone, performing a factory reset. Nothing.So, I contacted a Samsung technician via livechat. He 1) spoke very poor English and 2) seemed less familiar with wireless products than I am. That was of little help.I then contacted a T-Mobile customer service representative. We went through the steps to check and see if it was an issue with the phone's APN settings, or my wireless internet; the APN settings seem to be functioning correctly, and my router also has no problems. She said this must be an issue with my internet service, but after speaking with two IT technicians, temporarily disabling the security settings and changing the encryption key on my wireless network, we've verified that my wireless internet is not the source of the problem.Finally, I spoke with an Amazon customer representative to see about returning the product but keeping the SIM card. I've activated my account already, and T-Mobile has a policy where if you use their \"No contract\" prepaid plans, you must use the plan for 6 continuous months or face a cancellation fee; so in fact, it is not a \"no-contract phone,\" it's a 6-month contract phone. This is why I wanted to keep my SIM card. The Amazon customer representative said he could not help me, and a wireless specialist would email me within 24-48 hours. Amazon customers are not allowed to chat or phone with wireless specialists.So, basically, Amazon sent me a defective product that neither its manufacturer, Samsung, or the phone company it's connected to, T-Mobile, can fix. And they're making me wait 2 days to see if I can even return the phone.If one of your prerequisites is to get a phone that needs to access WiFi, other than the GalaxyS, I can't recommend Samsung products. And I don't know if I can trust buying any wireless products from Amazon anymore, after the poor customer service I've received.=========An update. I added a star for the exemplary service I got from Amazon WIRELESS; NOT Amazon.com. To explain:As I said, the Amazon live chat representative told me to wait 24-48 hours to hear from Amazon wireless. After waiting the first 24 hours, I decided to try to call Amazon.com customer service myself, thinking that my question (that I wanted to return the phone, and if I could keep the SIM card or not) was simple enough that an Amazon.com customer rep could call the Wireless team and get back to me with an answer.The customer rep I spoke to said she didn't know the answer to my question, but she DID give me the phone number to Amazon wireless, saying they would be more qualified to help me. When I explained my problem to the customer rep there, he said that because I had ordered my phone through Amazon.com, NOT Amazon Wireless, that I needed to direct my question to Amazon.com.\"But two different Amazon.com people said that I needed to talk to Amazon wireless to resolve my issue.\"The guy put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and then he was gracious enough to answer my question about the SIM card (you can keep it, by the way), AND he sent me a return package label, all when I wasn't an Amazon Wireless customer, but an Amazon.com customer.So, a sort-of-thumbs down for Amazon.com: it took two customer service reps for them to send me to someone who would help me, when they were supposed to be helping me from the start. And a big resounding thumbs-up to Amazon Wireless for helping me even when I wasn't an Amazon Wireless customer.Lesson learned? If I ever order from Amazon again, I'll make sure I'll be ordering specifically from Amazon Wireless, and Not the main Amazon.com website.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a good phone!!", "Author": "PAMELA JOHNSON", "ReviewID": "R1KOCXAJ7CNO25", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my first smart phone.

Picks up wifi easily at public hotspots such as at the airport. As routine, I put the phone on the charger every night. I did shut off the gps but the wifi stays on. I use Task Manager to stop apps that are not needed. I do not have a data plan - just bare bones voice and text extra ($.20 per message) with T-Mobile. The phone is fast, responsive, well built and has a small footprint. I inserted the micro sd card right out of my old BB Bold - picture, music worked perfectly. The sim card worked flawlessly transfered from the Blackberry. I'd say this phone over the five year old BB is a lightyear ahead.

In order to save my eardrums I called tech support and was told that there was nothing that could be done about it, which angered me until I discovered that the volume for this could be adjusted in the \"system audio\" settings.  I found it strange that their support people didn't know how to do this.The second problem was when I tried to pair the phone to the bluetooth in my car's audio system.  I got the message that the phone was paired to my car, however the voice control in the car didn't work.  I later discovered that you need to drag down the notifications bar during the pairing process to download the phonebook.  The only other issue, is if you use your google contacts and type them in Firstname, Lastname in your contact list, in my car, a 2011 Elantra, I have to say the Lastname first in order for the voice recognition to work.  Not sure if this is true for all cars, but I didn't have to do that with my previous phone from Straight Talk.This morning when I turned on the phone there was a big yellow triangle on the screen and a message that said \"downloading\", which never went away.  I called tech support and they helped me reboot the phone which cleared out all my data.  He said I must have hit the volume and power buttons at the same time, which is easy to do because they are on opposite sides of the phone right where it is natural to hold it.The biggest problem I am having is that when the phone is shut off, voicemail picks up after 1 or 2 MINUTES!!...Or just goes to a busy signal after 1 or 2 minutes, which pretty much makes the voicemail unusable.  It does seem to work regularly when the phone is left on.I am undecided as to whether or not I will keep this phone or T-Mobile or not, but there are some pluses.  The Dart is like a poor man's Iphone in that it does much of what an Iphone does but the resolution isn't even close and the smaller screen size is noticable.  But, having true internet access on my phone is convenient...being able to sync my contact list off my gmail account is very cool...and being able to use wifi, especially for voice...is a huge advantage since my cell service sucks at home because of the terrain around us.I will play with the voicemail and consider leaving the phone on all day until bedtime so I can receive voicemail most of the time, which I think might be practical.  But, I would be curious to know if anyone else is having the same problem with their voicemail on T-Mobile.Except for the voicemail issue, I would recommend this phone for someone wanting a decent entry level smart phone. As for T-Mobile, they seem about as good as most other carriers...in other words they suck too.

Nothing to do with the phone, but our experience with T-Mobile, from the original setting up to solving problems, mostly accounting, is nothing short of horrible. They took $50+ dollars out of our account because the number they assigned us was previously assigned to a deadbeat, so every time we added $$$, Whoosh, it was gone again. Their CS people are rude and uniformed.  They will contradict each other and when you complain they aren't helping with your question or problem, they just hang up, or they put you on hold for a supervisor who never comes on the line.  No, they are not in Bangladesh, but they are worse if that is conceivable.  I finally went to my local store and the counter rep tried to talk with the CS people and she was hung up on twice!  When calling in you go thru the punch 1, punch 2 over and over and then after finally getting a live person and explaining your problem, the say \"Oh gee, that's not my area and switch you to another rep with whom you must explain your problem once again from the beginning, only to have that rep say Oh gee, that's not my area and immediately switch you to another line on hold, etc. etc. This happens every time I called.

My kids use the phone in WiFi mode only; however, make sure they know what they are doing because it is very easy to hit a button and, viola, you are on the T-Mobile network & getting charged by the MB.This is a good choice for a smart-style phone for those who want a smart-style phone, but do not need to be continuously connected to the internet on T-Mobile's network. For a kid's phone, it is a great choice.If you want a little fancier phone that has more capability but is still budget friendly, look at Nokia Lumia 710 4G Windows Phone (T-Mobile).

There is limited internal memory so you will run out of space even with an external micro Ed card. Most apps will only install to the internal memory.
