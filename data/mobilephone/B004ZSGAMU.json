I can't imagine having a different phone. I feel it surpasses the iPhone in a few ways. For one, it has a bigger and sharper screen. If you're planning to play games, watch movies or shows, this is the phone for you. It might not seem like it's \"that much\" bigger, but it is and it makes a difference. The screen is sharp enough that I watch Netflix and HBO shows on my phone all the time (did I mention the WiFi is strong enough on the phone for this to be possible?). Also, a lot of people think they simply must have their music on their iPods. Once I got this phone, I sold my old iTouch. Are iPods better at handling music then the Droid X? Yes. But is it a significant upgrade? No, not at all. The music quality is the exact same, so the only difference is the interface. It's very easy to get the music from your computer onto the phone as well, simply a drag and drop process. Having owned the phone for almost a year and half, I have to say that the battery has declined over time. When I got the phone, the battery life was about 8-10 hours using it somewhat throughout the day. Now that is about 5-7 hours of heavier use. Even so, I still love this phone and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "A. A. Glazer \"world wide web wanderer\"", "ReviewID": "RHFHW4WNZZF44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me a while to decide what phone to buy - did lots of research. I believe in yesterday's technology when it is still good. This is. It does everything the new phone of today do. Only issue I have - and I've reaad about it in many reviews - is the camera. It is very slow to respond. But that is not why I have it. I have a good DSLR and it doesn't bother me that the camera in my phone is not that great.  Everything else works wonderfully. Great reception....I can hear and be heard well. It finds my wireless very quickly. Lots (LOTS) of options in the settings menu. It is extremely highly customizable. There are seven (7) home pages to set up whatever you may need. I have it set up as one with my calendar, another with music/radio apps, another with oft used numbers, another with a sticky note and one with photos, one with navigation and map stuff and the last with misc apps including my Siri-like helper (works great by the way).  The battery isn't great, but it lasts all day. I am used to charging it each night. I bought a second battery so it's there if I do need it. Get a case of some sort (even though it's a pretty device, you need to cover it) - and a screen protector. I have two different types of cases I got here on Amazon (the battery too). I also suggest you get a Bluetooth if you don't already have one - pairing is simple and fast.  But back to the Droid X - it is great. I love my phone and use it for many things all day, every day. The fact that it is larger than most other phones is nice. I can see better with the extra real estate. Carrying it is no bother if you have the right case. It will fit in your pocket - but be careful you don't break it there.  Great phone. If something happened to mine - I'd get another one.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for our uses", "Author": "Breanna Rudd", "ReviewID": "R3W31LYRBSQSRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone to use with StraightTalk, kid \"needed\" a smartphone.

I absolutely love the camera.  The 8 megapixels means that I have clear, high quality pictures that I can use for digital scrapbooking, printing, and sharing with friends and family.  I love that my video and still camera is always at my fingertips.  In addition, I use this phone for hours every day to check email, text, play games, wake up in the morning, play music, listen to digital books, and find out how to get where I'm going.  Oh, and sometimes I even make calls with it!  It's pretty great for that too!  I also like that the touch screen keyboard has good sized buttons.  I rarely have typos, but have been known to have some auto-correct fails from time to time.  The only thing I don't like about this phone is that I have to have two sets of music libraries, one on Amazon, and one on ITunes.

It has held up from the drops and oops and still keeps going strong.  The biggest disadvantage today for this phone is that you are limited to what version of Android your carrier decides to stop at before no longer upgrading.  It is well capable of handling the later versions of the android operating system but unfortunately for me, my carrier has discontinued android OS updates at 2.3.  But if you are willing to live with that then this phone is a good reliable choice.  Battery life is good but like most batteries these days, they start to dwindle in lifespan after a couple years and you are stuck at either upgrading or spending a premium for Motorola's replacement battery.This phone does it all well and in my opinion works better than an Iphone.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great replacement", "Author": "GolfingNut \"Lovin' It\"", "ReviewID": "R1MNPT67EMX9ZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone came right on time and was in excellent condition.

Within the first 6 months the phone continuously turned itself on and off, especially when I was trying to make phone calls (and one time, during an emergency). Within the first 2 months I got a replacement phone, thinking my first one may have just been a fluke. The next one was slightly better at the time, but quickly deteriorated as well. Two years later my Droid X barely makes phone calls anymore (it takes 3-4 minutes to place a call), randomly sends text messages from 2-3 months ago to people, and as of last week does not send text messages anymore. The battery life is laughable and the overall operating system is slow as molasses (it takes at least a minute just to open an app or the camera). I know a lot of people on here just got this phone and are saying it's wonderful but let me tell you - it will not last.

Now my girlfriend loves pictures and taking pictures and using apps to edit them into collages. So when i found this phone with a nice 5 inch screen and a 10MP camera with flash at a very offordable price i was all over it. However some flaws with the camera kept her from enjoying it like we wanted. For example it says 10mp camera however the quality of the pictures look nothing like it and no its not because i have the settings wrong...it just doesnt look that good and the flash is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. When you take a picture with the flash its like the timing of the flash is off and the picture always has excess brightness...then on top of that about 2 weeks ago the camera button on the bottom right side of the phone quit working so its difficult to take pictures of us together.As far as the actual phone it actually works really well with no white noise and never drops a call unless signal is completely lost. Battery life is not the best but not bad either about 10 hours with moderate use. No over heating and downloads/runs most apps quite smoothly.So overall the phone is not too bad just i meant this review to be a warning to the people like me who are thinking about buying this phone for picture/media related purposes.

My phone can be fully charged, but will go dead after 20 minutes of talking on it. Basically, it's crap and the battery life is horrible! I also have a friend that purchased the same phone from this company, and he received the same results.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "I REALLY WISHED I CAN LOVE THIS PHONE...", "Author": "elchamber", "ReviewID": "R3Q5CLIVS875DG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone has a bigger screen than my old iPod Touch and iPhone 4.  It had an expandable memory so I can fill this puppy up with MP3s, pictures and videos(I had 7 feature films I own in it with plenty of room to spare).  I didn't need a case or screen protector.  With an iPhone now, it was liberating not caring about the dropping this phone since it's sort of built like a tank.  I have a refurbished one(explained below) and the only thing time has done to it's exterior is some paint gone and usually smudges andfinger prints due to daily use.  Had to replace the battery.  It good since I replacement batteries are like $10 bucks for two.  Since it's an Android, your apps will constantly have updates with and without firmware updates for the phone's OS.Again, a perfect phone for people who want a smartphone that can do the basic things you need and want without all the bells-and-whistles that newer smartphones today have.  You can really have it pass your 2-year contract.I really wish I can love this phone or basically like it, but, after a year, was the most stressful thing I have ever have.  It freezes, lags, re-boots itself, and doesn't download anything on WiFi.  Not being able to use it on WiFi was what broke my alliance with Android.  All that freezing and lagging could be worked on.  All I had to do was to make it work like an iPhone or basic cellphone.  No updating widgets or background data service and this phone is still good to go.  But the WiFi just sucked.  It would connect and stay connected, but would NOT download anything.  The second biggest problem was when my first Droid X totally corrupted the microsdHC in it.  That SD was 32 gigs!  So Verizon sent me a refurbish one.  Son of a BITC... I would have rather have my old, original, corrupted Droid X back.  At least I can use WiFi on it.  Battery life sucks, but you can always get another battery.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone sold as new wasn't Be careful", "Author": "kimberley L", "ReviewID": "R12E4VEWLLHIN5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Loved phone when i got it But, phone stopped working after 1week.

That replacement offer was a limited-time deal, while the model was current, and matches what many users here describe as their display problems: banding, black screens, etc. I had that issue, and had my phone refurbished by Verizon at the time.Motorola batteries typically last two years before they start to degrade, in my experience, and the X was no exception. I began replacing my batteries two years after purchasing the phone, and replaced them at intervals thereafter. I didn't have the issues with the battery cover falling off that others have had, but then I was reasonably careful with it, and it was inside a case whenever it was being carried in a purse or bag.The current model Droid is located here, for nearly the same price (under contract): http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-DROID-MAXX-Verizon-Wireless/dp/B00E9W8Q1A/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid;=1400025145&sr;=8-9&keywords;=motorola+droid.

Since I still did not want to tack on extra $$ for data (especially since I get data on my iPad = $60/month just for 2 devices to be on data!) I bought a phone the salesman told me was a \"great texting phone\".  This turned out to be very false as the phone was extremely slow and lagged constantly.  Then Verizon introduced the new pricing feature making it much more affordable for my family to have data.  So I was on the prowl for a better prepaid phone that I could replace my p.o.s. with.  I stumbled upon this baby.  I've had it a few days and its incredible!  I love it!  So happy I bought it.  Now would I be this thrilled if I owned an iPhone 5 or a more recent droid?  Probably not but since I was upgrading from a non smart phone this thing is incredible to me.  I really love apple, but didn't want to put out the $$ for a used beat up iPhone 4.  I'm actually enjoying this more than I think I would an iPhone!One thing to be aware of:  I bought this phone \"new\" and it certainly looks and performs that way.  I doubt it was actually new but the company certainly made sure it looked nice.  I can't complain about that.  I also bought a sandisk 32 gb sdhc card \"frustration free packaging\".  Do NOT DO THIS!  It was crashing my droid and I couldn't understand since the Droid X is supposed to support 32 GB.  I figured out its because FF Packaging is basically repacking refurbished sd cards.  I replaced that with one I bought at walmart and it actually works in the phone.

I will admit, honest and truly, that when it comes to some operations - mainly the browser and map navigator - this thing handles amazingly. It definitely pushes that data through very well and the battery holds up surprisingly good for such activities. The problem is, I can't even use it as a phone. More precisely, I try and use it for phone activities and it stalls and falters and sometimes (pathetically) reboots. For example, as I type this, I've been trying to send a text to a friend for almost six minutes now. The phone takes usually over a minute just to bring up my contacts when I click that button, about another half minute to fully load the list (I admit, I have a decent bit on there due to Facebook syncing), and then when I go and click my recipient I can usually expect to be treated to a minute or two (and right now I'm at about four) of \"not responding\" messages before it finally gives in and lets me compose and send a text, like it just did now actually. Only took about seven minutes and I always strive to make sure I have a third to half the phone's RAM open. That's quality. Same happens with the dialer too. Go into contacts, stall, look for friend, stall, click on friend, stall, stutter for about a minute when I press \"dial.\" I guess this leads to one more positive aspect of this phone that I should mention before ending this, and that it's pretty darn durable. Because, trust me, once you've had your fifth, five-minute wait to reply to an important text, or your dozenth dropped call because the phone does not bother to actually become active when someone is ringing you, and so on, you're going to throw it at the wall.

I should have thought that the Seller would have exercised some discretion in this matter due to the varying difficulties pertinent to time sensitivity expressed in this matter.I sought to return the Phone to the seller, only to find that the cost associated with returning the Phone would have been eighty percent (80%) of the initial cost for the Phone.

Highly recommend to others!!!", "Author": "Josephineas", "ReviewID": "R2M8NWAS3WTC2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally looking at this phone on Verizon over 1 year ago when it was time to renew my 2-yr contract -- but I went with the @ (LG Spectrum 2, VS930) instead... I am just over 1 year into my two-year mandatory contractual obligation to Verizon with my LG Spectrum 2., so this won't be used with services as a registered mobile phone... The reason I wanted it??? Instead after about 10 years of going through so many brands, models, styles, sizes, qualities etc-etc-etc., of @ \"(Traditional) MP3 Players\"., I set out to look on the market for something different to use as an @ \"MP3 Music Player\" and \"Photo Viewer\" and if needed also as an \"Video Player\"... This Droid X by Motorola., like all other new technologies of \"Smart Phones\" in general., has so many features that traditional mobile multimedia @ \"MP3 Players\" just do not have and cannot offer -- and the quality of pictures, videos, music, etc-etc-etc., is also superior to traditional MP3 Players in my general experience of use... After searching on Amazon in both the @ \"Prepaid Cell Phone\" section and @ \"Used (Previously Owned) Branded System Contractual Deactivated Cell Phone\" sections like this Droid X is... I narrowed my likeness in selection down to dozen of phones that I really liked -- with this (Motorola Droid X) being among the top 3 for my available price-range... I needed a computer part; so I managed to purchase this phone also to my order previously used from @ [BluTekUSA] for $45... So very glad I did, and in love with it!Now...I am not a phone and phone-technology knowledgeable expert, so my views are given with a grain of salt... But my views for what I use it for and experiences with it are as follows...{{{Physical Quality}}} The \"Physical Quality\" of the phone's structure is amazing and superb -- extremely durable and despite being thin is of the same thickness as my @ (LG Spectrum 2)... The frame of the phone is made out of strong hard-casted \"aluminum metal\" -- and far superior quality to my @ LG Spectrum 2 which is made out of @ \"Plastic\"... I feel that if I dropped my @ LG Spectrum 2, it would shatter instantly into a hundred pieces -- but this Motorola Droid X would survive... This Motorola Droid X is really hefty (noticeable weight to it) when holding it in your hands and heavier than my LG Spectrum 2., which is good and lends to its quality of stability and durability... This Motorola Droid X is well built and designed all around, and feels really comfortable in your hands with a good grip of control... The back frame of the phone is @ \"Aerodynamic\", up where the @ \"Camera\" is which helps in gripping and controlling the phone from slipping out of your Hands... Overall, in my view, the @ \"physical quality\" of this Motorola Droid X is superior to that of my newer generation smartphone of @ LG Spectrum 2!!!{{{Screen Size and Touchscreen Type/Quality/Response-Time}}} The @ \"Screen Size\" is 4.3 inches -- which is a breath of fresh air, sort of speak, when coming from traditional mobile multimedia @ \"MP3 Players\" which only have a general usual tiny screen-size of @ \"1.6 inches to 3.2 inches\" and need a Magnifying-glass to view everything... With the 4.3 inch screen, I am able to enjoy and view all my photos, music, and videos perfectly clearly with every detail in focus -- note to mention: also able to operate the features/options of the phone with ease versus small touchscreens of traditional MP3 Players... The @ \"Touchscreen Type\" is @ \"Capacitive\"., so this basically means that it operates from the static energy produced by your fingers in which you barely have to touch the screen to operate its programs/options of buttons., and responds instantly after giving a push-command to the screen vs. that of @ \"Resistive Touchscreens\" which you have have to press on the screen and press hard to operate its programs/options and usually takes a slower response-time of about 1-2 seconds generally... The @ \"Response Time\" of this phone is instant and lightning(blitzkrieg) fast -- not only equal to my @ LG Spectrum 2 and my mother's Samsung Galaxy S-III.,but far superior(faster quality) in response-times than my Spectrum 2 also in a lot of areas of operation... The only problem often a nuisance, because it's @ \"Capacitive\" and so sensitive: if you're not conscious about it, than even having simply your fingertips on the edge will randomly active the screen with command gestures for options/features/programs/buttons on the screen., and often annoying when playing music and all of a sudden it switches to another song or folder etc., without actually touching the screen and pushing anything... Even if you don't remember to @ \"dim the screen to standbye\" after doing something like changing a song etc., even the slightest breeze gust of @ Wind will active the screens' features/options/programs and even simply pressing the phone up against your body etc., will do it... You really have to be conscious when using @ \"Capacitive Touchscreens\"... But the @ \"Lightning Speed in Responses Times\" is well worth every bit of the nuisance., reducing my stress and impatience from ADD/ADHD from throwing the thing up against the wall etc from waiting even a second or two which seems like an eternity., lulz... Another reason why I wanted to break away from traditional @ MP3 Players, and try something new!{{{Screen Clarity}}} The @ \"Screen Clarity\" is amazing, beautiful and immaculate -- and equal if not better in ways to my @ LG Spectrum 2... Everything is clear and vibrant, easily readable, and detailed especially when viewing my selection of PC Wallpapers and personal Photos -- and a breath of fresh air, sort of speak, from the usual @ \"Gaussian Blur (Pixelaration)\" produced by traditional multimedia mobile @ MP3 Players., and just another reason yet why I wanted to try these as use as multimedia mobile players vs. traditional mobile multimedia MP3 Players!{{{Audio/Sound Clarity Quality}}} The @ \"Audio and Sound Clarity Quality\" is excellent and fantastic... The Audio and Sound is very loud and easily understandable -- especially when playing my @ Music., without any distortion static disruptions as occurred on a lot of my traditional MP3 Players [especially when I increased the volume level up]... I was pleasantly surprised at how great this Phone sounded when playing my @ Music., and only on poor low vocal and melody quality of songs did the phone sound weak and distant and hard to hear... I have been using this Phone as my MP3 Player for one-week now, and I am really impressed and happy with it!!! This Motorola Android X, also has played every single song in my folders with any recognized errors... It does perfectly what I wanted and got it for -- as an standalone @ \"MP3 and Multimedia Player\"... The @ Audio and Sound quality and clarity., especially when playing music., is on par or better than almost every traditional multimedia MP3 Player I've used...{{{Pictures, Background, Picture Response Time, and Picture Quality}}} The @ \"Picture Quality\" is fantastic and equal when comparing side-by-side to my (LG Spectrum 2) and my mother's (Samsung Galaxy S-III)... Every picture is clear, vibrant, and detailed... The @ \"Response Time\" when using the @ \"Camera Mode\" and \"Taking Pictures\" is instant and lightning fast -- equal if not faster at times than my LG Spectrum 2 and mother's Samsung Galaxy S-III... Before I can even finish clicking the button and take my finger off -- the photo is already saved and ready to be viewed to the internal HD or external Micro-SD Card without delay... Also when viewing your personal-Photos and PC-wallpapers in @ \"Browser Mode\"., the @ \"Operation Response Times\" such as @ \"Scrolling(Up and Down)\" and \"Pushing(Forwards and Backwards)\" to view photos -- is instantaneous without delay and lightening fast also... Actually, it's a lot faster taking pictures in @ \"Camera Mode\" and viewing them in \"Browser Mode\" than my newer LG Spectrum 2 and mother's Samsung Galaxy S-III... I have never had with this Motorola Droid X, as of yet, any @ \"busy load delays\" when loading folders and viewing pictures and operating picture editor-options etc., as I have on my LG Spectrum 2... Every picture is ready instantaneous to be viewed one right after the other... I was pleasantly surprised with this!!! I have a personalized folder with @ 1,000 PC-wallpapers in them, and I can scroll through the entire folder viewing everything in 1 minute give or take without load-delays or system-problems or play-errors... WOW!!! Also, one of the biggest factors in me transforming from traditional mobile multimedia @ MP3 Players to mobile multimedia @ Smartphones as Standalone MP3 Player., is because for the fact that all @ Smartphones not only allows you to upload your own pictures -- but set them as the @ \"Device Background Wallpaper\" which only a few select traditional MP3 Players allow you to do., and if the Seller or Company doesn't list that fact of capability in their description -- you really have to go out on a whim when buying an MP3 player and hope it allows you the capability to \"Set Photo as Background\" and let alone have good visual clarity/quality in the process... With these @ Smartphones; I know they all do in allowing that \"Photo as Background\" option -- so this is yet perhaps for me thee biggest reason as too why I decided to break away from traditional MP3 Players for Smartphone w/ MP3-Music Players!!!{{{Camera and Video Quality, Type Format, and Response Time}}} The @ \"Camera and Video Quality\" is great and lighting quick... Before I can even finish positioning my hand to different angles etc., the Camera and Video already recognizes where I am going and gets there first ready to start viewing... The @ \"Video Quality Format Type\" taken and played is HD-720p., and the @ \"Photo Quality Format Type\" taken and viewed is up to HD-8MB... Every Video and Picture taken -- especially in my apartment which is poor lighting., has been virtually crystal clear without any @ \"Gaussian Blur (Distorting Pixelaration, Yellow Grain, White Grain etc)\"., which always seems to occur with both traditional MP3 Players and traditional Digital Cameras... The Camera-mode and Video-mode and Editor options are easy to use and operate... Another reason moving from traditional MP3 Players, is the fact that these Smartphones like this Android X by Motorola have Digital Cameras and Video Camcorders -- so I don't have to lug around extra baggage of a Camera, Camcorder, and Music Player and have everything ready in one package on the go; plus the HD-quality of the Videos and Pictures on of this Motorola Android X is far better than most standalone traditional MP3 Players and Digital Cameras that I have owned and used from $100 and under... I don't use Cameras and Camcorders much; but having them in case I want or need to -- as such when camping, nature hiking, intimate relations, etc-etc-etc., is nice and easing... I don't use my Smartphones for any video/movie watching; but just having the option too is also nice to have for when if I want or decide too...{{{Features}}} This Motorola Droid X Smartphone has tons of programs/features and options -- virtually everything is standard according to mandatory @ \"Android Operating System\" requirements., and that you'll find on newer generations of technology smartphones such my (LG Spectrum 2) or my mother's (Samsung Galaxy S-III)... When comparing this Motorola Droid X vs. my LG Spectrum 2 or my mother's Samsung Galaxy S-III; actually there is very little that this Motorola Droid X doesn't have with regards to options and programs/features that newer generations of smartphones don't have... Among the only things lacking that I can find versus say new generation smartphones such as my LG Spectrum 2 for example -- is the lack of any fancy colorful stylish @ \"System Themes and Icons\" for the Android O.S and is bare/dull system theme of @ \"Grey w/ on White\"... This fact is a bummer; but one of which can easily be rectified with freeware apps in \"Google App Play Store\" for changing themes such as the @ \"Go Launcher EX\" etc... Outside the obvious @ Motorola Android System \"Theme\" and \"Icons\" difference., and also the \"Chipset-hardware\" technology used in the device may no longer be currently produced on the market -- but everything else is still current with regards to the familiar Android O.S system structure, Aero appearance, and its apps and widgets etc., which is unchanged in newer smartphones e.x. phone, contacts, messages, internet, google search, google play, youtube, facebook etc-etc-etc., all that stuff... How you operate the system with its controls and also from the main-screen desktop is unchanged e.x. press and hold down on the screen and pops-up menu for wallpapers, widgets, apps, settings etc-etc-etc... This Motorola Android X, was released in 2010 and only 4 years old, so its still fairly current technology -- and considered obsolete after around 10-12 years... The physical features itself of the Phone includes an @ \"Mini HDMI to Full HDMI TV/Monitor Port or Mini HDMI TV/Monitor Port\" and an Red-button for instant @ \"Camera/Camcorder\"... It also has your usual controls such as backwards and forwards., options/settings., homescreen (return)., and also the power/dim-screen button...{{{Loading Files}}} The great things I like about these Smartphones, is that they like are majority of traditional @ MP3 Player and don't really need software... Simply connect the phone to Windows, and Windows automatically installs the driver itself, and you're ready to go... One only needs real software for @ Firmware Upgrades and Cloud Data Backup... Once into Windows from the desktop after Windows installing the driver; simply @ \"Drag and Drop\" your files into either the internal Hard-drive or external Micro-SD Card drive and you're good to go., and simply go into your particular system app for @ music, photos, videos, etc-etc-etc., to find and use them... Simple!!!{{{Battery Charge Time}}} Man, this thing is lightning fast... This the fastest Device with the quickest charging time ever... The phone literally recharges from an @ \"dead(drained) battery\" to full capacity use in literally only about @ 30 minutes if that -- actually had it fully recharged in about 20 minutes several occasions... I am really happy with this, since I don't have to wait the usual @ \"4-8 hours Recharge Time\" as with almost all other @ Smartphones and standalone MP3 Players., as too enjoy my music again etc...{{{Hours of operation}}} It's been a long time since I had a Device that could last more than the usual @ \"6-8 Hours (Continuous Playback, 2-4 Hours with Intermittent Operations)\"... On estimate, this Motorola Droid X gets roughly about @ \"14-20 [give or take] Hours of Continuous Playback\" for @ Audio., and roughly about half of that [give or take] of about @ \"8 Hours Audio Playback w/ Intermittent Operations\"... This is amazing!, and literally without 'intermittent operations of the Droid_X's features e.g. changing songs, volume levels, turning screen on and off, etc., constantly' can last almost the entire period of the 24 hour day on Audio... Sure this will change once the Battery is used(charged and uncharged) over time and the Battery begins to die(not hold a charge, or a hold limited charge) and need to be replaced... But even with my perplexity for \"Intermittent Operations\" of changing songs constantly, flipping through folders, changing volume levels, screen on and screen off etc-etc-etc., every few minutes or seconds -- I still get about @ \"8 Hours\" of Audio playback versus about 2-4 Hours of standalone MP3 Players and most other Smartphones... I am very pleased with this!, and when not connected to my Apt Wall AC-outlet for \"Continuous Power Charge\" and my Dell 100Watt 5.1 Dolby Surround Hometheater Speakers for \"My Home Stereo System\"., whether \"14-20 Hours of Continuous Playback\" or \"8 Hours Intermittent Operation Playback\" is good enough to get me through the day when not @ Home and plugged into the Wall when using... This Motorola Droid X has the greatest \"hours of operation\" for audio that I have actually ever seen -- both on other Smartphones and standalone MP3 Players...Overall!? I really love this Android X by Motorola!!! Perhaps, one of the greatest coolest and cutest things I like about it and will always remember about it -- is the @ \"Android Robotic Sound Schemes\" that you don't get with newer Android-based Smartphones... I just can't get over that robotic \"Droid\" when the system boots or shuts-down etc., or someone calls in or have a message etc... Back in 2010, when this was released, my first 2 year contract was up with Verizon with my first free upgrade from the @ Motorola W755 (flip phone)., and I decided to go with the @ (Blackberry Curve 9330 3G) of which I upgraded to my LG Spectrum 2 from., and regret not going with this phone instead for the Blackberry... Now, I own one, and very satisfied with it!!! I purchased mine used(previously owned) from @ [BluTekUSA] and listed in the description -- it said that it \"may come with blemishes, scratches, normal use wear-and-tear etc\"... But after getting it; opening up the package; and inspecting it -- the phone was virtually as it was brand-new and pristine condition... I was shocked -- not a smudge or scratch on it!!! I would order this phone again used or new., if something were to happen to it...  Works flawlessly!!! Looks even more beautiful and amazing!!! Feels good in my Hand!!! The only real worries I had when purchasing this; was since I am not activating this on my Verizon account with service -- how I would install applications etc., and also how well it would play music... #1) after reading online; I discovered the way manually to download, transfer onto device, and install @ (.apk/.exe) runtime files via a program called @ \"Astro File\" also others as \"Android File Manager\", \"ES File Manager\", etc., all work good also... So I don't need @ Internet Service and Google Play App Store directly -- which is nice and comforting, albeit more work than clicking a simple install link to the file... #2) I was worried about how well these Smartphones in general., and especially this Android X in question., would not only just play my music -- but be able to properly @ chronologically and-or alphabetically arrange my files in my personalized folders without ruining the artist-song titles and throwing everything shuffled out of alphabetical order all over the place throughout the folders... When I got this phone and put in my 32gb Micro-SD Card loaded music, and went to search for and play my music with the Motorola Droid X's built-in @ Music Player App -- my worst fears were confirmed as this Phone's system would not recognize the Song-track Artist and Title and Alphabetical-listing properly as I loaded everything onto the Player., albeit would recognize my personalized folders., and completely destroyed/edited my @ Song's Artist and Title with gibberish and randomly scatter my songs out of listing throughout the folder at various points like a mangled car-wreck disaster at 120mph., and but everything would be normal upon connecting device to PC and entering Windows O.S Desktop again... #3) in response to #2... I went searching online for an alternative @ \"Music/Video Player App\", and after searching for hours and downloading 8 different Music/Video-Player app -- I finally came upon one program that is the best in my opinion and experience -- called @ (\"Folder Player\")., and which handles my folders with songs in artist/track-titles flawlessly as they're loaded from the computer as I want them in alphabetical order with needed features such as 'in player option' of @ delete etc., and a real nice professional stylish \"Black and White\" interface and widget-face to match the Motorola Android X's color \"Grey and White\" scheme... Since installing this (\"Folder Player\") app; I have been using this Motorola Android X constantly for hours every day and am in heaven and cannot seem to put it down, lol... I need my music -- it is my life and soul and existence and sanity :)... The Phone itself, plays my music superbly without any play-errors or audio-distortions... With @ (\"Folder Player\") installed, this has become an excellent alternative to standalone traditional multimedia MP3 Players and even Digital Camcorders and Cameras -- and far superior to any traditional @ MP3 Player on the market with mass so much extra options to use and in quality also especially... I am very satisfied with this product and my order and highly recommend to others to get one -- if not as an activated serviced @ Smartphone, than as an standalone @ \"Smart Multimedia Music/Video/Picture Player\" by itself alone as an alternative to standard usual 'same-o, same-o' MP3 Players., use the programs like @ \"ES File Manager\" etc., to manually install all the apps you want onto the device!!!I give it @ 5-Stars!Pro's)+ Excellent Physical Design+ Excellent Physical Quality+ Excellent General Operation Response Time+ Excellent Feel in Hands+ Excellent Picture Quality and Taking/Viewing-mode Response Times+ Excellent Video Quality and Taking/Viewing-mode Response Times+ Excellent Audio and Sound Quality+ Excellent Screen Size+ Excellent Battery Life (Hours of Operation)+ Excellent Charging Times+ Excellent Features+ Excellent Price$Con's)- N/A- Although, Couldn't handle my music folders of songs w/ artist and title listings and alphabetical ordering by itself alone without installing an third-party application as it should've done...", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Replacement phone", "Author": "Just a college guy", "ReviewID": "R2DEQHDG4N937D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I dropped my RazrMaxx in a puddle, and I didn't have insurance so I was looking for a cheap smart phone.I got this a few months ago, and it's not bad.
