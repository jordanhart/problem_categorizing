The phone itself was nice. My son loved the features. But it is really expensive to put service on if you do not want a contract. It has no SIM card slot, so you are limited on which carriers will add service to it for a low price. Cheapest I found was for about $45-$55 a month, which is just like getting a contract. My son just didn't want to pay that much for a phone no matter how nice the phone was.However he did like the way the phone looked in tablet mode. It is a little on the heavy side, but the features are nice when watching a video or simultaneously wanting to text and be on facebook at the same time. I encourage you to get it if you like a lot of screen, but shop around for a good price on service for it.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fairly \"meh\" overall.", "Author": "Brian Mattison \"Technophile\"", "ReviewID": "R20RZVZQL8T5Q0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The battery life is the most detracting factor about this phone. When you use a single screen, it's livable, but if you plan on using two screens, spend more and a get with a larger, more modern LCD panel. I find myself avoiding using two screens, because it just drains the battery too fast. The DPI on the screens is fine. If you buy into the whole \"more pixels is better\" thing, you'll be disappointed. If you're a normal user, you won't know the difference.The hinge is novel, and the phone is well built. However, it feels gimmicky after a while. It is fun to play with it, though.Camera is passable. It isn't great, but it does a decent job with enough light. Typically photos end up a little blown out.Android is close to stock. It runs gingerbread after the updates are complete. It isn't great, I very much prefer WP7/8 or iOS over this particular OS.The processor is getting a little old at this point. It's fast enough for most things, but it stutters at times. The graphics processor is strained when using two screens, and transitions/effects show that aspect.Overall this phone is \"ok\". I got it for a good price (I had to purchase a new battery) so I can't complain. I would suggest, however, that you buy another phone. This phone isn't worth owning anymore, especially with superior phones (in nearly every aspect) in the $200 or so range.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Aaron Moore", "ReviewID": "R1YPEZ4ZHC7KU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item is great, perfect.It is exactly how it was depicted.It is exactly what I wanted.Thank you.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "I guess I got lucky!!!", "Author": "Mr.G", "ReviewID": "R2752X8D67404V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the title says, I guess I was the one of the lucky ones because I don't have all the complaints everyone else has. I've had this phone for about 2 1/2 years and I love it. I'm a 32 yr old man who still plays games on his phone and downloads random apps. I make phone calls and text all day long. I never use the 2 screen feature but even without that the phone works fine. The battery life could be better and the phone does cut off by itself every now and then but by every now and then I mean maybe once every few months. Complaints about storage...what are you people downloading??? I download apps all the time and don't really have a big problem with storage. If that's a problem you should start downloading to your SD card or get an SD card with more memory. Durability...i'm the guy that puts his phone in his lap while driving and then gets out of the car and it falls on the ground. My phone has never broken or fallen apart. Complaints about apps closing... it happens sometimes but not enough to complain about. My GPS works fine and as far as customer support.. I'd go to a sprint store if you can. My phone was stolen a while back...got a new one a day later. The phone is very easy to use and it has enough features to satisfy most people. But again looking at the other reviews it seems like people are in search of a perfect phone that has no issues. I doubt you'll find it. I've come to realize that phones are like temperatures...There isn't 1 that satisfies everyone!I also think it's funny when people complain about a phone and how it's slow with the internet or it's picture is not clear when watching tv or movies...It's a PHONE!!! If you want a cell phone that does cell phone things I can't say too many bad things about this one. If you want something that talks to you, searches the internet in milliseconds, looks perfect when watching tv on it, and never has any problems...good luck finding that.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1MZF8Y74BVMN2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is by far the worst phone, worst company and worst customer service that I have every received.  I purchased this phone for Christmas for my 13 year old daughter.  Within 2 weeks, it stopped working.  The battery would get very hot.  The touchscreen would not respond.  I spent over 5 hours on the phone with Kyocera technical support before they finally created an RMA to have it repaired.  They have now had the phone for 7 weeks and have no estimated time of completion on the repair.  The technical support technicians have no idea of what is happening and are not able to do anything to fix the phone.  They will not send a replacement and expect me to continue paying the monthly service bill.I will never by a Kyocera product of any kind.
