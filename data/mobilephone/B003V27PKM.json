{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome phone, tiny buttons", "Author": "Silly Elfie", "ReviewID": "RRDFK8PCM4TRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone July 27, 2010. That first phone was defective, returned and Amazon e-mailed me the UPS label to use for my return while shipping me a replacement phone. I was very happy with their service on this issue as I received the replacement phone two days later before they even received my defective unit. The replacement phone has worked fabulously.First let me explain how I use this phone so that readers can get a basis for comparison. I use this phone to talk, text, play my mp3s and make notes. Since I do not have a contract, I can not access websites, additional apps, or many of the features/apps that come preloaded on this phone. So for me, this phone is a very intelligent personal organizer with cellular capabilities on a pay-as-you-go plan.The size of the phone, along with what it can do, blew me away. This phone is very thin and light weight yet has all the connectivity of its competitors.The screen is incredibly bright while using a sensor to auto adjust the brightness. You can manually increase the brightness and see the screen fine outside. YouTube has a video of a reviewer showing Avatar to people outside at a fountain. The screen can be that bright and viewable outside.The responsiveness of the touch screen boggled my mind. The main screen, along with the four buttons along the bottom edge of the phone work perfectly for me.One thing I was disappointed in was the Calendar. In order to access the Calendar, and many other functions, you need to setup or tie a Google account to this phone. Without a Google account, the Calendar simply won't function.I've read that the GPS has issues but this can be addressed by the user with a temporary fix until Samsung releases a patch. I do not have a link to this but I found several links to it very easily.Avatar and The Sims 3 look amazing and run very fast. No doubt about the processing power of this phone. Oh, unlike its competitors at the time of its release, this phone's frame rate is NOT locked. YouTube has a game performance video comparison. The Vibrant clocked an amazing 55 fps while most others were 20 - 23 fps. I realize this is not a gaming computer but I do believe phones will go in that direction and the Vibrant is capable of doing so now with very impressive results.I noticed the first couple of days, the battery seemed to drain rapidly. After that time, that battery life has been really good. Again, be aware of how I use the phone. Battery life will drain faster with more options enabled. If you do not need an option, I would recommend disabling it. However, I would not recommend buying an expensive smart phone just to turn it into a dumb terminal. Turn off what you do not need and be ready to use a charger in the car and/or at work if that is possible.The Android OS, along with the customization that Samsung has done, makes the menus very intuitive. I would, however, like to see more more consolidation of menu entries. For example, their are three separate entries for volume; Ringer and Messages, power-up and power-down, media (movies and music).  I would rather all of these volume areas get consolidated into one menu entry, Volume, and then adjust each as necessary.I absolutely LOVE the screen unlock puzzle pattern feature that I have never seen reviewed. The user can set an unlock puzzle pattern, draw a pattern using a 3 x 3 grid, connecting at least 4 dots. This makes securing the phone fast, easy to do and very easy to remember. Bravo Samsung.Another issue I have seen people mention is the battery indicator at the top of the screen. It took me a while to figure out why it seemed off. This indicator is actually divided into 5 segments, 20% battery life per segment. However, those segments are not separated by a gap. Imagine signal strength bars shoved together without gaps. This gives the false impression that the indicator is faulty, lagging, delayed or just bad. I hope that Samsung changes the indicator to just display a battery life percentage inside a battery shaped icon. This would eliminate any confusion and make Battery Life apps obsolete.The camera is amazing. I've taken indoor, outdoor and near dark photos that turned out great. The phone has several modes to help enhance photos. Using the Night mode can let you take photos in near dark settings. I've read a lot of comments where people dismiss the camera while never using it or because it lacks a flash. To me, that's the wrong stance. This is a phone, with a camera as an additional feature. If I need a really strong camera, then I am using the wrong device. I've taken more photos with this phone than any of my previous phones but don't think for a moment this phone's camera has replace my main camera when I go sight seeing.The only issue I have with the phone are the buttons. The buttons barely stick out from the sides at all. In fact, from the front, the buttons aren't visible nor are they shown in any pictures you will find. This actually makes the phone more difficult to use than is really necessary. The buttons do work but it would have been much easier to use if those button stuck out about 3x - 4x as much as they do. This is an annoyance but the phone is still very usable.As I mentioned at the beginning of this, I use this phone to make notes (grocery list, To Do List, Daily Diary entries, etc), text, talk and play mp3s. It does what I wanted this phone to do -very- well. The Contact/Organizer feature is amazing. It has tons of entries for each contact, even entries to help with social networking. You can disable entries you do not need or add entries for a contact that you need from a list of possible entries.I am very satisfied with this phone, show it off to others and now I truly understand what the hype was about when smart phones were initially launched.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Back to technology~", "Author": "Lona Noll", "ReviewID": "R2OMILZGZ6BHSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love all the features this phone has to offer.

Period.It's almost freakishly thin. (Certainly svelte.) The size and weight makes it almost imperceptible in your pocket.You get pretty good photos and respectable HD video with notably clean audio. And there's some preloaded fun with Avatar (looking dang good on that screen) and a special edition of Sims 3. It even has some tricks up it's sleeve, like running Google Earth.Now here's the BIG BUT: It's almost unusable.Let's start with the buttons: The power/lock button is a joke, especially on such a thin, slippery device. It's barely a pimple (on the \"but\") - and I don't have stumpy fingers at all. Then, there's the touch sensitive Android function buttons (Home, Menu, Back, Search), which sounds cool except they often just plain refused to respond. It sometimes took 3 or 4 \"presses\" to get any reaction.I came to the Vibrant from a Motorola CLIQ, so I'm no stranger to a highly-modified OS. And while Android may not necessarily be described as \"elegant\", Samsung ruined a completely workable UI, mangling the usability in a sorry attempt to be something it was not *coughiPhone*. (Paged, horizontal menu, huh? THAT'S original...) Oh, and thanks to all the questionable \"enhancements\", the thing lags all over the place. What's the point of all the power if it chokes just jumping between home screens? (Are you sure there's really a 1GHz processor in there??)Yes, as you may have heard, the GPS is definitely jacked up. I was lucky if it ever got a lock.Finally, and here's the biggest \"but\" of all: The reception absolutely, positively blows. So good luck with using this as an actual phone...Anyway, I returned it after 2 days and got a myTouch 3G Slide. It's got none of the glamor but completely blows the Vibrant out of the water in everyday use while costing fifty bucks less.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
