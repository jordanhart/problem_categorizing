It is very good for my specific use.Pros:1. Small size, fits completely in a fist.2. Small screen, hence less battery consumption. But not that efficient as w580i.3. Qwerty keyboard is very helpful for my frequent note-taking.4. Superior and trusted Sony music quality and equipment.5. All regularly available apps present or can be added free of cost from market.6. Good speaker phone and volume. No problems.7. Long panning screen with widgets and menu.8. good camera but slow to start.Cons:1. The built in theme is not very good. It is all blue and not changeable.2. Camera doesn't start quickly.3. Music player is horrendous, can't make any playlists.4. Non-micro-usb data and charging cable. Sony is not eco friendly, adds more and more wires instead of using the std. usb cable like motorola.5. touch screen is sometimes sluggish.6. Need to remove backplate to remove the SD card.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "S. Burgess", "ReviewID": "R3SPSQJA6PUMIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the by far the best Sony Ericsson phone I have ever owned.I avoided touch screens for a while, especially with the touch keyboards but with this phone's touch screen + slide out key board there's absolutely nothing to complain about.The screen is vibrant, very reactive to touch. The phone itself is small, unique looking, and packs quite a punch with sound.Pros:Size - Fits in your hand and slips into your pocket!Speed - Connects to wi-fi at a touch or your provider's internet connection.Unlocked - No build up of monthly fees, this phone is free of contract.Capability - Amazing voice guided aGPS, full access to android market and applications.Multimedia - 5mp LED flash camera, buildable music library and great speakers that get very loud.GPS- The gps is like a Tom Tom, only better and already installed on your phone. Best part? It's free. I can't forget the voice guided directions :-)Cons:You need to download certain applications for different things, such as editing photos or sending files via bluetooth, etc. This is just a short problem though because the phone downloads really fast.Overall:I love this phone. If you are looking for a smartphone without the bulk, something that's unique, and a device that gives you all you need then I definitely would recommend the Xperia x10 mini pro!!!", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson xperia mini pro white", "Author": "EV \"jokerlom\"", "ReviewID": "R1V55E30PL7FK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well, very fast Internet browsing.

It then started to disconnect when I was in the middle of talking, bringing me back to the home screen. Also when I called someone, I could hear them but they couldn't hear me. I emailed the website (HassleFreeCell.com) I bought it from and they said they only covered the phone for 30 days and I would need to send it back to Hong Kong, which I had NO IDEA, that is where the phone came from. I can't get any information on how or where to send it back to for evaluation. HassleFreeCell.com will not help me in any way. They keep telling me to contact Sony, which I did, many times. They will not do anything because it's not from the US. I will never buy another phone from them again and I would advise, if you do, to make sure it is made for the American market!! They said it was a\"NEW\" phone but I'm beginning to think it was probably a refurbished phone. I can't imagine that a new phone would malfunction in such a short period of time. I'd advise everyone to shop a different Vendor unless you want to get screwed. They will not help you in any way, shape or form.

It was sturdy, size was good, I liked everything about it (except that it was pretty outdated, making the Internet and other interface fairly slow).I had to replace it because the backlight would not work, which made receiving calls problematic.Anyway, about THIS phone, needless to say it runs tons faster than the G1 though it probably does not compare to the high-end Android phones out right now (though that should be expected with the price)Pros:-Very small, every time I look at it in my hand I can't help but to love how tiny it is!-Physical keyboard very easy to use, the keys are well spaced and you know when you've pressed it-Touch screen responsive-Fast interface-Android makes interface intuitive, did not have to relearn everything-Sturdy, it feels tough and the sliding mechanism feels solidCons:-If you're feeling a bit tired and get careless with the touch-screen, it could seem a bit too sensitive. People with bigger hands should also avoid.-The green blinker that tells you you have a notification blinks every 6ish seconds, which is honestly not often enough for me, sometimes I want to get a quick look at the phone and know whether I have a notification or not..the G1 blinked very frequently, but this may be a pro for some.-No dedicated number keys - but this is to be expected on a small phone, it's a minor con for me-The messaging has a lot of random options that get in the way of the actual message, although it disappears when you're navigating it comes back while you're typing-The jacks/USB ports are exposed. This is not a major problem for me, but I can see it could be for many-It's like a dust magnet. But I think this is expected since it's a black phone, my G1 was white so I probably didn't notice the dust. It's something I can get used toFor me this phone does everything it needs to.
