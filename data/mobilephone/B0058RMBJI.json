Don't expect much from this phone.If you are looking for a phone that plays games, this phone is not for you, this phone runs really slow because of the processor it has. There are times that it will freeze up if you are running too many applications at a time.Another thing is that the battery life is really bad. If you are someone that loves to surf the internet, this phone will really drain your battery. So carry the phone charger all the time.But other than that this phone is a good touch phone, for calling and text messaging purposes only.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a great phone.", "Author": "Quik", "ReviewID": "R2VKIK0TLPO4EX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my first Android phone and I had it for about 6 months. I knew it was slow for a smart phone, but I didn't really care. It worked fine for talking, texting, playing simple games, and what-not. The only thing that bothered me was that the camera didn't have a flash.However, after about a month, problems started to appear. The phone would shut itself off randomly, freeze, have programs crash, etc. It started happening more. I took it in to be looked at and was told that there was technically nothing wrong with the device; it is just a poorly made phone in general. After those 6 months, it shut off in the middle of a text message. When I attempted to reboot the phone, it froze on the Android screen; the phone would not power on completely. I checked online forums and, apparently, this is a pretty common issue. Some people were able to reset their phone to original factory settings, but most people said they had to purchase a new phone. I brought my phone in to be looked at and despite numerous attempts to fix it, I had to purchase a new phone. Basically, if you want a phone that will last, this is not the phone to purchase.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone Available...Buy a different phone!", "Author": "Gabbie", "ReviewID": "R29GD8WUH1KHJ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and had it for a year...save you money and purchase a different phone.

It is fabulous. For an Android at its price point and the plan cost thru Cricket, it is a great phone.I will say theres still a learning curve. I just recently figured out that I can add my contacts (to text, or call) to the home screen. So I did, I added my most contacted. I also found I can add my Cozi caledar, and other stuff.I LOVE it.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "it doesn't", "Author": "j briano", "ReviewID": "RN6LHJD25JDO3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it is a good phone. only problem is it doesn't stay hooked up to internet for long.

I just read this over, the misspelled words are the acts of the phone,NOT THE USER!!!! But I decided to leave it so you can see.
