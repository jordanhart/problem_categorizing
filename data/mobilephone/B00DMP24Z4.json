{"Reviews": [{"Title": "its a perfect phone for my husband", "Author": "TeamIrish", "ReviewID": "R3Q5XIKW38JWQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband hated his last phone, he culdn't see the numbers on the keys because it was a texting phone, so he would never use it. He had been commenting that he would like a phone that had big buttons for his fingers and that it didn't need to be super complicated to use since he only needed it for emergencies, I bought this one because my carrier didn't offer that type of phone. It was a little weird to set up, I pretty sure its mainly offered overseas, but now that its has been set up for him he's all set.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "this phone sucks", "Author": "eric lawrence", "ReviewID": "R2QI8OWQFGHOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is verry hard to use it would take a rocket scientists to figure it out.
