My daughter managed to kill another phone by dropping it (I'm beginning to think she does it on purpose!) 6 months into her contract.She liked my new phone, so I bought her this one - it's cheaper than the ZR, & don't want the expense if she drops it again.Just arrived 24 hours ago, and she's a happy girl again. - Facebook loads very quickly.Battery compartment a little awkward to get on an off.Battery life should be pretty good - I found something called stamina mode in the settings on mine, that cuts non essential processing and info flow when the screen is off. - really saves on the juice. - You can white-list any apps you want to continue receiving data.It also has NFC (near field communication) that normally only comes with higher end phones (Though, I personally, have yet to use it for anything)Camera- 8MP - CMOS sensor and HDR. reasonable in low light - Takes some very good photos (for a phone)Definite bonus - Micro SD slot to expand memory.Screen nice and bright - good picture -  224ppi - not as sharp as some, but more than adequate for browsing the web, - Certainly as good as phones in the same price bracket.Oh, from the label - GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 UMTS/HSPA band 1/2/4/5Great phone for the cost.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great option for Iphone", "Author": "Almudena", "ReviewID": "R2AXTRO7JTHFK2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, I used to own an Iphone and was pleasantly surprised. It is user friendly, not much need for the Instruction manual as it really is very easy to use. I love that most of the apps for Android are free, and the screen for this phone is larger than the Iphone, it takes great pics, and overall I have to say that I dropped it at least 4 times and it barely did any damage. It has options the Iphone doesn't like you can customize the ppl you receive calls from, I love this option! For the price and the fact that is unlocked it really makes it a no brainer. I have used Metro, Tmobile and even straight talk to the phone is versatile and you need no contracts. I love the phone and my bills are never higher than $45.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very good choice.", "Author": "Adriana", "ReviewID": "R1LH2VQDVKL86Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone for price. Comparing with others that belong to the same range, it really is a good choice.I've been using it for a bit more than a week, and so far it works very well. A couples details:The camera isn't as good as I expected. Is not bad by any means, but it doesn't seem like the 8 mp add too much to the ones you can get with a 5 mp camera.Battery is alright. It gets you through the day and that's pretty much it.The model feels really comfortable to the hand, not too big and very light. I got it in white, and it look very elegant. The screen resolution is awesome.Performance is good, although it took me a bit to get used to it. I had Blackberry before, and I find those were a lot easier to customize. I mean, people with knowledge can do wonders with this phone, since it allows you many more liberties than Blackberry in customization, but if you don't know much about it it can be a bit difficult. But then, that's a critic to Android, not to the phone itself. It just takes a lot of time to arrange it *just* the way you want it (once it's done it's great, though).Speakers are good enough, although you have to make sure not to obstruct it with your finger or anything because then it sounds weird (in many other phones I've had that has never been an problem).There a many other little issues in the OS (again, that's mostly for Android, not the phone itself), like notifications or the running of apps, etc. Which I'm not 100% happy with, but those are things I *know* can be arranged however I want them (or most of them, anyway), except I haven't had the time to fiddle and play with it too much. So if you're new to Android, just know you need to give it time to completely get the hang of it..", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "verry good", "Author": "Mary Carmen", "ReviewID": "R2XUU5LPQCJ3PN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i liked so much , is cute and its use is really easyi love my Phone...Thanks you so much", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid phone", "Author": "NM", "ReviewID": "R37XLFN8Q1S7TZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Been 2 days thus far and so far so good. Supports high speed on lycamobile(t-mobile mvno) and per specs supports AT&T; but I have not tried it on ATT network. Solid voice quality - way better than Moto G and our recently returned S3 Mini. However the phone is a bit bulky and the metal power switch is plain ugly. Cover easily comes off which is a plus in my book but the overall protruded cover does not look too good. All in all, aesthetics are not the greatest but what matters to me most in a phone is solid - supports tmo and att bands, solid voice quality, adequate and expandable memory. Speaker volume is great too.6/6 Update: This is a solid phone and we are very happy with this. Voice quality beats S4(we own one) by a country mile.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Winston Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R81I6DXVO5VTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Congratulations i recommend this product for more people, i really satisfied with my Sony Xperia L C2014 Unlocked Phone, good job", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "love this phone", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R24PP465U6IM4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this phone to anyone.
