I wanted a touch screen that wasn't a smartphone and that's exactly what the Pantech Crux is. The battery is good (I can go about 1.5-2 days without charging. In this day of smart phones that have to be charged every night/throughout the day, I view this as a good thing). It has a music player that is OK, but I don't like how you can't edit a playlist after you create it. The response time when you select something is a little slow, but everything works. The texting is frustrating sometimes because it CAN be inaccurate, but THIS IS NOT A SMARTPHONE, so what were you expecting?If you have patience and don't care about having a smartphone, this phone is good.

I do like the texting on this phone. If you are getting this phone for calling/texting, its great. I do not use the internet, but it does have the ability to use it. It is not a smart phone. The ringtones, if you want custom have to be shorter than 30 seconds. Also to get songs into ringtones seems a bit time consuming and backwards.

The calibration gets thrown off so easily and it is very laggy when texting. What's worse, often I will not receive texts for half an hour to an hour after they have been sent (sometimes up to 2 hours), despite having excellent signal. An even worse case scenario of this is when the phone decides to do it's little bi-weekly \"general failure\" charade, in which it does not send or receive messages AT ALL. The phone gives no indication that it has gone into general failure, so the only way to find out is when you happen to text someone and the message cannot be sent. All the while, other people may have been trying to contact you or to respond to messages. The only remedy I found for this was to turn the phone off and on (a process that also takes forever and a day), after which I'm usually greeted with a barrage of text messages.Further related to the core necessities of the phone is the call quality. It's terrible; I often find myself asking people to repeat what they said multiple times or shouting to get my message through clearly.As if having poor core functions of the phone wasn't bad enough, the extra \"features\" are more of a bother than a bonus. The camera isn't that great, even though I expected that from the start. The phone in general is sluggish, at best. Tapping any application on the home screen requires at least some wait for a response. When opening the text history from a contact, the wait time is unacceptably long for contacts that have ~30+ messages stored. Simply opening my pictures appears to take all the processing power that the phone can muster, and I usually have to wait a minute or two for them all to load. I occasionally have problems with the alarm feature of the phone, in that it fails to go off. This is very inconvenient when the  phone is the only alarm I rely on.I also occasionally experience very bizarre battery performance. After charging it, there will be times when the battery will be completely dead within the hour. Removing the battery and placing it back in followed by another recharge seems to fix this, at least temporarily.Cosmetically, the phone screen is very hard to see in direct or even partial light.The only positive things I can think of about the phone is that it has a decent music player and that the battery life isn't terrible, even after two years (with the exception of the problem mentioned above). Having used it only as a basic phone, I can not speak for its 3G and related functions, but I always seemed to have decent coverage. Though, truly, if you want the 3G features, you would be better off with a smart phone.Overall, I would buy any phone before purchasing this one again. It is very unreliable and frustrating to use, even for someone who is usually patient with electronics.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Crap", "Author": "owner", "ReviewID": "R386BF56E3SRTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is the most awful phone that I have ever owned.

They keep going to Verizon last minute or out of nowhere deciding they have found a \"good deal\" and get new phones. This often results in them renewing their contracts and the cycle begins all over again. I don't want to sound like I'm complaining, it's nice of them to keep me on their plan (one less bill for me) but I wish they would consult me before hand.So, with that in mind: I get a random phone call to come to the local Target. They're talking to a Verizon sales person and are getting new phones. I rush over there and I'm given two options. A brick of a flip phone..or the Pantech Crux.  I foolishly selected the Pantech Crux. Had I more time to research this phone, I would have opted for two tin cans with a string between them.I realize it's not a smartphone. That's okay. I don't need a smartphone (although it would be nice). I do however need a phone that doesn't randomly turn off and back on. I need a phone that will hold a charge for more than a day. I need a phone that I can actually send and receive texts from. I need a phone that I can actually read the screen OUTDOORS (doesn't matter if your in shade or an apocalypse storm is coming..you can't see the damn screen). I need a phone that after programming an alarm, the alarm will go off at said time.  The simplest task like selecting a contact turns into an ordeal. God help you if you accidentally hit the icon for an app. 3 hours later you can back out of it and return to the home screen.  Sometimes I feel I'm just walking around with a child's play phone.

I hate putting up with this phone, it feels like a chore to have it rather than a privilege. I read the reviews on Verizon's website and on amazon, I saw that this phone had some really nasty reviews about how the touch screen and camera do not hardly work; I just brushed it off and thought \"maybe it's just old people who cant work a touch phone and it wont happen to me\" I was so wrong. When I got the phone I was super excited because I had just switched from the LG enV3 and I finally had a touch screen phone. I thought it might have been just me when the screen was sort of inaccurate, but it wasnt just me. The screen messes up a lot and just regularly it is very inaccurate. Next, the missed calls feature on the phone doesnt allow you to see your recent or missed calls because the phone cuts off every single time you try to look at the calls. The music buttons are on the top of the phone which I thought would be a cool feature quickly backfired, I have gotten my phone taken away in school so many times because my jeans pressed the buttons and music played loudly.

With a simple movement of the physical \"Slide to Lock\" function to lock then unlock, it re calibrates and works great. The issue is that over time this calibration has gotten to where it becomes un-calibrated very quickly, sometimes 3-4 times in a single text message.Second, Not real sure if this is just Verizon getting screwy or the phone itself, but it will go HOURS with out receiving a single txt message. I will have to restart the phone to finally get all of the texts that have been building up, and then it shows them as \"received\" at their original times they should have been received, though they were not. This causes problems because there may be time sensitive messages for work or what not and I do not receive them until it is too late. I believe this is involved with the phone's standard antenna (the 1x one). Reason being, is that i will receive emails like normal during these silent periods of txting, which uses the 3G antenna.Lastly, the battery is sporadic. In the past month alone, I can have the phone go from lasting two days on a single charge to lasting 3 hours on a single charge, with the same general use in both instances (general txting and email, occasional call). I would have to say this can only be due to the phone either believing it is charged when it is not, or, the phone getting caught in programming loops that DRAIN the battery without my knowledge.I gave three stars because for the first year i had it, i loved this phone, it is just in the past 4 or so months when these issues have started to arise, and as it gets older, they are becoming more and more frequent.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE", "Author": "reluctant customer", "ReviewID": "ROMEEWNVQ5EGW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was not compliant with service, i tried to hook the phone up to a line. and after.20 minutes of trying to get the.phone to work, i found out it didn't work with Verizon.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "i hate this phone!", "Author": "jordan", "ReviewID": "R35NRU723UGINZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i have had this phone for a year and i hate it! texting on it is so hard. the phone shuts off by itself. sometmes when you recieve a phone call it wont let you answer, and sometimes you cant hear them and they cant hear you! the reception is horrible! so now im in the process of looking for a new phone! i wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone!", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "this phone is awful!", "Author": "aimonti", "ReviewID": "R6R4JD4Z608LW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a year now.
