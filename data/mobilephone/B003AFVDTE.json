Very impressed with customer service and professionalism!I mentioned on my initial review of the phone I ordered that the battery did not hold a charge, and had arrived without a back on it. As previously mentioned, the company was quick to reply and send me a back for the phone (which I had requested), but without even requesting so they also sent a new battery.Kudos and much success to you!", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "It will have to do for now", "Author": "Frank_IFA", "ReviewID": "R2KA2VQKYFYPC6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my mom as a cheap replacement phone for the one she had prior. She needed a simple clam shell phone with nothing fancy, just dial in a number and talk kinda phone. I was able to activate the phone by dialing *228 with no problems.Pros- cheapest decent phone I could find for the money. Long battery life,e asy to use.Cons- Feels cheap, the battery cover button is poorly made. Everything about this screams made in China. The battery cover is made out of tin with the same feel as the top of a soup can. Right off the bat I had to break off the USB charger cover as there was no grove to remove it with your finger.Overall, I felt the phones on the verizon website are way over priced and this is a good option for those that are in need of a new working phone and don't care for spending the big bucks.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Reliable", "Author": "J.D.", "ReviewID": "RHYZVYJ8AI8BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had previously had the W385 for 2.5 years.  I went back to this phone (W385) after having a Samsung Intensity II.  After keys not functioning correctly on the Intensity II and breaking the screen accidentally I bought W385 once again.  From the supplier this phone came with a Clean ESN so that the phone could be programed to my number.I have never had an issue with this W385.  If you want a cell phone that is decent to text on and nice to talk on, and do not need a data plan, this is the phone to get.  Regardless if you are a teen, an older person, or like me at age 24 who doesn't need a data plan, GET THIS PHONE!  I would recommend this phone to anyone else who is looking for a phone with very basic features.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tank Phone", "Author": "David McBride", "ReviewID": "R20HG6HPUTNW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best.

Wolter", "ReviewID": "R16MVVJJQG3X9I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased a two year contract from Verizon on two of these phones in a family plan several years ago. The phones are great little devices that handle most of what we were looking for. One of the problem we have found its that the batteries tend to start loosing the ability to keep a charge so that even on short calls the battery indicator will drop down to one bar and a recharge is necessary. Another problem is that pictures taken with this phone cannot be downloaded to your computer with the Motorola Phone Tools 5.0 application as this part is not supported for this phone.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "don't buy it", "Author": "honggang sheng", "ReviewID": "R1RUEBXLV33OI3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the basic phone only for better quality of voice.

I would speak highly of them. My Wife uses the phone with comfort and we were able to sync the device with her new car as well as her Blue Tooth Earpiece. We had another new 4G Phone System in the Box but in fact, she prefers simplicity and only uses the phone as a phone.As to Verizon, they are quite outrageous, inaccurate and abrasive, making false and unsupported claims and statements. At one point they even allowed access to their database and my personal records; which were sold to a 3rd. Party for use in a litigation not involving me, without any form of knowledge, consent and/or approval. This was done in violation of lawful mandates imposed upon them.Respectfully submitted.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did what we bought it for", "Author": "Jeff R", "ReviewID": "R3KKLFQVIZGZOE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My son-in-law is part of our family plan and he goes through phones at an alarming rate!

Tough and reliable", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R39PS9N6UWT6HE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my W385 for over 3-4 years.  It is banged up and has been dropped many times.  I even left it out in the rain overnight and it still works great.  It doesn't have nifty features and the camera is low rent, so if that's important, you may need something else.It uses a standard mini USB port for charging and data, so you can charge it from many different chargers or even a PC if you download the drivers from Motorola. Any standard USB-to-mini cable will work.  Best of all, you can use it as a modem (at least on MetroPCS).  It's not easy, but it can be done.Oh yes, it also makes phone calls and will receive them too.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rugged, Long battery life,  Basic phone", "Author": "Cleech", "ReviewID": "R24F48CQ67GV8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Motorola W385 for at least 5 years, probably longer.  It doesn't have a QWERTY keyboard, so it's really not suitable for texting.  And, in general, I don't find the interface all that intuitive. However, given those limitations, it's a great phone.Here's what I like:It's a flip phone.  Phone rings, flip it open to answer, close it to end.  Just like Captain Kirk.It's thin and easily slips into my pocket.The outside of the phone is covered mostly with what feels like rubber.  Easy to grip, looks cool.I've had no problems with the phone even though I've dropped it a few times and gotten it wet.It seems to have a large number-storing capacity.I've set mine to ring and vibrate simultaneously.  I understand that not all phones allow this.Typically, it stays charged for a week; or a least it did until recently, (I'm now down to two or three days, so I've ordered a new battery).Despite what is said in some of the other reviews:The recharging port cover does have a groove that allows you easily open the port cover and move it to one side.You can down load ring tones, page 42 in manual.According to the manual, you can send pictures to other phones or email addresses.  Although I've yet to try that feature, since I don't text.After 5 years of use and abuse, instead of getting a new phone, I've just ordered a new battery for my trusty Motorola W385 flip phone.  I like it that much.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "If You Want Just A Plain Phone", "Author": "Miss Missy", "ReviewID": "R2DC2K7ZABV7F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I talk on the phone all day and work on a computer all day so at the end of a day I don't need the texting, the aps or the searching, I've done it all day.
