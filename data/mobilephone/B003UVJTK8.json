{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hardware Failure", "Author": "evelynn", "ReviewID": "R3VT7H4HHAHXRV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this item from Amazon for $878.03, but it was sent by a 3rd party distributor - Worlwide Distributors. Again I PAID AMAZON almost $900 for a new cellphone. On the website, it clearly says there will be no returns on cell phones. HOWEVER, the almost $900 Brand New cell phone was defective out of the box. It could not even be turned on. Worldwide Distributors would not return my money and offered a refurbished phone in return, which I refused because I paid almost $900 for a NEW iphone. In researching this Worldwide Distributors company, the BBB gives it an \"F\" rating for how it deals with customers issues. My complaint is not so much with them, but more with Amazon, who backed Worldwide and would not provide me with a NEW phone nor reimburse me the almost $900 that I paid their company for a BRAND NEW cellphone, that again, did NOT work when it came out of the box. I can understand the policy to not accept cell phones back, but honestly cannot understand them not taking back a BRAND NEW - NEVER USED - UNABLE TO BE TURNED ON - cellphone. Shame on Amazon for caring more about the $878.03 they received for a worthless phone, than me, their valued customer. And shame on them for partnering with a 3rd party distributor company that conducts their business in such a questionable manner as to receive an \"F\" rating from the Better Business Bureau.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPhone great.

So obviously opening the phone from its original package and use it for a couple of days to make sure it worked well wasn't an option.I took the phone abroad then, my brother opened it, plugged it and surprise:  iPhone restarted every 5 minutes.  So a new, never opened phone with no apps installed whatsoever just kept restarting every 5 minute.  We tried Apple's suggested recovery/wipe with no effect.I talked to seller FGS Trading and they said:  \"Sorry iPhone was bought 5 weeks ago and we only cover first 4 weeks under Amazon policy, you have to deal with your NEW broken iPhone with Apple\".So, I guess the main message to all review readers is:  NEVER BUY A GIFT FROM AMAZON UNLESS IT WILL BE OPENED/USED WITHIN 30 DAYS!  Otherwise you risk getting a Factory Broken item and having to deal with all the hassle with the manufacturer.THIS MIGHT BE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ANYONE TAKING A GIFT ABROAD (WHO USUALLY BUY ITEMS WITH SOME SAFETY TIME).", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best phone ever!", "Author": "Guillermo Osorio \"Geo\"", "ReviewID": "R3UF20790LVUPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "iPhone 4 is the best phone I've ever had.

Firsts days, the battery life was a bad issue, but then I found that there is a service called \"ping\" that you can unactivate, and the battery life increased 90% (some days I even don't charge my phone overnight, and next day I still have 60% of battery)2.

and my experiences with Apple phones just keeps getting better. In the last 3.5 years, I have tried, returned & owned Semi-smart & Smart phones, from different manufacturers, from Palm phones to BlackBerry's to Nokia's, and on to the 3G/3G S/4G iPhone Series.This Review should NOT be taken as a direct \"Comparison\" among all these other semi-smart & smart phones, but, rather I am comparing the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 3G S model, as that is my most recent experience as of late January, 2011 ... and I stopped looking back.The other pieces of useful information about my usage as a Pro-sumer are 2 main additional facts:a. I have always purchased outright, all my phones as US Models and Unlocked; using primary PAYG cell phone coverage plans, from AT&T; and/or, T-Mobile.b. I have \"jailbroken\", most of my iPhones (except for one), as an Option, for adding other App's, outside the steel grid of iTunes.One CAVEAT that I would like to add to this mix is one overwhelming FACT about 3G versus 4G cell Marketing HYPE, that anyone taking the time to read my Review should take home with ... 3G and 4G \"COVERAGE\" Services, are Directly-Dependent on your (a) LOCATION, (b) Cell phone company INFRASTRUCTURE, (c) Version of 3G or 4G EQUIPMENT, that is Operating Properly, (d) Cell phone current 3G or 4G radio-receiver version, (e) Current Atmospheric Conditions.I am a well-seasoned Traveler, in and outside the states, and all I can say is do not believe all the \"hype\" from the Companies, nor, the magazine reviews, that do not field test the phones in a \"real-world\" environment, like the Airports, Taxi's, Trains, Auto's, Hotels, Motels, Resorts, sub-burbs and/or, out in the country-side. I have read many \"reviews\" where all the `testing' was conducted Downtown ... sure, where all the big Towers are located, what would you expect?And also remember that at big shows like CES and others, many New product lines and services have been \"Optimized\", so that they will Shine ... why you expect any less?7 Main Reasons why I choose to upgrade to the iPhone 4, from the 3G S model:* Retina Display (326 pixels per inch) -- smooth as silk, continuous text & graphics look sharp at any size.* 5-Megapixel Camera with LED Flash, with optional HDR setting -- Captures amazingly detailed images. A built-in LED flash that illuminates any low-light scenes, plus a 5x digital zoom and you can shoot self-portraits with the front camera.* HD Video Recording (& Editing) - Shoot Hi-Def movies. Capture some impressive Video even in a low-light setting, thanks to the advanced (backside) Illumination Sensor & built-in LED light.* Multitasking* - you can run your favorite 3rd-party apps -- and switch between them instantly -- without slowing down the performance of the foreground app or draining the battery unnecessarily. The battery also lasts longer than the 3G S models.* FaceTime (FT) - iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 or to the new iPod touch over Wi-Fi. 2 Cameras front & back. FT lets you switch back and forth between them during a video call.* iOS 4 vs 3.0 - Elegant, Smooth and intuitive interface. Besides the built-n Apps, there is now over 350,000 apps and games available from the App Store, you control everything with a tap, drag, swipe, pinch, flick, or twist of your fingers. iOS 4 is a desktop-class OS that's been reinvented for mobile devices.* Performance and stability that lead the industry - fast performance and stability is rock-solid.* Multi-Tasking -- using multiple apps at the same time is it's cornerstone.Con's - mostly to do with the 3rd-party Cases, that it's not easy to add a Back Charger, and Would like to see some Cool \"tri-pod's\", now that the Camera's are great!My POV - The WORST \"reviews\" here on the cell phone or electronic category, that I find so Obtuse, Totally Useless and without any Substance, are those posted by certain People, who are 'airing' their Grievances (aka bitching), about a SHIPPING, Wrong model or have a Customer Service (Amazon or 3rd-party) Problem posted here, rather than providing a subjective Review about a particular Item or Product line. Then, there are those 'savants' and/or, 'wannabe's', that have never purchased ANY item or product, but, have posted a False Review, which makes them both totally disingenuous and inappropriate, AND, does not HELP Anyone. My Solution for those that received the wrong model or item is to wait until that is resolved and then post a Product Review, while adding a commentary about the Customer Service or Shipping problem, now, doesn't that sound like something everyone would want to read! Imagine that!My Apple `Wish List' for 2012, is a 7-inch iPhone 6, with all the above goodies, plus NFT, HDMI, SDHC, a 3.0 USB, a 6.9-inch Retina Display (16/9 format), and can `communicate, instruct & exchange' with ANY device, outside of iTunes.Ok, Santa, You Got That?About Updates - I will post one or more over the next 6-months or sooner, should anything significant should change.

A night and day improvement, and not much need to jailbreak your phone anymore. All the details are on Apple's website, and according to most sources this new OS will be available to the general public this fall.Below is my original review: (BTW, I have NO knowledge of this seller or the condition of their phones, this information is not an endorsement of FGS Trading, and I would suggest that anyone considering buying from an Amazon seller make contact with them prior to completing any transaction with a full list of questions.)I had the 8GB 3G model and thought that was great, until I got a demo of the iPhone 4. Man is this version is light years ahead of the original model.With a 1Ghz CPU, and 16GB of flash memory, this thing is a portable office/entertainment center par excellence. I've had this phone for 3 months without a single problem, the display is nice and sharp, the apps load very fast, and I now have over 130 apps to perform just about every duty you could possibly think of with absolutely no impact on performance. And on the ATT 3G network, I average download speeds of around 3Mbps, and over 1M upload speeds....and how do I know that, cause I got an app that tells me that's how. BTW, the display is the equivalent of a 960x640 on your desktop so what you see is essentially a high res yield and page loads are superfast. And resident memory (512Mb), after a full days use I just checked and still had 120Mb of Ram available. On the 3G model that number was usually down around 4Mb by the end of the work day and had to be refreshed.Even the battery life is 3x better than the previous model, and thats a good thing cause its integrated but a full charge should yield and entire days work of calls, emails, surfing the web, SMS messaging, and play. I no longer need my laptop cause there's nothing I cant do with the iPhone, and that includes sending faxes, editing Excel or Word documents, and even printing. A flash for the 5MP camera, two(2) HD video cameras, and even real time video conferencing over a wireless network, and Bluetooth that unlike the 3G model is actually compatible with everything you throw at it, including Garmin GPS....just amazing. This thing even has 2 mics with noise suppression so calls are clearer on the other end.BTW, with all the apps, music, and videos I've got loaded on this thing I've still got 10GB of flash memory remaining. I cant imagine why anybody would need more storage, and the 32GB model isn't any faster and doesn't have any more features. You'll need iTunes on your desktop to get the most out of this phone and iTunes can be a little intimidating at first but its worth the trouble, and all the instruction you need can be found on the web or Youtube for transferring photos, videos, music, apps, etc.I've been reading with amusement about the \"antenna problem\" with the iPhone 4 and have this to say..... It is easily cured by slapping on a hard case or shell on the phone, which eliminates the issue I see some people complaining about. I have personally never experienced this issue because I left the AT&T; store with a protective shell on my phone which virtually everybody I've ever seen with an iPhone has anyway. Very simply you CANNOT replicate the reported \"death grip\" problem with a shell around the outer frame. Cant be done. And BTW, I don't know if its due to network improvements or what but lately I'm getting 4Mbps download speeds so if anything I'm happier with my purchase now than I was 4 months ago but I live in Florida and cell sites are plenty down here, if you live in California or New York you may not be so fortunate. Zero complaints, and that's something most smartphone users of other OEM products can't say.Also, amongst the disinformation you'll read about the iPhone here on Amazon one guy states \"the screen is easily scratched and the back is easily shatterable.\" Utter nonsense. First of all, ALL cell phones are \"shatterable\", and the iPhone screen is made from Gorilla Glass, a proprietary Corning product that quite simply does not scratch. You can read up on this on the web but after a while you will feel comfortable dropping your phone in your pocket or purse with your keys, power tools, pistols, whatever. I've dropped my phone a couple of times and it has not shattered and the screen is still perfect after 4-5 hours of use per day.I caution you to beware negative reviews on here that are filled with bad English and are authored by individuals who have written only one review (on the iPhone) and posted it in several locations on Amazon's site. Its easy to pick these out, and many have no doubt been written by the same person.And finally, the Wall Street Journal did an article on the iPhone 4 recently that concluded the following 1) AT&T; network is 46% faster than Verizon for iPhone users, 2) many reported problems with poor service and dropped calls are an AT&T; network problem, and not associated with the iPhone, and 3) call quality is better on Verizon's network vs. AT&T.; There are pros and cons to both carriers but bottom line is.....IT AIN'T THE PHONE! I've posted a link to the article under \"Comments.\" Also a definitive technical review by Anandtech.com is posted there, and yes they cover the much overblown \"antenna issue.\" The iPhone is still the biggest seller in the market, and for a reason.Oh wait, about 2-3 times a month my girlfriend gets mad at me and hangs up in the middle of a conversation, so I guess I am suffering from the dreaded dropped call after all. haw haw", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just as advertised.", "Author": "Michael C.", "ReviewID": "R2ZW91IWMXRE3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my iPhone 4 today via UPS on the earliest day of the expected delivery range.

The first moment I see this stunning beauty iPhone 4: I said WOW! I am totally in disbelief mode how one can make so beautiful thing. I am in total love with the lady.2. After living with this lady for some days: How could God (Apple) create so beautiful with ugliest heart!!! I mean beauty is sometime very deceptive but not that much.3. I am still in love with this stunningly beautiful lady: I return first iPhone 4 and try another iPhone 4. Still hoping for best.4. I got same replica of this lady. (God cannot create the exact replica of most beautiful things but Apple can)5. After living with this lady only for few days: I am more than happy to part my ways with this stunning beauty. Let me tell you, in my whole life I have never been so happy to part my ways with so beautiful lady.6. Now I am in totally hate of this lady to the extent I even don't want to the face of this lady. I say: Hey Beautiful lady please go back to Apple's beautiful store, museum or in REEL life (MOVIE). You have no place in my REAL life.Interested in full version of the story? Please go head and read.My first review ever (FYI I am 35+ of age and bought many products). I have never written any review for any product so far. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WRITING THIS REVIEW IS TO SAVE YOU YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. SO HERE GOES THE ONE OF MOST HONEST REVIEW OF THE GREAT IPHONE 4 WITHOUT BEING MESMERIZED BY THE SHEER BEAUTY OF THE PHONE.SO READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU DO CARE OF YOUR MONEY ELSE YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO BUY IPHONE 4 AND HAVE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF YOUR OWN.I received my iPhone 4 almost 17 days back from AT&T; on 12th Oct 2010. From the first day itself it started showing me all of its true colors.Pros:1. As everybody says great display (Retina display).2. Great and simple and nearly perfect touch user interface.3. Hands down the most beautiful phone with best built and finishing.4. 5MP HD camera.Cons:1. `ANTENNAGATE' -> From the moment we started using it we had that notorious 'antenna' problem. Everybody including us so much pissed with the voice quality suffered because of this issue that we preferred not to talk at all. Sometime the voice was so low at both ends that it was not audible at all. Even after putting the bumper on the phone did not solve the problem entirely. Sometime though rare we noticed the above antenna symptoms again. I PROUDLY SAY \"I WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE THIS PROBLEM ON ALL FOUR IPHONE 4 I HAD COME ACROSS\". ON ALL THE IPHONES THE SIGNAL BARS WENT TO 2 FROM 4-5. Many videos can be found on youtube.com for the same (JUST CHECK THEM OUT THEY WILL FEEL YOU GREAT HORROR MOVIES IPHONE 4 BEAUTY LOVERS). This issue was not blown out of proportion as against what Steve Job's claimed.There are some very important things to note here about this so called `most appreciated company' Apple and one of its best product iPhone4:(i) SEE THE CHANGING COLORS OF APPLE/APPLE CEO STEVE JOBS:(First) No such problem ->(Second) Not that big problem ->(Third) Others are having the same problem (Did you hear it before? Or at least others don't give trouble when you hold them in your normal style) ->(Fourth) Take the bumper ->(Fifth) Avoid holding in that position.Apple CEO Steve Jobs said `avoid holding that way'. Apple Please tell us why should customer amend their `normal' way of holding the phone that too after having paid so much price? Instead should not Apple should have taken the moral responsibility of this mistake and recalled it?Apple/Steve should be ashamed of when they asked to asked customer to change the way of holding the phone. But how Steve could do that? Then he will no longer be the best CEO of the so called best company? (It would have incurred the loss right?) Most ridiculous asking so far I guess. Why there should be any restriction on the most basic thing `holding the phone'. It's like one electronic switch company saying please press the button in certain way else ...'(ii) This antenna problem comes into the play when most of the right handed people hold the phone their most natural way. It seems that so big and quality conscious company has even failed to do even a simple usability and quality testing. Shame on you Apple!2. BATTERY -> Battery would run only for 24 hours at max without using battery consuming features. So all claims of this many hours for standby, video, internet etc. looks false.3. TURNED OFF ITSELF -> On 17th day my iPhone 4 turned it off on its own though it was fully charged.4. NO ADOBE FLASH SUPPORT -> Though `Adobe flash' is universal standard for web this iPhone 4 still does not support it. Great Mr. stubborn Apple!5. SPEAKER VOICE NOT GREAT -> Speaker voice not that loud and not acceptable for this so called great smart phone. Many Other phones outperform iPhone 4 in this area.6. VERY POOR SIGNAL RECEPTION AND CALL QUALITY -> Call voice quality average and not that great what one would expect from this phone. MY BLACKBERRY CURVE 8310 WITH THE SAME ATT NETWORK WOULD WORK EVEN IN UNDERGROUND PATH STATION AND THIS GREAT IPHONE 4 DOES NOT EVEN WORK INSIDE WALMART WHICH IS QUITE OPEN WITH THE SAME ATT NETWORK. POOREST SIGNAL RECEPTION. THE T-MOBILE NETWORK WITH THE BASIC PHONE (WHICH I USED TO HATE A LOT EARLIER) SEEMS WORK BETTER THANKS TO IPHONE 4. SO IN SHORT THE WORST COMBO IS WORKING BETTER WHEN COMPARED TO BEST COMBO (ATT AND IPHONE 4)Another couple shared the same thing with me. They told me that Blackberry Torch with worst network (T-Mobile) was having better reception than the dead combination iPhone and ATT.7. BAD 3G EXPERIENCE -> I noticed couple of other things with respect to 3G. When I keep 3G and cellular data on, the signal bars are very low where regular network is giving full bars and I was not able to access the web at all even in prime city locations. Not sure whose problem it is: Apple or service provider.Once I turned the cell data on and the bar became from four to one and then zero, after that my iPhone went into Searching mode forever though I turned off the cell data plan. As usual I restarted the phone and it worked. Looks like another bug in phone's simple functionality.8. BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP -> This iPhone's beauty is only skin deep. Beautiful by looks only not by heart (features). If you compare it with a woman then I would say its most beautiful woman but with HIV. So you can do whatever with this stunning lady but those basic things (you know what I mean right?)9. THE LADY WITH HIV LIKES TO BE TOUCHED AGAIN AND AGAIN -> This lady with HIV will work only when you touch it, thanks to the touch interface of it. So if want turn off the phone press the button then touch (slide). You want to turn it on; press the button and touch (slide the finger on it). Want to make a call? Touch the phone application icon and then type the number (forget the good old days when you just touch either number key or call button and you could do it). Done with you call and want to finish the call? Don't forget to touch the end button. ENOUGH?10. EXPLOITING CONSUMERS -> Like other companies (Earlier Microsoft for example) Apple also started using malpractices and exploiting the situation because this company is now in command. Some examples :(i) AV component cable you have to buy from Apple only. Other's cables do not work. Now imagine the price of Apple's AV component cable: $49. That's almost 1/10 of the price of the phone itself.(ii) The iPhone cannot be (or as easily) unlocked as other phones.(iii) I heard if you unlock the iPhone the other's carrier's SIM does not go that well (May be because of its unlocking through software not through hardware).(IV) ON ATT AND APPLE WEB SITE YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY REVIEW OF THIS GREAT IPHONE 4. REASON: APPLE CANNOT MAKE ANYTHING LESS THAN GREAT! (HA HA HA)SUMMARY: THIS IPHONE 4 IS EVERYTHING ELSE BUT CELL PHONE. PLEASE SPEND YOU MONEY ON SOMETHING WORTH AND MAKE SURE AT LEAST YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THAT IS A CELL PHONE AT LEAST WITH GOOD RECEPTION AND CALL QUALITY.Question to all of you ->Now I ask you all, the phone which cannot even offer you basic things well, what you would call it smart phone? There is one car with all kind of luxuries: AC, pool, TV and whatever you can imagine but it does not drive well. The engine gives some trouble after every two hours. Will you buy that car? Are you going to live in that car? First thing for any vehicle obviously is smooth driving right? Same way most important thing for any cell phone is good signals and good voice quality. This phone lacks in those basic things. Apple, you have to get those basic things right. So when consumer reports did not suggest this phone to consumers they were absolutely right.I am not that happy with this phone.Update on 6th Nov 2010 ->I tried my second iPhone 4 after returning the first. The experience is getting worse about this iPhone 4 and I have decided to return the phone. ATT exchanged my first iPhone4 with already returned by other customer (Looks like other than me there was one more wise guy in this world who returned this phone). Shame on ATT who charged me the price of new piece and sent me the refurbished one.Bye Bye the great beautiful iPhone 4, Please go back to Apple Beautiful store or museum or in REEL life (movie) , you have no place in my REAL life or pocket which is looking for just a decent usable cell phone.Update on 25th Nov 2010 ->I returned the second iPhone 4 also and start using my other spare $9 phone. CAN YOU BELIEVE $9 phone is working better in terms of voice and reception quality.SINCERE ADVICE ->->-> Please wait for next iPhone. This iPhone 4 really sucks. Apple had become very over-confident when they release iPhone 4, because they know there are many BEAUTY BLIND people who would buy this DUMB BEAUTY without even reading review for it even though they had to stand in the QUEUE.Update 02/26/2011 -> As I expected, As per Consumer Reports Verizon iPhone 4 has the same antenna issue.
