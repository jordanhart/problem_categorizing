{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Feiteng H7100 after some practical experience", "Author": "Robert J. Marsh \"RouterBob\"", "ReviewID": "R1RILJE9RVUDB8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to review and really evaluate the impact on the lower cost off brand phones and the existing mobile market in the US.  After some research I found this device would be about as good as it gets from a cost and capability perspective.  Also, the dual SIM support can be quite handy for us global travelers.Pro's: First impressions were really good.  Everything was delivered as indicated. The physical build quality is very nice, the phone has a solid well built feel and all of the pieces fit together without any gaps, etc.  Apps ran great and performed very well. I tried various video's both local and streaming and the experience was very good.  The audio for movies and phone is good and also the video quality was good too.  Battery Life is as expected and will generally carry you throughout the day.Con's: The GPS performance was really poor, often it takes up to 5 minutes to get any type of GPS lock, longer if you are in transit when you initiate it.  If you are looking for anything more than basic \"about where am I?\" then this device is not for you.  The wireless connectivity is flakey, often it will not connect to a WAP unless you turn off wireless and turn it back on.  I also found that once an app was uninstalled it would error out re-installing the app again.  Finding any support for the device is highly questionable, I would expect absolutely no updates to the phone.Questionable: Many of these devices claim to have 1 GB ram, however it would seem many of them have only 512 MB. Also, advertised as a 1GHz dual core the sticker on it said quad core ??? its not.  It is also unclear what size SD card is supported, there is very little clarity here as I have seen the maximum SD card size at 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB... I used the 16GB and it worked without issue. Looking at the AnTuTu performance score shows it operating at a far less rating than the name brand phones are, however, the overall performance of everything I tried was quite good (except GPS).  They list Android 4.1.1 but many of the other reviews indicate it is closer to an actual 4.0.X release, I cannot verify either way.Take away: If you are into the android platform and looking for a low cost alternative, this may be an option.  Frankly, the price point gets you the phone below what you may pay for a name brand with a 2-year contract, many of the pre-paid carrier offerings give you more for less and can really save a good amount of money over the course of a year or two, but there is definitely a lot more risk.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "5.3 Inch Capacitive Touch Screen,540*960\nCPU:MTK6577 Dual Core\nDual Camera(1*Front camera:0.3MP,1*Back camera:5.0MP)\nWifi;GPS;Bluetooth\nFashionable mobile phone for businessman", "Name": "5.3 Inch Feiteng H7100 Android 4.1 3g Smart Phone with QHD Screen GPS Dual SIM Dual Core 1ghz 8mp Camera 1gb RAM (Grey)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BTH44FjyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00APJNMKG"}}
