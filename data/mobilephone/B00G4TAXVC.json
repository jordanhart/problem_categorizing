The screen is of fair quality. It feels like commodity glass. The phone comes with a pre installed screen saver, and also a hard back case. The processor is fairly speedy, but the phone is only 256Mb. The flash is bright enough to use in the dark, but the CMOS sensor on the camera is not good for low light conditions. The 2MP camera is pretty good in outdoor well lit areas, good enough to snap those memories for a quick FB. You won't be impressing anyone with your quality snaps though. The front camera CLAIMS to be 2MP, but the CMOS sensor is of much worse quality, color and tone are much different than the rear camera, but guess what, there is an FFC on here, and it works great for selfies when you need them. Surprisingly there is a back light on the touch controls, most budget phones skip these.What you don't get: not even EDGE (2.5G), GRPS(2G) can be blisteringly slow if you are a 'media' person. Even browsing modern mobile websites on this phone over Edge can be painful. It does have Wifi, and Wifi works great. GRPS works just fine for Maps, and Email. I'm a casual business user, and so I only need this phone to stay connected, it does that job.I recommend using UC Browser or Opera Mobile for non sensitive browsing (these are proxified browsers that convert web pages to WAP). I use these WAP conversion browsers to help with speed on GRPS (makes it bearable), and also helps with the low 256Mb memory. Most of the 'slow downs' i've experienced come after using the default Android browser on a heavy web site.The battery is fairly small but the settings have been tailored, that if you have access to wifi the battery will last a long while. Since this is an GRPS phone though, if you leave background Syncing on, you will drain your battery.A few notable things are missing that allows some of the over specing (Dual Core 1.2 Ghz Processors).You also do not get, Gyro Sensor, no Ambient Light, or Proximity Sensors, Compass(not needed for google navigation). What that means is you don't get Auto Brightness Controls, When you bring the phone to your face the phone has less sensors to detect positioning - sometimes you face dial, orientation requires a shake (can get stuck). Or Geo orientation in the Google Maps, you'll need to know which direction you are walking physically.Still a great phone maker, I would buy this phone again, and would not hesitate buying one of their more premium models.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "A bargain for the price", "Author": "chester johnson", "ReviewID": "R2I1YB3SZ900V9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With so many offerings available in iphones It took me two months after diligent research to make a decision.

One day shipping, came the expected day. The phone is super light and nice! It has the newest version of Android and for what I heard, not even the Samsung Galaxy has that version of Android. The battery stays charge, and it comes with everything they say it comes with. I'm currently using with the AT&T; Straight Talk SIM card and is working great. The only thing that I think they could have done better is the mega pixels on the camera. It has a poor resolution. But other than that, I just got me an amazing phone. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone wanting to buy a good phone for less than a 100 bucks. I'm very happy with my purchase. :)", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Bruce Showers", "ReviewID": "R1XW2G1G7CPWM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Absolutely Love This Phone Its Great !!!
