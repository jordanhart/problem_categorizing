{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly Good with a few negatives", "Author": "Amazon Kid", "ReviewID": "R1JBWISMMKRKGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for sale at Officemax on Black Friday  The Huawei Glory(Net10) runs on the Verizon Network and the call quality is very good and the reception I would rate as above average to good.What else I liked:The phone has Android O.S. Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 installed and runs very smooth switching and opening up the various applications.  The stock Android Browser did a great job as I browsed various mobile sites and websites.  Youtube videos and streaming audio worked very good with the 3G speeds that my Glory was receiving at the time.Another positive is the solid construction of this phone.  It is thicker than the Huawei Ascend 2( an older Huawei model) and you'd almost expect there to be a slide out keyboard.  Some people do not like a bit bulkier phones but in this case I feel that Huawei took care for a more solid constructed phone resulting in hopefully a long phone life.For a  phone of this price range the sound was surprisingly good.  Loud enough but not too loud and you won't get that tinny sound you can get with some other inexpensive cell phones.Has a built in FM receiver along with an app and a widget.  Up to 40 presets can be saved.What I didn't like:Camera is only 3.2 megapixels, no flash and no way to turn the shutter sound off.  I'd say the camera would be adequate to use for bar code reader apps and portrait photos in reasonably well lit environments.Battery life isn't too good.  Moderate use would chug through battery life.  Best use would be voice calls and light data use and it may make it through a day if you're lucky.  Downloading apps and streaming music blazed through battery life rapidly.Other than FM radio very disappointing as to the selection of included apps or widgets.  Had the whole google suite of apps which I will not use anyway with the exception of the Google Play Store.  It does have a version of Quickoffice that will only view documents-- no editing or creating.Phone doesn't come included with an sd card.  Doesn't bother me as they're cheap enough to buy anyway.  The Glory supports up to a 32 GB  SD Card.A few more things.  The SD card is in a poor location.  The back cover must be removed and battery lifted from its slot to fit the card in its place across from where the battery sits.  I did not use the wi-fi or bluetooth features yet.  When I do use these I will return and update my review accordingly.All in all, this is a solid phone. 4 stars at the Black Friday price I paid and about 3.5 stars at regular price. If the Glory had a decent camera I would have bumped up the rating one notch.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Minus two stars for this", "Author": "Ancient DIY'er \"Gregg\"", "ReviewID": "R25AT8KKEGSBKM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Minus one star for the crap phone and minus another star for Net10's lack of service.  $50 a month for data you cannot access and a phone that only works when it wants.  The touch screen doesn't work when you touch it but will work in your pocket when you don't want it to. Then it will drop calls in the middle and sometimes re-boot itself with no warning.  If it stays on for several days, it needs to be manually re-booted to function at all.  Stay away from Huawei and Net10.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mini review and comparison with ZTE Valet", "Author": "Agrajag", "ReviewID": "R2GWNI4KDHXQVM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the Glory and used it for between 1 and 2 weeks just to try it out but didn't activate it. Its basic functions as an android device and communicating over wifi were fine. It seemed attractive and well made for a $100 device. Then I became interested in the ZTE Valet and bought one of those too. At someone's suggestion I installed an app called Quick System Info Pro on both phones. I'm no expert but this app seemed to indicate that the ZTE manages its memory much better - lots more available space in just about every category. Plus the ZTE was $20 less at BestBuy. I think the Glory is a little better made and operates a bit more smoothly, but the $20 and the memory factor swung it for me, I returned the Glory - but I don't think you'd be disappointed with it.BTW the Glory has an FM radio, which would be nice, but the Valet has a flash for its camera (which can be used as a flashlight); this seems to me to be a much more useful feature.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT", "Author": "Roger Earl", "ReviewID": "R3V4IWYF5KY68A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FOR BE IT WORKS GREAT.  $ 7.00 A MOUTH TRACFONE 3X EVERY THING.

Then someone buys some minutes on my account then reverses the charge.  Net10 shuts off my phone unless I pay for the minutes added to my phone.  So I buy minutes and they reset my account to the minutes I just bought and change my phone number.  I called an american number for service after arguing with Indian people about my account.  So it was fixed.  2 days later my internet minutes were down to 0 from 1950 MB.  I never used the internet, but it was gone.
