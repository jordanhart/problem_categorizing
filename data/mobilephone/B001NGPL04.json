{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Elijah D \"dev1zero\"", "ReviewID": "R22RV6SNXRCVSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is simply amazing. It has everything you want in a smart phone; Web browser, GPS, still/video camrea, wifi, bluetooth and a decent number of apps (not to mention its good looks). It also comes with a 8GB micro SD card which you can upgrade if you need to. Touch flow 3d makes up for the outdated UI of WM 6.1. Whenever I forget it at home, I really miss it.I use it with a \"go\" plan cause I'm not willing to pay a carrier tax every month. It's no big deal because I don't make that many calls and I use data apps only where I have access to Wifi. It may not be a good fit for someone who has a monthly plan. You might as well just take advantage of the carrier discounts you get on a new handset especially since the phone doesn't support 3G in the states. I think HTC missed a big oppurtunity by not releasing a US 3G model.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone equipment (UPDATED AGAIN)", "Author": "H. Martins \"Helder Martins\"", "ReviewID": "RDCIYH2RQFM7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a techno geek, I like all the electronic gadgets and have to say this one is the best phone I have ever had by far.This smart phone offers you the best you can have using Windows Mobile. It has the same size as the iPhone. Only being phone's width which is bigger than iPhone, however, it doesn't has anything to envy to the Mac's big seller.It comes with everything you might need for your day to day routine and also, HTC has improved battery capacity (I had an HTC Diamond before this one and battery couldn't last more than 5 hours!).Only thing which is a con for me in this phone is its price, but nothing can be that perfect.UPDATE (10/28/2009): I thought this equipment has died on me after it started to fail to connect to the Internet using my mobile's line. I made a lot of tests, went to support and even tried using different SIM cards (from the same provider -Movistar-) and thought it was dead. It resulted to be that my provider has made a change in its system (which they don't even know about it, at least not their first level of support) so my phone can NOT get connected to data plan again (voice and SMS are just fine). Apologies for the ones who read my previous feedback saying the phone dead before second month, it wasn't true, which is going to die is my service plan with Movistar because they're such incompetents providers.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Phone To Date", "Author": "Brad Redding", "ReviewID": "RVY69FRT9L3DN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the HTC Touch HD for about three months. I have had over 7 different phones this year alone, buying and trying and then selling them within  a months time with the exception of the HD. This phone is so much fun. The quality and the looks are unmatched to date from any one. The Touch Flo 3D on this is beautiful. I use this with AT&T; On a Prepaid program with absolutely no issues at all. There are countless APPS that can be downloaded for free on many web sites.I have added the SPB Shell software on this and it is unbelievable. The price of this is a little high but for once you are paying for the quality and not the name (Blackberry)of the manufacture. I f you are a Windows OS person you will not be disappointed. This one will stay in my home for a long while.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worthy of every buck!", "Author": "Sanket Daru \"Sank\"", "ReviewID": "R15WIP7VMN6I81", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is truly amazing. The looks, the feel, the responsiveness... Everything has been beautifully crafted. Definitely, the touch could have been better (don't expect iPhone like breezy touch), but its easily offset by the wide range of both free and paid apps available on the internet. If you like toys and you like to mod them to satiate your inner cravings, then this phone is definitely for you.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone! ! ! !", "Author": "Kaye Olson \"Kaye Olson\"", "ReviewID": "R1M9H1M5MYYXMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an HTC Tilt 2 when my contract was up in January.  I am with AT&T; and thought I would stay for another 2 year contract.  The Tilt 2 has given me nothing but headaches, freezing up, etc.  VERY Slow internet connections, even though it's 3G.I wanted the HTC HD2 from the minute I read the reviews on it.  I was not wrong.  It does not have 3G, but I can tell you it runs much faster than the Tilt which is supposed to have 3G.  Downloads are faster, internet access is quicker and I am so glad I switched.This phone will not disappoint you, it's fun to work with and everything about it is just awesome.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'm selling it for $500", "Author": "Ayesha Syed \"Nokia 786\"", "ReviewID": "R1E2KIUPSGDOBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey guys, I'm selling the HTC touch HD on amazon for 500.
