A lot of call were dropped and a lot of searching for bars occurred. I have not had to do so with this phone. While it may be also due to switching Sprint to Verizon, I get a good signal almost everywhere even in large buildings (sometimes).I got this phone because it was the freebie offered when I started Verizon.I don't expect a lot from phones. Just be able to make calls and not drop them. It does all that fairly well. As far as extras, it has no built in games (that I could find at least) and no stop watch. It does have a camera. I have used it occasionally. The pictures are not that great from it. There are probably other gizmos too that I'm not aware of.My one major complaint are the side buttons which tend to get pressed a lot if you have other stuff in your pocket. Not sure how but some voice recognition dialing voiced menu comes up which is annoying because it does it even if the ringer is set to vibrate. May be a way to turn that off but I'm not aware of it.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002QHTK4C"}}
