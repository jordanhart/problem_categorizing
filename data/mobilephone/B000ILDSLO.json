{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far, so good.", "Author": "J. Napodano \"VTNap\"", "ReviewID": "R1YHLAG63G2J2N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the 6945 for about two weeks now.  So far it is performing very well.  Setting up the email took a while to figure out.  If you are like me, you hate all the clutter and useless software pre-installed on these devices, so it took me a while to clean up the view.I don't use the Outlook Sync function, but it looks like it works well.  The auto-sync function is something to be aware of.  The first time I did auto-sync it wiped-out my contact list on my PC and replaced with the few contacts on my sim card.  Luckily it only deleted the contacts to my outlook delete folder so it was easy to restore.  Here are some PROs and CONs after about two weeks of use:PRO:1) Wifi or Cingular GPRS email works well.  You will have to set up two different accounts - one for your Wifi and another for when you are using GPRS, but that is easy to do. The reason you should do this is so that when you are on Wifi you can send via the Wifi server instead of the Cingular GPRS wireless network.  I have set up both a work and personal home email account (both POP3).  Looks like this device can handle several more email accounts if necessary.2) Internet explorer works very well.  This is not a lame mobile web browser that strips down sites.  It is the real deal.  Websites look just like they do on your PC or laptop - only smaller.  You can customize the view pretty easily.  Favorites folder is easy to set up and the address bar is easy to use.3) The screen is very nice.  I find myself using both the built in keyboard and the on screen touch pad.  Both work very well.  Resolution is very good.4) WM-5 is very nice.  I've used the Work and Excel programs so far.  They are essentially the same as on your PC.  Why anyone would want to use an iPaq to edit a DOC or XLS file is beyond me, but if you need to do this you can.  I have not had a chance to use the Powerpoint viewer yet, but I'm sure it works as well as Word and Excel.5) I purchased a 1GB mini-SD storage card.  That is very easy to pop in and out.6) You can use MP3s or WMA files as your ring tone - that's pretty cool.7) The device is very solid.  Not as big as you would think.  Fits well in your pocket or on a belt clip.  Looks like it will hold up well.  The pen locks in the side and is also pretty solid.  Not like the Treo, which I've heard is very fragile.8) And now for the Phone - It works very well!  I was surprised because most people complain about the phone quality on these devices.  I find the sound quality to be as good as my RAZR.  The Cingular Sim-Card can be swapped in and out between my RAZR and iPaq, so if I am going to a sporting event or bar I and dont want to bring the iPaq I can just swap the sim-card right back into the RAZR and it works.  I had to call Cingular and get them to change my phone to the iPaq.  This was purely for data.9)YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE THE \"Treo Package\".  Don't let Cingular sell you that extra crap.  I simply added the MediaNet200 package for $19.99 which gives you unlimited Media + 200 text messages a month.  That is plenty of text messages and the unlimited data gives you all the web surfing and emailing you can do!10) GPS navigation is pretty neat little function.  You have to download the maps from Microsoft Pocket Streets, but they are free.  The GPS sucks battery life like crazy, but if you are on the road in a strange city this can be very helpful.11) Windows Media player works just like your PC.  I added about 750mb of music, so the device is actually an MP3 player as well.  It has an external speak or you can stick in headphones (be aware, using the media player sucks battery life).CONS:1) I'd say the biggest con is the battery life.  If you are on just GPRS/Phone with stand by (no talking, emailing or surfing) it will probably last about 2 days.  However, using the phone or emailing cuts that down to about only 12-14 hours.  If you set up the WiFi as well as have the phone on, your battery life is about 8-10 hours.  If you also have the GPS and Bluetooth on, I'd say 5-6 hours.  My advice is to not use the GPS or Bluetooth unless you really need them.  And, if you are going to be on WiFi, leave the device in the craddle.  The USB charging is very slow but the AC adapeter chargest the device to full in about 2 hours.  YOU CAN PURCHASE A BIGGER BATTERY - and you probably should.2) Cingular does not support the 6945.  You will have to tell them you have the 6925.  I called HP - they are identical except that the 6925 is Cingular only and the 6945 is unlocked for T-Mobile as well.  Obviously Cingular wants you to buy the 6925 instead, but the 6945 is the same.  If you call Cingular for support, just tell them you have a 6925 to avoid even having to explain things to them.3) The ring volume is not that loud.  But, it does have vibrate.4) Do not buy the leather case that Amazon sells with the device for like $[...].  The device comes with a belt clip that works just fine.  If you want something nicer, go buy it in person....All in all this is an excellent device.  I use to carry a cell phone and my laptop on the road - now all I need is this.  Again, you can swap your sim-card in and out, so keep your old cell phone for times when you don't want to carry around the iPaq.I only gave it 4 stars because of the battery life.  That can be fixed by purchasing the more powerful battery, but that will cost you extra.  Also, the device is pretty expensive relative to the Treo or Q or Blackberry.  None of those devices have WiFi though.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT ALL IN ONE DEVICE", "Author": "Smart \"Smart\"", "ReviewID": "R34QLTX2P342SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this.

Took no more time to get mail then any other Pocket PC. I installed Tom-Tom, 5-minute veterinary consult, Plumb's veterinary drugs, synchronized it with my calendar and numbers and I am in business. Using a Jabra bluetooth, I can stream my MP3's while doing everything else. The only feature missing was voice activated dialing, but I am adding MS Voice Commander to fix that. I get better reception and signal (and stability) with the HP 6945 than with my T-Mobile MDA. So, it was a great purchase. Picture quality is not what you want if you are a photographer, but it is a phone. In a pinch, a picture is still worth a thousand words. Beats carrying a phone, a camera and a PDA; since this is all in one. I find that my thumbs don't mind the keyboard, but it does take a little adapting.

You will no longer have to be concerned with reconnecting to headset constantly.  Plus, NO MORE ECHO - thank god!  the echo problem is fixed.  When using the bluetooth to answer phone, it answers imediately and you can talk the second you hit the button, no delay.  Headset sounds crystal clear to caller. (I don't know why all these folks are claiming they can't get their headset to pair up.  I had no problem)Second, in comparison to the 6315, this phone is greased lightening. Its all a matter of perspective, but if you owned the 6315, you will love the speed on this 6945.  ie. hit the power button and it shuts right off with no delay. I would say it operates at double to triple the relative speed of the 6315.Third, no more hangs like the old days.  I have been using it non stop for 48 hours utilizing remote surveylance software, installing lots of programs, using mini sd card, streaming with wmp, using internet explorer, using mail & phone, and even running wifi bluetooth and gps - NO REBOOT REQUIRED YET. and memory bounces right back when closing programs rather than clogging up and requiring resets.Basically, Everything that bothered you about the 6315 seems to be fixed.Beware, to my surprise ther was NO included backup software but I installed sprite backup/restore and it works perfectly.Yes, battery life sucks, get a car charger and get over it.  Note that the bigger battery solves that problem.  Alot of people are saying to get the bigger bat if you use your gps, but if you use gps you will plug into charger to keep phone from going into standby constantly so tell them to stick it:)Note: With small Battery, I took phone off charger at 10:30am and using all features except gps under average loads (including internet surfing and streaming for an hour using wifi and gprs), it was at 62% by 4:30pm. it charged to 100% in about 30-40 min.other Things to note:MS voice 1.6 is AMAZING.  It hasn't screwed up once.  No comparison to older products.You can now associate rings and photos to your contacts which is nice cause it pops the persons pic up when calls come in (I dont know if spb added this feature or it came with).and this phone works perfectly on tmobile service. The only issue was internet access (I had to change the prefix on the internet server options from internet3 to wap).SPB add on is a must!You will have issues with screen resolution, but since win mobile 5 doesnt support the larger screen res anymore, you might as well get used to it.  Plus, you know that new mobile 5 software will be modified for the newer screen sizes.Anyway, that's about it.In conclusion, if you have the 6315 and your thinking about an upgrade, DO IT!!!!", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "still the king of all smart phones", "Author": "qw", "ReviewID": "R3FWS6SYGHON6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.

Ready to throw those pricey Data Plans into garbage binP.S. I've used it for 5 months, and during this 5 months:a) I never missed single phone call even when I'm in a shelter room where the signal is very weak (my sony ericsson 810i missed signal sometimes), when I'm listening to MP3 through the included headset and when I'm watching IPTVb) I never need to reboot due to freeze. Sometimes, it does show a waiting icon for a couple of seconds, that's because it's paging out system memory in order to accommodate more application to run at the same time. There is no harm, you won't miss a call, you won't lost any data.c) When start to sync with PC, there are a couple of seconds during which keypad or screen won't response.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this 'dumbphone'", "Author": "Chris Burke \"Critical\"", "ReviewID": "R2FCIRJM26Y5Y4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is totally outdated.

Everything on this device is outdated and bad quality. HP Helpdesk people try to help you if there's a problem (and there are a lot) but do not know what they're talking about.

Bowman", "ReviewID": "RCBBZPVSVLY7C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was one of the early adopters of the iPAQ h6315 and suffered the consequences.  The hw6945 is head and shoulders above it.  HP has addressed most of the hardware and software issues (although a little more RAM and processor speed would be nice).  Strangely enough, one of the most important new features is the screen cover.  Now you no longer have to wonder what terrible things might happen when the unit powers up in your pocket.  The keyboard is small, but usable however not all applications have an indicator that it's in NumLock mode.  The GPS receiver is excellent.  The MS Pocket Streets that comes installed has so few maps available that it's essentially worthless, but the Delorme Street Atlas Pocket PC software (that comes free with the latest version of Street Atlas) is great.  You can buy a 1gig mini-SD card (for about $35) and download any or all maps of the US and Canada; just beware that the larger the map, the slower the processing. The routing feature will talk you to your destination while showing your current location on the screen.  Another S/W package that should be considered mandatory is MS Voice Command.  I have over 800 contacts that are synchronized (over Bluetooth) with my laptop, and the voice recognition accuracy is astounding.  There is no training required; it works off of the spelling of the names.  Making calls from the car is simply a matter of pushing a button and saying \"Call Jim Smith at work\".  I have a Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset and it works seamlessly with the iPAQ.

The body built is not comparable to that of Treo which looks very professional. 6945 looks like a cheap toy- The OS is very slow in responses - sometimes takes about 4-5 seconds to respond for a key click- GPS does work, but you need to shell of $150+ for TomTom or equivalent money for any good GPS software. You might probably get a Nuvi for the same price, instead of adding TomTom on this slow device- HP doesn't give any additional mini-SD card with this device. You need to buy your own. MiniSD is more expensive than normal SD and even micro-SD. I am not sure why did HP chose this format- flip-case feels as if it would break at any moment- you cannot sync (activesync) with your computer over wifi. It seems Microsoft decided that activesync does not have encryption built-in and disabled syncing over wifi for security reasons. Sounds awful when you first hear, but that is the truth. The Wifi in this device is useful only to fetch emails from google etc., but you cannot sync with your computer- there is no HP support for this device.

The instructions manual that comes with such a complicated machine is a paltry 60 pages long brochure, so you really do not get any info on advance features. The Additional Product Guide in the CD is not much better, just a standard Windows Help, missing a lot of key functions (for example, try to find some useful guidelines for the GPS function).  After purchasing a 2GB Pertec MiniSD and installing it, I had to contact HP to solve some problems. Through chat, I explained my problems, only to have the HP Rep say \"we do not support memories over 1GB and/or from other manufacturers\" (this is nos stated in the manual). The DOWNLOADED manual is far from extensive: 204 pages, but most of them are only half full. An example: Functions like creating a playlist in the Media player are non existent or not explained, and of course, you can not synchronize the Ipaq with your MS Media Player because most everybody has more than 2GB of music in their PC.

I got attracted by the idea of having everything I needed in only one device which could fit my pocket (talking about size). The result is this relatively slim pocket pc with a huge lovely and clean screen with all the abilities that HP had to offer with this product.Ok, pocket pcs can bear several software as Microsoft Word, Excel, Power Point and Picture Viewer, as well as Internet Explorer, File Manager, Pocket AutoCAD, etc. I also loved the idea of having my personal organizator as a databook, worldwide alarm clock, appointments manager, large address book and also... the WiFi posibility. I've got a wireless connection and I must tell, this device works pretty well. Websites are seen so clear and just the same you would watche them on a conventional personal computer. Connection time is fair and gets signal almost inmediately.Connectivity between devices is also a great stuff, as this HP wonder has integrated bluetooth and IR ways, as well as a craddle with a USB cable, in case you don't have a wireless enabled computer. It includes a built-in digital camera which I understand is just 1.3 megapixels, but however, I already have a digital camera, so I don't need a fancy one on this unit.Speed and storage is enough for daily use but if you are a hard user of data and need speed, you may require to buy a 2 or 4 GB Mini SD (as I did, of course). I have installed some of the complement programs on my SD card and the main ones on the unit. This is a great way of saving some memory for other large files or running software.Something I would improve is the battery life. In my case, using the phone for about 1 hour and keeping the screen on (working) for 45 minutes a day, it only stays alive for 3 days, then I need to charge it. If we could replace the whole craddle for only a cable to connect it to a computer, we would also have a better choice (specially for travellers).In conclusion, I love this device...

You already know everything it can do from the description; I can't really expand much upon it.  Overall I like it although I have experienced some trouble.Cons:Battery life--sometime the battery unexpectedly dies--some attribute this to automatic syncing.  Wi-fi & GPS kill it really fast too.  On my unit lines go across the screen and shutdown the device around 20% battery.HP Navigation software is $129 extra; you just get a 60 day trial.  You'd think it would be included for the price.  You can buy a no-name navigation device for the same money nowadays, so I don't know how they get away with this price.  Plus if you have a data plan, you can use google maps for free.  The next cheapest program is Delorme Street Atlas, but the interface on this is tough--don't try navigating with Street Atlas on a PPC at 80 mph.  Also note, the included Pocket Streets doesn't do routing; it can just track your location.Sometimes the joystick pointer seems to be stuck (the screen keeps scrolling).Voice Dial isn't included either.  Something you expect from a phone nowadays costs you $40 (though cheaper alternatives exist).Bluetooth--doesn't autoconnect to either of my headsets.  I have to re-enter my passkey each time.  To connect, I have to turn on bluetooth then click on the shortcut for the device I want to connect.  I could operate my old phone from my headset while it was jammed in my pocket.Camera--takes about 2 seconds for the picture to snap, but makes a deceptive noise before the shot is taken.  Sometimes I wait a whole minute for the picture to come back for review.  Quality is OK though.Not a lot of programmable buttons.  My previous PPC had wealth of programmable buttons.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "I Have Learnt a Bit of Patience", "Author": "Adegboyega Olusegun", "ReviewID": "R1D2XKG98PHSG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, the product is comparable in functionality to other PDAs/Smartphones (Nokia N95, O2 XDA, etc) in the market. It comes with all the expected cool features, such as Wi-fi, Bluetooth, GRPS, touchscreen and a camera.I do think the phone is a bit slow in responding to keyboard and stylus inputs. The response that you get from the phone while placing a call is a bit slow compared to other phones. You have to learn to be a bit patient while making calls. The camera function is particularly slow in starting.Another issue I have with the phone is the battery life. The battery life is really inadequate for using the installed applications on a regular basis. The back-light and application usage really cause the battery to run down pretty fast.A common feature in most phones that is missing in this phone is the ability to map telephone numbers that appear in text messages to names if the numbers are present in the address book. The lack of this feature can sometimes be a source of confusion for me, especially with SMS delivery notifications. I sometimes get confused about which SMS I sent the SMS delivery notification is referring to.In conclusion, this device is excellent--no doubt.

I allways close unnecesary opened applications, but it still slow.  It seems to me that HP have to work on using a new processor, something about double the actual speed of 416 Mhz.  Here are some observations:1. The phone works, just put your SIM card and use it, thats ok.  The problem is that the software and response time never compares with my previous Sony Ericsson phones, my last one was a W600i.  You need both hands to operate it, if you are driving... looking for a phone number in contacts, Call History or the Speed Dial, be careful, use your Pocket PC phone can easily kill you... of course you can use a voice activation software that in my case, Latin America, almost none of the automatic softwares works (accent I guess). If I'm dialing a number and the voice mail alert starts playing right before the recorder starts... it doesn't matter if you press the End button, buttons are so slow in response that you have no time to place a miss call...2. The GPS works just fine, but not with the HP applications... there are no maps for my country (Panama)I used the GPS Tuner software and had to georeference some images from google earth.3. The HP 6945 freezes a lot, it is very anoying having to restard so often.  Some times it freezes when I'm receiving a call.4. The square screen is not good because some of my applications don't work on it.5. The camera is really slow to start, very limited functionality and bad quality photos... if you want to waste good moments... just go and take pictures with this mediocre camera.6. The battery is very bad, you better keep on syncronizing very often or you'll end up with out batteries very soon.  There a lot of excuses like don't use your Blue tooth to often, dont use your GPS because it'll suck your battery, pay 55$ for a new bulky battery, stuf like that.7.

I will try to answer here the main doubts I had before the purchase.1) Size and weight: it is very small and light, practically the size of my old iPAQ 1940 but slightly thicker and heavier. It can be easily carried in a shirt pocket and does not require the use of a case due to its screen cover.2) Screen: square, 3 inch, 240x240, surprisingly good both in size and legibility. It has the same width and character size as the 3.5 inch screen of the iPAQ 1940 and the fact of being shorter is not very disturbing. Actually, when entering text, both screens have practically the same size due to the space occupied by the virtual keyboard on the iPAQ 1940. My feeling is that this screen has much better legibility than the 2.8 inch 240x320 screen found on most phones due to its greater width and character size. Furthermore, the virtual keyboard is very small and difficult to use on a 2.8 screen. I installed the free Haali Reader program and can read eBooks as easily as on the 3.5 inch screen of the iPAQ 1940. As for the legibility outdoors, it is much better than that of the iPAQ 1940: it is very good in bright sunlight and acceptable under non direct lighting.3) Keyboard: very good once you get used to it. It is noticeably faster than a virtual keyboard on a 3.5 inch screen and much faster than a virtual keyboard on a 2.8 screen.4) Operating system: Windows mobile 5.0 has a couple of big advantages with respect to the 2003 Operating System.4.a) Office programs are much improved. Word Mobile uses now the same file format as the PC version and maintains all the document formatting. Excel Mobile includes now the possibility to make charts. A PowerPoint viewer is now included.4.b) The lower part of the screen now includes two softkeys (options that change depending on the program and circumstance), which are accessed by the two inner keys (just as on mobile phones). This feature, together with the central joystick and the keyboard, make it possible to use the device almost without using the stylus, which is very convenient.5) Battery life: quite good, lasts easily for a full day of normal use. However, with constant GPS use, it lasts for a little over 4 hours.6) Telephone: 4 band, very sensitive, good sound, does not feel at all too big in the hand. Just great to write SMS messages!7) WiFi: excellent. The possibility to have Internet access at every hotspot is incredible. Internet Explorer is fairly good and using Skype is a joy.8) Bluetooth: I did not try it yet.9) Digital Camera: fairly good. I read a lot of negative comments about this camera but found that pictures are perfectly acceptable, even when viewed on a PC screen, if the highest resolution and lowest compression are used. However, the delay between the instant the button is pressed and the photo is taken is quite long, so that the camera is only suitable for static subjects.10) GPS: very good. While it does not use the SIRF chipset, the GPS is very sensitive, much more so than my Garmin eTrex Legend. It works perfectly under tree cover and even inside some buildings. Furthermore, the first satellite detection is much faster. If you plan to buy a hard case for outdoor use be aware that an all aluminum case severely limits satellite detection.Bottom line: I am quite happy with this device that surpassed my expectations in almost all aspects. I think that the purchase of one of the many devices with a 2.8 inch screen could only be advisable for younger people with good eyesight, provided that is has a sliding keyboard.", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Best PDA of them all", "Author": "J.

The list of attractions is big for the hw6945:- GSM phone- Bluetooth- WiFi- GPSBut I must say Windows Mobile and its applications are a lousy shadow of what I had with PalmOS. Every single application is more limited and less intelligent than its Palm counterpart. For instance:- ToDo list doesn`t have categories- Contacts don`t allow a series of customization that Palm allows (it looks like we went back to the early bad sofwatre designs - replacing customization for lots of columns on the database)- Calendar appointments (especially recurrent ones)are much harder to configure. Palm has a very clever design, BTW, for recurrent events.- Outlook is much heavier and less customizable than PalmDesktop- Synchronization is a painfull process, I still don`t know how to get a few things synchronized the way I want, and getting help with Microsfot products is much more difficultThe actual features (GSM Phone, WiFi, etc.) are OK, no complaints except for the anit-intuitive wasy to configure and use them. Things are spread all over, so if you land in a different country (I`ve used it in India, Holland and now Brazil) and want to customize a few things (like choosing the carrier, or configuring GPRS) you have to visit dozens of different places. Those things seem to work OK, though.Maybe this is just bad luck, but in any case after 1 month of use the backlight is malfunctioning (goes on and off randomly), and needs to be replaced, which is something very hard to do overseas (I bought it in the US, but I live in Brazil).As soon as I can compensate for the financial damage, I`ll certainly replace the iPaq for something else, preferably a PalmOS-based device (or any other OS really) with WiFi...
