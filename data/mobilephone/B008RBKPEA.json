{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Inexpensive phone for international travel", "Author": "G. Sherwood", "ReviewID": "RF0A8QIAYLRMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for a recent trip to France, along with a Telestial Passport Lite International SIM card with $5.00 Credit for 190 countries.  I only intended to use it for emergency phone calls, and I didn't need any frills.  Fortunately for me, but not so good for this review, there were no emergencies, so I didn't actually use it to make any calls, but I felt I should write up something to help others in a similar situation, to provide information on how to have a lifeline back home without spending a lot of money.  My US cell phone company doesn't do international roaming, so that wasn't an option.  It's possible to rent phones for international use that are already set up, but would have cost just as much or more as buying this phone and a sim card, and I would have to return it and pay for it again the next time I go overseas.  With this phone and sim card combination, I pay once and can use it for years to come.The instructions provided with the phone are wholly inadequate, and this is why I'm giving it only 4 stars.  The manufacturer didn't even see fit to indicate how to turn the phone on. Fortunately, in the end the set up wasn't difficult, and could be done at home, well before leaving for my trip. First, remove the back of the phone by inserting your thumbnail into a little groove at the bottom of the phone between the back case piece and the middle colored trim piece and prying it off. Then insert the sim card into sim slot 1 by sliding it under the metal retaining clip - the notch in one corner indicates the correct orientation, and your sim card will have a matching notch. Then put in the battery, put the back back on, and charge it for several hours (the instructions say 24 hours, but mine was fully charged in about 4 hours).  Once charged, I turned on the phone (see below), went through the setup for the sim card (which is specific to the sim card, so I won't describe that here), changed the ringtone and ringtone volume (see below), and was all set.  Not counting charging, the whole thing took maybe 20 minutes.As I mentioned, I didn't need to actually use the phone.  However, I did receive a text message as part of the process of setting up the sim card (no problem there and it was easy enough to figure out), and I did have the phone on the entire time I was in France.  The battery life was excellent - I didn't need to charge it at all the entire 10 days I was there, and by the end of the 10 days, the battery indicator only went down one notch, so it probably could have gone a few days more.  This is even more impressive because I don't wear a watch so I used it frequently to check the time (which uses power each time the screen comes on).  The screen was easy to read, and it seemed to have good reception - full bars in most places throughout the country, and the phone updated with the network I was on, so I know there was communication between the phone and the cell towers.  Sadly, I can't comment on actual call quality.Because of the lack of instructions, I copied and pasted some info that I found helpful from another review for the same phone but a different color (thanks to MichaelAngelo for providing it).Important buttons: center input button with left, right, up, down scrolling.soft keys - are above the answer and end call keys.Turn on/off: press and hold the end call key - release when on or off.Menu: shortcut press left soft key.Phone book: shortcut press right soft key.Flashlight on/off: shortcut press and hold center input button -release when on or off.Change language: press left soft key - scroll down to settings (wrench symbol) -scroll down to option 4 phone settings (Spanish/PortuguesConfiguracion del telefono) - scroll to option 2 language(Spanish/Portugues Idiorna) press center input button -scroll to English - Press center input button or OK.Speaker phone : press right soft key on - press right soft key again off.Vibrate on/off: press and hold # key (lower right corner).Lock keys: at home screen press and release center input button -then quickly press * key (lower left corner) a key symbolappears on screen. Repeat steps to unlock keys.(to answer a call in lock mode press the answer key).(to make a call the keys must be unlocked).Lock keys auto: press left soft key - scroll to settings (wrench symbol) -scroll to security settings - scroll to auto keypad lock -select auto lock setting (recommend 30 seconds or more).Voicemail: press and hold 1 key to set or check.Ringtone volume: at home screen press up scroll key - select general -select option 2 customize - scroll to option 4 (ringtone volume) -press center input button - scroll right or left toIncrease/decrease volume.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Travel phone", "Author": "Traveller", "ReviewID": "RXJVGKDQF5W4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We used the BLU Jenny as a travel phone for a recent trip to Spain. It is a great basic unlocked phone which hold can hold two Sims cards for greater savings while traveling abroad. We used a basic Orange Sim card that sells for 10 euros and another Sim for international calls. Public phones are awful in Spain. A basic phone is a must to keep in touch with others or for checking on hotel or restaurant reservations. A memory card is needed to store pictures on the phone. Also, the instructions for inserting the memory card can be improved. Overall, I was very pleased with my purchase of two phones for travel and I was very sad when one phone was accidentally left in a taxi.

FM radio2. MP3 player3. Bluetooth4. 2 SIM card slots5. micro-USB charge/dataThe speakers are pretty loud. I listened to the radio on the beach and it was great.There is one strange con to this phone is that they did tried to save space by not putting in any headphone jack. I knew this was the case when I ordered it but didn't realize that it would be this hard to get around it. The music options are:1. Bluetooth headphones - so far not impressed with either sound or price. I got a pair of LG stereo headset for $60. Good for calls, music is terrible.UPDATE: the awful MP3 sound is not because of the headset but due to an old Bluetooth stack on the Phone. I experienced same sound on an old (6 yo) laptop but not on last year's Samusung Galaxy, that one sounded great.2. micro-USB to 3.5 adapter - proprietary so no guarantee that it will work. I am waiting on a Motorolla adapter in the mail. If it works, I'll update the review.UPDATE: this did not work3. micro-USB to a USB adapter to a USB gaming set. Have not explored this option but it could potentially work.Overall a nice phone for folks who don't want the data plan.

I needed a \"burner\" phone PRONTO, so asked for the cheapest with a \"no plan\" option.  BAD idea!  ***Apparently the quality control is simply missing.*** Cellphones are always frustrating at first, but this phone is a total LEMON.It  has been a major frustration since I got it (at store, not Amazon, btw - couldn't use computer at time).  I rarely pan a product - generally don't review if I can't say *something* nice - but you REALLY don't want to take a chance on this phone, even if you have to pay a bit more.The ONLY nice thing I can say about the phone I got is that it is a little bit better than no phone at all - it works *sometimes.*-----------------UPDATE 4/14/14 - Starting in MARCH I began to have troubles charging it (2 months usage)  - by mid-month it was dead in the water -- would not even turn ON.-----------------A FEW of the frustrations===================1- the \"manual\" (a fold-out in teensy type) was only in Spanish. I speak English & purchased phone in Ohio.  Fortunately for me (after reading some of the other bad reviews), someone else set up the phone itself -- in English.2- the \"help\" text on the phone is less than worthless - tells me to plug in a \"compatible headset,\" for example -- but where?  No clue - no port.  Can't find an online manual to help me (links returned in search engines 404).It took forever to click various menus to figure out how to set up a bluetooth headset on this particular phone -- you NEED a headset if you only have the use of one (non-dominant) hand!3- What's REALLY frustrating is that it doesn't seem to work the same way twice.  At first, I thought it was me, so I started writing things down (once my hand was healed enough to be able to scribble notes) -- NOPE.  Sometimes you have to press a key once, sometimes twice -- sometimes even three times.  The screen reflects what you are pressing, but it doesn't DO what it is supposed to do (like hang up, send, etc.)4- Even worse, the MENUs are screwy!!  Highlite an option and press a key, and it gives you the options for a different choice.  Repeat?  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  Changing the ringer volume has been an Easter Egg hunt -- I go where I went last time & it's just not there.  Next time, it's somewhere ELSE.5- THEN there's the \"call log\" - simply a list of how many times a number has *ever* called me (or I, them), and you have to scroll through the list to see who has called LATELY.*Even* when I have input a name & number in the phones address book, it doesn't always pick up the name, and seems to see the caller as a separate being (with it's own count).  Sometimes it starts a new \"count\" when it DOES pick up the name. Good luck figuring out who's waiting for a call back unless you have a ton of time and patience.6- Moving right along to why you want a phone to begin with -- it won't stay connected.  Hangs up all by itself - sometimes 4 or more times in a 30-minute call,  Almost EVERY call -- that can't be the provider, nobody's that bad.6- I could go on - but why?  As the ADD Poster Girl, I'm not a fan of having to learning a new cellphone anyway, and generally stay well behind the \"bleeding edge\" until I'm forced to change -- but THIS one is the absolute worst phone experience I've had -- EVER!Cast just off, so I am *finally* able to begin to put everything stolen back in place and hook up my \"real\" cellphone and go back to my \"real\" provider (Verizon vs. Cincinnati Bell), thank you GOD!!!!Hope this review keeps the rest of you from having to go through MY experience.~~~~~xx,mgh(Madelyn Griffith-Haynie - ADDandSoMuchMore dot com)", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone (with Caveats)", "Author": "AmazonBox@theDoor4Me", "ReviewID": "R160CWOZSRXQU3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great affordable compact phone.

Used it as a prepay with no problems refilling etc. Battery lasts forever it seemed. Call quality pretty good. One thing I couldn't quite figure out was how to raise the volume. Minor issue as it was loud enough. Adding contacts takes a few more steps than normal. Minor issue.Its as basic as you can get but it works flawlessly. Makes calls and sends txts.

We also had two unlocked T-Mobile Samsung phones and two identical Telestial SIM cards to go with them.  None of the Telestial SIM cards would work with Jenny although all the SIMs worked in the Samsung phones.It was too late to return the phone when we got back from our trip.  Interestingly a US T-Mobile card worked in the Jenny when we returned but I don't need the phone in the US.The manual is also not written very well.  Couldn't find any troubleshooting tips in the maunal or information on what to do in the situation I was in.My daughter is going on a trip to Guatemala and I had planned on having her take this phone with an approriate SIM card, but now I'm worried that she will run into the same issues there.July 2013 update -- Didn't use it for the Guatemala trip.
