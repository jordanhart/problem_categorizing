I will first talk about what i dislike and then what i like. The ONLY  thing that I dislike about this phone is the recording view. When recording, the light diminishescausing your surrounding to look darker. The camera is not that great in quality. My family always uses Samsung products and this is the first Samsung product ive gotten with a crappy camera. Other than the camera, the phone works excellect. I have net10 & i get great service. I use it as a tablet to write my books. Check out See You Again on Amazon for a great short story. I use it foreverything.

It gets shipped from China and has a lot of difference as compared to tablets made for American market. The google play app does not work and a lot of applications were not able to install. The tablet hangs sometimes.I would not recommend anyone to buy it as some features like Keypad are starkly different and odd than regular American version.

Not too big, not too small, and this \"phablet\" is just right for me.  I took my AT&T; micro sim from my Note 2 into the sim card slot of the Tab 3 and Voile, I had instant phone and data.  Wow!  I use this device with a BT Bose Headset so I can listen to my music or radio, answer phone calls, etc.  Got the SuperNight dock/cover/ keyboard and I be stylin'.  I am able to sync my 2013 MS Office Calendar and Contacts installed on my desktop Dell Windows 8.1 using MyPhoneExplorer.  I can hook up the USB cable to the \"phablet\" charge port and then my thumb drive is seen as a drive!  I use Office Suite Pro for editing and Polaris Office for printing.The only feature missing?  A flash for the camera, which by the way is 5.0 on the back.  Neither were deal-breakers for me as I am not that big of a camera buff and really wanted the phone-tablet combo for the other features.  For me, this is device is serving me well.  I recognize that device choices are based on personal preference, features, needs, wants, $, etc. so this might or might not be for YOU!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Stevenson Cuartas M", "ReviewID": "R2JJ9MTHQ5G5GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Tab works very well thank you very much!
