The speaker phone is distorted at top volume of 7, so just lower it to 5 or 6.  This isn't a phone you are going to speak on the speaker phone a lot, just to monitor when someone puts you on hold for a couple of minutes. It has a good camera and video capability.  It is easy to upload small MP3 files to use as free ringtones for people on your contact list.  There is also a handy button for composing text messages.  You can download Google Maps for use if you are driving and need directions.This phone isn't for heavy web use but can come in very handy in an emergency because you can easily check your email.  It does not have an add-on slot for SD memory.  You cannot transfer photos from your phone unless you have another bluetooth device.UPDATE:  With the recent price increase for this phone, I would recommend the LG 840G instead.  It is a better phone and has triple minutes, wi-fi, and better sound quality.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Email feature / 3G is amazing!

I must say, this phone is pretty amazing on 3G and Email feature.  I love carrying this flip phone knowing I am able to receive emails in time.The reception is not horrible as the other reviewers stated. However, compare to LG 500 (which I hate the small query keys), LG 500 does have better reception.I found out that you can send simple email using message icon/ sent box on this phone, which is pretty cool.It truly depends on what you need.  This phone has more features than a simple flip phone; I was under the impression that one can transfer mp3 / photos using USB cable; I was wrong about this feature.

Tracfone online will give you an LG 440G for free (and with free shipping) when you buy it together with an airtime card.  Offer good until 9/30/2014.  I just bought a spare LG 440G yesterday at a local \"dollar\" store for $5.  I still love the phone.]I recently upgraded my Tracfone service from a four year old Motorola v170 (2G) to this LG 440G (3G).  I like the flip phone format, even if it's considered out of date by most.  This 440G is excellent for purely voice communications and is acceptable for receiving (but not sending) texts and emails.  In fact, my LG 440G is better at voice than my wife's smartphone.  As long as that's really all you want, this phone plus a Tracfone $100 one-year airtime card is the best value on Planet Earth.Pro:  A 3G phone has access to a lot more cell tower hardware than a 2G phone.  Connectivity is tremendously improved over my old Motorola v170.  I find that I get good voice service in all of the dead zones that I had with the v170.  The Motorola couldn't connect from the inside of my home (stucco over heavy sheet metal wrap, circa 1915), or inside my local Costco, or from the basement of my office building, or while walking with the dog at the Mount Tom reservation in Holyoke, Mass.  The LG 440G works OK in all of these locations, AND everywhere else I've used it.  No more having to go out to the front porch to make a call!The construction is solid.  Voice quality with speakerphone turned off is excellent.  I haven't experienced the problems with voice quality noted in GusHerb's one star review.  However, I do agree that the speakerphone feature is better for camping out on hold than it is for actual conversation.The camera is functional should you need it, but don't buy this phone if a good camera is important to you.Con:  Some of Tracfone's online advertising states that this phone has WiFi features in addition to 3G connectivity.  Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong, but the WiFi part appears to be a mistake.  WiFi isn't mentioned on the box the LG 440G ships in, or in the owner's manual.  There aren't any menu options that I can find to set a WiFi SSID or password.Do not buy the similar LG 430G here on Amazon without doing your research.  It's important not to confuse this 440G with the 430G.  The 430G is a T-mobile phone, while most of Tracfone's network is on ATT.  Do a search on Tracfone's web site for phones available in your zip code.  If the 430G isn't listed, it's just a paperweight for you.Please keep in mind that this is a disposable phone that sold for $10 outright when I originally wrote this review, and even less as of the update above.  Obviously, it's going to be found wanting if you want more features than just excellent voice service.If you would rather have a touch screen Android smartphone with more features and access to a ton of apps, but with slightly poorer voice service, then please read my review here on Amazon of the Tracphone LG L39C:http://www.amazon.com/review/R39UGNG4BGAEEF/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00HPX2NTG#Please read my L39C review carefully and follow the bread crumbs to the bundle that I actually purchased.  The Tracfone LG L39C smartphone can be had for dirt cheap, as I allude to, and offers incredible value in the low end, introductory Android smartphone format.  My wife and I bought one of these for her, and we both love it.  Nonetheless, I prefer to stick with this LG 440G flip phone for myself.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Flip Phone I've Owned", "Author": "mikey", "ReviewID": "R36KUMQH6R35NB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like flip phones.  No troubles with pocket dialing and locked keypads. Works much better in noisy environments, and allows for more privacy when making or receiving calls. I was able to bluetooth over my contacts list from another LG phone. That saves a lot of work!I installed USB bluetooth adapters on my desktop & laptop PCs. USB bluetooth adapters cost about $10. It's easy to transfer photos, Old Time Radio MP3s and movies or videos to this phone. USB data cables will NOT work, you need to use bluetooth for file transfers.  It has about 100 megs of memory available. That's not a lot, but enough to hold a movie or video and several OTR shows. There are many Old Time Radio Shows and Movies in the public domain, available \"FREE\" at numerous websites. The variety of shows is amazing. My personal favorites are the sci-fi, mystery, suspense, and detective shows. Many are double plus good! If you've never listened to OTR, you are in for a real treat!I use the built-in speaker & it works well. It also has a landscape setting for watching videos in full screen mode. Videos should be in .3gp format. When you tire of these, just delete and add some new ones.I really like the rugged and solid feel of this phone. I use my cell phone as my camera, and this one takes good photos. I found $1.00 flip phone cases at a local Dollar Tree Store. Case would fit most any flip phone.I've used the LG440g for 6 months now...and I'm happy with it!...Has good phone call quality. I've sent texts and email messages with attached  photos, & all worked well. It's my home phone, no land-line for over 3 years, so I leave it on all the time. Battery life is good. I tried the browser on 3G....works well. Really like the larger screen and keypad...it's a real plus! Love that old time Vintage Telephone Ringtone, sounds like a real telephone when it rings!...lol...I've owned a number of other flip phones over the past 5 years: LG420g, LG430g, W260g, W376g, and W408g. The LG440g is Numero Uno! The LG420g is #2!I've really enjoy texting with this phone...It works really well!...Cell Phones are amazing! They are the Swiss Army Knives of the 21st century.$9.99 for this phone is a real deal!...If you want a flip phone...this might be the one for you!I have recently retired this phone to the kitchen drawer. It's been a very good phone but I now have an Alcatel 392g flip phone & an LG530g phone. Both are able to take micro SD memory cards. It's great to have a full featured multi-media player that fits in my shirt pocket!Note: (This is a GSM phone with an AT&T; SIM Card.)", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Reception Horrible Voice Quality", "Author": "GusHerb", "ReviewID": "R3UBJ8HIDXR6TT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So we have an extra line on AT&T; that I'm looking to cancel, but keep the number.I knew that prepaid would be the way to do that, just didn't see any phones with plans I really liked. Fast forward to one Sunday in November, after lunch we stop in at Best Buy and I walk past the prepaid phone section like I always do, only to glance and see the LG440G on the shelf, seeing that it's a new phone on Tracfone (who was my prepaid carrier of preference to make this switch) I instantly grabbed it and saw that it was a 3G phone, and works on AT&T;! (something important to have just to get tolerable service from them...)So needless to say I purchased it, porting the number from AT&T; to Tracfone took just a few minutes and was very painless. So the phone at this point is activated, I made a test call and this is where the headaches start... So every word that you hear starts out very quiet then gets very loud, and on top of that if you turn the volume up to something barely usable the speaker starts distorting like the speaker in a fisher price toy. It sounded so horrible, it was very distracting.Thinking that maybe the phone was defective I then went back to Best Buy and exchanged it for another, called Tracfone to transfer phones (for some reason this took much much longer then porting the number in, in the first place!) and low and behold this thing was doing the EXACT SAME thing.On top of it all I started to realize that my signal sucked, even right next to AT&T; towers (I confirmed this thing worked on AT&T; by checking the SIM card, ending in C4 means AT&T;). It was dropping 3G alot, and even had rather dramatic deathgrip issues.So I got fed up, found the Samsung S390G on Amazon for 34 dollars at the time and ordered it. Returned the LG440G back to Best Buy (which they will have trouble returning it because the system tells them if it's been opened, but they in the end CAN take it back as long as it's within 30 days of purchase). As for the Samsung S390G I'm very happy with it, get good cellular signal performance with it and great sound quality compared to the LG440G, can crank it up with NO distortion AT ALL.I don't know if there is a bad batch of LG440G's out there or what, but this was by far the second worst phone I've ever tried to use (only surpassed by a Nokia 1616). I can't recommend this to anyone, and I'm not about to try another one down the road either and then likely have to deal with the hassle of returning it.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Getting More for Less", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "RWUD92MIP2AH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know how the one star brigade can attack this phone.

The responsiveness of being a 3g phone is also immediately noticed. The external screen for time and call info is also a great feature that was not on the old phone.

It cannot be done through USB cable transfer with this model, but it can be done through a Blue tooth connection.I have an older Dell desk top, which is not bluetooth compatible.So I bought a TARGUS  Bluetooth 4.0 Dual-Mode Micro USB adapter ( that also includer a driver Disk )for $25.00 at Staples.  I popped the disk in my computer, followed the instructions, then inserted the micro USB in one of the USB slots. Everything installed properly. NOTE: You need a desk top or Laptop thats new enough to have an optical reader in your disk drive... so if you have an ancient desk top- better check this out first. I was then able to pair my phone with my computer, and then pretty easily transfer a 1.5M .jpg format picture into one of my Picasa folders on my PC.  Hallelujah.... although I don't plan on using my phone for a camera, since it has this feature, I want to be able to do it.  You can also send pics to other people's phones and to facebook - but I do not want to \"sync-up\" those 2 things to this phone... you may want to though!Now on to Texting.... The phone automatically makes a capital letter after the use of a period.

The first, a Samsung 245g flip phone has a screen just too small to use for anything beyond short and simple texts. Next up was the LG840g. Nice touchscreen operation, but I found the onscreen keyboard a bit awkward, and felt like I needed to carry it a holster rather than my front pocket. The new LG440G is a good compromise.  It is a bit larger, when closed, than the Samsung, but with a considerably larger and sharper screen, making texts and emails much easier to read.  The 3g connection downloads emails fairly quickly so you don't burn a lot of minutes checking messages.  Call quality is fine, and the signal strength is about average, meaning spotty in my home; just something I have to live with, I guess! All in all, I am very happy with my twenty dollar investment.

It was fine at first, except I noticed lately I wasn't getting a very good signal at home, which is where I use my phone the most. When looking around online I discovered the 420g is an older 2g phone and felt if I upgraded to 3g the signal might be better.  My $10 bet paid off.I got the Lg440g on Amazon for only $10.00, half what it sells for on the Tracfone site, and am very pleased with the improvement in the signal, particular at home. It's 3g with better reception, only a bit larger than the 420g and has some added features.I noticed another reviewer of the LG440G mentioned there is no Wifi, like is mentioned on the Tracfone site.  That is correct, the Tracfone statement that it is 3g with Wifi is incorrect.  No Wifi.I also noticed Tracfone states the 440G has voice command dialing, which it actually does, but is not mentioned in the phone's tutorial.  If you want to use the voice command dialing, it's in the Tools menu of the phone and does work well.I've noticed a minor glitch with this phone. It buzzes for no reason when I access the voicemail, and buzzes when I place a call, but it's a minor nuisance to put up with for a $10 phone.I gave it 5 stars based on the quality and features of the phone.

All I wanted was a phone for emergency purposes and what have you kinda deal. I did not want to join the family plan for $30-40 a month cause I really do not have any use for a cell phone, as every family member has one. Prepaid plans sounded fishy to me, so I did some checking around. Went to Walmart and checked their displays and asked a lot of questions.This flip phone caught my eye at $20. All I needed was to buy a prepaid card for minutes with it. With this phone they will double the minutes. In other words, as a trial, I spent $20 for this phone and $20 for a 60 minutes card. The 60 minutes was automatically doubled to 120 minutes plus an additional 10 minutes for a total of 130 minutes. I can even send and receive text messages with it. And the plan would not expire until you use up the minutes or 5 months had passed, whichever came first (for my plan). This phone will show in its screen how many minutes you have left and the number of days remaining. That is a great service! You can always add minutes and increase the number of days in a snap.So, for about $8 a month I have a simple to use phone just in case I have to use it. With this phone I can even call overseas! I bet none of you can do that even with a $1000 cell phone. Calling overseas costs twice the minutes: talk of 10 minutes will cost you 20 minutes airtime. Still, that is a real bargain!Roaming charges prevail. If you go astray from your area code and then make or recieve a call, that will cost you twice the minutes. Just like overseas call, 10 minutes talky will cost you 20 minutes airtime. But then you get those extra double minutes for free whenever you add minutes to this phone.For a starter, I called one person with this phone and text 5 messages, and read 4 messages. I used up less than 2 minutes for all that good stuff. If you want a simple phone that is cheap to boot with all the nooks and crannies needed for basic stuff, this phone with tracfone prepaid cards will do the job. Take it from me. I've carried a cell phone since the late 80s, the heavy duty Arizona Memorial shaped phone and everything in-between.

After using my wife's Motorola Tracfone, I'm not enamored with touchscreen phones and I want the phone to simply answer the call when I open the phone.  The basic functions of voice and text communication work well as does the Contact list.  The learning curve is very short, especially if you've gone through the on-line tutorial to learn what the buttons do and how the menus are organized.  I only briefly tested the internet browser but it seems to work well also.  The LG 440G even works via Bluetooth with the Jeep uConnect handsfree system (which has a reputation of being fussy about phone compatibility).Not much to say in the critical category.  Keep the speakerphone volume at a moderate level or it will distort. One can only expect so much for a phone at this price point but it would be nice if the Contact list and photos could be transferred via USB to/from a computer or, even better, sync up with Windows Live Mail Address Book.

I purchased this phone, called customer service and was told that I could transfer my minutes and number of my current tracfone over no problem.  I was told this could take up to 2 days.  2 days later, I still had a phone that said \"requires activation\".  I called customer service back and was on the phone for 178 minutes and STILL do not have a working phone.  The first 73 minutes I was on the phone with customer service and all the rep kept saying was \"can you hold for 2 more minutes while my page loads?\", over and over and over and over and over for 73 minutes.  Finally I was transfered to his supervisor who said she didn't see what the problem was.  I explained that the new phone still wasn't actived or working.  She had me try several things, enter a bunch of codes, etc etc and finally said it was working (which it was not).  She told me to wait 15 minutes, turn the phone off and back on and all would be good.  I told her I was almost 2 hours into this call, I wasn't hanging up until I had a working phone.  We waited together for 15 minutes turned phone off and back on, still unregistered.....  She transfered me to her supervisor.  She tried all the same things then informed me that I could not transfer my old number to the new phone as it caused an error in their system.  If I wanted a new phone I had to have a new number(this is my 3rd tracfone, and first time I was told I can't keep my number, in the past the transfer went smooth).  I told her I wanted my minutes and number put back on the old phone and she informed me it would take 2 business days(this was Friday night) so it would actually be FOUR days until I had a working phone again.  I asked for HER supervisor and she transfered me and he was nice, promised me he would make sure I had a working phone by tuesday and look into why I had been on the phone for almost 3 hours.  I seriously doubt I will get a working phone, and have every intention of looking at another carrier.  I have had good luck with my last tracfones, but anyone buying any tracfone, be warned they have some of the WORST customer service ever.  And this includes their own website where you will only receive automated responses, an automatic messages telling you to wait 15 min and try again.

It was a great decision.Aside from the boatload of features and very easy to use interface it is durable and easy for anyone to add minutes at any time.

I had planned on spending $50 or so but after checking out several other models saw no reason to.It should be noted that my communications are generally limited to infrequent calls, zero texting and no Facebook or other social media. Though I'm the go-to guy for building and troubleshooting PC's, I'm not who you ask for wisdom about Android vs. iOS! The thing is, this phone, for $14.99, does all that most high-end smartphone are used for 95% of the time: call, text, email, surf the Internet on 3G, play tunes and take still or video pictures, even if at a relatively low-res 1.3MP, plenty good enough for me in most cases.The USB port functions for charging purposes only, so a Bluetooth connection will be required to upload music to the phone or download pics to your computer.The menu is pretty well laid out and easy to navigate, the screen is sharp if not in bright daylight, battery charge life could be better but not too bad.So what's not to love?Well, for one, the perplexing decision to include a joybuzzer-upon-answer feature that for the life of me I'm unable to disable. The phone vibrates when a party you've called answers. I have tried both methods to disable the buzz - press the '#' key at the lower right until \"Vibrate mode off\" appears, or navigate the menu structure: Settings/Audio and Ringtones/Ringtone/Alert Type and choose 'Ring'. The other two options here include vibration.Now, I can understand that this might be useful for folks in noisy or heavily distracted environments. But it's simply an annoyance for most. It has in fact become so annoying that I may attempt to open it up and desolder the audio transducer (the buzzer) if that's doable without destroying the phone*. If not, I will likely go ahead with an upgrade to a model with a little more configurability.I would give this phone 5 stars for the reasons mentioned above, but the vibrate feature has turned into a buzz-kill.* Edited to add - removing the buzzer is easy and requires no desoldering. Simply power off the phone, remove the battery cover, remove the 6 small screws holding the back on, and use a flat-edged jewelers screwdriver to release the back. You'll see a yellow item at one end that can be easily removed with tweezers or simply by hand. It's a tiny motor with what appears to be a half disk weight on the output to create the vibration.

Makes or receives calls when it feels like it. Was I just spoiled by having a cell phone that always worked?2.  Turned Vibration off, but it seems to vibrate anyway with the ring (when I'm lucky enough to receive the call) and also vibrates once whenever I flip open to answer a call and start talking to the other party.  How do I get vibrate completely off?3. I thought I set up voicemail correctly (followed the prompts).  Then I called from another number to test it.  It did not even light up or ring, but, after 4 \"rings\" I was put through to voicemail, where I left a vocal test message.  Later on when it felt like it, the phone lit up to show I had received a message but only gave me two options: to \"call\" or \"ignore\".  I tested this three times calling from another number and then pressing \"call\", \"ignore, or PWR/END to find the message it was lighting up about.  Each time instead of going to the message it just said \"unregistered number.\"  Then, in going to menu and checking for \"messages\" there was no record of any message.  Then it would repeatedly tell me I had 2 messages, but I still could not find any.  I would just keep getting \"unregistered number.\"  Did this mean my tracfone was the unregistered number or that the number I called from was the unregistered number? Huh?

If this is all you are looking for, this phone fits the bill.But the features are a bad joke. I had hoped to be able to use this phone to retrieve my e-mails. But the load time is absurdly long, and it takes even more time to try to zoom in on the tiny screen enough to see your e-mail. Plus, while I could use it OK for my personal g-mail account, it won't work at all on my work account, which is set up with Go-daddy. And the web browsing is too slow, and web sites look like like they were written in a font meant only for fleas.Music? What a joke.  There is NO HEADPHONE OUTLET on this phone. Do they expect me to listen to music with the phone on speaker?  I have no idea if it would work with a bluetooth headset, and I really don't care, because I am not going to invest a dime in tricking out this phone.Also, the charger slot looks like an ordinary micro USB connector, but THERE IS NO WAY TO CONNECT THIS PHONE TO YOUR COMPUTER.  So good luck if you want to load your contacts, photos, or music onto this phone.I know that there may be a way to load things via bluetooth, but I tried, and I got nowhere.
