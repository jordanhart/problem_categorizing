The phone quits charging, even on the new charger provided, and on all the ones in their Metro PCS store. We speak to Jose employee 8735 and he tells us we have to pay the deductible because the \"7\" day warranty which is supposed to be a \"30\" day warranty only applies to new customers, not customers who upgrade. So after shelling out $450 for the phone, $730 when accessories and everything was purchased, we now are told to put out another $129 deductible and wait for, possibly a reconditioned one, in the mail.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "6.3 in tablet-sized screen with the portability of a smartphone\nAccomplish more with a 1.7 GHz dual core processor, 1.5GB RAM, 16GB ROM\nAndroid 4.2 - Jellybean\n8 MB rear camera with LED flash and 1.9 MP front-facing camera", "Name": "Samsung Mega (MetroPCS)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gRgvX1OeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GX3V1U6"}}
