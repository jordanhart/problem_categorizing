I had issues trying to submit this review from it, though (it has issues handling the big open text boxes, especially in horizontal mode).Wi-Fi reception is decent; not as good as in laptops or my old Nokia E71, but usually good enough.Another plus on this matter - free internet access points requiring you to hit 'ok' on their start page are now accessible for web browsing and then to any other app (unlike E71).Amazon site mentioned international warranty, but I didn't find any document on that in the box. Keeping the receipt and hoping I won't need to use the warranty which I suspect I don't really have. BTW, the device woke up in Spanish, but asked from the start which language I prefer.

There seems to be absolutely no lag on this phone whatsoever & flash plays perfectly. The screen is absolutely Vibrant & Crisper looking then advertised, The Colors pop and are not over-saturated like the first Galaxy S. I'm using this phone in Kuwait and there has been no call quality issue whatsoever. It is the thinnest phone on the market which explains the lightweight plastics they use to make it so light. With that being said I don't recommend you use this phone with out a very good protective case like an outterbox. I bought 2 extra Hyperion batteries (because they have the smart chip that wont let you overcharge the battery), 1 USB EVO sync Dock/Batt. charger, and an anti scratch Zagg shield (because it will keep all scratches away from the screen and the body of the phone so when the next model comes out your current phone will be resaleable in like new condition :-) with the Dual core processors on the Galaxy S II you get the fastest phone in the world. This will probably remain true for another year or two until Tegra 3 processor phones come out. Finally, I understand that apple has successfully brainwashed us all into thinking we need them but,I've slowly come to like the advantages of Android based phones & with a little bit more time the Android market will be even with Apple. The Galaxy S II Phone itself is better than iphone4 but we know its the apps that have us all zombified into the apple world. Soon the Android app and iphone app markets will be neck and neck.

Before getting into details about a few of the amazing features of this excellent phone, here is a summary of what I really liked about the Blackberry Curve and how the new Galaxy S2 compares:1. It was easy to type text on the Blackberry because it has a physical keyboard which even a user with big fingers can cope with. I was put off on-screen keyboards a couple of years ago by the truly appalling and virtually un-usable Blackberry Storm, but the Samsung is really OK in this department even though its keyboard appears on-screen because the key points are so large, and when you finger a key a larger image of it pops up to confirm which key you have activated.2. The Blackberry's party piece was very easy and intuitive email management, which I need to use all day long for business messages. Well, the Samsung is surprisingly good here too, with the added bonus of a huge screen and the facility to enlarge or reduce text size with a sweep of the fingers, iPhone style. The text clarity is first class.3. The Blackberry has very long battery life and typically I'd only need to charge it every 4 or 5 days, even with heavy usage. The Samsung does not fare well in comparison and needs daily charging, but there's a number of things you can do to prevent high power consumption like turning off features you're not using and not playing music through it (if using the phone principally as an iPod-like music player is important to you, then this Samsung may not be for you as battery life will be reduced to a few hours).4. The Blackberry is small and handy in size, whereas the Galaxy is 3x larger (but about the same thickness) - however in compensation, you get that amazing huge screenFor a really comprehensive techy overview, please look to other excellent reviews of this product. Here's a summary of the main features of this amazing phone from my simpler perspective:* The AMOLED screen on the Galaxy is definitely its star attraction: huge, bright and clear with fabulous colour definition, it's even better than the iPhone or iPod. Designers have finally copped-on that people don't want ever smaller and smaller phones and no-one wants to watch a movie on a screen 1.5cm square; they want something of a convenient size that they can use and read easily at arm's length* Despite the substantial size, it's thin and lightweight at only 116g which makes it no problem in your pocket and a big advantage to a smaller person when making long calls (the iPhone for example is around 20g heavier)* All functions are very intuitive and easy to use - at least as good as the iPod4 with a similar feel* Calls are easy to make due to the big clear graphics and easy-to-follow menus - however it has some minor quirks like you can't answer a call by actually pressing the green phone symbol, you have to `sweep' across it - but once you learn this, everything is OK. The ear-speaker and voice-mike are both very good and very clear; reception so far first-class with no dropped calls* The quality of the image from the camera is also exemplary (but make sure the flash is turned on)* The Galaxy has a standard connect-to-computer/mains charger socket, a micro-USB port located on the base-edge of the phone. Finally manufacturers have chosen (not before time) to stop ripping-off their customers by making them buy new chargers with every new handset and begun to standardize - FINALLY!In summary I'd say if you're looking for a smartphone, the Galaxy S2 is a very serious contender. It's beautifully designed, its screen is absolutely amazing - you need to just use it for a couple of minutes to appreciate how good it is - yet it's lightweight. The menus are intuitive and easy to master; it has loads of optional software and aps (mostly free to the user, unlike with Apple); making calls and managing email is a breeze. It's a weather forecaster, a GPS street-finder and a web browser with astoundingly clear screen definition unlike anything I ever used before.Possible cautions include barely acceptable battery life, and for this it drops a star: if you're a current Blackberry user you'll really notice this, and especially so if you use it as a music player. Also the Galaxy might be intimidating if you're a technophobe who just wants a simple phone to make calls. But it compares very well in all essentials against the iPhone: it's lighter, cheaper and the screen is better, and most of the aps for which Apple charges you, you get with the Galaxy for free.One final point: make sure you buy a good robust case and a screen protector for it; there's plenty of choice and most of them do the job OK.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Received the wrong phone GT-I9100G instead of the GT-I9100", "Author": "CS", "ReviewID": "R2TS7O4JF5FC5I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The order I placed was for the Samsung Galaxy S II GT-I9100 (International version).

As of now there's not much that can compete with Sammy's latest. But that's just it.

Whatever, that's the way things are these days. However, if there's one thing I'd really like to know, it's how to register the darned warranty for this thing cuz it's not offered in the U.S. So, Samsung U.S. doesn't know what to do with you when you try to register on their site. If you talk to a \"representative\", they'll tell you something absurd like \"Seems your phone is from South Africa so you'll have to call them\", or \"Seems your phone is From the U.K. so you'll have to call them\". Seems to me the \"reps\" are just making stuff up if my phone \"seems\" to be from South Africa AND the U.K. So, international warranty, are you worth the extra $30-$40? So far, that's a negative.

Canto", "ReviewID": "R110U7R375OPIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure where to start or what should be the focus of the review. So if someone has an specific question, ask, and I'll do my best to answer it.First of all, I had an N8 Nokia phone which I loved (mainly for the camera and GPS navigation), but had enough draw backs with the OS (Symbian) that I started looking else where for my next phone.I evaluated carefully this phone for a month and decided to keep it, at the end.The phone is crazy fast (changing between screen, menus, apps, etc.), the OS (Android Gingerbread) is really smooth and friendly.The resolution is amazing.The 5.1 sound is really nice (saw a movie with this option ON, and it sounded great).Internet browsing is as fluid as with a PC.There are TOO many apps, so you'll have a lot of fun with that.One issue that a heard before was the battery life, so my test and results are these:* 3G ON, Wifi ON, Sync ON, Notification ON: 8 - 10 hours* 3G OFF, Wifi ON, Sync ON, Notification ON: 20-24 hours* 3G OFF, Wifi OFF, Sync OFF, Notification OFF (only turning data ON when needed): 36 - 40 hours.So in my case, it really depends on how much time 3G is ON and how my personal configuration (data sync) was set. In my opinion, this is not a problem at all.Camera is great (even compared to the N8).Video is great.GPS is good, but not great (I miss the Ovi Maps ... which, at this point, would like them to sell their software). Google Maps won't do without data (or at least won't work efficiently). Bought CoPilot and the result is average, but at least it was cheap (around 10 dollars).Tested (successfully 3G) with the following carriers:* AT&T; (U.S.)* Telcel (Mexico)Of course, if I compare any of these features with the N8, the difference is enormous, but the real rival is the iPhone. So I tried my wife iPhone4 for a while, so I could get a better perspective. And I'm sorry to say (to Android fans ... or Apple fans, for that matter) that between these two, it totally depends on taste or the one that you actually own.I wouldn't trade this phone for an iPhone, and my wife wouldn't trade her iPhone for my GS2 (but we both thought that the other ones phone seemed really great), so you see, I guess what I can resume from this is that both phones are really good ... the details, well it depends on the user, I guess.Anyways, really fast, fun and time consuming.So overall, really happy with the phone.Oh yeah, before I forget, one important fact (for some, I'm guessing), although I'm a tekkie and might ROOT and put some special ROM on the phone at some point (just for kicks), the review and my final opinion is on the phone as sold, so I wouldn't go and say that these android phones are only for geeks/tekkies.Cheers.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Problem with Int'l Warranty and Language Input", "Author": "cookiedoe", "ReviewID": "R3N3ZA8VQPPX8N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone itself is great and lived up to the expectations.

It can last one day (regular use).Writting with \"SWYPE\" is a very delightfull experience. The swype writting is just one step ahead of the others, is state of the art.I thought it would be so big to take in my hands, but it isn't, I feel very confortable holding it and also I can take it into my pocket, is very very thin.The videos and pictures are amazing, very clear. It features 1080p for real, I recorded a video and then I used the Micro USB to HDMI MHL adapterto plug it to my HDTV and the picture and video quality was perfect!The screen is perfect, is very clear, it has a very good resolution and everybody around me love the screen of this phone.I haven't tried the GPS and still other features, but with this \"toy\" there are many things to play with.I am a very happy SGSII owner, a satisfied customer.I highly reccomend to get this device instead of any BB or iPhone.Meet you in the Hubs...Este tel\u00e9fono es m\u00e1s de lo que esperaba despu\u00e9s de leer todas las revisiones que se encuentran en Internet.A\u00fan cuando no hab\u00eda \"garant\u00eda\" y ning\u00fan sello de garant\u00eda en la caja, una vez que enciendes el tel\u00e9fono te das cuenta de que esun aparato incre\u00edble.Este que compr\u00e9 (lo compr\u00e9 con The OEM Shop) vino corriendo Android 2.3.4 usando el Kernel UHKG7, por lo que no se necesita actualizarlo.No est\u00e1n habilitadas las videollamadas desde Gtalk en este firmware, pero la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda es muy buena. Puede durar todo un d\u00eda (d\u00e1ndole un uso regular).Escribir con \"SWYPE\" es una experiencia \u00fanica.

Graba 1080p de verdad, grab\u00e9 un video y utilic\u00e9 el adaptador Micro USB a HDMI MHL para conectarlo a mi TV HD y la calidad de las fotos y videos es impresionante.La pantalla es perfecta, muy n\u00edtida, tiene una muy buena resoluci\u00f3n y a todo el mundo alrededor de m\u00ed le encanta la pantalla de este tel\u00e9fono.No he probado ni el GPS ni otras funciones, pero con este \"juguete\" hay muchas cosas con las que se puede jugar.Soy un feliz due\u00f1o de un SGSII, un cliente satisfecho.Recomiendo altamente comprar este equipo en lugar de un BB o un iPhone.Nos vemos en las redes...", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does not get 4G speeds on T-Mobile", "Author": "Catherine E Kerr", "ReviewID": "R18E7208X7MS8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone is awesome.

(Argentina):I am a compulsive user of mobile phones and technology is changing very often. I tried several Nokia (E and N series), various iphone and some others (LG, Pantech). To make a proper review is necessary to separate two things: software and hardware.1) Hardware: In a world where every month new devices come to market, it is impossible to say for a period longer than 3 months \"I have the best phone in the world\" In this case we can say \"I have an excellent phone, the best of his generation and will continue to be well regarded by at least 2 years.\" It's fast, versatile, has a great camera (photo 8Mpx and video 1080p). AMOLED screen with incredible brightness and clarity and a lot of conectivity options.2) Software: comes with Android 2.3.4. So far (2 weeks of use) is just perfect. It had no freeze or reboot problems. Ran ran smoothly any program. It's true: Iphone wins in number of programs, but Android is growing faster in these days because of the differents brands that are using it. I am not an anti-iphone, I admit that the iphone OS is currently the best, but clearly on a limited equipment, that also does not facilitate user interaction 100%Cons:No doubt the battery. But if I have a Ferrari with 5.0 engine and I use it all day on a race track, clearly I have to put gas on it often ...(forgive me for the English, I speak Spanish natively)Bs. As. (Argentina):Soy un compulsivo usuario de celulares y cambio de equipos muy seguido. Prob\u00e9 varios nokia (serie E y N), distintos iphone y algunos otros (LG, Pantech). Para hacer una review correcta hay que separar 2 cosas: software y hardware.1) Hardware: en un mundo donde mes a mes salen al mercado aparatos nuevos, es imposible decir por un periodo mayor a 3 meses \"tengo el mejor equipo\". En este caso podemos decir \"tengo un excelente equipo, el mejor de su generaci\u00f3n y que seguir\u00e1 siendo bien visto por, al menos, 2 a\u00f1os\". Es r\u00e1pido, vers\u00e1til, tiene una excelente c\u00e1mara (8mpx y videos 1080p). Pantalla de amoled con un brillo y claridad incre\u00edbles.2) Software: de origen viene con Android 2.3.4. Por ahora (2 semanas de uso) es simplemente perfecto. No tuvo ning\u00fan freeze ni problemas de reinicio. No se trabo ning\u00fan programa y, por mas que iphone gane en cantidad de programas, Android esta creciendo a un ritmo mucho mas vertiginoso el dia de hoy.

Very nice screen, decent camera for a phone. I get over two days of usage out of a charge, which is pretty good for a smartphone, but I don't use cellular data, only wifi data and cellular voice / texts, and I also rooted it and slimmed down the software running on it.Which brings me to the second part of this review, the software: The firmware it comes with is actually rather good, and this version of TouchWiz isn't as bad as I've heard previous versions were. There are many quite customized roms available, including a stable release of cyanogenmod, but I went back to the stock firmware but rooted and with various samsung components uninstalled, and I like it quite well. I'm not fond of the default lock screen options, and it is silly that one has to root the phone to uninstall junk and customize the lock screen, but most phones are even worse in this regard.Rooting and installing mods is not very hard and doesn't depend upon security holes which samsung would periodically fix in updated firmware requiring new rooting tools: instead you restart the device and hold a combination of physical buttons to put it into \"download mode\" and use a tool available for windows or an open source one available for linux or mac to flash new software onto it. There's no cat-and-mouse game with Samsung. It's worked quite well for me.One final note, this is the European original GT-I9100 I'm talking about, the galaxy S2 variations available from US carriers are going to have worse prospects with rooting and rom compatibility (in addition to being thicker and generally being worse designs).", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellente cell phone", "Author": "Lucio", "ReviewID": "R3HCNK49YNWFPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent product.

What they sent me was the GT-I9100G (note G) model.  I reported it, but the item description has not been changed.  I don't know what the other sellers are sending out, but I think only the G model is now being made.  Samsung changed the processors, and put a lesser video chipset in the G model, but it is supposed to get better battery life, and not overheat under heavy load, because the cpu max is limited.There is a huge outcry internationally, because Samsung put the G model in the non-G box originally, without telling anybody, but the box I got had the G on the end.I spent many hours on this because of the SA-I9100 listed in the item model section, and it was not what Amazon shipped at all!Also, this phone works on ATT if you can get a signal. Does not work well in my house, even though I am in Birmingham, AL, where Bellsouth was big, and merged into ATT.  Duh!  I ordered a T-Mobile sim card, also, but only get Edge because this phone does not have the 1700 MHZ frequency that T-Mobile uses for 4G in the US.  I think ATT uses the 1900, but has made post failed merger deal for T-Mobile to deploy it at some time, whch is a rumor only. It might already be available out west in the US.You have to know or search how to set the APN to even get this phone to show the data availability.At least T-Mobile works every time slowly, but during the day, ATT is unusable at my house in the city limits.  Good luck!

I knew before that it was coming in the market, read its reviews online and waited anxiously for it.I am very happy that I bought this phone cum tablet and because of its larger size, it is much better for me that Samsung Galaxy SII.I have previously bought Samsung Galaxy SII as the larger screen phone (4.3\" display) and was very happy with it but found that the screen was smallish for me and so I looked forward to a bigger phone. I found Samsung Galaxy Note (5.3\" display) to be that wish come true although I still sometimes feel that I can even be fine with 6\" screen size.So after more than a month of use, following are my conclusions:Review Highlights:Price:It is more than iPad2 and all the other tablets I have seen till now but as it is unique, I am compelled to pay. If it was at a lower price, it would have been better.Size and Weight:Samsung Galaxy Note is the largest of phones available in the market. Because of it large size and Android Gingerbread 2.3, it is a very nice mini-tablet as well as a secondary phone. Unless there is a 6\" phone-cum-tablet is launched, this is the best phone-cum-tablet your money can buy. Its weight (178g)is perfectly acceptable considering the size of the phone and its thickness (9.65mm) is nearly as of Samsung Galaxy SII (8.49mm), a really thin phone.Display:Very nice Super AMOLED display and it is really great watching movies and photos on this big display. It feels like a mini-tablet and it displays very well. Because of high pixel density (285ppi), the text and details are very smooth.Speed:The speed is good due for dual core (1.4GHz dual core) processor and I don't feel it slow. Although when I installed more than 15 apps, then I found it getting slower and sometimes was taking too long to start an app. Therefore, I always try to keep only those apps installed which I actually need.Battery Life:It depends upon how many apps are running in the background, whether the phone is in energy saver mode, the WiFi is switched on or not and the extent of brightness of display. A CPU hogging app can drain the battery within few hours but if I use WiFi selectively, keep brightness to near minimum brightness (which is still fine for display), in energy saver mode and just run basic applications and minimize widgets, I can get battery life of up to a day. I suggest not using Samsung Galaxy Note as your main phone as you may end up connecting to charger all the time. Use it as a tablet and secondary phone, along with another primary phone and that is the way it brilliantly shines.Android Gingerbread 2.3 Experience:I like its user interface and widgets but I have uninstalled some widgets to keep it fast and have low battery usage. Widgets take a lot of battery life and also use CPU continuously as well so I always uninstall Samsung widgets that I do not need.As a Phone:It feels big as phone but I do not use it as my main phone. My main phone is Blackberry Bold 9780 and so I use Samsung Galaxy Note as secondary phone. For secondary usage, it is fine although I do not like the fact that at higher sound volumes, the telephone call sound from ear piece is loud enough that people nearby can hear the conversation. Therefore, during calls I reduce the earpiece volume. The speakerphone is very good and video calling through Skype is very enjoyable.The large touch keys and display makes it very easy to use it as a phone.As a Tablet:It is very nice as a small tablet. My son uses it for gaming and likes gaming on this phone a lot. For me, I can browse internet much better than a Samsung Galaxy SII, read emails better and its kindle app is great. I feel that a kindle 6\" is not required when you have this phone. As it is not an Eink screen, I can read it well during night when lights are switched off.There are many apps in the market but I install only those ones that I really need as I want to save memory, CPU usage and battery life. Many of the apps keep running in the background after usage once so a number of times, I go in Settings> Manage Applications to clear cache and stop applications that I do not require running.Use with Data:It has usual GSM, WCDMA and HSPA+ capabilities and I have seen its performance to be very good.Photos:Photos look brilliant on this phone and its both front and dual cameras are excellent. The low light photos are not as great as a dedicated camera but its LED flash is strong as well.Videos:It has taken very nice family HD videos and I really like those. It plays videos very smoothly as well. Because of brilliant display, dual cameras (8MP rear and 2MP front) which take good shots and videos, and efficient microphone, it is an excellent device for photos and video capture and playback.Sensors:I have mainly used the Accelerometer which works fine. I am not a huge fan of digital compass in a mobile phone. The digital compass in phone always behaves erratically.Two features that I want:1. I need a similar touch button as for Wi-Fi switch on and off TO switch on and off the usage of data using Mobile networks.Final Verdict:Excellent secondary phone and a small tablet. Use another phone as primary phone and you will be fine. Keep widgets and running apps to minimum and you will be happy with it.Use of a plastic cover and front display screen guard will keep the phone safe even when it uses Corning Gorilla glass to prevent scratches.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply love this phone!", "Author": "Haruka-J", "ReviewID": "R1LBS1CDQEC7CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only issue i've had with it is that i've had it for 2 days and it already got scratched on the back plate so PLEASE buy yourself a cover for it right away the backplate is stupidly easy to scratch.Speed awesome, reception awesome, battery life? was my main concern, it's been 12 hrs now of semi- consistent 3G browsing facebooking (not much calls tho) and i'm still 35% of battery left.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "After my old Hero it is 100 times upgrade", "Author": "Kaizersose", "ReviewID": "R8YEC3Q2BJJLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is all you need these days, it is fast, not too big and not too small, the display is amazing and the price i bought it (530$) is the best value to money ratio in the market today!The only drawback is its battery life, which is ~ for one day.Love it!", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone!", "Author": "Kazim Mohammed", "ReviewID": "RFQ8Y9SHP7P98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Still one of the best phones out there!

Without knowing the issue about GT-I9100 and GT-I9100G, I started using the phone and fell in love at first sight and touch.. It is a awesome phone , way better than iPhone 4s .. Now today while I opened the review of this phone in Amazon I came to know about the fight between G and no G.. I became concerned and worried.. I did a deep research online.. First I came to know G at the end comes when it is made outside US.. And then after a extensive research I am convinced that both these two  models have ALMOST identical product features and they both have a little advantages over other.. If you are concerned about the battery life, less over heating, then G is better than no G.. GT-I9100 uses 1.2Ghz dual core Exynox 4210, while GT-I9100G uses 1.2Ghz dual core TI OMAP4430. This is the only difference.. So it is reported that  GT-I9100G might feel lag when opening up too many app compare to GT-I9100 model. Believe me, I did not have this problem with multi-tasking though.. So I have decided not to return this model as I am not a hardcore gamer and l do not like to play with the custom firmware and kernel modification thing. To me battery life and less over heating is more important.. So it is time not be afraid with GT-I9100G...

However, since I received the phone I had noticed some problems with it and I even contacted amazon in order to find out what I could have done to get it fixed. At first, only a couple languages were available where in most handsets of same model, most languages are available. For the last 20 days I have noticed that the handset could not be charged for some reason, and therefore I sought assistance in authorized retail stores. The answer for the problems with my phone is that the phone is a fake replica of what has been advertised and the serial number on the handset which is usually used to verify if the item is authentic is nothing but fake with no historical registration. With all this being said, I wanted to know of measures I can take through your respectable company in order to take this vendor out of your website and get my money back. My handset is no longer working and every time I try to turn it on it seems it will explode. I have been a good customer and used the website for many time and I would never expect to find counterfeited items like this available.

In my case, this purchase was fantastic, I received (in time) a Samsung Galaxy S II GT-I9100P and is one of the most amazing phones in the S II family if not the best. However, I recommend the seller to be more specific about the particular item it's offering. The one they sent me is the same as the GT-I9100 plus it has the NFC technology; it's the european version, first released in late 2011; started in spanish, provided by Movistar-Spain (it has a subtle small white logo in the back, at the bottom, and has some Movistar apps in the system as well), it came packed with Android \"Ice Cream Sandwitch\" 4.0.4 and upgradable to \"Jelly Bean\" 4.1 (at least) via the Samsung KIES software. I hate huge bulky phones, yet this one is so thin and light I have absolutely no complaints, I love Apple products but I prefer the S II over the Iphone, in part for the Android system, but it has top notch design, hats off to Samsung (even if you say it's a rip off), and even though the S III is a bit more capable I still prefer the S II for the disign. The only drawback I have found so far is the poor battery life, with regular to extensive use it barely last a day, don't use the wi-fi or data package and you're good to go, but I don't see the use of having a smartphone and not be internet connected.

The phone comes in a box with charger Movistar European (2 round pins, plus an adapter for flat USA plug) The phone is unlocked, but not a \"factory unlocked original\".Use: While in USA the phone froze a few times. Nothing terrible, but it seems that the unlock was a topic of soft. Data connection through wifi is very good, but the phone activates the power saving mode and the wifi often disconnects when the tel. is idle (idle enough to get him back online) The quality of the device is very good, it has very good sound on the loudspeaker and the definition of the screen is great. The sound quality is also very good to talk. The battery lasts approx. 1 day according to use (like most current smartphones).My opinion: SII seems a very good alternative to the iPhone but 1/3 cheaper (comparing prices for unlocked devices). The software platform of Android (google play) has the same popular applications that are available for apple (dropbox, instagram, social networking, games, etc, etc, etc). For USD400 I think this is a great alternative, I am very happy with the purchase.Compr\u00e9 el tel hace 1 mes en USA. el tel\u00e9fono viene en una caja de Movistar con cargador europeo (2 patas redondas, mas un adaptador para patas planas de USA) El tel\u00e9fono est\u00e1 desbloqueado, pero no es un \"factory unlocked original\".Uso: mientras estuve en USA el tel\u00e9fono se congel\u00f3 unas cuantas veces. Nada terrible, pero pareciera que al desbloquearlo qued\u00f3 alg\u00fan tema de soft. Laconexi\u00f3n de datos x wifi es muy buena, pero el telefono activa el modo ahorro energ\u00eda y el wifi suele desconectarse cuando el tel. est\u00e1 en reposo (basta sacarlo de reposo para que vuelva a conectarse) La calidad del aparato es muy buena, tiene muy buen sonido el altoparlante y la definici\u00f3n de la pantalla es buen\u00edsima. La calidad de sonido para hablar tambi\u00e9n es buen\u00edsima. La bater\u00eda dura aprox. 1 dia seg\u00fan el uso (como la mayor\u00eda de los smartphones actuales).Mi opini\u00f3n: el SII me parece una muy buena alternativa al iPhone pero 1/3 mas barato (comparando precios de aparatos desbloqueados).

(Lesson learnt: Always get the best phone out there if you want your phone to last at least 2 years)Pros:- Generous 2G internal device memory + 12G internal usb storage + 32G external micro SD card storage (bought separately) giving you 14G of internal memory to store those pesky apps which could not be moved to external storage.- Gorgeous Amoled plus screen. Black and colours don't look any better.- Pretty good camera.- Probably just the right size to use with one hand. I use the built-in Swype as my text input and could actually write faster than normal typing.- Fast, responsive and surfing the net with one hand is actually a pretty decent experience.- Wifi tethering works great.- Really enjoyed using the phone for the past year.- Latest android update 4.0.3Cons:- Battery life. All smartphones probably face this issue. Bought a 3500mah extended battery (which however makes the phone look ghastly - Samsung should really, REALLY, think about incorporating optional heavy duty battery packs into its design yet have a relatively slim, even, stream-lined appearance). The ugly extended battery allows for really heavy duty surfing and usage throughout the day or two. Activate android's power saving feature in settings for greater effect.- Home button also used for Vlingo's irritating voice talk feature, so you get to Voice talk instead of home. (Samsung - There's no need to ape Apple's Siri - voice recognition is a dead in the water feature for most people and not worth incorporating it as a core).Conclusion:I think this phone fulfils all my smartphone expectations and I think the chief difference for choosing between this older model and Galaxy SIII would probably be the screen size.

Of course if you're used to all of the Apple operating systems I suppose it's relative, but once you start with Apple you have to convert everything you've ever owned- completely not worth it.

Despite people's warning that there's no warranty for this phone and the unusual reported cases of Amazon and some other sellers selling the GT-i9100G series rather than the original GT-i9100, I decided to get one. I got the phone after 2 and a half weeks. Checked the model number and the android version since some people complained about both aspects. Mine was a genuine GT-i9100 with 2.3.4 Android operating system. I did have problems with battery but it isn't a problem at all when you actually get to know what you can do to save battery life in general. Yes, the phone itself is an unlocked version, MEANING.....it may not work with 3G or 4G. I did try both 2G and 3G, and they DID work. As for 4G, haven't tried yet. I dropped this phone a couple of times and had skid marks on the sides but nothing inside broke (that doesn't mean you should be dropping your phone irresponsibly).

However,  there are two factors that prevent it from attaining a perfect score.  Firstly, there are known problems with the camera sensor, there are two different kinds out there, and it is mostly up to chance whether you get one that works or one that doesn't. The other issue is really poor samsung support, after scouring the xda forums for a solution it was evident that a possible firmware solution to this problem, has yet to be released to the public.Design: This is one of the thinnest dual core phones out of the market. Coming in slightly thinner than my girlfriends iPhone 4s. I appreciate the fact that the headphone jack is located at the top of the device. My previous Droid (Inspire 4g) had both the usb port and headphone jack on the bottom of the device, it was quite crowded, and unsightly. You have your volume rocker on the left side of the device. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you are hitting the button, as the volume rocker cannot wake up the device.  The power button is located on the right side of the device. This is not only an odd place for the button, but it can be very irritating if you are holding the device with one hand and accidentally hit the power button, forcing you to re-enter your PIN or Pattern.  I think the power button would have been fine up top with the head phone jack.The international has one tactile button and two capacitive buttons. This is one button less than the American version, which has a dedicated search button. While initially i missed the dedicated search button I have learned to live without it. The tactile button is your home button similar to the iPhone, you press this to take you back to your home-screen. You can double tap to activate Samsung's voice command module.  The capacitive button to the left is your menu button, and the one to your right is your back arrow button. Both are responsive and function the same as the American version.Display: The super AMOLED screen is bright, and vibrant. It  is large and responsive. Supposedly some devices have had the dreaded oil slick issue, fortunately I did not have that in my unit. However, this further adds to the gamble of purchasing this device. This thing is a finger print magnet, if you don't have a screen protector (I'm waiting on mine) you may want to carry a microfiber cloth on you so you can wipe off smudges.Software: One of the major advantages to purchasing the international version is the fact that it does not have any carrier bloatware. The device is travel friendly since it has a quad band radio and unlocked sim card. The Touch-Wiz 4.0 interface is lightweight and does not appear to bog down the processor. All the built in android OS features are there such as the wireless hotspot, and USB tethering abilities. These features are traditionally removed in the American version to force you into shelling out more money on to their two year contracts with them. The device can handle multi-tasking beautifully, and picks up GPS signal much faster than my Inspire 4G.Camera: Probably the most disappointing thing about the unit I have received.  Unfortunately I have a faulty Fujitsu module. I have yet to determine if this is merely a firmware issue, or a true hardware flaw. The camera cannot focus on any object at all. Close up photos work well. However,  this is hardly practical. The front facing camera appears to be okay, though I have only used it a couple of times. In either case, you may be out of luck with warranty support if you are stateside.Battery: The battery life on this thing is excellent. I can stream music continously for up to 6-6.5 hrs before I have to plug in. With light Internet browsing  it can easily last for 1-1.5 days That is a significant improvement over the Inspire 4g I had which had to be plugged in to last the day.Overall: I really enjoy this device. I love it. However, I am truly disappointed over the camera. I have given much thought about this, and decided I will try to stick it out. I hardly ever take photos, and I love everything else about the phone so its hard to say that it is a deal breaker for what I need it for, which is, mainly calls, messaging, and light Internet browsing with the occasional navigation.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expensive", "Author": "Awesturck", "ReviewID": "R35HXFWMC4EYS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung Galaxy S II GT-I9100 Unlocked Phone with 8MP Camera and Touchscreen - International Version (Black)I have been tracking this phone for a while until I was able to buy it but now the price has gone sky high and it is too expensive...

Thankfully, I was with my provider so long that they gifted me with any phone of my choice. Desperately wanting to get rid of my Blackberry Curve and go outside my usual box of phone choices, I got the Galaxy S2.I have no idea why anyone likes this phone so much. It looks nice but that's about it. It constantly turns off when I'm trying to make a call. I had to spend TWENTY MINUTES trying to find where to even make a call in the first place! And I am only 20 years old, I can figure out new technology in a few minutes.The sad excuse of a keyboard is the biggest problem. It's a touch screen, and the keys are so incredibly, ridiculously close to each other that even autocorrect (which is an abomination within itself) always gets what I am typing wrong, and I've got pretty slim fingers. The spacebar is so freaking tiny and far down that most of the time I end up hitting the period button and every.word.ends.up.being.typed.like.this. I am a fast typer, running well over 80wpm on keyboard and probably nearly as fast on any cellphone I've ever used and I cannot describe how annoying this is.And the MOST annoying thing about the sad excuse for a keyboard is the permanent button that switches between English and Spanish. I can either focus on trying to type things correctly, just to look back to my text and see half of it is in spanish, or try to guess at what I'm typing and watch the screen every second. On every phone I've had before, they keyboard was the best. This is horrible.They say that the S2 has no option for notification lights, but when you look near the front facing camera, there is indeed an option for notification lights, but for some reason just doesn't work? Does that have any function at all?The phone also has no option for setting an alarm AND being able to turn the phone off, and the alarm would still sound. I DON'T MEAN SLEEP MODE. These are entirely different. So I must resort to keeping it on. Of course occasionally I have to turn it off completely so that it doesn't glitch, but I could do this every day and it would still glitch constantly. When I had a lock screen, it would frequently glitch and load the screen up in the corner, making me have to turn it off and restart so I could use it properly. Nearly each time I've had to make an emergency call to a friend or family member, it just shuts right off!It also comes preloaded with SO MUCH CRAP that I will never use and uses a good deal of the memory. I also am forced to update the software, which doesn't do much. All it does is add on more programs and networks that you will never use.Rearranging icons is difficult; hold, wait, drag. hold, wait, drag. can't just move anything and it's slow.And lastly, the reception is horrible; no one can ever hear me. That may just be my provider, though, even though I am supposedly in a \"hot spot\" for them. I've never had issues before this phone.Even my sidekick was better.I could go on more, but my point as been made.

The tint is also very noticeble by a subtle change of view angle. I read that a lot of people is complaining, some says it is a problem and that you can get one without tint, others says it is a characteristic of the SAMOLED display, I just RMA my one to get a new one and hope to get one that does not have blue tint but if it comes this time I will just keep it, because it is not big deal.I use it with a Ballistic case.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Viktor", "ReviewID": "R1ID03R558PJ81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the article and started using it, so far works perfectly.

My only advice if you buy one is... some companies in Toronto, Canada, and maybe around the world, have been offering this phone as a 4G, but actually this phone comes with a H+ speed, which is a middle point speed between 3G and 4G. Probably you won't find any difference with 4G now because the average speed in the market is slower than 3G and 4G, but be aware of it, you never know in the future things can change.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not drop it", "Author": "Alex CK", "ReviewID": "R1COVYHF0SOBK5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you drop the galaxy S2 and the screen becomes damaged, do not bother to repair it, the original Samsung screen replacement is $150 to $ 200, cheap china made screen is around $90 to $120.
