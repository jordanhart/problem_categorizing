Phone does work and has good signal strenght happy with that, Takes bad pictures but I heard the tundra does so no fault from the seller there. Phone is what they said it was inregards to condition. But the hasel that I went though warrents that I buy else where in the future, Number's-Photo's-Battery, As I have bought two other phones on amazon that were great but I broke, Why I wanted a tundra.

My husband has also has had his for over 2 years and his has been replaced twice.  The battery overheats and the phone is not indistructable my husband has dropped his and it broke so don't go by everyone's reviews that they've dropped it and it hasn't. Also the bluetooth malfunctions on it all the time.  And now my phone is also powering down by itself and the battery is getting hot again.  If you are a texter this is not the phone for you either.  Major let down by motorola for us.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great buy", "Author": "Dena", "ReviewID": "R13U5T106VKO4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It came on time and just as described.

This is the first impression of the purchase. Will update this review as I use the phone.Pro: The phone is physically in very good condition. Some minor scratches on the front and back, but other wise the finish is good. The cover's spring is strong allowing the cover to close solidly. The outside and inside screens do not have scratches. The inside screen appears to have been replaced. The display is bright (need to install SIM card to do a full screen evaluation). Initial evaluation is the phone is as advertised on Amazon.com.Con: The down side is that the wall charger is not for the Motorola Tundra. There is no conceivable way that the charger's phone connector could be mistaken for a mini USB connector. I have a phone but it's use is limited by the charge currently on the battery. I would have called \"quality used phones\" but I cannot find the company, or the person listed as the seller, on-line or at Amazon.com's website. I will now have to wait while I find, purchase and have delivered the correct phone charger.Two stars for the supplier, \"quality used phones for lack of attention and frustration/inconvenience to customers.  More to follow.Sandbox 2", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "A modern classic!", "Author": "invisible", "ReviewID": "R2RRX88PMAEW5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is one of the classics of communication equipment design, what the Star Trek communicator would be if it actually existed. And my review is for a used phone, for which I paid about $80.Some of the pluses:Hard shell and O-ring seals. I drop my phones in the mud sometimes so this helps a lot.Rubberized cover makes it harder for the phone to pop out of your pocket.Functional speakers, loud enough to be heard when you're on the tractor.Simple Motorola interface. Nuff said.Good range and clarity for ATT 3G network signals. My acid test for this is a swamp between close hills and 8 miles from the nearest ATT tower. I haven't had a dropped call yet.Standard mini-USB cable plug. You already have fifteen of these cables lying around the house. Motorola has been making them for fifteen years at least.Functional camera. No it is not optimized for photography but you can turn off all the sound effects so you can take a photo of that ivory-billed woodpecker without scaring it off. But this is a cell phone. If you need a camera see Canon EOS Rebel T3 12.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm IS II Lens and EOS HD Movie Mode (Black)Negatives: All the bells and whistles can't be deleted or removed. Like I'm going to shop for MP3s while checking my email and paying my phone bill, all while I'm driving down the highway. Jeez Motorola, everybody in the world isn't 15 years old!Edited on 11/12/13 to add: Oops. It finally happened! A few weeks ago I dropped my phone in the mud while I was doing some yard work putting in a French drain. Ran over it with the tractor, +/- 5000 pounds. Had to wash the mud off of it before I could put it back into my pocket. Otherwise it survived well without a scratch.

Harold", "ReviewID": "R34JB77W06FIMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a Motorola Tundra VA76r for more than 3 years. It still works flawlessly. Unfortunately, Motorola stopped manufacturing the phone and AT&T; stopped selling it. I'm so happy with the phone that I decided to purchase a NEW backup Tundra to keep as a spare for when my current phone finally stops working. The way it's still working, I'm expecting to get several more years of usage. But now I'll have my NEW backup phone available when nedded. I really don't understand why Motorola decided to stop manufacturing it. There is no current replacement on the market built to military specifications that withstands drops, accidents, and is waterproof. I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a rugged phone built for long term usage. Be aware that the phone offered on this website is way overpriced for a REFURBISHED phone. I bought my brand NEW phone in original AT&T; packaging on another website whose ititials are \"eb\" for only $169. I checked \"eb\" today, and the same seller is now selling the same NEW phone for $219. That's still cheap for such a great quality phone.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Construction workers dream TRULY A TOUGH PHONE (of course they stopped making it)", "Author": "SMEAD", "ReviewID": "R11767H30TTAPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought refurbished for husband. He took it in to AT&T; to transfer data from his old cheap flip phone and you'd think he brought in some fascinating dinosaur specimen.
