{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great service! poor quality phone.", "Author": "MetalFan", "ReviewID": "R2VUMLL9PAOZXL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was delivered very quickly and in a Blackberry box with all the necessary parts! I ordered the phone on a Friday and received it on Monday. I was looking for another Blackberry to replace my broken Storm2 for a few months while waiting for the contract to end. I tried to stay away from refurbs and this phone was in new condition out of the box. Other BB's on Amazon are advertised refurbs and that is why I chose this phone other than the cheap price tag.The phone works as it should, no problems.9-26-11- UPDATEPhone is painfully slow in the simplest of functions, the small SD card connector snapped off and now renders a 16gb microSD useless. The trackball has to be almost pushed into the phone to work properly. I'm tossing this phone and going with something else for 3 months until the Verizon contract is over. The BB experience is so bad, I kick myself for paying for the data plan and using a phone which has no gps and such awful data capabilities.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": ".", "Author": "Gabbie", "ReviewID": "RZOJK5M5YSS0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I haven't been able to turn on the phone yet, because it said it comes with a wall charger and it didn't. Which really disappoints me. But the outside of the phone was like brand new! No scratches or anything noticeable. Hopefully when I get to turn on the phone it works well.ALSO! The phone said it comes in silver the phone I received came in red!!!! I do not like that either. I got a phone cover for it at the same time as well thinking the phone would be silver but the phone cover looks silly now because the phone color looks bad with it. Now I find a charger for the phone and its not turning on!!", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Guess it's OK", "Author": "Ambrose", "ReviewID": "R3I6RO79503SMH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price i got it for it could be worse, but then again have nothing of equal value to compare it to.  It does the job, slowly but it gets done.  Good transition phone in case you break your better one, haven't had it freeze on me or anything real bad. Sound quality on calls isn't good. Buy a case for it because its slippery.  At the end of the day it's not that good, but it's ok could be worse.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry curve", "Author": "raul Crisantos", "ReviewID": "R2ARVUWTMNLP9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone works good have a problem with the 'U' but its working good that's probably the only thing that my phone has but if i pressed it hard it works!", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Blackberry phone", "Author": "Gopal Venkatesan", "ReviewID": "R1BDA59E73MNY8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like my Blackberry Curve 8330 very much.  I wasn't a Blackberry user until a month back so I was pleasantly surprised by this phone.  I was under the impression that typing on a Blackberry would be very difficult given the small keys, but I was proved wrong by this one.  Overall a very good phone for the price (I paid $79.)I'm giving four stars since sometimes it takes a while to bring this phone back from standby mode, otherwise I have no complaints at all.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry", "Author": "deborahburgess", "ReviewID": "R28BZVV92MAHAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great! It was exactly as they said it would be. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It would have been nice to know that the smart phones are more expensive monthly tho, but all in all a great phone!", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005AYVP96"}}
