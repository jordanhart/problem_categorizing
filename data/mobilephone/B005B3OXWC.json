Can compete with Android in some sense, that it has the capability to install basic tools and games; although the tools are not for free.It has a built in:- alarm- chronometer/stopwatch- Text messaging, and MMS picture sending- Basic 1x speed browsing (costs money)- voice recorder- Music player- Still picture camera- Calculator- Calendar with reminder- world clock- Memo pad (text)- Nice music sounds, fonts, and themes.- Vibration and dynamic alarms (soft to louder)- Can speak caller's name when phone rings (\"Call from ...\")It has 105MB of internal memory, 5MB in use, so a good 100MB for your pleasure.Supports upto 32GB microSD cards (I did not test any larger cards)The back speaker can be quite loud; the internal speaker for conversations, much like many other phones, crackles when putting the volume to max.Camera takes pictures of upto 1280x960 pix.

Reyes", "ReviewID": "R3FWHOCLHNMH9R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the phone myself..Started out with 4 of them for the entire family. The features I like best is the easy to use keypad and the MP3 music player I have downloaded tons of my favorite albulms and listen to it wherever I go with or without headphones.

It's a good phone for the money :)Samsung Freeform III Prepaid Phone (MetroPCS)", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "The model number is the only upgrade", "Author": "Deadweasel", "ReviewID": "R3VQUU9DFBOPAI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I started out with the Freeform II, which was my first step beyond the standard candybar phones.  It worked well for the most part, but after a year of service, the mic suddenly decided to die.  I figured it was a good excuse to check out the next version of the phone, which had improved spacing and size for the keys (a big plus for somebody with bear paws for hands like myself).Big mistake.  While calls still sound good, the interface is slow and choppy, especially while trying to send text messages.  There's nothing more frustrating than typing like mad, only to have the phone seemingly freeze for a couple of seconds, and completely miss multiple words' worth of typing.  To experience it multiple times during every single message is painful enough, but that same halting behavior is noticeable with almost every feature interaction possible, short of actually dialing a phone number.At 1.3MP, the camera is pretty pointless, save for reference images, but be prepared to re-snap often, and only in solid daylight.  Move too soon before the freeze-delayed snap, and you'll get a blur instead.As a music player it does a fair enough job, and the full-size headphone jack is definitely a plus.  However, even though it will drive a regular set of headphones well enough for tunes on the go, beware: if a call comes in while you're jamming, the music in the headphones will suddenly stop, but the ring tone only sounds on the phone itself.  I suspect you have to shell out for a stereo hands-free kit before you get to hear your phone's rings over the headphones, but that's not so important to me, so I'll never know for sure.To make matters worse, even though its predecessor worked with Samsung's PC Studio phone management software at least enough to back up the phone book (the Freeform II wasn't special enough to be supported for any of the other interesting features like SMS management apparently), the Freeform III isn't even recognized by the latest version of the program at all!  This is especially shameful, considering Samsung ships a copy of PC Studio with the phone.  If it weren't for both models having the ability to transfer contacts over bluetooth, I would've been stuck transferring 180+ work phone numbers to the new phone manually, since there's no way to store the phone book on the SD card with either model.All in all, while I felt like I got a decent bang for my buck with the Freeform II, I feel a bit cheated this time around with the Freeform III.  Sadly, Samsung has never released any kind of update for the II, so I'm not exactly holding out any hope that they'll do any bug fixing -let alone proper updates- for this one.  If all you want is decent call quality, this phone will do the job, but then again, if that's all you need, there's no reason to spend $50 on this thing when a smaller, cheaper phone will do the task just as well.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone - even better customer service!", "Author": "Andrew Lubin \"author of Charlie Battery; A Ma...", "ReviewID": "R1K65UPQOF68IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a phone for phonecalls and texts and a provider who offered good connectivity, and decided on MetroPCS and the FreeForm 3.1-What a great phone!

Smack dab in the middle of the home base where I should have excellent coverage and I have 0 - 2 bars inside buildings and 3 - full bars on the road. Doesn't make sense. As I am strapped for cash currently I had to go with the cheapest I could find and currently metro is having a promotion of $25.00 unlimited minutes and text for the life of the phone. I haven't much of a choice since I need to cut back and this is far better than the $70.00 I was paying with ATT.So far the called go through relatively well and they can hear me but I get choppy sound at times from callers.The buttons are a bit small as is the phone itself. Odd thing is I added some ring tones to added storage and all the ones I added were almost complete silent, you could barely hear them while the stocked tones were normal volume. This frustrated me completely......after multiple tries of deleting and re-uploading I got the same results. During the process I had also turned off and turned on the phone. All of a sudden and for no apparent reason the tones I added just started playing at the proper volume.....and I simply have no clue why. I think it takes too much clicking around to plug it into a PC.....First you have to plug it in, 3 of my PCs errored when they tried to install the software but it seems you have to go into your menu and clock a few levels in and activate the USB storage before the phone goes into an \"inoperative mode\" and your PC can then access the files on the memory card. There were several annoyances I needed to play with (one especially annoying was your keys lock each time it goes into sleep mode and I had to unlock them each time to use the phone) before the phone was more functional to my taste. The battery is pathetic as well. After a day it was already losing charge. My last phone, even after 2 - 3 days still had a full charge. The camera is useless but I didn't get a phone to use as a camera so not big deal. Had metro not had such a good promotion I would have returned it for another carrier other than ATT. With the promotion though you are only given 48 hrs to return the phone. I guess you get what you pay for.Update, 3 days of ownership and on a full charge this piece of junk died after 40 minutes of talking, 40 minutes!!!!!!
