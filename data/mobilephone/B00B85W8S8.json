It worked.The screen is beautiful and most importantly--Huge!If you get one of these babies you most likely won't need a 7 inch tablet. Plus, you can call/text people with it :) It also has GPS, which most cheaper tablets out there don't have.I haven't tried using a Data plan with the phone, but my in-house wifi works great.Using the internet on this phone is nice and easy-- the built in browser is fast, though my default preference has been Opera.It's pretty quick when accessing apps and since it's not JellyBean it's got Flashplayer built in--thank god for that.Youtube and Netflix work great.Screen is very responsive, better than my Crystal Ainol tablet.The camera seems okay--don't have anything to compare it to, the video camera seems a lot nicer (I could see myself using it over taking pictures).The phone is very lightweight and the perfect size to read on. Reading comics on it is actually a surprisingly nice experience--using the Kindle app, the pages of a comic can be divided and enlarged if you choose.I've found myself neglecting my tablet since I powered up the phone.The one thing I couldn't find when doing research on this phone was a picture of it compared to a 7 inch tablet--so I've decided to post one, in case that helps someone make a decision.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Was Almost Perfect", "Author": "The Engineer", "ReviewID": "R6MQTQRE9ZBDM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Yes, it does work with the Straight Talk BYOP SIM for both AT&T; and T-Mobile.As a legally blind person, I've always had to use a magnifying glass when using an Android phone.  Now, I can use my phone without looking like I'm Sherlock Holmes.The box is labeled \"Android Note 2,\" but the actual device inside is labeled \"Android Note 3.\"  I know the \"Note 2\" models come with Android 4.0, and my \"Note 3\" came with Android 4.1, so I'm not complaining.  This is about as pure Android as you can get; no bloatware of any kind.There are 2 design issues I have with this phone:1. Because of the case design, the micro USB connector is deeply recessed and requires the use of an unusually long USB connector plug.  Start looking for extra data/charging cables NOW.2. The retaining clip that holds the micro SD card in place is of poor construction.  Cut a small piece off of the packing foam, as a spacer to keep the memory card in place, when the back is on.***** UPDATE #1 01-31-2013 *****The GPS receiver has failed.  Using the GPS Test app ([...]), no satellites seem to be visible; even when standing outdoors.  Very UNHAPPY.***** Update #2 02-01-2013 *****I was finally able to verify there IS a working GPS receiver in my phone.  It seems the receiver and/or antenna is not as sensitive as the typical Android phone.  I was able to finally get the GPS receiver to lock onto some satellites, but the operating conditions required to overcome the issue requires the user to be \"highly conscious\" about the environment they are using the phone in; outdoors, with absolutely no structural obstacles, etc.***** Update #3 02-01-2013 *****Lining the inside back cover of the phone, with foil, improves the performance of the phone's GPS receiver.***** Update #4 02-07-2013 *****By not using any live wallpapers, and only using weather apps that only look up the weather when you ask it to, like AccuWeather ([...]) I was able to get the standby battery usage down to 1% per hour.I also began using this feature I discovered called \"Schedule Power On/Off\" to automagically reset the phone every day at 2:30 in the morning.  Essentially I tell the phone to turn itself off at 2:27 AM and then turn itself back on at 2:30 AM.***** Update #5 02-12-2013 *****This is in response to the 1 star review by @Himadri.As for the \"Note 3\" sticker with version 4.1.1 instead of 4.0.1, I think most people will prefer Jelly Bean over Ice Cream Sandwich anyday.  I just got through loading AnTuTu and am happy to report that the model I received does contain a dual core MTK6577 processor.  As for the disappointment of only getting 1 Ghz instead of the promised 1.2 Ghz processor speed; that 1.2 Ghz is only achieved through manufacturer overclocking -- the actual specs for the processor are only rated at 1 Ghz.  Overclocking to 1.2 Ghz makes the phone more unstable, and I'm glad the manufacturer is keeping within the rated clock speed.  500 ma for the charger is sufficient to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time (less than an hour from 75%), considering the phone draws only 1% an hour during normal use.***** Update #6 02-15-2013 *****Extra screen protectors, cases and USB cables can be obtained through the Alibaba site.  It's kind of like the Chinese version of eBay.  All payments to sellers are held in escrow until you receive your package, via registered mail.***** Update  #7 02-18-2013 *****For those of you who are going to use this on Straight Talk...  Do not try creating a new APN.  Instead, edit the existing \"default\" APN.  Otherwise, you may discover MMS or tethering will not work, because of an extra required setting that was previously unknown to you.***** Update #8 03-22-2013 *****This morning, I awoke to find notifications in Chinese.  I should've paid more attention to those Chinese lessons my Mom made me take; I haven't the slightest idea what they are.  Are they system updates or malware?  I tried 1 of them, and it tried to download something, but the download wasn't successful; again, the reason was in Chinese.  \"Lookout\" doesn't think anything \"bad\" happened, so I simply cleared the remaining notifications and will hope for the best.***** FINAL UPDATE 12-19-2013 *****It's Dead Jim!Over the last 2 months, I've noticed the slow deterioration and failure of the phone's charging circuitry.  Symptoms are:1. Resetting the phone causes a 10% or more drop in the estimated battery level.2. Sudden drops in battery level (from 85% to 65%) if you just \"stare at the display\" long enough.3. Charging circuit does not \"play nice\" with charger.  You end up pulling the battery and reinserting it, to get the charging circuit to start doing its job properly.I noticed the price on this phone has gone down about $20 from when I originally purchased it.  Rather than purchase another one; I decided to get the BLU Studio 5.5 D610A BLU Studio D610A Android Unlocked which has more features, for about the same as I originally paid for this phone.  Look for an upcoming review on this device from me!===== Conclusion =====The reason I gave this product 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because many people who shop on Amazon have an unrealistic expectation that this is going to be an out of the box \"turn key\" experience.  You ***WILL*** have to tinker with it, in order to get to that \"Happy Place\" in your heart.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is awesome!", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R3DMNEN3RJK9W8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone last week and absolutely love it!

This phone rocks big timeORIGINAL POST:Got it some days ago (bought from keydroper), requested it in black and black it is. Very fast shipping from Hong Kong (seller is very responsive, replied to my email in two minutes).The display is amazing, with good angle views. It came with Android 4.1.1, not the expected 4.0 listed in the description, no complains there. I find it very fast, I agree it is not \"super fast\". I am using it with Tmobile prepaid, perfect. I plan to keep my prepaid number and get another with the $30 plan (full internet, 100 minutes) using the two sims, will update this review when I do it. Have not tested battery duration, seems good so far.As mentioned in another review by the engineer, the cable is not standard, but I could make a spare cutting the rubber in the mini usb side of an older cable.The only issue I have had so far was that the auto-rotate stopped working, restarting the phone did not fix the issue. I turned it off, took the battery out and put it back, started and it is working ok.I would have paid much more for this phone had I had the chance to test it in advance.***UPDATE 2/24/2013****Ok I just did the test of the data plan. Let me start with the good:Yes it works with the two sims, I have (for this test month) two t-mobile phone numbers, the original simple pay as you go and the other in the SIM2 the $30 data plan. It was easy to setup in the t-mobile site, no need to call them.Now the bad: this phone (at least my phone) does not connect using 3g, it shows an icon with an E (I think it means Edge) and the best download speed I tested was 160kb, upload 50kb and right now it is 35 and 34.I did a simple test: took out the SIM2 and put it in my old and trusty LG optimus and repeated the speed test: I got downloads of 1900kb and uploads of 100kb.The moral of the story: If you buy this phone expecting 3g speed with Tmobile you may be disappointed. I will not renew the plan and keep using it with my simple prepaid, wifi. But I changed my rating to 4.****UPDATE 3/1/2013I had the intermittent issue of the phone screen going off when placing a call. Found the explanation in a post on the web, here is it:------------Question: Hi, can you teach me how to calibrate?Post:It is actually a simple process. Locate your proximity sensor, it is a small LED-like thing next to the speaker, on either side. Look for calibration of proximity sensor, you can find it usually amongst the display options. Tap on it, target-like concentric circles appear and the application asks you to place some obstacles over the sensors. The easiest way is to hold your palm above the sensor approx. 5 cm (2 inches) apart. Touch the Start button, and then try to complete the process with your hand motionless. The whole process takes a few seconds. If you did everything right, during a call, holding the phone to your ear the screen goes blank, and the phone application re-appears when moving the phone away.------------I did the exact process and the phone is perfect now: I make a call, move it near my ear, screen goes off, move it away and it comes back. :-) :-) :-)I think that somebody mentioned this in some comment, but I did not know the exact procedure to calibrate. In my phone it is under Display and the caption is \"Als-ps calibration\" and the button caption is \"Calibrate\" (what the explanation refers to as Start button)****UPDATE 4/3/2013*****I bought another for my daughter, have not received it yet.She has ATT contract plan with data, her iPhone was stolen a while ago and she is using a replacement phone which goes up to 3g only.I removed my tmobile SIM, put her ATT SIM, powered up and behold: no need to change any settings, just acknowledged the prompt stating the SIM change, and the phone worked flawlessly with data at H speed (which is supposed to be faster than 3g)When the new phone arrives I will post speed tests.****UPDATE 4/7/2013******New phone for daughter is beautiful, white, both cameras have more megapixels.It is working with my daughter's ATT contract data SIM, speedtest application reports downloads of 2.2 megabits and uploads of almost 1 megabit (995kb).

I really like the phone, everything works great. I bought the AT&T; Straight Talk standard sim card which works great with the phone gives me the H data signal. I bought this phone back on April 17th I've had it a little while. Setting this phone up I used the information in the reviews by The Engineer (which I am extremely thankful for) on page 5. If you are planning on using the same sim I highly recommend you look. The sound is good quality and can get very loud, camera is good (I don't do anything besides take pics of my kids), the screen is nice and bright. As far as outdoors direct sunlight you can barely see the screen but if you use your hand as some shade it's easily seeable. The one issue I have with this phone is the size only because it wont fit in my pocket BUT I would buy it again. The quality of this phone definitely met my expectations with what I had read and then receiving the phone. I was weary especially with it coming from overseas but it was worth it and so was the wait. Things I didn't realize is that the phone comes with 2 batteries, a strange looking stylus, wall charger/USB (the plug that goes into the phone does need to be cut further back if you have one of your own that'll fit, the one that comes with is already set), earphones, and a case cover battery door; you take off the back cover and snap another on that is connected to a cover that wraps around like a checkbook.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!", "Author": "R.

I emailed the seller after ordering to request the orange color.  My phone arrived in 2 days.  My SIM arrived later.I highly recommend that Straighttalk users who are use T-Mobile or AT&T; first find out which provider works best in their area.  T-moble was lousy at my workplace and mediocre at home but wonderful in certain areas of the city.  I ordered an AT&T; SIM for just $19 and my signal is now wonderful at work.  I had suffered with T-Mobile for more that 2 weeks. I went from no bars on G to a full 4 bars on H.  You certainly cannot judge the phone by the SIM.

I had to use the speakerphone sometimes.  Talking was fine though.  I had no trouble hearing the conversation.  The Speaker is good.Video:  I enjoy it.  I don't require HiDef.  Great for watching a video during lunch break.Memory space:  I need a larger memory card for storing more video.  I used my 2Gig from my old phone.Navigation: I really need to test it.  T-Mobile bothered me so much that I never really tested the Navigation in my car.FM radio APP:  I guess having this great AT&T; signal doesn't help.  It really is an FM signal and I cannot get 90.1 at my employer.  I downloaded the WABE 90.1 APP instead.  I works wonderfully. I can enjoy the classics again.Camera: fine for me.

After about a month, the first one crashed and kept announcing how it was throwing up all its programming and then after about the third round would not turn on. I sent it back and AMAZON WAS GREAT in accepting it! I will NEVER be sorry for purchasing through them. I liked the unit so much I ordered it again, as it came with a ONE YEAR WARRANTY!! I am VERY happy with the product. ONE DRAWBACK is that it did NOT come with the original charger, and as several other people have mentioned here, the charging jack is more recessed. If you hold your tongue right and don't breathe on it you can get a regular micro USB to work in a pinch, but the first unit that I bought actually came with a slightly longer prong on the micro USB end. Apparently you can actually carve away some of the plastic foreskin on a regular one, but there could be an issue with it shorting out. I have been meaning to contact the seller about this. BOTH units that I bought were white, and the first one, with the correct longer prong, had a white charger and USB cable to match. The second unit came with a black charger and USB cable with the standard universal short prong used on most phones.  I am thinking that for some reason the factory swapped the charger out. It was a brand new sealed box. They are probably in high demand, as the only place where any one with this phone can get a replacement. You can't just order any universal charger.

It's a MTK6575 single-core 1.0Ghz inside as revealed by Antutu Benchmark and other hardware info apps. If not for these apps I would have been fooled.DETAILS: I also received one with \"Note 3\" sticker on phone and has Android 4.1 inside (not 4.0 as described). Says N9776 on back of phone (batt compartment) but I also noticed that battery compartment is white plastic (not black as in pics), rear camera is \"orange metal\" (not silver-metal as in pics), and charger/cable/handsfree-earphones are black (not white as in pics). The charger-adapter is 5V but only 500mA output so takes too long to charge the high capacity batt. But so far none of these descrepancies are deal breaker. Then I downloaded Antutu Benchmark and few other hardware info apps and found out that the inside was the cheaper & less powerful MTK6575 single-core 1.0GHz system. I cried foul to seller, sent screenshots and returned it for full refund. Amazon Seller (in US) says he wasn't aware and also paid higher price himself for MTK6577 dual-core 1.2GHz phone simply trusting his supplier in China.Update 02May2013: I bought again, this time from an eBay/Amazon seller from Hong Kong. I requested seller to confirm for MTK6577 dual-core before shipping. So I finally received an orange colored 6\" N9776 with MTK6577 dual-core 1.0GHz as they advertise. Interesting that it looks \"exactly\" identical to the single-core N9776 I returned before. So it means you can't tell the difference from external look or packaging. This dual-core is much smoother/faster.

Modifying USB cables, External Charger", "Author": "Raymond Perry", "ReviewID": "R19MKMK391SAKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ADDED 05/22/2013EXTERNAL BATTERY CHARGER - Some users may be interested in an external battery charger that works with these huge batteries.  I purchased Hyperion Universal Rapid Battery Charger for Samsung Galaxy S III, Samsung Galaxy Note, Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, Samsung Galaxy S II, and Samusung Galaxy S II Skyrocket (Compatible with Most Samsung Android Phones)This charger works, but there are a couple of things you might want to know.  The spring loaded bottom does not pull down far enough for the battery to fit as intended.  However, a rubber band holds the battery in place just fine.  Move the movable contacts to the right side of the charger.  Adjust the contacts so that they touch the two outer contacts on the battery.  The battery should be inserted with the contacts more to the right than the left.  My batteries have a black arrow on both sides to indicate where the contacts are.  The side with the arrow more to the right should be facing out.  Rubber band the battery in place against the contacts first.  Wrap it around, not lengthwise.  It does not have to be super-tight, just enough for the battery not to move around.  You will know you have things setup right if the BLUE LED lights even though the charger is not plugged in.  Plug the charger in.  The LED should turn kind of PURPLE.  When it goes back to BLUE the battery is charged.  However, it will go to BLUE when the battery is not quite fully charge so leave it plugged in for a while.  The reviews on this charger are not great, but that may be because the instructions seem to be reversed.  I have two of these and they both work fine with several different phone batteries.  Just ignore the instructions.  It seems like the contacts should always be to the right.  Sometimes this means inserting a battery face down.  I have inserted batteries backward with no ill effect.  You will know the contacts are reversed because the LED will remain OFF with battery inserted and charger unplugged.  Some reviewers stated that the charger will only charge to 99%.  I never really noticed, but I can live with that for emergency backup.  Sorry if my posts are sometimes too detailed, but I try to provide enough information for folks to make informed decisions.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is an AMAZING phone and value.  These are now shipping with Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean.  I have been using a Galaxy Note which, to me, is one of the best phones out there (well, until the Note 2 came out).  I am VERY happy with this 6\" phone.  While there are a couple of minor things that I might prefer different this phone, I am thoroughly impressed and thrilled with this phone!  It may not technically be as fast as the Galaxy Note, but I do not notice much difference.  A couple of reviewers have complained about the screen.  My screen is gorgeous.  According to the specs the resolution may not be the same as the Note, but I cannot really tell any difference.  Some have complained about the camera.  Photos look fine to me.  In short, I do not see anything \"wrong\" with this phone; everything works as expected and works well.I am using mine with ATT right now.  It either comes set up for ATT or it reads it from the SIM card.  At first there was no data connection, but after quite a few minutes it was there.  So give it a little while before you panic.  There are two SIM card slots.  I have read that you should put the SIM in the GSM only slot to get 3G or faster data speeds.One minor irritation is that the phone has very little internal storage, apparently only 512mb/503mb available for apps etc.  This is storage, not RAM.  Most phones have 8gb or so.  Maybe this helps keep the price down.  You will definitely want a micro SD card.  I would suggest 32gb.  You can get and app like AppMonster to move as many apps as possible to SD card.  You will also want to go into Setting>Storage to change the Preferred Install Location and DEFAULT WRITE DISK to SD Card.  These are two separate things.  You will see the selections for DEFAULT WRITE DISK, but you have to tap Preferred Install Location to change it.  Even so you may have to go into AppMonster or other App2SD app to move some things.If the phone screen does not automatically turn off when you hold the phone to your ear you will need to calibrate the Als_ps (proximity sensor).  This prevents your accidentally hanging up because your cheek touches the screen.  Go into Settings>Display>Als_ps calibration.  There will be instructions on the calibration screen, but the may not be perfectly clear.  When the calibration screen appears, lay the phone down screen up on a flat surface.  Hold one hand over the upper part of the screen, especially the proximity sensor, which is the little oblong dark area in the upper right corner.  With the other hand touch the blue button.  Make a call and hold the phone up to your ear.  You should see the screen go off as it gets close to your face.  If not, do the calibration again.SELLER and COLOR SELECTIONI would only order from Keydroper.  He is very responsive.  Others have reported great customer service from him when they had problems.  The phone is available in white, black or orange.  There is nowhere to specify color when you order so here is how I suggest you do that.  As soon as you place your order go into \"Your Orders\", and click on the Order Details.  On this page there is a link to contact the shipper.  Click on it and send him a note.  I did not do that at first, but I had asked him something else.  In his reply he asked what color I wanted.  I selected the orange, and I love it.USB CABLESDo not let this scare you off, but as reported in many reviews the USB port requires a longer micro USB connector (more of the metal connector itself exposed).  It seems like the port on the motherboard is normal length, but the curvature of the case edge prevents a normal length micro USB from inserting far enough to make connection.  Others have suggested trimming the plastic back a bit to expose more of the metal connector itself.  I thought I would elaborate on that a bit.  You really only need to trim back the plastic on the \"top\" side, ie, the side with the narrower face of the connector.  Usually this is the side with the USB logo.  I tried using a razor knife, but many of my cables had harder plastic so I found it much easier to use a hacksaw with fine teeth.  You only need to trim back about 2-3 mm, about 1/8\".  Just cut slowly until you feel/hear the blade touch the metal.  Then trim a little on the edges, too.  I did this by laying the blade along the edge of the connector at the same angle as the edges which taper toward the top.  After making the three cuts I used a razor/utility knife to cut the waste free and clean up the cuts a bit.  I probably did 10 cords in 15 minutes once I got the technique worked out.  I keep chargers everywhere - three rooms at home, two cars, office, travel bag, etc.SHIPPINGI ordered my phone on 5/2 and it was delivered 5/10.  Not bad at all for an item shipping from Hong Kong.I could go on and on about a great phone and seller, but that's all I have time for now.

Received it in 10 business days after ordering it. Tracking it might be confusing since its through USPS. The manual was in english so its fairly clear and informative. This was my 1st touch screen smart phone. This coming from using basic flip phones over 15 yrs. The package came tightly wrapped. Inside the package include: 1 x manual, 1 phone, 1 leather case, 1 ear phones, 1 usb connector, 1 charger, the screen protector was already applied onto the phone itself. The phone itself was quite huge since its 6\" screen and all. Its a clone so its similiar to a samsung note II but minus the brand logo and its 1/3 the price. Texting, voice calls, video watching on netflix, youtube so far is great. Sound quality is good. The battery life is good compare to most phones. It comes with 2 batteries. The only thing I might say its not on to par might be the camera. If you want photo studio quality, i suggest go buy a slr digital camera. If you want regular pics then the camera give it a decent quality. It is unlocked so it can be used on straight talk, AT&T;, net 10, T-Mobile, virgin mobile or any other gsm carriers. It won't work verizen or sprint since they use csma network. I had it for a week so far.

Very well-made. The price has been going up and down like a yoyo, though. Two weeks after I ordered it, there was a US$19 drop. The vendor has kindly promised to send an additional battery to make it up. Service from this vendor (lol-buy) is quite good. No complaints here.There is already a very helpful and somewhat long review thread on the orange version. I'll simply touch upon two major issues here:(1) The sim cards: I have tried an AT&T; data plan micro-sim (an adapter is needed), booted up the phone and the card is recognized. After entering info in the sim management panel, 3G service is indicated by an H next to the signal bars. No problems answering and calling at all. Then a second sim from another country is tested, also recognized right away; although a field test will have to be deferred until my next overseas trip.(2) The GPS: It actually works well. A Satellite Check app (also included in the Polaris Navigation app) operating in the magnetic mode (for indoor use) picks up 9-12 satellites in a few minutes. It takes only seconds to get a fix outdoors. Google Navigation works flawlessly.On the flip side, the display is no retina display; it is just good enough for general viewing. And some apps don't work - those requiring a magnetic sensor (it does not have one), for example, the compass apps. Not deal breakers, of course.Overall, for the money, this is a surprisingly good smartphone. Some tweaking is needed, but it is part of the fun.5/13/2013 Update: (1) The vendor quickly sent over the battery. (2) After many tries, this phone simply cannot be rooted.6/4/2013 Update: This phone actually can be rooted. Now it is perfect!7/19/2013: After almost 3 months of daily use, this phone is still going strong. There has been a huge improvement, thanks to Google. The newest Google Maps no longer stays in RAM thus avoiding the previous version's eating up the memory.8/15/2013: After inserting a new battery, all of a sudden, the phone begins to randomly shut down, does not wake up from sleep, cannot fully reboot, and worse, the battery cannot be re-charged. Turns out to be a contact issue: the three copper pins on the battery and the phone sometimes do not kiss tightly. The battery needs to be about 0.1-0.2mm longer. A spacer made from aluminum foil corrects the problems. These symptoms are suspiciously similar to some previous comments complaining about a broken phone or unchargeable battery. Probably just a loose connection.3/3/2014: After testing umpteen apps. Two prove the most useful: (1) a browser with a funny name \"Naked Browser\" allows automatic deletion of history, cache, etc, on exit; and (2) MobileUncle is a must, in its Engineering -> localization mode, a GPS fix can be obtained in less than 18 sec. Others such as Documents-to-Go works well with Dropbox and phone calls, both US and international, with Viber is a breeze. This dual core phone still does a good job, it'll be interesting to see if the ones with octacore will now take over.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "R157JVN0B2LGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

As far as save files create files save applications from the play store. The phone will download them to your SD card and then it would save the cache, save files to your phone so it renders the SD pointless. Basically this phone sucks. All it is, is the first android phone just with a huge screen. Its not worth what they ask. And any issue you have with this phone and want answers on your screwd cause no one cares. There's no contact number from the company. Only emails and they give you two sentence answers that don't help at all.

When we got these phones in it was like the difference of night & day ! Considering that we got them from China we expected it was going to take forever to get these phones, but after asking the seller to get them to us as fast as possible he paid about an extra $20 to get them to us faster and we got the phones in about 2 weeks or less and we did not have to pay to get them to us faster ! On 1 of the phones we accidently broke the camera lens and they said to send it back to them and they said that they would fix the phone at no cost to us. The only complaint that my wife has is that here hands are not very big and that makes it difficult for her to hold the phone. Thankfully I love the phone and it fits my hands just fine. I would highly recommend buying from this seller, they have very good service and will go out of their way to please you !!!

I have experienced a few problems with this phone:1) some down-loaded files have Kanji letters describing the file,2) the initial charger issue,3) the on-board memory is very bad - there are programs that run on-board that are excessive in size and to which I cannot figure or have a hard time figuring out what they do, 3) when you make calls the screen goes black - thus you cannot use the keyboard as a control with phone based interfaces,4) the opbtions to roam and use international coverage - while partly an issue with the service provider, is very cumbersome and non-responsive,5) the phone seemed to have a number of issues when NOT using wifi data networks.  The data connection would drop even when the signal was very strong,6) Many of the annoying sounds and reminders on the phone could not be shut off or customized.  Customizing some contacts did not work at all.I think others had the many of the same problems.++++++ update ++++++++++this is the email I received from the company regarding this phone.

If I could, I would give it a zero out of five. Where should I start? It's a GSM phone which means that it uses a SIM-card. A standard SIM-card and not a micro-SIM which means it'll only work on 2G networks and lower. No 3G or 4G. The memory is HORRIBLE. It only has 512 megs of RAM which means that once it hits the mark, it'll go to the home screen from the browser. Also, it can't hold that many apps because of the limited space. Often times, without even using an app a notification will pop up saying that an app stop working or has crashed. The screen is a cool 6 inches, but when you make a phone call, it'll go black making it impossible to do anything that requires a phone key prompt or checking your voicemail using your password. I do enjoy the video and sound quality of the phone, but the camera sucks and the only ear buds or headphones that'll work with the phone are the ones that comes with the phone. So, if you have those cool iPhone ear buds or Beats Audio, it isn't going to work. This is, by far, the worst $150.00 I ever spent on a mobile device.

First I received it on the date it said it would arrive! I was super excited about that, i'm not a techy person so I couldn't tell you specifics but here it goes.The phone itself is beautiful! nice large screen it's basically a tablet, looks a little funny when talking on the phone, i've had people approach me and ask if i'm talking on my tablet and i have to say NO it's my phone! hahaMy two biggest compalints: One, the phone does NOT charge! the adapter i received doesnt work for crap! i left my phone plugged in over night and it stayed at 35% the entire time, i was SO mad! i tried the second batter (came with 2 batteries, woo!) and same thing, did not charge, finally i decided to plug the usb into my computer and just like that, it chaged! it sucked because no i have to leave my computer on all night just to get my phone to charge, but it's not so so bad, not sure how or where to find an adapter that will actually work, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.number two is just like another person said, when you are talking on the phone the screen shuts off and the ONLY way to hang up is by using the power button, you have to go into the settings and check that the power button can also be used to hang up calls! This really sucks, but it doesn't ALWAYS happen sometimes the screen will stay lit and i can hang up just fine, i've gotten used to just putting it on speaker, it sounds better, that is my number 3, the sound is SO quiet, i have to press my ear against the screen just to hear and sometimes my cheeks will hang up the call or pause it when the screen is still lit. But i've had that problem with ALL my smart phones so if you have big cheeks beware haha jk jkhmmm o and last but not least the speaker it has on the back...o dear, it is not the greatest when playing music, especially rock, metal, heavy metal, screamo...it kinda sucks for that, when using it to talk on speaker phone it works really really well but not so well for music! other than that i'm very happy with my purchase, it does everything i need it to do, check e-mail all 4 of them :) personal and business, same with our businesses facebook page, it runs well, not slow at all, and the screen is great! works much better in the dark, some glare when you are outside but still a great phone! so if your not too picky, the price is freaking awesome and the phone is too! had the charger actually worked, i would have given it 5 stars, but it's not that big of a deal to me! i'm not picky i just like having something nice and something that gets the job done! I use my phone for EVERYTHING and so far so good! i will update if it messes up in less than a year tho, since that's what a lot of ppl said, that it only lasts a year! for me that would be a wonderful miracle if i could make it to the one year mark! i'm rough on my phones haha oh and also i got it in orange! didn't have to message them or anything :) so happy guys!
