{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review for Sprint's Torch.", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "RF68RGBE4HJ98", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros -1. Good screen size, good graphics while browsing, the phone has a very sleek built and looks attractive to hold, there is a lock mechanism on top of the phone.2. Despite being a touchscreen phone the blackberry has a scroll trackpad for those who may miss it or may need it, this is required to ensure pinpoint accuracy for those who haven't mastered the touchscreen immediately.3. Great camera, super fast. Picture a friend looking to get out of the image before you click, too late, the camera is super fast. It does have a flash too.4. Call quality is strong and you get reception everywhere. OS 7.0 isn't very different from the previous Operating System. Some say it should have been called 6.5 to show the lack of technological advancement since the previous operating system.Cons -1. While the phone is sleek, the on screen keyboard will take some time getting used to and there aren't many options for changing it.2. Compared to an Android the screen doesn't have that kind of wooing ability.3. The phone is a blackberry without a keyboard and for those who stick to the blackberry for features such as BBM, this is an immediate departure.4. While this is a great phone, it is missing a keyboard and therefore pitted directly against Android phones and that is where it is truly beaten black and blue. As an entertainment device it isn't very loud.For a very long time, Blackberry was formulaic and introduced little changes to their phones because their known formula was working. I used to respect them for that but in this day and age when you are competing with the likes of Apple and Android, most people who use the Blackberry as their sole device are dropping it and looking for other things. There are many cross platform chat softwares which work three quarters as good as the Blackberry like say Whatsapp (instead of the famous BBM).If you are considering getting this phone, do look at a store model I would strongly suggest. Voice clarity is good, design is good, the basics are fine. People coming from old Samsung Instincts would like this phone. So would people who have a Blackberry Style. Someone coming to this phone from an Android like Samsung Epic or HTC Evo won't be able to use it without complaining once in a way. The battery life is poor because they are now making their phone slimmer and the touchscreens bigger. From Blackberry I would like a better browsing experience and maybe a better onscreen keyboard. This phone was a great try and it's heartening to see how sleek and beautiful a blackberry has become.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Activation required", "Author": "Jillian101", "ReviewID": "R3CMCBBMOFMMS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the same phone as a matter of fact 2...I was able to convince a friend to purchase one as well...it did say activation required...I was using the phone but it sill said that...I googled it found the solution...Punched in ##000000, then entered my phone number in the first line, saved it and that wasit...never saw 'activation required' again...", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "BB Torch 9850", "Author": "OJ Oshin \"Muyiwa\"", "ReviewID": "R2H43QGDSQ7PVC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone cause i wanted to use it outside the US, and since it said unlocked, i reckoned it would do just fine. However, i got a scare when i received the phone and found out it was Sprint branded complete with a sim card and required activation. I felt so disappointed and since i already had it with me in Africa, there was no thought of returning it.I immediately went on the internet to buy an unlock code for it. The unlock code came in the mail, but while i was trying to figure out how to unlock the phone, i discovered that it was actually unlocked.I then put in my local sim and the phone kept on saying activation required. Despite that i put in the required local codes to activate the local BB network on the phone and to my pleasant surprise it worked and the BB line worked and i could make and receive calls.Despite this, the icon for my local network would not show, instead what is permanently displayed is \"activation required\".Anyway, I'm using the phone and it works well, although it is a Sprint branded phone.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Kriston50", "ReviewID": "RI36U039TTJ1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've received this phone today and it seems great.

The touch screen is responsive and vivid. The phone is quick and runs programs without the lag experienced with prior Blackberry phones. In short, this is far and away the best Blackberry out there. With that said, if you're not tied to Blackberry (likely due to an IT Policy) then I'd go with an iPhone or Android phone. Nonetheless, this is a great piece of hardware. If Blackberry had the same depth in their app store I think this phone would compete well with anything out there (iPhone and Android).", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "buen telefono", "Author": "Arnaldo Nu\u00f1ez", "ReviewID": "R3QIDSOBN9FJYW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "el telefono como producto funciona muy bien, estoy satisfecho con las ventajas y bondades que ofrece, lamentablemente en venezuela no tenemos la tecnologia adecuada en los proveedores de servicios para aprovechar al maximo estos telefonos.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "b2000lauren", "ReviewID": "R3KVOJ0A8VT5EN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this phone for a friend and she just love love love it so much. its not in the u.s.a. so its good cause that makes it international. its the best of a phone , your phone you don't have to change your phone when you travel so all your contacts will be there for you.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Utterly out of dis world.....", "Author": "baha", "ReviewID": "R3OCI7OTBFLSR8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First and foremost the phone was a beauty. it was new and in excellent condition. unfortunately it was an unlocked verizon phone.

Now that I have had the 9850 for about 6 months i Mostly want to throw it against the wall.  To be fair typing on the screen works reasonably well though not quite as good as a iphone or a android phone, but its adequate.  My top complaint is that the phone locks up ALL the time.  This occurs many times a day when you are trying to use the touch screen interface and it displays a clock type icon in the middle of the screen, usually lasts for about 30-60 seconds.  This is equivalent to the hour glass icon you get with a windows computer while it's crunching data.  It serious acts like it just doesn't have enough RAM. This temporary lock-up occurs at least half the times I pick up the phone to do either email or use the Google Navigation app.  You really have to keep the number of apps open as low as possible.  There are always 4-5 apps open that you can't close and I try to stay below 6-7 apps open for fear of it locking up more.My second issue with this phone and its just as annoying as the first one, the battery will not last a full day.  I do live in the Dallas area and so I'm on 4G a lot and I read that may have something do it with it.  Still a fully charged phone should make it past 3pm in the afternoon.  To be clear, all I use this phone for is my company outlook email, my gmail app, and a navigation app (either the Google maps app or AT&T; navigator app).  I don't use it as a music player or to watch movies or any games of any sort.  email and navigation, that's it.  I now have to always keep a charger in the car with me, especially when traveling, to limp it back home or back to the hotel in the evenings.Can't wait till my company gets away from Blackberry's and I can get either an android or an iphone.

I pre-ordered it 2 weeks before it even came out! I guess that was my first mistake...I probably should have waited to see what people said after it was out for a while. Here is my horrific experience with this phone:My preordered phone came to my home on the opening day date! Yay! I brought the phone to the Verizon headquarters to have them set me up. They got my phone all transferred and I was on my way. About an hour into having the phone I noticed the programs weren't working and most applications weren't opening up. I then brought the phone back to the headquarters store and they promptly exchanged me with a new phone. An hour later, I was walking out of the store happy as a pig in you know what. As soon as I got to my truck IN THE PARKING LOT I noticed the buttons were not working. I played around with it to make sure I was not crazy. I wasn't. I brought the phone in 5 minutes after I had walked out and customer service could NOT believe it! They felt so bad for me. I toyed around with the idea of just going with a completely new phone (Driod, Iphone) and decided to give it ONE MORE TRY since I had 14 days STILL to change my mind. Another 30 minutes later I walked out again and had a new phone (the third one) and was happy again.That was 88 days ago. Today I woke up and the phone just completely would not turn on. I was so angry. The battery was not dead it was completely fine the night before. I proceeded to call customer service who said I would have to take it back to the store I got it from. The store said all they could do was replace it with the same exact phone (new...which was nice since usually they make you get a refurbished one). The problem is I didn't want a NEW TORCH. It sucks. It is garbage. This is coming from a LOYAL blackberry customer. I had the old curve, the new curve, the bold, etc. This is garbage and definitely the END of RIM.So now I am out the $130 I paid to \"upgrade\" and I am stuck with a CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED Droid Incredible 2. This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that I paid $130 88 days ago to have a USED phone.I heard great things about all of the Droid products so I am excited for the switch (I am not quite ready for the Iphone....must....not....give....in).Wish me luck, but please....do NOT bother getting this phone. Blackberry is going down the tube. It's a sad day for me.
