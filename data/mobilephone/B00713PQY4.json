It's battery lasts very long it has a very good power saving mode unless you're really using it hard. For regular use however like making a few calls and only at certain parts of the day you're using heavy data and wireless browsing or other such activities this phone is great.Note that the statement in the description (unlocked for International Only) does not mean that they phone is unlocked for international use but means that the phone can be unlocked and used as a global phone. Or at least my phone did not come unlocked I had to pay for a unlock code to get it unlocked.The main negative about this phone is that it does not have android 4.0 which I'm amazed at as it's a Motorola device. You can root the phone and install a custom ROM that probably would allow you to use android 4.0 but straight from the company you won't be able to. If you want a phone that is similar to this one (physical keyboard) especially in terms of price then you can check out the Captivate Glide because it has android 4.04 but it's keyboard is not close to this phone.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worse Phone Ever!", "Author": "Jessie Rose", "ReviewID": "R2KD9HOKP9QQQQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone for two years and had to have it replaced six times.

Very good product from Motorola. I don't like the keyboard very much as I don't use it, but my wife love it. I rather on-screen keyboard. The speed of the hone is very nice, reception is unbelievable. The speaker is loud and clear when playing media or when phone rings/provide an alert. 3G speed is fine.I can't give a 5 star to this product, due to some aspects that are not quite right. The phone has that horrible Verizon logo -really, why the carriers love to brand technology, it's stupid. It is exactly when car dealers insist in put their ugly sticker to a fine piece of engineering. So, on top of being a walking ad, the OS is stuffed with useless Verizon apps that are hard to uninstall.I had to configure the phone caller ID, location where I'm using it, but due to Verizon stupidity and big ego, I couldn't change the default dial number for voice mail, and contact my carrier (*611 keeps dialing Verizon's customer service international number) If you know how to do this, please comment...Overall, if you don't mind branding, it's a good phone.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motorola Droid 3", "Author": "Juanjo", "ReviewID": "R2ONG9F6FBT99R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente Equipo es justo lo que esperaba, mi primer Smartphone con Android, tambien compr\u00e9 accesorios para llevar el equipo al l\u00edmite, un micro SD de 32 GB y fundas especiales para el equipo.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Nikola", "ReviewID": "R2N6DY8AGXU65T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had some problem at start, but new battery sorted everything out.
