The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seller says that there is no carrier logos on the casing, its just software configure for the carrier. Well, there is the at&t; logo on the casing. It's not like it hinders the performance of the phone.. I am very particular on the items I get online.

Having installed the new battery on 4/29/14, placing the phone on charge for the day, the problem still exists.  After charging all day (the phone gets noticeably warm during this process), then turning the phone off overnight, when turned on this morning a warning for needing charging appeared. I have concluded the problem is with the phone, not the battery.  Having had the phone for less than two weeks and it was marketed as a \"NEW\" phone, the experience has been very disappointing. I am going to return this phone to Amazon and will assume that that process is easy, as promised.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Get what you pay for", "Author": "slavko", "ReviewID": "R1P5SW78NOK74B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone to replace a Galaxy Stratosphere and found it to be similar but much slower to respond to keystrokes. I really like a dedicated keyboard but, the operating system seems sluggish. Front and rear camera are ok but, doesn't have a flash which limits picture taking.  Over all it's ok, would make a decent cheap first phone for a casual user.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Mari Vaccaro", "ReviewID": "R2IWBOT7BF84SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far my favorite phone I've had so far! I am so happy with the slide out keyboard ( with actual buttons) I looked all over for a phone like this and they were way out of my price range. I am always a bit leery of buying anything refurbished, but my phone is working great & I am very happy with it! It is perfect and just like brand new, I would've never guessed it was a refurnished phone. Would highly recommend it to anyone who, like me, loves the smart phone but hates the touchscreen keyboard. It also came way faster than I thought it would, so I was really happy about that, too! :)", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fine Phone", "Author": "shydra", "ReviewID": "R1VOL1RHTJ0WUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone it has worked out well for my needs.
