In Package: Comes with power cord (recharging) and a T Mobile sim card (you have to call TMobile to activate your prepaid phone line and the sim card). Or you can get your own phone line with another carrier (they will require their own sim card).The phone is more of a backup phone (than my primary phone), but it is REALLY easy to use. The speaker is nice and loud, speaker phone is on the middle black button, speed dial, volume control are very easy to use. Yes, the manual/user's guide doesn't really start till page 23, but using the phone for the first time is very intuitive and easy to set up. The Red Phone button on the right gets you back to the main screen. To dial, just punch in the phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx) and press the Green Phone button on the left - very easy!Opening the phone is a bit difficult (for a person with no nails), but otherwise the phone is quite stylish. Outside window: Caller ID, time of day/date (when you press the volume buttons). To \"silence\" the phone, open it, then press the up or down volume buttons to either raise the ring volume or lower it to \"vibrate\" or \"silence all\".Texting/messaging is impossible because it has three letters to a button, so i would not recommend it if you are a texter. The internet is in \"Web2go\" (the globe on the upper right when you hit the \"menu\" button) - also a bit difficult (and incredibly small screen) to use. I does have a camera, but i haven't used it yet.But for a good/strong backup phone for just voice calling, this can be a good little phone. Or for a backup phone for your vehicle etc..its probably 4-5 year old technology, but so is your car's technology, so what the heck! I was originally going to return the little red phone when my \"real phone\" gets delivered (from Amazon), but i'm starting to really like the simplicity of this little phone, so i will keep it as a backup (to my new whizz-bang smartphone, which this is NOT). Haven't had one problem with reception anywhere, and the antenae seems very strong in all kinds of scenarios (urban, suburban, airport, roadside etc).This is a T MOBILE phone only. It will not work on any other network.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "MY Phone", "Author": "Wendy V Brejot", "ReviewID": "R50K6OQZHNM7S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a copy of my review for the regular version.Some people on other sites said that they didn't like it because you need a USB cable to download/upload photos to/from thier computers.Well not a problem for me. The only 1 photo I have on my phone is of my cat. I use it as my wallpaper. I got this phone to make/recieve calls. Not to take pics.I just got this phone yesterday 10-16-2011. So far so goood.The owner's manual leaves something to be desired. It dosen't state how long to charge the battery. (I went online to find out.)I was able to set up my account,voice mail and other stuff with ease.The speakers and mike sound clear. The screan is easy to see and clean. I also like that it has Caller ID on the top flap so you can see who's calling before you answer.You also get a choice of plans. Pay as you go or one of T-Mobile's monthly subscriptions. Right now I chose pay as you go. I also have the choce to upgrade to another plan later if I want to. That's great.PS For all you cell phone charm addicts. YES this has a little loop for attaching charms.-----------------------------------Update March 3,2013I had this phone for  about 2 years. I lost it recently and had to replace it with an AT&T; Go phone.I had great coverage while I had but there was one thing that annoyed me. Texting on this thing was BAD.

I will follow up this review if anything changes.To date, it is my favorite basic phone to recommend and use.  I have not had any issues at all with dropped calls as another reviewer mentioned. Sounds to me they received a defective one.Here are the Pros that I have found with zero cons:The battery life for me has been excellent.Extremely user friendlyVery easy for those that are non-tech.Large keypad.Clarity on both ends of callslarge keypad.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dreadful, awful phone", "Author": "DallasWriter \"DallasWriter\"", "ReviewID": "R2UUAEOCVUXWUY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a month, and have hated it for almost all of that time.  I got it because I'm not ready to spend tons of money on a smartphone. So, yes, I get that it's basic. But this is easily the worst phone I've had in all my years of using cell phones, and it was a waste of money.- The text user interface is insane. On other similar phones, when you type a combination of letters using the T9 dictionary, it offers you the most common word. If that isn't what you're looking for, in other phones you can use the arrow keys to scroll through alternative words. Not this phone. You have to backspace over the wrong word, use a MENU to change to the alpha mode, then type in the word you want, then change back to the T9 mode.- It routinely skips telling you that you have messages. If you're getting a cell phone to actually know when you have text messages or voicemail, you might want to keep looking.- The wakeup alarm function also works erratically (at best). Cross your fingers that it doesn't decide not to work on the day of your big job interview.- It drops calls -- often.- A minor annoyance: When you turn up the volume, it rings to demonstrate the corresponding volume. The ringer during this function has to be the most irritating ring available; and I don't think any of my Samsung phones (the kind I've mostly had in the past) rang loudly when I turned up the volume.Just an awful phone.(I really wish people would use a product for more than a day before giving the product a great review. The point of reviews is to help others make informed decisions, and you aren't informed after one day of use. I wish someone had warned me about this phone.)", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another Of Many, None Are Great.", "Author": "An Ikearat's Brain \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R1U2WNRUSC7HYA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an old phone, no longer in production. This review is more of a rant than a useful review as I'm sure the number of people considering this phone is extremely limited. Read-on if you are looking for the details I seem to care about.The vendor, UniqueBuys did a great job, delivering exactly what they offered and ahead of schedule.I have been ordering inexpensive little phones all Summer trying to find one that has fewer issues than the others.The LG GS170 (T-Mobile branded) scores about even with the other phones I have.So far, the best one has been the Samsung SGH-A107 (not as many features, but well designed and with good software).The good:It's about the right size.It has enough features to entertain you as well as make it through the day.It's built solid enough to be a daily-use phone.It looks nice (with exception to the composition of the case coating).It uses a \"standard\" USB connector for recharging. (some data services are available through this connection, you have to use Bluetooth for file and picture transfer. There is no iSync of addresses of calendar information).The bad:- It is slow, the software is asking too much from the little processor, result is the menus are slow and there's some lag between the press of a key and a result.- If you use your own Wallpaper image you are penalized by having to wait up to two seconds for the soft-keys on the screen to appear after opening the flip. (Menu & Options)- The display power management has been co-opted to serve the vendor and not the customer. Power is wasted displaying useless stuff on the external display while you use the phone for a call. (you are a walking billboard for LG)- The software is not logically ordered. It takes several key presses to reach commonly used features and stuff you will have little use for has been \"pushed forward\" by T-Mobile in an attempt to get you to use services. (this is common of \"branded\" phones, so you get what you pay for in this respect) Even with special keys for Messages and the camera, there are still hoops to jump through where other implementations (other phones) are better at serving the features than on this phone.- A press of the side key(s) to activate the external display is buffered and processed after the display lights. Result is, the Date is displayed a fraction of a second after the display becomes active requiring a second key press to return showing the Time. The Time does show after a delay in which you must stare at the phone or miss the Time readout before the display goes dark again.- The 4-way pad and center button are flat and feature no tactile clues. You can not feel the center button and none of it is back lighted. In low-light locations, it is very hard to use features involving the 4-way and center button.- The casing, while strong is noisy. Handling the phone produces crackling sounds that your friends will complain about while you are on a call. The speaker-phone feature might have been an afterthought addressing this problem.The Ugly:- The phone is coated in a rubber-like substance that attracts dirt and pocket fluff like a magnet. You can not simply wipe the phone down with a cloth as the surface clings to cloth and pulls additional debris from the cloth adding to the mess. The only way I have found to clean the phone is to wipe it with a damp lint-free camera lens cloth and then air-dry it on the counter top. Most other plastic cell phones can be cleaned simply by wiping with your t-shirt. Also, in my experience this kind of coating will decompose into a sticky mess after a year or so of handling. Ever touch a Ryobi cordless drill? It's like that.- The file system is \"broken\" in that should you install a file with an extension the phone does not recognize, the only way to delete the file is a Master Reset (Master Reset access code is 0000 <that's four zeros> I had to search this so here it is for you to use). You can not even delete the file through Bluetooth, the delete Bluetooth message returns a bad command error message. Be careful, you can fill-up the phone's memory with crap and have to do a Master Reset to clear it all out.- As with most of these phones, the camera is only slightly better than simply drawing a picture of what you see for yourself.Pictures taken with the phone are not the same aspect ratio or file size as images to be used for Wallpaper so all your pictures will have a white border in them if you try to use them as Wallpaper. Loading an image through Bluetooth works, but you -must- be careful or you end-up with an incorrect file size or a bad file extension that the phone does not recognize. Hello Master Reset :)I have returned to using my Samsung A107, this LG T-Mobile branded phone is not \"good enough\" to take-up any more of my time.p.s. People have asked my why I don't use an iPhone, \"you can afford it, hell you buy all those little crap phones!\"The reasons are many and some trivial but the bottom line is, I don't want a cell phone draining my time with trivial pursuits. I have no need of games on a tiny screen and I can remember 99% of the phone numbers and other information I need through the day.What I want is analogous to a pocket pay phone. I want to be able to make/receive a call and occasionally send/receive a text message. What's so hard about that? It seems to me cell phone manufacturers fail at the core of their calling.Thanks for reading, I feel better now :)", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this thing!", "Author": "Daren", "ReviewID": "R3S5QMY6KGWS4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Charming, simple, and forward.

I grabbed this one at Walmart. I wish I never had. Here are the things I don't like about it...1) The exterior screen is tinted. When in daylight or very well lit rooms, you cannot see who is calling when a call comes in.2) The idiot who designed this thing placed the \"Off\" button right above the #3 button. Therefore, while on a call with an automated system, it is very easy to press OFF instead of #3 (if prompted to do so). This, obviously, ends your call. I have had this happen numerous times!!!! Sometimes after being on hold for what seemed like forever! How annoying! This same problem also occurs if/when texting.

I always carried a charger with me with all of my previous Nokia phones. I have actually gotten a full 2 days out of this thing.

The only 1 photo I have on my phone is of my cat. I use it as my wallpaper. I got this phone to make/recieve calls. Not to take pics.I just got this phone yesterday 10-16-2011. So far so goood.The owner's manual leaves something to be desired. It dosen't state how long to charge the battery. (I went online to find out.)I was able to set up my account,voice mail and other stuff with ease.The speakers and mike sound clear. The screan is easy to see and clean. I also like that it has Caller ID on the top flap so you can see who's calling before you answer.You also get a choice of plans. Pay as you go or one of T-Mobile's monthly subscriptions. Right now I chose pay as you go. I also have the choce to upgrade to another plan later if I want to. That's great.PS For all you cell phone charm addicts. YES this has a little loop for attaching charms.-----------------------------------Update March 3,2013I had this phone for  about 2 years. I lost it recently and had to replace it with an AT&T; Go phone.I had great coverage while I had it but there was one thing that annoyed me. Texting on this thing was BAD. I had to keep pressing the keys over and over just get a particular letter.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "does anybody speak english at t-mobile", "Author": "REPTAA \"REPTAA\"", "ReviewID": "R1WQJ93YWJ4L2M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "very hard to activate,only a few people at t-mobile speak english...the ones that speak english,like to pass you off to a computer... ever talk to a computer,please repeat sir etc. and etc...", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": "Always free shipping within the USA", "Name": "T-Mobile Prepaid LG GS170 No-Contract Mobile Phone Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-z590TDCL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006FJCLI4"}}
