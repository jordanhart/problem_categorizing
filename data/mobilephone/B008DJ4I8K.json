{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone but horrible battery life [UPDATE]", "Author": "hotchas \"hotchas\"", "ReviewID": "R2QU10ARM3VRQT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great no-frills phone.  It is not a good phone for texting because it takes too many steps to insert letters.  It does have 3G ability, so connection is quite good with AT&T;, although Verizon phones get better connections.  The MAIN problem with the Pantech phone [I have had 2 models thus far] is the HORRIBLE battery life.  If I don't use the phone at all, it loses a full charge after 1 and a half days.  If I DO use the phone a few times, then the phone dies the next day.  So, make sure you take your charger with you.UPDATE on battery: I have tried a new battery and still only get poor battery life, but others I talk to do not.  I think the issue is that because I live so far from any towers, the phone constantly seeks a signal.  Those I have asked live in the city.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent For the Flip-phone User", "Author": "Barbara S Greene", "ReviewID": "R3CJY5WXIWUX2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Broke my previous Pantech Breeze, tried another model that just couldn't cut it, was horrified at the replacement cost quoted at the phone store,  and ordered this phone to return to the familiar.

The phone kept freezing up on me and I was not able to dial or receive phone calls.  I had to continually take out the battery and put it back in to get it unfrozen. The texting was not like my pantech. If I received a text and went to answer it my answer appeared in a different location. Therefore the questions and answers were not near each other.
