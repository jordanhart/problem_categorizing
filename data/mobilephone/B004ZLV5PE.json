{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Never buying a phone online again", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R3TUWMO5JWO6AN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost \"Like New\". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriend's Christmas.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "iphone 4 16 gig", "Author": "Jax", "ReviewID": "R1HHUD8MU09CCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have one and my son had to have one.

When I sent an email through Amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company, I received a brief response from their team: \"Have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchange?\".Considering my options, I decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem.  A couple of seconds after opening the case, he told me that the phone was not a new one, but refurbished.  At a glance, he could see clear evidence of water damage, and it was missing all kinds of screws, fasteners..etc.I was horrified to learn this, and deeply troubled that iDeal Expert considers this acceptable practice - particularly given their supposed \"Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee: We stand behind the quality of our products with an iron-clad 100% guarantee. We are in the business of building long-term relationships with our customers, and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us.  We offer an exclusive EZ NO-HASSLE RETURN POLICY.  If for any reason you are not satisfied, simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refund.\"In my opinion, iDeal Expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice. I fail to see how such behaviour can lead to \"long-term relationships\", nor to fully-satisfied customers.If my experience is anything to go by, my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is \"BUYERS BEWARE!\".UPDATE: shortly after my posting, I received an email from the iDeal Expert team as follows: \"This was bought in August, we are now in OCTOBER and cannot accept a return this is past 60 days and we will not accept a return.\" I responded to correct their error - reminding them that I had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame, and had even received their acknowledgement of that email.I remain deeply concerned that iDeal Xpert has not only sold defective goods, but then chose to use their 60-time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem. I still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the company.UPDATE #2: today, the screen of my iPhone 4 went blank...without any warning, nor any good reason.

Last May, after becoming a bit more financial stable, I made my first smart phone purchase and bought an iPhone 4.I am relatively new to cell phones in general (I\u2019ve only owned a cell phone for five years), so purchasing a smart phone was a big deal for me. Although I know the benefits that come from owning a smart phone, I wasn\u2019t sure at the time if I was making the right purchase. I like the physical feel of a QWERTY keyboard. I don\u2019t download a ton of data. Compared to most of my peers, I don\u2019t even text that much. Despite this, I have been pleased with my iPhone 4.The basic apps that come with the phone are easy to use. Software updates can be set to download automatically or manually.Security is a major concern and you can change the settings to make your phone secure or as open as you would like.I hardly ever downloaded anything with my old phone (it wasn\u2019t a smart phone anyway), but I have noticed a huge advantage in the speed of whenever I do download something on my iPhone 4.I love the camera functions of the phone. I had a camera on my old phone, but the difference in pixels is extraordinary. Not only that, but I can take extended videos, too.Physically, the phone is of a design that is pleasing to the eye and the phone is extremely lightweight. With that said, I highly recommend getting some sort of real protection for the phone (such as an Otterbox or Lifeproof) because although this is a great phone, it is not at all durable and the glass can easily crack or completely break if it\u2019s dropped on a hard surface.My only major complaint about the iPhone 4 (and all Apple products in general) is that it does not include an operating manual. Sure it comes with a little pamphlet about how to turn the phone on and off and what buttons to use, but that\u2019s not a manual. That\u2019s a mini-instruction guide and nothing more; it has no real knowledge of how to actually use your phone, for instance, it doesn\u2019t tell you how to download apps, how to open the apps already included, what apps are included, etc. I have never understood the concept of selling an electronic device, but not including a manual about how to operate it. Apple is terrible with this (as is Adobe in the world of software-they never include manuals for anything either). You do a major disservice to your customers when you don\u2019t include a manual. As much as I have liked the few Apple products I have owned, they will always be a step below of what they could be for not having a manual.In general, I am very pleased with the iPhone 4. It\u2019s been a good cell phone for me so far and if you can deal with not having a manual, I recommend it for someone looking to purchase a smart phone for the first time.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "leonard  field", "ReviewID": "RYL01VYMJ8ON9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPhone 4 was everything I thought it would be and more.

I love this phone even to today and its one of the best purchases I have ever made (I don't buy expensive things like this often at all but this has been worth every penny).  I cant imagine my life without an iphone, it makes my life so much easier to be able to check emails on the run and do all sorts of things.  Many other phones done all these things now as well, and if I were looking for a new phone today I would honestly go for the 5s as it is significantly better (although significantly more expensive as well). Whatever you choose to do be sure to get a reliable case on the phone ASAP to protect your investment.  These phones can be fragile but putting an otter box defender on it will keep your investment safe for years to come (or go for a waterproof option if that is something that may threaten your phone such as you work at a pool in the summers or any situation with high risk for potential water damage).  If you protect it, you wont regret getting it.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "First iPhone is a great iPhone.", "Author": "romevi", "ReviewID": "R3QI3DCJO6O670", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPhone 4 was my maiden voyage into the world of touchscreen phones. Prior to that, I had a Palm Centro, and before that I had been a fan of Motorola's Razr phones (which are still some of my favorite). I was a fan of Palm's organizational apps, and the keyboard was great, but holy moly was it behind three or five years in terms of Internet compatibility. Still, the organization and tactile feel prevented me from switching over to an iPhone or Droid, not to mention the high cost of obtaining a data plan, though I had been following Apple's technological progress since the early 2000s.Nevertheless, once the iPhone 4 was revealed, and some final convincing from a relative, I made the switch, and I, like millions of consumer, can gladly say I never will look back.(Though I quickly will mention that I still miss the tactile feel of physical keyboards.)Because I have made it a habit to be technologically and gadget savvy, I already knew how to navigate through an iPhone, and had a long list of apps I wanted to download. Since I didn't own any of the phones before, I can't compare them hardware-wise, but software-wise we all can agree that Apple takes a few steps forward, but makes a couple bumps along the way.The first big feature to grace the iOS upgrade for me was the Notifications. I realize that many had been clamoring for this, and it was a welcome addition when it was released, but over time it has become quite cumbersome to manage with the different security settings Apple has included.I still use the iPhone 4 to this day, though mostly as a workout companion. It has a noticeable weight compared to my iPhone 5, yet I actually prefer it as it feels sturdier in my palm. And since I'm used to the iPhone 5 now, the iPhone 4 seems to perform a lot slower than before, especially with iOS 7, and the battery drains faster now, but it still manages to load all the apps designed for iOS 7. Not bad for a three-year-old phone.While I certainly like the iPhone 5 and its ability to store an extra line of apps, I prefer the squatter iPhone 4 for its size. It's easier in the hand, and it feels more portable as it takes up less room in my pocket.iPhones are nice to have, but I'm seriously considering a Droid next. Apple's products just aren't up to some of the competitors' capabilities in terms of gaming and customization. I love video games, and the iPhone has some amazing software, but their limitations only serve as a downgrade.Still, for the general public, I'd say Apple is the way to go.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone good as new so far", "Author": "tyler george", "ReviewID": "R3G9FYIVMDIRVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought i was taking a risk on buying this phone.

The most useful piece of equipment I've ever owned in terms of everyday usage.I had the iPhone 4 but not the 4s.  It is an extremely well made phone and would rate 5 stars except for the fact that the iPhone 5 is dramatically better in every respect but one.The actual phone reception (on ATT anyway) is much better on the 5 - it's LTE in many parts of the country and that's better than ATTs usual crap network.The 5 is significantly thinner and lighter than the 4 (not that the 4 is exactly heavy.)  It has a greater storage capacity (64GB) which means you can carry more stuff with you.  The screen is slightly larger without making it more difficult to carry - an extra row of applications.  A small but not insignificant advantage - especially for web browsing.But what really makes it better is the chip speed and processing power.  Browsing on line on the iPhone 4 is slow and frustrating.  But on the iPhone 5 it's very quick and responsive - a dramatic improvement that makes the phone and many apps much more useful.The new ear buds are okay but I'm not sure I like them as much as the old ones.  So sometimes I use the old ones.The new cable is much smaller and more convenient except that I have all the old ones (one is included).  Oh well, the price of improvement (they needed to change the connector to make it really thin.)The one knock against it is that the headphone jack is on the bottom instead of the top.  I hate that even though I've kind of gotten used to it at this point.  I think that was a mistake.So net net - this is is actually a great phone and you can get it for almost nothing.  But if you've got the $199 (or $127 at Wal-Mart) for the iPhone 5, I'd spring for it.  Given how much you'll use it, it will cost you about a 25\u00a2 a day for the best.The only problem is that Amazon as of this writing seems not to be selling it.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Raffaele", "ReviewID": "R19H8WEM9WWEB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never had an iPhone so this was a huge deal for me, I took the risk to get a used one and I do not regret it, the seller gave me the phone with 4 more cables besides the original, original box with documentation, earpods, wall charger and even a black case.
