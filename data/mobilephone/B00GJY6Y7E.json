If you go to ZTE-USA you find this phone has a 1.4 Dual Core processor and a very decent resolution of 480 x 800. It even has 4G, but not LTE 4G.  This is a very nice and snappy phone that might be worth more than 99.00. Go Phone users can try this phone with confidence.  The only downside so far is that no one has yet to make any cases or screen protectors, likely because it's brand new.  In getting to appreciate this phone, I am of the learned impression that Chinese made tech gear can be really well made at a lower price and that shouldn't come as a surprise.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Android phone but not perfect.", "Author": "Nik \"G.

Has a 1.4 Dual Core processor  (no lagging or freeze yet) and a decent resolution screen of 480 x 800. Has a 5.0 MP back camera but the pictures in low light are not so good even using the flash. In outdoor the pictures are ok after some adjustments in brightness and exposure. You can change, WB, ISO, Metering in the camera and also include some effects that you can use. It doesn't came with a front camera (sorry girls, no self portraits). Can record 720P video with audio (not impressed). Also took pictures during recording video. It is a 4G and not LTE 4G technology. I get it to replace my Samsung Galaxy S3. I have a 2 year contract and the warranty expire 2 month ago meanwhile so I have 2 choices: (Contact the Insurance and pay double the price of the Z740 Radiant or buy a gophone).I only move my existing microsim from my S3 and have a new phone. Good battery duration. Its has WIFI capability and that is perfect for me and not have to use all my data of my contract plan. I installed a 16GB micro SD and works fine for increase the storage capacity (Only has an internal memory storage of 2GB) so be careful installing to much programs or games from Google.If you want a no contract phone for the price really you will enjoy it. If you looking to get excellent pictures, this its not the phone for you. No cases, extra battery or screen protectors are available yet.**UPDATE** (1/16/2014)Finally I found a replacement battery on Ebay and in Amazon. Its the same for the Avid 4G N9120 or Force N9100.**UPDATE** (3/10/2014)Amazon start to bring covers to the z740.

I can listen to music and play the same game (Dr. Mario) I can conduct a call and use the browser 2) Here the problems though  a) The browser must be the included Internet Explorer as Google Chrome is resource heavy to use on this phone.  b) Shop Kick causes a bunch of problems, it will work somewhat okay if you're not doing anything else. If you are listening to music (file or streaming) and start scanning items to get kicks (points) the audio will stop playing after a few minutes. After that, it might cause Shop Kick to crash or the \"app.google.com\" to stop working. That requires a hard reboot of the phone. I will try Fast Reboot to see if that will solve the problem of during hard boot to get the phone back functionally properly. Other than that issue (I have made $155 worth of gift cards with Shop Kick so its function is important!) the phone works as advertised. As reported in other reviews the camera really isn't that good. Even with flash it takes terrible low light pictures. If you're going to take any indoor pictures with this, I highly recommend a high kelvin natural sunlight bulb or small LED light to make up for the poor quality or just take pictures in bridge sunlight only. I haven't tried video but it suffers from the same problems. The better the lighting the better the video will look. I have broken my LG Optimus G, so much for Gorilla Glass, so I was forced to find a cheap substitute until I can get it fixed. I will likely get it fixed because of the Shopkick problems (along with Beyond Podcast when multi-tasking) and this ZTE phone is just slower and has less RAM available. My options are to get the G fix ($160) or sell the Radiant + $160 and get a Moto G 4G LTE when its launched or get the One+1 when its finally released.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great first SMART PHONE + No Contract Go Phone", "Author": "Kitty007", "ReviewID": "RY8742Y2JP1YK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I enjoy my AT&T; Radiant (my first SMART PHONE) because I am a confident user!!!

Insert a microSD card, plus clean the protective lens prior to using the camera; with steady hands, the 5 MP photos are acceptable to this 'non-demanding' shutter bug (When I am in a serious photo-mood, I'll use a Canon EOS.). The 'Go Phone' plan is economical, & meets my current need. Use pre-loaded 'News & Weather' app with WiFi for limited 'current news' -- no data package required. Will add a data package later if necessary. Both 'Calender' & 'Notepad' have helped in getting things organized. This 4\" screen Radiant is capable and a steady performer.
