{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Top Choice Smartphone!", "Author": "K.Waggner", "ReviewID": "R2VY3JGCWZOISQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good: The Samsung Galaxy S4 has Android 4.2.2, a fantastic camera, a powerful quad-core processor, and software solutions for just about every scenario; including working as a TV/DVR remote. It's comfortable in your hand and has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot. It also has a little larger screen than it's predecessor.The Bad: Its screen is a bit dimmer than competitors' but not too much. You may not even notice it. I found the Galaxy S4's power button turned on at undesirable times. If you were a critic of the GS3's plastic construction, you'll be disappointed with this one as well. Not a game changer for me though.I think it offers a little more give if you drop it. A long list of software features could overwhelm and confuse the inexperienced user.The Ugly: Not a thing ugly about this phone!The bottom line: Its laundry list of features require time and effort to truly master, but the Galaxy S4 is the top choice for anyone looking for a big-screen, do-everything smartphone. Lastly, just in case you're wondering, an S Pen won't work on the GS4 due to the lack of Wacom digitizer, but the C-Pen and other capacitive styli should function perfectly fine.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GVHZB8M"}}
