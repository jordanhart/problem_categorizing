It took a while to find an unlocked GSM tough smart phone that meet my requirements. Like any smart phone you will need to charge it daily if you enable WiFi/GPS/Data roaming. With just the phone enabled it will stay up for 10 days. I went with a tough phone after seeing my grand kids destroy their parents I-phones.After I received the phone I took it on a 5 day Elk hunt to New Mexico, it was in my pocket and worked at -15F. I have not dropped it on the ground nor have I put in the water to see if it meets the IP-67 standards. I have put it on the boat console in light rain and banged thru chop with no problems.This phone is not for everyone it is not sleek but it does what it is supposed to do with minimal upkeep", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE", "Author": "Barry", "ReviewID": "R2UG5MNQ6ANY71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS THE BEST AND TOUGHEST PHONE I HAVE FOUND!
