It came within a few days of order placement. The item came as described. We were delighted that these phones are still available because the newer phone that we were using didn't meet our needs. We had a question about the product when it arrived. We e-mailed the company and they responded immediately; after a few e-mails, the question was settled. I would definitely buy from this company again as they are efficient and trustworthy. LG VX8300 for Verizon Wireless in Black - No Contract Required If you do order the phone, you will probably have to call Verizon to transfer your number to it, as it didn't go through as Verizon on-line directs. The customer service at Verizon was surprised that we had an \"old\" phone! Batteries for this should be ordered on line, which this company sells. Verizon charges a crazy amount of money for a battery ( I had to emergency buy one during Sandy) that is under $10.00 on-line.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "cheech", "ReviewID": "RD7QL80BTV6FP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is perfect for loud work places.this phone is very durable, light weight, easy to use & clear display. loud & has a large veriaty of ring tones.wish they still make them like this phone.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "jimmck", "ReviewID": "R1VM4A77MD7YJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a replacement phone and I love it.  I purchased the original more than seven years ago and gave it to my son.  I don't need all the gadgetry of smartphones today and this phone works just fine for all my needs.  I love the flip capability.  It has always delivered clear sound and the reception has always been great.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE this phone!", "Author": "Dixie", "ReviewID": "R8S6I9B71OS7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like having a basic flip phone. I want to be able to text occasionally, take pictures if I forgot my camera, and get clear calls. This phone fits the bill. I have had mine for a few years. I got an upgrade to another basic model and within a week switched back to this one. I am so excited to see that I can still get this phone if mine ever dies. I tell people that I will switch from this phone when it is certified dead. It has never butt-dialed anyone, it's easy to adjust the settings, takes fairly decent pictures and holds one of those mini-data cards. Best of all, I am not required to have a data plan with this phone (very rare these days!).I really can't say enough good about this phone!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sometimes you just need a good basic phone!!", "Author": "F.

I'm so happy I found this solid phone! The LG VX8300 has great battery life, good quality sound and a durable build.

Let's face it -- there is a generational difference here.  So this is going to bought by a higher percent of older persons than young.  (Of course, there will be many, many exceptions.)Anyway, from my older person's perspective this phone is great in many respects.The clamshell: I don't change settings or call several people by carrying it my pocket.  Great.But I can still turn off the ring -- why don't they change it?Rugged construction and I hope LG durability.  Super Great.And I give up a bunch of stuff that I don't want, won't use, and that can cost money every month anyway --  great.The buttons are BIG.  I don't have to carefully stick the tippy-top of my little finger in there to dial a number or access menu items.  Fantastic.But don't they know a few of us with imperfect eyesight (not iSight) will be using it. Why do they make the date and time so small?So the virtues of a clam shell LG -- but somebody went to sleep on a couple of aspects.  Maybe next model.  I'd be happy to be a beta tester.
