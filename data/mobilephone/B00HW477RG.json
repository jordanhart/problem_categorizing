Through many google searches, came across the Blu Products phones. After researching their existing product lines as well as the new lines about to launch, I concluded that the Life Play X was the device for me, and was able to order one as soon as they became available. I really like the fact that they are \"unlocked\", so I can use an MVNO and get better pricing/support than from T. Specs-wise, it falls into a happy medium between the S3 and S4.Pros: Unlocked. Comes with a case/cover that doesn't add much bulk to it, but will help protect it from drops. Both front and back cameras work well. Plenty of onboard storage with 16G flash. Micro-SD card slot for more storage. Good processor, device is very responsive. Bright, clear screen. Passes the feel test - does not feel cheap, nice and solid. Wifi works with no issues. GPS worked well with the little testing I did.Cons: My wife liked it so well, she claimed the first one I got, so I had to order and wait for a second one to be shipped. The speaker and headphone volumes could be a little louder, but I am getting older and probably losing a little hearing, so they're really not bad. Would be nice if it had 2GB of memory instead of 1GB, but still plenty to get by. No 4G LTE support, but 3G HSPA+ is going to be around for quite awhile, so enough cell data speed for anything I need to do.As far as battery life, this is my first smartphone, so don't have a frame of reference. I've also been playing with it a lot, trying apps, etc. It easily gets through one day with what I'm doing with a lot to spare, though, so it's good enough for me.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "life play x, a lot more than i expected", "Author": "aaron", "ReviewID": "R12KI69AKWGA18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "firstly the shipping took a while, for some reason amazon took a long to time to accept payment, only when i contacted them to complain they upgraded me to free one day shipping. other than that its all good.pors: the display is great, i cant tell the difference between this and the S3 honestly, also the rear camera is good, not as good as an iphone or lumia ofc but for the price it is excellent, apps run without lag and screens scroll smooth. the dual sim configuration works great, you get to choose which sim for data, messages, voice calls and video calls. the battery life is fine, i easily get through a day with lots more to go. the stock browser is fast on wificons: there is only 9.8GB available instead of the 16GB advertised. there is no led indicator so u always have to unlock the phone to check for updates. the front camera is slow and a bit blurry.other than the few cons listed above, i would give it 5 stars but this is only based on 2 days of use, so il update after a month or so", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent phone", "Author": "Brigham Ray", "ReviewID": "RDF7R6YHYCDJU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone works great and comes with headphones and a case which  give it 4 stars. It needs better software stability for 5 stars. As far as software issues go, the phone will randomly power on and off (which drains a signifigant amount of battery after a few days) and sometimes the touch screen will become erratic. Another bug, something that really bugs me, is that the input method will change back to the 4.2 keyboard after powering it back on, even if I specifically change the input method to something else. I also wish the phone would become android 4.4 already so these annoying bugs could be fixed!", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best phone", "Author": "Sergio Leon", "ReviewID": "R1RKR4SQK12O4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Blu Life Play and was totally the best around, then i saw this upgraded version and decided to upgrade and sold the old one.

Compared with my last one (Studio 5.3 S), the Life Play X has more internal memory (16GB vs 4GB) and better (720 x 1280) screen resolution, yet a smaller/lighter form factor.  Despite having only an 1800 mAh battery, battery life is good assuming light to moderate use.  This Life Play X L102A model is tailored to AT&T; GSM in the USA covering the HSDPA 850/1900MHz bands.  Setup of this phone was really easy, just popped in my work and personal SIMs (and added WiFi password for home), and was off and running with cellular data and everything (whereas I had to spend a fair amount of time to research/configure mobile network settings on the old BLU, which was a bit of a hassle).This is probably one of the best (if not the best) dual-SIM smartphones for use with AT&T; in the USA.  There may be better dual-SIM phones out there, but not at this price point at this time (March 2014).  I'm sure BLU will come out with something even better next year, but for now this phone is the bomb.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Value For Money", "Author": "Darius F.

Only negative is the headset  issue; see my request to BLU support below:BLU:I have a question about headsets. I tried a few others apart from the original one that came with my device but they all have poor audio quality/volume. I did some research and found that only a certain type works on this device. Can you give a technical spec for the type of compatible headset for this device. The original earbud that came is OK but its difficult for my ear and becomes sweaty and slips off easily (doesn't fit well). I would prefer to get the type that rests inside the outer ear and not sticks into it.RegardsSyed Ali", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "AshleyBD", "ReviewID": "R12OG2DUBKGD0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this phone!

Whenever i connect it with my speaker for the shower it freezes right in the middle of the song and pauses it for whatever reason and its so annoying. Its only happening with pandora, im not sure about the other services. Also if you have a tmobile sim in it for whatever whack job reason its really acts like its retarded driving you all over the place. im not sure if its the network or the phone but it doesnt play nice with tmobile and its gps unit. i have not tried att yet but they are expensive This is why i changed it from 4 to 3 stars overall its a good phone for its priceUPDATE!!!!!4/17/2014Ok the major problems are now the earphones quality when you use other earphones because its bad and still the extremely horrible part of this phone is that the gps software is load of crap and not good when navigating.
