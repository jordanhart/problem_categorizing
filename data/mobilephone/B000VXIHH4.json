It is the best phone i have ever owned and it never gives me problems. It is extremely durable as i have a tendency of throwing my phone when angry and it still works fine.(just a few scratches). Keyboard is great and the internet browser is superb. Many apps are available if you look online and includes Microsoft Word which is convenient. Only complaint would be low camera resolution in the dark due to no flash.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Happy so far", "Author": "A. Hunter \"A.

The Qwerty keyboard is something to get used to but when you do its great. There are plenty of good security measures to use on this phone and I don't feel the least bit limited.
