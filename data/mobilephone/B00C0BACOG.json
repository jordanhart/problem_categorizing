NO GOOD!....", "Author": "Andrea R.", "ReviewID": "R3IYL38W3592YM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well I ordered this phone awhile ago.... it took forever to get here, which was to be expected cause it came from China. Then I finally get it, and the size was good,color was good BUT!... sound quality was really awful!.... and not to mention it kept dropping calls!... I would not recommend anyone get this, but it's up to you if you do... and besides whose to say, maybe it was just the one I received. Well, after being disappointed with this item, I immediately sent this item back to seller. Now it's been one week or so,since this seller had this item back in their possession... and I was told I would get my money back.... and STILL HAVE NOT GOT IT!!.... they also said it had to be tested, before I could get my money back.... and still.... nothing. I returned this item right after receiving it, and now I feel as if I was played, on my refund. To top it off, whenever I contacted this particular seller, he responded back rather quickly.... But, now since I am requesting my money back from a defective item that was sent to me.... suddenly, he does NOT have the time to respond back to me, when I asked about the status of my refund. THIS SELLER IS A CROOK!.... EVERYTHING IS ALL GOOD UNTIL A PERSON NEED THEIR MONEY BACK!... DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!... BUT KNOW IF YOU DO, IT WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK!...
