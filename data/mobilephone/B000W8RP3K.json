Lewison", "ReviewID": "R1M0KQASIELRQR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "1st one wouldn't activate on ATT network.  Seller was great and send out a replacement.  Replacement woudn't activate either.  Spent an hour on chat with ATT and got it to activate.  Worked for about 2 hour and then lost connection.  Connection would come and go for a couple hours, usually came back after a reboot or when connected to computer via USB.  Then would disconnect when unplugged or after a call was made.  Totally unusable.  Seller again offered to send a replacement but by that time the phone was smashed into many small pieces.  Too bad, I really like the old school RAZR form and function, but I guess I'll be forced into using new technology.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Gayle Ledyard", "ReviewID": "RO2GGBT7R3IDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift for my husband who does not want to text, but simply receive and make calls.

Not big on touch screens. And the Razr is just one of the coolest designed flip phones. I had to have it. The phone came on time and was well package. The reason I gave it a 2 was because of these reasons. The side buttons for volume and voice record are very loose. Almost feels like they are going to come off. The cover over the front screen on the outside was coming unglued. The battery cover had dents in it already. And the keys are also coming unglued. Gluing the cover and keys back is not a big issue. But this phone was supposed to be brand new. It was more in used condition. The biggest problem right now is the screen will go black and not come back on. I've only have used this phone for a total of 3 weeks. I have to take out the battery and restart it all over again. And the screen doesn't always come back on. Takes a few tries. It was working good until this. If it didn't have all these issues I would have gave it a 5 star rating. So if you want one of these phones be careful when you buy them. Your taking a risk. You may or may not get a new one.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Motorola RAZR V3", "Author": "Philip M.
