{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not for the meek. Android tinkerers may like it.", "Author": "Raven A. Wind", "ReviewID": "R168UR6D1JESD2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't mean that headline to sound negative, but let's be serious here: There's a reason this phone is so inexpensive. It is an earlier-model Android phone that suffers from the dreaded \"Low Internal ROM memory\" problem so common in these lower-end phones. What that means is that the average user is going to be pretty ticked off when they get this phone and find that they're getting the low memory warning on Day One, after all the Google Services (including the Play Store) update themselves, and you put your contacts and information on the phone. Sure, you can move some apps to the \"Internal Memory\" (NOT the SD card, it turns out; The phone has 1GB for apps in a separate partition, but doesn't offer moving to SD card as a default choice), but that won't solve the loss of ROM.Let's break this down a bit. This phone has four types of memory in it:1. RAM - This is the operating memory, just like the RAM in a PC, which can be cleared easily enough by shutting down apps. No problems here thanks to the way Android does things.2. \"System Memory\" - This is where the main OS (plus updates) and system files are stores. When you download from the Play Store, this is where the apps will initially be downloaded to, directly. When you get the phone and all the main updates occur (Play Store, Google Services, Google Maps, Google+, Gmail, Mail, Calendar, and other \"essential\" system apps) you will find the phone has less than 40MB left in the System ROM. Downloaded Apps will fill this fast. Moving them to the next memory category below will temporarily solve this problem, but you will still find your storage shrinking as you receive texts and calls, use the web browser, receive emails, and get more updates. In short: This is a total pain in the butt and it can only be fixed if you root the phone.3. \"Internal Memory\" -  This is the built-in 1GB of storage space for Apps. When you choose to move apps from the System Memory, they are moved here. The system actually doesn't offer to move apps to the SD card, but to this space instead. So realistically, without rooting or other management apps, this phone can handle 1GB of apps. Some other personal info can be stored here, too, on an app-by-app basis.4. SD Card - You can insert an SD card (I tested a 32GB with success) and use it for additional storage. However, this space will primarily be used for media: Music, books, documents, videos, etc.  Apps don't get moved here by default. You can opt to have various apps store data on SD (Web Browser, Email, etc.) but for the average user, this is not a solution to the full System Memory problem. Moving apps to Internal Memory will help a little, but when that's full you're stuck.The solution I came up with was to root the phone and use Link2SD to Link/Move/Delete various apps on the System Memory. Doing this, I was able to reclaim a little space, but even so, with ALL the non-essential apps linked, moved, or deleted, I still find this phone hovering around having 20MB left in the System Memory. Periodic cache wipes help, but even with this solution in place, this phone chews through System Memory quickly.Bottom Line: Don't consider this phone unless you're not planning on downloading many apps, not a heavy texter, or are comfortable with rooting and tweaking at risk of bricking the thing. I honestly would not recommend this phone to the average user. For Android geeks and people who are comfortable with hacks/cracks/etc. I would say it's worth it at a low price, but don't expect any miracles.As for the TracFone service, I can't complain. The price is low, the data usage is easy to conserve (turn off Data in the notification menu and use it only when needed), and the Triple Minutes helps a whole lot. Due to the way TracFone does text units on their Android phones, I'd say you want to steer clear of them if you're a super-heavy texter, but you can always find alternative apps for texting, too.Considering the memory problems, and the fact that this phone has an older screen that isn't as responsive or bright as newer ones, I'll call this a three-star device. I'd say it's an entry-level phone, but that memory problem makes it a rough ride for newbies. If you're looking for your first Android phone, I'd caution you against choosing this one.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great improvement over my previous cell phone.", "Author": "Laura E. Lindler \"the knitting bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R33JX25YBRU43U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love using this phone. Everything about it has been so easy, from setting up an account with TracFone to downloading and using apps. I hated the cell phone I had prior to this one, a \"free\" phone with two-year contract with AT&T.; My AT&T; phone was costing me $30+/month for voice only (no data, no texting) and the phone was awful. If I didn't hit one of the several buttons on the side, my face would touch the screen, making the phone do things I hadn't intended. This phone solved all of those problems. It has a proximity sensor that manages the touch screen very nicely. For example, when making calls that require me to press a number on the dial-pad during the call, the screen goes black and locks while held next to my face, then becomes active when I hold it away from my face to press the number pad. I know this isn't a big deal for many users, but for me, it was so much better than my previous phone.When I set up my TracFone account, using my home phone, the confirmation did not go through at first. I tried a few times and still couldn't get confirmation, so I called customer service and they quickly got it sorted out and also confirmed that I had gotten triple minutes for the card I had bought.I like that Verizon is the carrier for TracFone here. Verizon's mobile network is much bigger and better and has better call quality than AT&T.;Having read previous reviews, I learned a few things relevant to downloading apps. I have gotten the \"low memory\" warning a few times. I had downloaded a couple of apps and moved them to the SD card. The apps that did not do as expected (either didn't do what I wanted or seemed to act wacky), I uninstalled. I don't keep apps that can't be moved to the card. Facebook was the one that was really eating my memory, even after clearing cache for all apps and moving them to the SD card, so I uninstalled it. Since then, I haven't gotten the \"low memory\" warning, so I think it really does matter what the app does, eg, FB has lots of graphic data to eat up memory.I've downloaded these apps so far: Duolingo, a language app; CVS, an app where I can order my prescriptions from my phone, check my scrip history and tell me when I need to have scrips renewed by my doctor; My Account, a TracFone app; AppMgrIII, to help manage apps; History Eraser, to clear up history, cache, etc. on apps; Ravelry photo, to quickly upload project pics to my Rav account; and Traffic Counter, which keeps up with my minutes, so I don't have to constantly check my TracFone account.All of them work well so far. I have read that apps designed by Google work best but I don't have enough experience using apps by Google vs. other app designers to know if that is true or not. All of the apps I've downloaded so far are free and downloaded from Google Play. I research what I'm looking for on my PC, then download on my mobile.Duolingo is a great app for learning a new language. There are prescription apps for several major drug stores, and I really like that I can quickly order my scrips from my mobile. I tried another app, but it couldn't find my local CVS. App Mgr III is ok, but might not really be necessary. I tend to use the App Manager that comes already installed, but I will work with it a little more before I decide whether to keep it or not.I haven't put any widgets or live wallpapers on my home page, yet, so I can't say if they eat up my memory or suck the battery down. My battery is lasting pretty well so far. I charged it for five hours before use, and the battery has been lasting with the phone on all day. I spent a lot of time using it during setup, downloading and trying out apps. The two previous days, it was down to about 20% by the end of the day and I charged it overnight. Tonight the battery is at about 60%, but I haven't been using it today like I did the past two days.I think it is a good idea to back up contacts on the SD card, though not necessarily essential. While I still had FB on my phone, and was getting the low memory warning, I could not add to my contacts. Again, once I uninstalled FB, I was able to add more contacts. Just for clarity, backing up the contacts doesn't move them, just copies them to the SD card where they can easily be restored to the phone.Overall, I am very happy with this phone so far. The look is sleek, using it is simple and enjoyable and best of all, it will save me a ton of money. I expect my phone bill will now be about $10/month as opposed to the $30 I was paying AT&T;, and I can text, thank goodness!I've only had the phone for a few days and have used only 15 minutes on it, but considering that I averaged less than 5 minutes/month on my AT&T; phone, that is a lot. If I have problems with the phone or find things that I don't like about it, I will update this review.My next purchase is going to be an Ooma Telo, and I can cut out another big chunk of money going to AT&T; every month. My bill for AT&T; will then only be for U-Verse, presently about $15/month, a promotional price for one year. Cutting out my cell phone service and my land-line should save me about $125/month.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect phone for my kids....", "Author": "mark graydon", "ReviewID": "R38QM4LBY2IBLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is the perfect starter smart phone for my kids, not too big and not too bulky...it's fashionable and allows them to feel as if they moved up in the big world of gadgets....the triple minutes is a great deal given their burgeoning texting/calling habits! could not be happier with this purchase!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the color, but most the price!!", "Author": "Cherden", "ReviewID": "RXPXRJ94JGO7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave up my Samsung Galaxay 4 and purchased this from Amazon.It is white, and does just about everything my Samsung does.

HOWEVER - it is not unusable. You just need to be aware of this limitation and avoid this phone if you intend to download many apps. 2-3 apps are fine. Make sure you go to menu > settings > manage applications > downloaded > click your app and see if 'move to internal memory' is available. If it is, do that. It will save your phone (system) memory which is where the apps go. Yes, this phone includes a 4GB memory card but that's basically for music and pictures. The reason why this phone is like this is because it's internal parts are basically based on phones from when apps weren't very large.I have: Gingerbread keyboard, Google Play services (26MB and _cannot_ be moved to internal memory!), Google Play Store, HowardForums, Hulu, Instagram, Netflix, Network Signal Info, TuneIn Radio Pro, and Wordfeud installed with 50MB left. Those are my basic apps and I have moved everything I could to the larger internal memory. You don't want to run your system memory down to 0MB because it's used for text messages and stuff.Overall, if you absolutely cannot afford one of the other TracFone Android phones and know you will need very few apps, this phone will suffice. Otherwise, I would highly recommend something like the Dynamic II though I know it is more expensive. You'll thank me later when you start getting into the smartphone thing and want to be able to download various apps without worrying about running out of space.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "buy LG android", "Author": "christopher Lamothe", "ReviewID": "R1TZZ0MYCJFGYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "now this phone is great the company is good I bought the lg840 was not happy the re in burst me and now I got this Lg android and I'm very happy", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "love this phone! great phone for the $$$", "Author": "monalisa007", "ReviewID": "R27GW5CDYA17ZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone exceeded my expectations.

Important item to note:  your tracfone minutes from a non-smart phone will not roll-over to this phone.  It seems the reason for this is because this phone seperates all your minutes.  You have a seperate bank of talk, text, and data minutes whereas on non smartphones this bank is all interchangeable.

I don't use my phone much, but having a previous Android phone from another provider I missed a few of the niceties that most phone users take for granted like having speaker phone option. The volume was also pretty awful on my old model & was prone to constant breaks in conversation on either end.I've been researching which would be the best phone option and decided on this one. I'd wanted to purchase this model before thru Walmart, but oddly enough whenever I'd enter my zip code to see if it worked in my area it would always come back as incompatible. Whenever I went to Tracfone's official site it said this model worked in my area. I compared Tracfone's prices to Amazon's and of course the price was a better deal here.After reading about issues with space for adequate apps and remembering how I killed my last Android with app overload, I decided to not bother with apps and just use it basically as a talking clock that doubles as a phone. I successfully transferred my number from old to new phone as per instructions...easy-peasy. The next day I went to my local Walgreen to pick up my usual 60 min airtime card & attempted to add airtime minutes. Okay, this is where it all goes downhill & knee-deep into a pile of horse manure. I didn't know, wasn't aware of, haven't seen any mention in the reviews that you couldn't add airtime from this phone. Maybe someone mentioned it & I overlooked it...I dunno. At any rate it can't be done. I'm thinking Android is supposed to be a step up right? My little $10 hobo phone could do it.  So finally ( trying not to bother anyone in India) I go to the website and \"seemingly\" it accepts my pin # & tells me all is good in the land.I go about my day. Threw away the used airtime card as per usual. BAD mistake, because later on I'm receiving a friendly text from the cutesy phone showing my remaining balance which is exactly what it was when I switched from old to new and it transferred my remaining minutes. I even added a 30 minute bonus promo which it pretended to have accepted. So the triple minutes should've brought it up to 210 minutes. I'm aware that it splits those total minutes into three's: phone, text, & data, but what happened to them??? I search in vain online for help. Tech support only gives two options & none are for the issue I'm experiencing. There's a forum for questions. I try logging in. It won't take my password and when it finally does its for the old phone. I try to make a new login, but it's not having it. I look longingly at the forum support board, seeing people with the same problem, but I'm on the outside looking in. Sadly, it's time for a trip to India.So to wrap this up because I need to go have a cry or a drink or both. I called India & was connected to a very \"American sounding\" rep who put me on hold for a bit to see if she could help. She told me what I figured on my own: you can't add airtime from the Android. She also informed me that trying it online probably wasn't the best way to ensure I'd receive my minutes & that its best to call in. OH GOODIE! They of course had no record of my adding a pin # and even though I paid for the card, I no longer have it or the receipt I purchased it with. So that knee-deep pile of horse manure I landed into earlier has worked it's way up to my neck. I have no additional minutes (which I paid for) and I'm out $20. I really miss my old hobo phone with the bad connection.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Be aware", "Author": "Princess in TN", "ReviewID": "R31PT2PTFGC5OA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are transferring from another Tracfone that is not an Android your minutes will NOT transfer just your date of service.

I also am annoyed at re-removing apps. Over time a few of them do stop updating but I still have to re-remove others. The built-in location app is an audio GPS and I love it.  I have a dashboard mount and have used it, giving verbal address and getting verbal directions.  Google maps built-in also lets me see a route if I don't want to keep the GPS (\"Location\") app on.  I was disappointed it didn't have visual Skype capabilities; I read that no Tracfones do.

This phone is advertised as a tracfone that uses minutes.  As a matter of fact the whole reason I purchased it was because it advertises triple minutes.  However, according to the box it is a net 10 wireless.  So I purchased a net 10 wireless card, try to add the minutes, and lo and behold, it doesnt work.  i call the company and spend an hour trying to nderstand someone who does not understand me, only to be told that it is not net 10' it is tracfone.  The tracfone cards will not work on it, but the fine print finally tells me that it will take a monthy net 10 card of 50 dollars.  So now i have wasted money on the phone and on a scratched off card I cannot return, and I am furious with tracfone, net 10' and amazon.com for selling this under false advertising, and I never want to do businees with any of them again.  I gave this a star only because it was required.
