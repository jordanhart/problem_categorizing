At first, I bought a used Blackberry 8530. It was a terrible phone and it stopped communicating with Virgin Mobile within a week. On the hunt for a new phone, I heard about the Optimus V. It kinda reminded me of the Hero in it's look and capabilities, and coming from an EVO 4G with Sprint, that really didn't seem like enough.That's when I found the Optimus Slider. The Slider has an 800mhz processor, which I feared would still be too slow, but was actually very snappy. Without the bloatware UI you find on HTC phones, this phone despite not being as powerful as my Evo, actually is faster in the menus. I used to get lag all the time with my Evo, and so far nothing with this (and this is while running live wallpapers and alternate launchers like Go Launcher).The phone plays all the apps well that I had stored on my Android account, and works flawlessly with Amazon's app store. This was a huge plus for me, as when I rooted my Nook Color I had all sorts of problems running many applications. Everything on this however works flawlessly.The keyboard's buttons are huge, and feel much easier to type on than other slide out keyboards. I never mess up while typing now, and never use the on screen keyboard. The red accents on the keys give it a very nice \"droid\" look, and the included Home/Menu/Back/Search buttons on the keyboard are a nice touch.The camera is pretty ho hum. 3.2 Megapixels and no flash. It records video, which is a plus, but only has a rear facing camera. Overall, it's much worse than my Evo, but then again, my Evo's cameras weren't good enough to take high quality photos in either. I usually use my stand-alone camera for good photos, so on the go quick snapshots work just fine for what it is.. a phone.The slider is quite smooth. In fact it's better quality than my old Playstation GO's slider, which violently snapped into place. This is much smoother and doesn't wobble like my GO's slider once fully pulled out.All in all, this is my first LG phone, and I have to say, I'm very impressed. For what I paid (168 free shipping) with no contract, it really highlights how much other carriers are over-charging for their phones (most of which are 5-600 out of contract!). It was nice to be able to replace my Blackberry without waiting for a contract to expire. I simply went out and bought a new one at the same price everyone else pays. The 3G is just as fast as the 3G on Sprint, so for 35 out the door for unlimited data and texts, it's a no brainer. I'm very happy I finally left Sprint, and I'm very happy with this phone.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Android Phone but VM Reception Needs Improvement", "Author": "NewsView", "ReviewID": "RGLBQMXGMJT5S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned the LG Optimus Slider (VM701) phone nearly a month. My spouse and I were able to take advantage of a Radio Shack special for Christmas 2011 that made this a far better buy. I can't complain about Virgin Mobile's service. We had to call customer service a couple times during and after activation and the reps were always friendly and we were not disconnected. That being said, I would advise that you activate your phone online. I called in my activation but had to go online before it \"took\". It took me about four hours for the phone to activate using my existing cell number but nearly two days and several phone calls for my spouse. (There is an \"activation status\" link on the Virgin Mobile website.)As a first-time Android owner it is fun to explore the Android marketplace, where it is possible to download a number of apps directly to the handset. You name it, there's an app for that. That's the good news. Now for the bad: with 181MB internal memory -- not the 512MB indicated in Amazon's description -- the VM701 fills up very fast when running apps that must utilize or reside on that space. Here's what we learned: All apps, even apps that can move to the included 2 gigabyte micro SD card, require some of that internal memory to operate. To write text messages or the like, you must always have internal memory free or errors and freezes will occur. I loaded enough apps at one point to come within 14MB of the internal memory limit only to encounter a severe memory outage. My phone froze and I had to reset the battery five times in a row before I caught a tiny status message on boot-up indicating that memory had run out. Consequently, if I had to name one bad thing about this mobile phone it is that you will run into memory limitations very quickly if you go \"app happy\" like I did. Some apps, like wallpapers and themes, insist on running on internal memory and you will have to make decisions about what takes priority. I recommend a minimum of 20MB free of internal memory at all times to avoid crashes and hangs.I am not sure if it is the phone or the Gingerbread OS but this phone sometimes has a mind of its own. I set a custom ring tone for my spouse and after two weeks it decided to switch to the Virgin Mobile start-up tone. A check of the settings revealed that my custom ring tone was still in place and that my preferred ringtone for general calls had changed on its own. When my spouse calls I get the \"generic\" ring tone instead. The other thing that has caused a fair amount of frustration is that the ringer mutes upon boot-up, yet only intermittently so. I like to turn my phone completely off at night and if I don't remember to check the volume button on the side of the phone when switching it on the next morning I will find it on \"silent\" later in the day even though I did not enter the operating system settings to mute it. I still haven't ruled out if an app is causing the issue, which is possible because my spouse has the same phone and has not had this particular problem.Above and beyond anything else I *assumed* about this phone, my spouse and I expected that like our feature phones the LG Optimus Slider would support audible (spoken) caller ID. This is not to be confused with the visual caller ID where you see your contact's picture and phone number pop up on the scree when the phone rings -- this form of caller ID is built in and functions flawlessly. Rather, we are attempting to enable an overlay such that when the phone rings it reads aloud what is shown on the screen. Thus far, I have paid for several apps and downloaded all the free apps on the market for \"voice announce\" caller ID and it does not reliably work -- even for callers who are in our contact lists. Once in a great while it will surprise us by correctly stating who is calling but for the most part our phones ring as normal or, if the SVOX voice says anything at all, it is to identify all incoming calls as \"unknown\". In searching various Android websites, I learned that audible caller ID is supposed to be a stock menu option in the Gingerbread OS but for whatever reason LG and/or VM has altered the menu so that it is omitted or hidden. If VM customer service has fallen short on one measure, it is in the conflicting responses I received to this question. Nobody can tell me whether it is a carrier vs. a hardware limitation, and the PDF owner's guide I downloaded didn't address the subject either. A post to the LG forum didn't clear up the issue, and attempts to use LG's web email form failed as did the Virgin Mobile website support form, neither of which have been working recently. It may have been VM's decision to strip this option out of the settings menu in attempt to streamline the OS to run on the phone's limited memory but that doesn't explain why I can't get a stand-alone app to fill in for the missing function.The best thing I can say about this handset is that it is solid in feel and will allow you to experience Android smartphone functionality for a low monthly prepaid price. The worst thing I can say about this handset is that reception, coming from AT&T; and Verizon, isn't up to par. It's not clear whether the network is to blame or the phone itself is lacking for an adequate antenna. All we know is that calls commonly clip or cut out when one of us is inside a mall or big-box retail store (though not at home or in the car, typically). Still, it is to the point where my spouse has left a store to complete a conversation outside. LG voice quality is good and the in-call volume is adequate when reception is good. Whether reception is adequate in the first place is the wild card, however. This phone utilizes the SPRINT network and here in SoCal that network ought to be as good as any. Unfortunately, we have noticed that sometimes our phones can be side-by-side and one of us will get the 3G signal (green bars and indicator) and the other will get white bars and 3G symbol, which if I am not mistaken signifies a slower 2G data connection. Odder still, we were driving beneath a SPRINT tower one day where we had five bars and on the other side of the street behind a small fast food restaurant all data connectivity dropped temporarily. If I had to evaluate VM as a carrier for business use -- and if I do recall the TOS for VM the company actually forbids commercial use so this may be a moot point -- I would recommend against Virgin Mobile and its parent company, SPRINT. However, if your primary aim is to own a modern smartphone while saving more money than you can with any other provider at present for unlimited data and texting, this prepaid LG smartphone is a great value. The VM voicemail system is better than AT&T;'s because it will time-stamp messages but on the downside I had to download a \"missed call\" app to get a tone to alert me to a missed text or voicemail message. That is because the phone's built-in notification consists solely of a tiny icon on the status bar and an equally tiny LED light that glows green when the phone has completed charging and/or an unheard or unread message has arrived. Both are far too discrete and easy to miss, but fortunately there was an app to solve the problem.A lot of LG Optimus Slider owners have complained about battery life, whereas a PC Magazine website article describes it as \"excellent\". I wouldn't call it excellent but it has not been as bad as I expected, either. My spouse typically needs to recharge half way or so through the day, whereas I can get through an entire day without a recharge even with frequent use (for me that is WI-FI more than talk or text, thus far). The phone is rated for 4.5 hours of talk time but when fully charged an app I downloaded, \"Easy Task Killer\", indicates that I have six hours of talk time. I have not talked on the phone for more than an hour continuously, however, so I don't know how accurate that is. In any event, we each use an application, available on the Android market, to conserve battery life. My spouse uses the free \"Easy Battery Saver\" app and I paid for \"Juice Defender Plus\" to compare the differences. What we learned is that some of the optimization settings to eliminate drains on the battery can also disrupt WI-FI and data connectivity. We at first thought our phones were faulty because we downloaded a battery-saving app first thing, only to find that the phones would drop WI-FI at random sitting five feet from the router, or after going out and about the data connection would not surrender so that the handset could seamlessly pick up in-home WI-FI. We set our phones to use a static IP address and that helped moderately with the WI-FI issue. However, I highly recommend Juice Defender Plus because not only will it keep the battery going it has a \"mobile data\" force-on feature and WI-FI fix. Once I went to the application settings and checked those fixes I have had no further problem with random drops when switching between the VM data network and WI-FI. All this aside, if you have particularly bad battery performance it may be a defective phone or battery. If, on the other hand, you are a heavy user the solution may be to seek out a compatible aftermarket battery that is rated in excess of the stock OEM battery rating of 1500mA. Please be advised, however, that the use of a third-party battery may void your handset warranty.With respect to the slide-out keyboard, I am glad we opted for the LG Optimus Slider over the Optimus V, which differs chiefly in that it omits a physical keyboard. The Slider's QUERTY keyboard is much faster. In contrast, I find that the Swype keyboard is too narrow due to the limitations of the screen size, and therefore I am prone to making more mistakes on the virtual keyboard than its physical counterpart. That being said, I have been frustrated in that there appears to be some way of accidentally triggering a copy/cut/paste function. I still haven't quite figured out why but if there is something in my clipboard and I hit the letter \"v\" the content is either pasted in over what I am currently composing or lost, depending on the action I have accidentally triggered. I attempted to post this how-to question to the Virgin Mobile product page Q&A; for this handset but VM never posted it.The web via Android is generally accessible but not to be compared with the experience of a conventional Internet browser/computer connection. This mobile phone, other than the built-in YouTube app, does NOT support Adobe Flash (contrary to Amazon's description). Whether for this or some other reason, some websites that permit comments don't allow for successful login, nor the ability to submit comments using the built-in Google Android browser. Alternatives such as Dolphin, Opera or Skyfire mobile phone browsers are not much better in this particular regard. I have spent a fair bit of time retyping things that I lost because the cursor is missing from the comment field or the clipboard content I had intended to paste is pushed out by accidentally triggering the \"copy\" function while attempting to get a cursor to move or a \"submit\" button to work. As expected, there are some websites that are optimized for mobile viewing and others that are not. It takes good eyesight to make use of non-optimized websites. Normal newspaper print type is 9 points whereas the type on a conventional (non-mobile) web page, when viewed on this phone, hovers around 5 points. You can zoom in with the flick of two fingers but that, in turn, means that the text doesn't always wrap correctly for easy reading. I can understand why a lot of people who own these smartphones also end up buying a tablet. Fortunately, the LG Optimus Slider screen features crisp resolution and the brightness options are adequate for all but the most glaring outdoor conditions. The only downside in this regard is that the brightness adjustment is a manual one. This handset does not come equipped with a light sensor to automatically adjust screen brightness but you can always install a toggle switch on your home screen for instant access to this setting, if need be.The 800Mhz processor seems fast enough for most tasks. The phone bogs down a bit when multiple apps are going but game-play in Angry Birds, for reference, is smooth with few \"force quit\" issues. Internet radio via Pandora and iHeart Radio work well. Oddly enough, however, it took some doing to get the VM Live app to buffer the carrier's own streaming content. To my pleasant surprise, I also found an app that will allow iTunes to sync with my phone, and sound quality through the mono speaker or stereo headphone connection is quite good. On the flip side, it is puzzling why some apps insist on running even when you don't want or need them. Using the free and highly functional \"Android Assistant\" to perform backups and to browse the phone's internal file structure, one of the system processes that runs frequently in the background is the built-in Facebook app. This is both creepy and inexplicable given that I choose not to join Facebook and have no need to operate it. (Unfortunately, it ships with the phone and can't be deleted to free up space.)This handset is Bluetooth compatible and provides turn-by-turn GPS navigation functions, but I have comparatively less experience with these other than to say Bluetooth, GPS and data usage hasten battery drain. For GPS use I recommend a car charger, sold separately. As for the 3.2MP camera, I must admit that I was disappointed with image quality. Shutter lag is significant, which results in soft, unattractive pictures under artificial indoor light. There is no flash but the camera works better than my first impression led me to anticipate under natural light or sunlight with pleasing color accuracy. There is not a front-facing camera for video conferencing but that was not a high priority for me in the first place -- one camera is enough for the price. Last but not least, it is my understanding that the LG Optimus Slider will NOT receive the Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) OS update because the internal memory and/or processor speed is inadequate to support it.All in all I am happy with the purchase of the LG Optimus Slider. The stars I have docked are for poor indoor reception foremost, and secondarily for the operational glitches that seemingly give this handset a mind of its own.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replace your Intercept now!", "Author": "Bay Area Tech Junkie", "ReviewID": "R1LYJXG6BAPGWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are still suffering with an Intercept, this is the phone for you! Although the specs say the screen is the same size, the Slider screen is higher resolution and slightly larger. Physically it is a little flatter and wider and it feels like a much more upscale device. There is virtually no lag in the UI, versus the tens of seconds on the Intercept. Physical Android keys mean positive feedback that you pressed one.Games like Angry Birds and Nano Panda run great. Music output is clean, and videos play smoothly. Photos and videos are also an improvement over the Intercept.The Android 2.3 dialer interface is MUCH improved over the one in 2.2 on the Intercept and you'll find yourself using fewer keystrokes and accidentally hanging up or re-dialing a lot less often. Recommend Mintues Checker for Virgin Mobile from the Market to keep track of how many minutes you have left. Skype also works almost okay over the 3G data connection, but there is enough distortion that touch tones don't work. Skype over WiFi is great with a headset, and toll free calls in the US are free on Skype (e.g. conference bridge numbers) and of course don't use any of your Virgin Mobile minutes.Google turn by turn navigation with GPS and satellite images is there, although you have to download a voice synthesis app from the Market before you get voice prompts (it tells you which one to download).Voice dialing is supported, but I highly recommend Choice Dialer+ Free for this phone, as you get confirmation of names before it calls unlike the native Google dialer that will happily start to call your ex-girlfriend or the San Diego Zoo when you asked it to call your Mom.On the downside, battery life isn't as good as an Intercept. While actively fiddling it is surprising how fast it burns through battery. With JuiceDefender and ATK I CAN make it through a business day with about 40% power left. Red lettering on the keyboard is difficult to read in low light and numbers require pressing the Fn key. It also seems slow to charge (takes well over an hour). Also Flash is not supported on this device, but there is a YouTube app. Lack of a light sensor means you sometimes have to manually adjust brightness to avoid being blinded, or to read outside.Like the Optimus V you can enable the hidden WiFi Hotspot function, but unfortunately on this device it still doesn't work. PDANet on the Market does work fine.If you are making an hour or two of calls a day and check email SMS very 30 mins or so this phone should work out great for you. If you are on an Intercept, this is a no brainer upgrade for you.UPDATE - since this phone came out Boost Mobile has made available the Transform Ultra, which is a much more powerful phone than this with more internal memory. If looking at unlimited plans, I think going to Boost for the Transform Ultra makes a lot of sense as it starts at $50 and with shrinkage gets down to $35 over 18 months. You CAN port from Virgin Mobile to Boost.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great new phone for Virgin Mobile", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R2TY0RIY3TNK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not sure why currently the shipment time is 5-8 weeks on Amazon, but I picked this up today from Best Buy (begrudgingly). The phone is basically the older Optimus V, which I currently have, with a faster processor (800Mhz vs 600Mhz - I could tell a big difference when using the operating system, it's much snappier now), more internal memory (512MB vs 256MB), a physical keyboard, and Anroid 2.3 (vs 2.2).  It's really a nice phone that you can tell is made well - the fit and finish is really nice.  The keyboard slider works well too - it's a very smooth action that just feels right.  My only complaint for this phone is that it has a fairly small screen of 3.2\". It's just a little on the small side for browsing webpages and such.  Also, now that I think about it, I wish the camera had a flash for it.

It was really annoying to have to delete most applications just to install a new one that cannot be moved to the sd card. Because they are a couple like maps which take a lot of space and that you cannot move. Really frustrating...The main downside is the battery life which is still not much better than the previous Optimus VI just want to clarify that I bought this phone on cyber Monday for 99$ at Virgin Mobile. So not that much for a nice upgrade!Anyway, I think this is the best phone from Virgin Mobile so far", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very nice upgrade from the Optimus V and a great option for those looking to switch to prepaid.", "Author": "E. Brogan", "ReviewID": "R2Y4QDSNCWSOER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like most people I started out with a contract carrier. First it was Cell One which became Alltel which became Verizon. Oh Verizon. Actually Verizon, I should thank you for shackling me with the same piece of junk phone for a year & a half, without your persistence in replacing my phone 5 different times with the same refurbished paper weight equivalent, instead of giving me something else that was at least comparable but worked, I never would of looked elsewhere which means I never would of considered Virgin Mobile. Needless to say by phone replacement number 5 I was so fed up I was counting the months like a prison inmate counting down the last days to freedom.When the time drew near for me to be able to tell Verizon they could take that phone and shove it (it was the Motorola Rival by the way) I had already begun doing research. Initially I was planning to go with Sprint. I know many a satisfied people who love Sprint but I personally don't love the 80.00 a month phone bills nor do I have to have the top of the line in cell phone technology. So I decided to head for the prepaid sector. I narrowed my search down to Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Straight Talk as they all work in my area. At the time Boost had the Samsung Prevail and the Black Berry Curve as their smart phone options while Virgin Mobile had the Optimus V and the Samsung Intercept. Straight Talk had the Nokia E71 which I initially purchased online only to be told at the store when I went to pick it up that it would not work in my area despite what it may of said online. So it came down to Boost or Virgin. After much research and video review watching I decided to go with Virgin Mobile and the Optimus V.Initially I was in love with the V (I was coming from the Motorola Rival after all) but I just couldn't stand not having a sliding physical qwerty and web browsing seemed pretty sluggish and I couldn't always get the screen to scroll in dialogue boxes on apps like Facebook. Then this puppy came along. I've had my Optimus Slider for nearly two months now and for me it is a HUGE step up from the V. Besides the obvious physical qwerty board which I think is great, I also love the speeds that I'm getting when browsing and the speeds with which I'm downloading apps and updates now. Not to mention Facebook actually works the way it should on this phone. No more dialogue box issues. Now is this a super computer of a smart phone? No of course not and at 47.75 with tax a month for 1200 anytime minutes and unlimited text and data, I don't expect it to be. It is however, everything I could ask for and it does exactly what I need it to do and it does it well enough to suit me.Pros:800mhz processor which is up from the Optimus's 600mhz. That extra 200 mhz goes a long way in improving speeds for downloads, web browsing and game play.Updated operating system of Android 2.3.4 which is up from Optimus V's Android 2.2.Sliding QwertyOver all build quality. Feels very solid and nicely constructed inyour hands.Monthly fees are excellent! 47.75 with tax for 1200 anytimeminutes, unlimited text and data. There are other plan options of course if this is too much or too little for you.Screen responsiveness is very nice and colors are clear andbright.The camera works well enough for me too. If I need something impressive, that what my Canon Rebel is for.The blinking status light is also a nice touch. I can see it all the way across the room and it lets me know if my phone is charged or if I have a missed call or text message.Cons: Battery life. For heavy cell phone users this will be a problem. Isuggest either carrying your charger at all times or picking upeither an extended battery or a couple of extra regular batteries.I'm not a heavy user but my phone was drained alot because ofstandby time and the phone searching for a signal at work where no signal could be found. I solved this by downloading the Juice Defender App and now my battery will last me all day with light tomoderate use.The other cons are mild ones that I have with the physical qwerty. The first being the placement of the back button key. Unfortunately they opted to position it beside the \"A\" button which is a bit annoying as there are times, not often, but there are times when I'll be typing in a dialogue box and I'll mistakenlyhit the back key when trying to push the A button which causes me to back out of where I am which means I lose what I type. It doesn't matter so much when texting since the text gets saved as a draft. Doesn't happen all the time but the fact that it can happen at all is in itself, rather annoying.My only other con is I wish the top row of keys had been spaced farther away from the sliding portion of the screen. I don't have child sized fingers so my thumbs tend to smash up against the other half of the phone when trying to hit buttons in the top row of the qwerty.Alright then, so there you have it! Over all the Optimus Slider is a fantastic phone and a wonderful upgrade from the Optimus V, especially if you want a sliding qwerty. Biggest down fall being the battery life but there are steps to take and apps that can be downloaded to improve this. Again it's not the top of the line but it is one of the very best phones I think any prepaid company has to offer for that price range. In fact I feel it outshines it's fair share of the more expensive prepaid competition.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Color Me Fanboy", "Author": "Pinetree \"Cone\"", "ReviewID": "R3JVONFRABOGDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is getting five stars and you had better believe it! Dollar for dollar the Optimus Slider is the best value on the market. It's no iPhone but you pay way, way more for those.I lost my Optimus V which at best had been a compromise. This turned out to have been luck smiling, in replacing the Optimus V I stumbled upon the LG Optimus Slider, it's newer incarnation. I had planned to eventually ditch the Optimus V, get a \"real phone\" and pay outrageous voice and data plans for years under a contract of adhesion (Google what that means). Instead I can keep my $25/month grandfathered Virgin Mobile all you can eat data and text plan with enough voice minutes to get by. Even at the currently available hefty hike to $35/month it saves enough to consider a New iPad just because you didn't buy into the overpriced iPhone world. And no contract of adhesion (go on, look it up, a good term to know).The Optimus Slider is surprisingly speedy, much more than would be expected by upgrading from 600Mhz to 800Mz. I swear the display is brighter. The physical keyboard is just big enough for those of us with big, fat, clumsy thumbs (truth in advertising) who can't master 3.2 inch (or 3.5 inch) virtual keyboards. Whereas the speakers on the Optimus v are the worst I have ever heard on any phone, even $15 throw aways,the Optimus Slider speakers are adequate to use as a speaker phone [which I do because I don't want to lose brain cells to cell phone transmissions or to Blue Tooth, or gain the uncontrolled growth of degenerate brain cells. Those are microwaves that you are putting next to your brain, and yes they do detectably raise brain temperature (just like a microwave oven) as the brain physically speaking is mainly a bag of water].Some have complained about the battery life. Hooey, it is at least 2 to 3 times better than the Optimus V for which I had a fleet of four batteries and always carried at least one extra fully charge one. I recently got an 1800ma battery and the standby time is at least four days now compare to making barely past one for the Optimus V. Andriod 2.3.4 is optimized for battery life and it shows. Perhaps they shipped some of the early Optimus Sliders with 2.3.3 (although I doubt it) which had known problems on some manufacturers' models. The device also tethers like a champ using PDANet without needing to be rooted. This alone is worth the price of admission, especially useful when cable goes down or your router takes a long burp, or you are on the road. To be fair, the Optimus V did excellent tethering as well. At VM rate's, it's a sweet deal! Take that Verizon, AT&T;, T-Mobile with your over-crowded, under capacity, over priced and volume strangled network service.Lastly they fixed the most fatal flaw of the Optimus V. Andriod V2.2 on the Optimus V and several other manufacturers' phones had a dreadful bug where incoming calls automatically activated the touch screen. I rarely could get the phone out of my pocket without some random touch making a hash of things. Mercifully, 2.3.4 has fixed that dreadful usability flaw.This phone is a keeper.

Farnham", "ReviewID": "R6X84QR9LJG9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I have now had an Optimus V, a Triumph, and an Optimus Slider.  The bottom line is that none of them are an iPhone 4 (which is what I had before the Optimus V) and all of them have there own specific downsides. So why did I leave the glorious iPhone?2 reasons:1. I have had enough of the post-paid contract deal that is now all but required to get a decent phone from the big companies.  I got tired of having to call every other month to straighten out a bill.  Getting nickeled and dimed left and right to add on a million features just to get a reasonably functional phone.2. I had had enough of AT&T.; I hated being transfered 20 times everytime I called. I hated having to argue my case for an hour just to get the $6 credit that that they somehow inadvertantly tacked on to my already ridiculously expensive bill.What was wrong with my other phones?Optimus VOverall good phone. Everything works well and for the average user, it is a great low budget solution, but...1.  My biggest qualm with this phone is Android 2.2 Froyo.  It may sound like a small thing but Froyo makes it very difficult to copy/paste.  It was very hard to find but once I finally figured it out, it was very cumbersome and iritating.  I copy/paste all day long so this ended up being a major issue for me.  Also, Froyo is not as battery efficient as Gingerbread.2.  Just like the Slider, the camera is not good.  Pictures are fine for quick snap shots when nothing else is available, but video is absolutely horrible.  I would rather just take an audio recording than use this video camera.3.  I ran into several apps that were not optimized for LG Optimus V, so they wouldn't run.  Not a major issue and it was only a few but worth noting.4.  Not enough internal memory. This is a major issue with low end Android phones. Even though you can use a micro sd card to get more storage, many apps must be installed on the internal memory, and if it can be installed to the sd card, part of the app must remain on the internal memory. Optimus V has around 140mb of usable internal memory (Slider has 152 mb).  The issue with the Optimus V comes in that all the preinstalled apps need to be updated.  When they are updated, an additional 50-60 mb is used because the old applications are not replaced since they are in the system memory (bloatware is less than desirable - this will become an issue with the Slider soon too when all the preinstalled apps become extinct and we are forced to update).  Right now with the Slider I simply don't update most of the preinstalled apps because all of the older versions function just fine.5.  Headphones had a loud enough static that is not present in the Slider (yay!)6.  600 mhz processor made for many things running too slowly for me (slider is more smooth so far - makes me happier!)Triumph1.  It is too big for its britches.  I had minor glitches with the Triumph running Froyo: periodic restarts (Virgin Mobile's start up music was particularly irritating while I was in a meeting at work or talking with a client).2.  Froyo sucks the battery dry.  It would have a dead battery with very minimal use (30 min tops) within 12 hrs.  That meant that I couldn't even make it home before the battery was dead.3.  The awesome 5mp camera is not so awesome.  It takes very bad pictures indoors (worse than the optimus).  Outside was reasonably good.  The video camera was absolutely horrid.  Slow frames per second made for very blurry videos inside and outside.  It boasts 720p capture but all that really means is that it is a bad video camera that can take widescreen videos.4.  I tried rooting my triumph and installing custom firmware, but the custom firmware for the Triumph, though abundant in choices, all seem to have too many issues for me.5.  Internal memory (about 1gb usuable) on the Triumph is awesome!  I could install as much as I wanted and still have plenty of room for more!So what is bad about the Slider?1.  Still not enough internal memory.  I am sure that it will cause issues in the future.2.  Still not a great camera3.  It is a little on the thick side4.  If you have your phone display on for more than 2 hrs a day (I always have my bluetooth/gps/wifi off to conserve battery), you will have to charge it before the end of a work day.5.  No LED flash (probably my most disappointing loss from the Triumph)6.  The Virgin Mobile bloatware is horrible and a space waster!What is good about the Slider?1.  800 mhz processor makes things smoother than the Optimus V.  It is up to par for me.2.  Finally Android 2.3 Gingerbread pre-installed!3.  Definately the lowest battery consumption in standby mode.4.  Pre-installed apps are more up to date and for me, I did not have to update conserving my internal memory!5.  I do love having a physical keyboard!  My first one ever, and it is great!  If touch screens for these phones were as good as the iPhone, it would probably be less of an issue, but having the physical keyboard is desirable in my opinion.My opinion thus is that the Slider is better than the Optimus V.

I loved the fact that it was an Android phone with a keyboard (a seeming rarity these days, for whatever reason), but I hated pretty much everything about it performance-wise.  It was slow, things would crash now and then, it would run out of RAM and spontaneously close open apps without even asking me if I'd like to save my work/progress, etc.  I tried the Motorola Triumph for a time, but it was riddled with hardware issues and I couldn't quite get used to the lack of keyboard.  Enter the Optimus Slider.I pretty much treat this phone as a portable computer.  I rarely even use half of my allotted 300 minutes per month, but I frequently browse the internet, play games (both native to Android and emulated), watch movies, play music, etc.  So far, it has handled everything I've thrown at it excellently.  There is almost no lag, compared to often waiting several seconds to accomplish something on the Intercept.  The processors are the same speed as far as I can tell, but the Slider has double the RAM capacity, which helps tremendously.  The ~150 mb of internal storage for apps is on the low side, and would normally be a problem, as not all apps can be moved to the SD card and the native application moving in Android always leaves files behind even for those that can.  As a solution, I rooted the phone, installed a custom ROM and Gingerkernel, and installed Link2SD.  This allows me to move ANY app to the SD card, have it stay there, and have the phone think it's still installed in the internal memory.  Basically, I have over 300mb of apps installed on a 150mb phone, with ~90mb still free on the internal partition.Also, this phone gets the best signal on VM's network of the three I've used so far.  In my office, both the Intercept and Triumph struggled to get 1 or 2 bars with very slow data (and I use it quite frequently there), but the Slider has 3+ and I get consistently quick speeds.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus Slider (Virgin Mobile)", "Author": "Samantha Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R1GTXTONO8Q6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched this phone for a very long time.  I moved from Sprint (HTC EVO 4G) to this phone and Virgin Mobile.I use my phone for:- Surfing the web (Wifi in home and 3G while away) Both are fast and the 3G is on par with Sprint's speed.- Tethering with EasyTether and my laptop. (Keeps the phone charged while I use 3G on the go with my PC)- Listen to music from Amazon Cloud- Teamviewer to remote connect to my computers at home when needed- Alarm/Calculator- Chat- Email- Navigation (Turn by turn voice activated)Like with my previous phone, you must charge this phone once a day, so that was no surprise to me.  The screen is smaller than the EVO but the slide out keyboard makes it up for me.  I also like the swype feature and do recommend surfing the web in landscape mode.I personally never played games on my cell phone, so I'm not sure if they would run very well.  I think it has the processing power to do it, but the internal memory is limited, so keep in mind you'll only have about 100MB of internal memory for applications.It does come with a 2GB memory card, so make sure to save your pics and any apps that let you move to the memory card should be saved here.The phone is very nicely constructed and doesn't look \"cheap\" or like a bargain phone.  In reality this phones equivalent is sold for A LOT more on the major carriers, so $200 is worth it.  In my case I was lucky enough to get it new for about $155.  I guess since people are getting refund checks Amazon and sellers have temporarily jacked up the prices. If they make a profit at $155, then I wonder how much the phone actually costs them! ;)My only NEGATIVE remarks about this phone:- I noticed some apps caused my phone to lock up.  I seemed to have narrowed it down to animated apps and backgrounds.  By lock up I mean it would not let me easily switch through the screens when I'd power it back on.- Also, I can't seem to find the setting on this phone to allow some time before requiring me to draw my unlock pattern after I press the power button. At the moment, if I press the power button to put it in my pocket or so I don't accidentally touch the screen while I'm walking to my truck... when I press the button again it wants me to redraw the unlock pattern.

Touch screen is fine, but I really prefer the slide-out querty keyboard for typing more than a short text message. The keyboard is okay. It's not as big as the one on my MyTouch was, and I bump my fingers all the time when I'm using the top row. Also don't love the placement of some of the keys.So far I've found that lots of apps in the app store aren't compatible with it. They just don't appear in my Market... but when I'm looking at the app store from my Kindle Fire, I see \"Not compatible with the Optimus\" on numerous apps. I don't really understand why this is the case, and it's kind of a bummer.I've had some issues with the home screen flashing and had to restart the phone. It's less than 2 months old, so that's concerning me. I really hope it lasts--although so far I love using Virgin Mobile, it would stink if I had to replace a phone over and over--and since this is the only slider they have, I don't have another good option.No flash on the camera--which means it takes terrible photos.Most importantly, the battery life is unbelievably bad. Not just average-smart-phone-battery bad. I mean really, really bad. I let it charge all night while I sleep, but it's usually dead by afternoon. I stay home with my kids, but if I worked out of the home, I'd have to take a charger with me to work because it definitely wouldn't make it through the day. I use an app to protect the battery power, but even with that it's still a huge pain.All in all... two months in and it's working okay for me.

I can get a full day with phone calls and some browsing, you do have to watch your browsing though as that does eat up your battery.The biggest minus is not really on the phone, it is the Virgin coverage with Sprint, once you leave the towns/cities I find you lose coverage very fast.

I have had Virgin Mobile phones in the past, though for just basic phone service, and have always been happy with them. I have now had this phone about a week and it has to be one of the most frustrating experiences I have had with any technology product. The first couple of days I had to keep hard-starting it to use it, it would completely shut itself off after only a few seconds (yes, the battery was fully charged). I could call out, but any calls coming in would immediately go to voicemail. I sent off an email to Tech Support, got a reply that was totally useless and didn't solve my problem. So I had to call Tech Support, who then reset the phone so I could receive calls. Next I attempted to download a ringtone. I was charged for it, and I got the link to download it, but the download would never go through. According to the troubleshooting instructions, I needed to delete an existing ringtone to make room for the download. Okay, just try to delete a ringtone on this phone. Called Tech Support and they didn't know how to do it. So I had to get a refund on the ringtone. Right now I'm afraid to try and download an app, for fear I'll end up on another 30 minute phone call to Tech Support. It's an attractive phone, not too heavy. Touch screen is nice and the keyboard is decent. Call clarity is good and coverage is acceptable. The battery life is really short. I'd like to be able to customize the phone somewhat, but good luck with that. The online manual at Virgin Mobile doesn't explain how to do a number of things, and the website is awful. You can't get to the information you want, moving to different parts of the site requires you to log in over and over again, and the layout and design are just terrible. I'm seriously looking at another carrier for a replacement.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Smartphone Virgin", "Author": "Warren Holzem", "ReviewID": "R2STJ62CIO9M9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little background. I got my first cell phone in 1990 before anyone else I knew personally had one. I didn't get it because it was cool. I got it because I had a job that involved being on-call, and having one gave me the chance to never miss a call-in, thus paying for the phone, the cost of service, and then some. I didn't consider a cell phone a toy then, and I still don't.By the mid-90's, I didn't need a cell phone, but they started to become standard equipment. So I always had a cell phone, but never the newest, and it often just sat in my car unused. That's how I first became a Virgin Mobile customer.So first a few things about the service: With this phone, you have to have a data plan, but I was able to transfer my phone number from my basic Virgin Mobile phone to this one without any problem. And my cash balance went to pay for the monthly service, too. It took me no more than 5 minutes online to set up my new data plan, and activate my phone. That was painless.Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint network, but the coverage where I work is only marginal. One of the things that attracted me about this phone is that it can connect using WiFi. What I didn't realize was while the WiFi works for the data services, it doesn't work for voice or text messaging. So much of the day at work I can send and receive e-mail, but I only get text messages when I move near the window. (I don't really care about not getting phone calls as anyone I really want to talk to knows my work number.)My WiFi at work uses MAC address filtering, and static IP addresses in the Class-A space, rather than the more common Class-C with DHCP. The manuals weren't very clear on how to set that all up, but a little bit of Googling, and I had the phone set-up to use my work WiFi. But that's essentially an Android OS issue, and not directly related to the phone itself.Now, finally to the phone: Given my history, I can't really compare it well to other smart phones, but there are some things I know. My fat fingers don't do well with the on-screen keyboard, so I am very, very happy I got a slider phone. The keyboard has some quirks to it, but for such tiny keys, I'm amazed at how well I have picked-up using it. I'm not typing like a teenager, but I'm doing pretty well.I'm a little disappointed with battery life. When I'm at work for 12 hours, even with the GPS turned-off, I can be down to 10-15% battery by the end of the day. But that's partially because the WiFi uses power, and the ranging it does to find that signal for the phone/text messaging service uses power, too. I suspect that most people wouldn't have the same issues I'm having with it.The charger is essentially USB with a micro-B end on the cable, which means it's easy to charge off of wall adapters, or a USB port on any computer. The phone recharges very quickly off the wall adapter, and fairly quickly directly off a computer or powered USB hub, so it doesn't take much to keep the phone going until I get home to plug it in for overnight.The screen is big enough for my 51 year old eyes, and I like it's level of sensitivity. I don't accidentally do things, and it does what I want.But back to the service: Verizon has a little better coverage in my area, but my goodness -- for the price, I just love the Virgin Mobile plan. I'm paying $35, while friends are paying $85. Sure, they've got their price locked-in for 2-years, while my monthly plan could go up next month, what are the odds that it would go up higher than what they're paying?So a month and a half into owning my first smart phone, I'm still very happy with my choice. I'm now constantly connected to my e-mail (which was my goal), and I've found a few apps that come in handy, too. All with a keyboard that my fat fingers can actually use!

The keyboard is easy to use and has decent sized keys. The phone feels solid and substantial in my hand. Obviously, a screen protector and case are needed to protect the phone from getting beat up. Virgin Mobile's plan is cost effective and reasonable. I've had no problem with their service since I signed on in 2006 after getting fed up with the ever rising costs of being locked into a contract with ATT. This phone works well for me and the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is what everyone mentions: lack of battery life. Obviously, that is just part of owning a smartphone.

The quality is solid. The buttons have a comfortable click, the slide-out keyboard is spacious with soft plastic keys and the screen is bright and crisp. The keyboard is backlit upon press, and the black and red contrast is quite attractive.2. Though it doesn't have any fancy dual core processor, it really speeds along. The 512 megs of shared memory gives you a good amount of space to run multiple apps and the 800mhz processor runs a lot of games without issue.3. I don't know much about the Android OS, but this \"Gingerbread\" that it has is wonderful. It may be missing features of newer revisions, but it seems like a lot of that can be remedied via the Marketplace. From what I've read there is no upgrading to newer versions of Android OS, so just make sure you can live with whatever version is on the phone.4. I'm not quite sure what to make of these complaints about the camera. I mean, it's a cell phone camera people, are you really trying to shoot professional-level pics with it? About my only issue with it is its need to auto-focus every time, which delays the actual shot a little when you click the button.5. Internal memory for apps is a little weak. It's supposed to be 150 megs, but with all the pre-installed Virgin and Google apps you're barely left with around 100 megs(IIRC). I've only installed around 15 apps and I'm already down to 55 megs...and these were huge apps, just stuff like Juice Defender, AIM, Fightin' Words, Opera Mini and other smaller apps. None of the pre-installed stuff can be uninstalled unless, from what I've read, you root the phone. I hear that kills any warranty you may get with it though, so I am hesitant to do it until I know my time is up.6. Battery life is an absolute disgrace. You can actually sit there and watch the battery level dropping as you do something as rudimentary as browsing the internet. I can barely make it an entire day without having to charge it, and that's just using the phone lightly. Break out some heavy usage and this thing won't last but an hour, maybe two. Juice Defender, a free app on the Marketplace, is *mandatory*. It really helps out, and I can go about a day and a half without having the charge it, even with some moderate usage. I would highly recommend an extended-life battery. If you click on my name, I think it'll take you to other reviews I've done and there's one for an extended battery I just purchased, and is working out wonderfully for me. Though it adds some bulk to the phone, I can get through three or four days with it, and that includes heavy usage of the internet and stuff like Sega Genesis emulation.7. Call quality seems to be really good, though I don't know if that has more to do with the carrier(Virgin Mobile) or the phone. Speaking of Virgin Mobile, I've been pleasantly surprised with how great they've been. They walk you through the entire activation process, they help you get your number switched over, get whatever plan set up that you want(I went with the $35 one) and do it all quite quickly(they said it could take up to 24 hours to switch my number, it took less than *6*)! About the only issue I had with them was when it came to phone insurance. They didn't really seem to know anything about it, despite it being on their website and will even refer you to the people who run the insurance. In the end, I didn't feel it was worth it, but if you've got a more expensive phone, it may very well be. You only have 15 days to register for it though, so if you want it, get it quick.8. The phone comes with a 2GB SD Micro card and USB cable(which has an optional AC block that you can use to charge it via a wall socket). Upgrading the 2GB card is a matter of preference, and would really just depend on how much you like to have with you in your phone. For most, that'll be enough for pics, some music and any additional bits various programs need to use space for(Opera Mini, for example, will use it for internet caching). For the power user, I think it'll take up to a 32GB SD Micro(I've got an 8gb, mostly used for music and Sega Genesis roms).All in all, I would say this is a solid and affordable Android phone for those who have to have a keyboard(like myself).", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good but not enough internal memmory", "Author": "Shelly8 \"Shelly8\"", "ReviewID": "R28BUEERISO16L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great entry level phone on Virgin Mobile.

The morons put the front navigation buttons on the side of the qwerty keyboard so if you try to type A you'll most likely hit the BACK button too, taking you out the screen! Same for the FN button (HOME), it's very annoying! As for the on-screen keyboard, when you're typing it takes up majority of the screen, intercept didn't do that. I also liked intercept's auto-guessing feature better. Optimus V's totally covers the screen while you are trying to txt! Luckily you can turn down it's probably of popping up.

I put off upgrading to a smartphone for ages, but ended up getting grandfathered into a ridiculously cheap plan with Virgin Mobile, so when the prices started coming down I bit the bullet. I tried the Optimus V first and returned it because I just couldn't get the touchscreen keyboards to work for me. My fingers are not made for onscreen keyboards and I ended up having to use my pinky to occasionally get the right keys to respond. So I traded up for the Optimus Slider, which went on sale shortly thereafter.As a first experience with Android, I was pretty impressed, particularly with the voice recognition. I rarely use my phone as a phone, but rather as a messaging device.  Having a phone that takes surprisingly accurate dictation made it possible for me to reply to texts and home and work emails with ease, which became a real advantage when I started walking for exercise not long after getting this phone--I carry it in an arm strap and track my walks with an app, and voice recognition is good enough to reply to emails even a little out of breath, and sometimes being able to just slow down a little and not stop walking altogether.  This was very helpful over the winter when I often had to walk in the middle of a workday.The onscreen keyboard was slightly better than the one on the Optimus V, but not enough to make the slideout keyboard unnecessary.  I wish they had kept the slider kb similar to previous LG phones we've had, like the various Rumors. On the Optiums Slider, the top row of letters is also the numeric row and you have to use a function button to shift or lock/unlock  the numbers, which is cumbersome. Given the comparative size of this keyboard to the Rumor Touch, I don't see why they needed to make this compression, but it's not impossible to live with certainly. I'm grateful for the slideout, especially since it looks like nobody's ever going to make another one *sigh*.Drawbacks--it's a little twitchy.  I love being able to use wireless, since VM's voice coverage in our area is very sketchy. But the wireless isn't great about rediscovering known networks and drops connections, and you often need to turn the wireless service on and off to wake it up--easy from the widget, but still. I'd like to be able to come back from a walk and have it rediscover my home network within a couple of minutes on its own, but it rarely does.  Power consumption could be better, and I normally have to charge it every night or find it dead on the couch the next morning.  I had a problem with random reboots for a while, but unloaded several apps and turned off automatic updating on those I could, and the reboots are now very rare. A very slight drawback is that I like to text to email addresses sometimes (as when trying to get my husband at his non-smartphone and his  email addresses) and the text app on this phone will not allow you to choose emails from your contact list, only phone numbers, for SMS. You have to type the email in and there is no autocomplete for that.  This has annoyed me on more than one occasion. I used to have a mailing list set up for this purpose on my Rumor and it worked great.The biggest drawback is the lack of internal memory.  It comes with (I think) 152mb of usable internal memory, which isn't much once you realize what apps can do. Max SD storage is 32G, which I have. You can only move some stuff to SD, and I put whatever I can there.  Like everyone else I got app happy at first and downloaded lots of goofy fun junk, then jettisoned it too make room for the things I really need, but even keeping it to things I only use regularly, it's not enough and there's stuff out there I could really use but can't wedge onto this thing.  I don't understand why so little internal memory, when otherwise it's a pretty nice phone.  Virgin is not great about letting you know the reality of the phone specs either.  Tiny internal brains is a serious limitation.  Since this phone's screen isn't big enough to make it a media center or gaming machine, they should have given it enough brains to make it useful as a workhorse at least.As a phone, which is my least preferred method of communication (in part due to bad hearing), it is an improvement over the Rumor Touch.  I get better reception in more places, and the calls are clearer.  When connected to wifi it's almost as good as a landline.  I haven't bothered setting up voice dialing but probably will at some point.The camera is ok. I will never shovel enough money into a phone to have the camera nice enough to replace a proper digital camera, and I don't need to video chat, so I think it's fine for what it is.  Nice to be able to scan barcodes.I don't listen to music enough to warrant getting into specialized apps on the phone or my laptop, so I just manage my music and playlists in WMP and sync or copy it to the phone from there, which is a cumbersome process sometimes and requires deleting playlists and dumping them in fresh every time.  I use a bluetooth FM tuner in my ancient car and bluetooth earphones when I'm walking, and it works fine.Browsing is better than I expected and I've even played back some video on the Netflix app (now jettisoned) and YouTube that surprised me with the quality.  I don't think I'll ever want a phone that's so big I could reasonably use this for regular video viewing, but it's nice to be able to entertain myself when I'm stuck somewhere alone.This phone has put up with a lot of abuse, since I drop it constantly.  It has little dings all over but so far everything has just rolled right off its back.  I also like that it's NOT huge, and fits into a pocket or sleeve holder pretty easily. Wouldn't want one much bigger than this, because I like a proper screen for the sorts of things people seem to want to do on their phones these days.  I would keep it forever if the internal memory could be upgraded somehow, again, since nobody seems interested in making slider phones anymore.As a first Android phone, I'm very pleased with it. Android does some very handy stuff that makes the phone infinitely more useful, and I could see how someone might be able to get by without home internet or a 'real' computer with a nice Android (or other smartphone) if they had to.  Virgin makes it less expensive to move into this territory.I'll upgrade when this phone dies, or when they come out with a well-rated new slider.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low internal memory- have to hack it to install apps to your sd card", "Author": "kehrman5", "ReviewID": "R32YFI57AM9VQ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price this is a great phone.

There are many reasons why we love this phone.  First, we love the Virgin pay as you go plan.  We find it inexpensive and it provides us with many wonderful services, like unlimited texts and surfing the internet (although on the Rumor, it was clunky and slow).  We don't make a lot of phone calls.  We decided that we were ready to take the next step and get an Android phone that would allow us to look things up on the internet during discussions with friends, as well as have access to  apps like an iPhone does.  With the Optimus we have fast internet access both on 3G and when we're home or at friend's houses via wifi.  There are so many fun and useful apps that work well on this phone. The main ones we are using (HeyTell and What's App) allow us to text and speak (kind of like a walky-talky) for free to our family and friends in Europe.  The Facebook app is a little clunky, but we don't mind waiting for our computer to go on Facebook.  It's also great to use an app like Yelp and find the closest restaurants or services that we need.Negatives are few, but one is important.  The battery life is horrible.  It barely lasts half of a day.  I knew this before buying the phone and read that if we downloaded a certain app, our battery life would be extended.  Now we have downloaded \"Easy Battery Saver\" and our battery lasts all day long.The only other negative is less important.  The slider keyboard is a bit more compact than our previous cell phone, and if you want to type numbers you have to push the \"fn\" key before each number.  That is really annoying.  A positive is that it has autocorrect for things like words with apostrophes like 'I'm' and it will always capitalize the letter 'I' when it stands alone in a sentence.  And the autocorrect does not over correct.It is a heavier and bigger phone than the Rumour, so it's not easy to just stick it in your front pocket.Amazon.com offered the phone cheaper than other online stores.Overall, we bought this phone so that we could have something akin to the iPhone without having to purchase a data plan or be stuck in a contract and we are very happy with what we've got.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect upgrade to Optimus V!", "Author": "Dr. StrangeBrew \"marekjjones\"", "ReviewID": "RELVGXVXNEC95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned the Optimus V.

Very Pleased!", "Author": "T. Brown", "ReviewID": "R1E5J171SM9EUB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been with Virgin Mobile since 2010.  I switched from T-Mobile (Wing was the smartphone I had) to save money and to not be tied to a contract after being laid off and out of work for almost 2 years. Though this isn't my first smartphone, the one I had ran Windows and had lots of problems.Because I was being budget-conscious when I made the switch from contract plans to pre-paid, my first VM phone was the LG Rumor Touch.  It's not a smartphone but it was touch screen and I had internet and email access.  I kept having prolems with the touch screen and realized that the phone just didn't do enough for me as a non-smartphone. I had to switch the phone out at least three times. I was reluctant to buy another LG phone.After having so many problems with my Touch, I decided to buy a new phone.  I wanted either the EVO or the IPhone because my friends who have them swear by them. I was leaning toward the IPhone but I couldn't bring myself to pay $600 for a phone made out of glass with no keyboard, and my friends who use Android said I can do just as much with an Android phone that I could with an IPhone.  I didn't want to spend $300 on the EVO either so I decided to go for the LG Optimus Slider ($179.99 at Target) because it was more in my budget. I had no knowledge about this phone prior to the purchase.I've only had this phone just over 24 hours and I'm in love!  It's a very sturdy, well-built phone and doesn't \"feel\" cheap. Because I am new to Android, I'm like a kid in a candy store adding all the apps. I don't know how it is in terms of the cost of apps for the IPhone, but so far, every app I wanted that I've added from Google Play (Android Market) has been free. I was also going to buy a separate GPS device for my car but the Google Navigator app comes free on the phone with voice-activated, turn-by-turn directions without the extra cost of a monthly subscription (I had to pay $5 a month for navigation on the Touch). So now I'm saving money on navigation subscriptions and not having to pay extra for another device. I needed a phone with a good calendar and it has great apps for calendaring.Pros:-It's a great phone with lots of features and cool free apps.-It runs and downloads various apps pretty quickly.-Has a keyboard.-Syncs very well with Facebook.-Great smartphone for the price.Cons:Battery life isn't so greatIt may not be as tricked out as an Iphone or HTC Evo, but it does a lot for half the price--and less than half the price of the IPhone.Now I can't say that this phone is better than the EVO or the IPhone because I've never used either one and this is my first Android experience.  I would say that this phone would make a great purchase for someone on a budget looking for a great smartphone and is new to the Android experience.If you are a non-smartphone user looking to make the switch to Android, (and if you are tired of dealing with contracts) this is a great first buy!", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best VM Phone with a Keyboard to date.", "Author": "Martin Brown", "ReviewID": "R1Q6XDABXKHTBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, some background. I have owned several Virgin Mobile phones. Starting with the Rumor Touch - which was OK, but I needed more. Then the Samsung Intercept, which was an acceptable Android Phone if all you used it for was calls and texts and never installed an app. Apps would take 10-30 seconds to load, even after the update to 2.2. Following that I owned the Optimus V, which was a couple miles ahead of the Intercept. The extra processing power gave it a little more oomph. It did have one flaw, however, which was solved by this phone. The Swype text input on the Optimus V was extremely annoying! The Slider has a great slide-out keyboard.Coming shipped with Android 2.3, the LG Optimus Slider uses its extra processing power to its full potential. The available memory seems to be greater as I still have ~35-40MB internal free after installing all of my apps and moving what I can to the SD card. Apps open almost instantaneously on this phone, and are much more responsive than the other VM Android phones I have experience with. Service is great as it always has been for me (YMMV). A fully charged battery will give me a full day's usage with JuiceDefender turned on.The one, and possibly only flaw I have with this phone and it's predecessor, is that the Max Volume isn't really MAX enough.

I could tell lots of falling and breaking was in my future with this phone, so Virgin Mobile and the Optimus Slider won the day.Things I like:-This phone is much faster than what I was accustomed to on the myTouch, and thank goodness for that. I was having a hard time with the updated Android 2.2. on the old hardware, lots of crashes (Maps especially) and lags and generally reboots. So far, the LG Optimus Slider has been a breeze, and has Android 2.3.-LOVE the qwerty keypad. I can't touch type to save my life and the number of typos and nonsense I have texted my friends is sad to recount. This makes my work life so much nicer (I can be productive on my commute, work on documents, etc.)-Turns on quickly. The myTouch took over 3 minutes (I timed it).

Not going to replace a camera by any means, but for something like Instagram photos, it works fairly well.Things that suck:-This phone has LESS internal memory than my old myTouch, which means I can't install the same amount of apps as I used to have, and/or have to save to the SD card (which, sadly, too many apps don't allow). That's just ridiculous, and makes my next point that much more frustrating.-Undeletable BLOATWARE. There are 4 specific apps that are just dumb and I plan to root and delete eventually. I do understand the carrier apps being permanent to the phone, but the 3rd party crap? Annoying.-Battery is NOT good. I keep leaving the satellite/sync features on and my phone is low battery by the time I leave work. Turning off these features when not in use greatly improves battery life, but I'm still charging it nightly, so YMMV. You can buy extended batteries/covers online, so there's always that option.-No \"touch home to wake up\" feature. You have to root and remap the buttons to get this functionality back. I'm just going to see if I can retrain my brain to press power to wake.-Video is not very good.-microUSB.

LAVIOLETTE \"brightondale\"", "ReviewID": "R1295XCW7OG2Y1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is noticeably faster then the original, non slider Optimus, but the battery life isn't as good. I guess this stands to reason that a faster processor will consume more power. After conditioning the battery, I've found it to only give a 5 day charge, instead of  7 days like the original Optimus (using Juice Defender, extreme setting on both). That's not bad and I really don't complain at all. Upgrading to this slider version of the Optimus, I didn't expect a difference in battery life, but there was. Before I loaded Juice Defender, I was having trouble getting just a full day out of a 100% charge. I've since learned you need to keep it on the charger for quite a while after it reaches 100%. It takes about 4 hours to reach 100% charge from empty and I've found by keeping it on the charger for an additional 4 hours, the charge will last much, much longer. Maybe there are some battery experts out there to say this is bad for the battery, but if it is bad for it I'll deal with it to get extra long battery life. One day to a charge just doesn't cut it for me.As with the original Optimus, I really like phones with real Android buttons at the bottom vs touch screen buttons that most Androids have. The original Optimus went a step further by putting space in between the buttons and at first I missed that, but now I don't mind.My biggest complaint about this phone is the location of the SIM card. You have to remove the back cover to get at the SIM card. This is a big pain if you also use a case like from Body Glove.Another big complaint about the original Optimus and this slider version is the lack of internal memory. I guess for most, this would be the biggest complaint, but for me, I don't load that many that many apps.It would be nice if either of these phones had a light sensor to allow automatic screen dimming, but I guess you get what you pay for and that's part of the reason I was able to buy this phone for only $65.The camera isn't that great as well, but I'm just used to phones having poor camera quality. If I ever get an iphone, I'm sure I would quickly change my thoughts on that.All in all, it's a great phone. If you're set on getting a slider phone for Virgin Mobile, this is the one to get. The Samsung Intercept is the only other one (at this time) and it is worthless. I know, I owned one. See my review on that phone to see why. What's funny is that I upgraded to this phone for the slider keyboard, but I got so used to not having one in the original Optimus, I rarely ever use the keyboard.

Before I got the phone I purchased 2x OEM BL44JN 1540MAH batteries of which its standard just encase. For the first few days with the OEM batteries I only got around 4 hours of use per battery at the time. Downloaded the Juice Defender app. each battery lasted me atleast 6-7 hours on normal use. Later bought an extended battery 3850mah(still skeptic on the mah 2 1/2x the power of the OEM) from Sporting Persistence. Battery life significantly increased to a days worth.Apps & Storage:Appspace is limited to around 150-160mb's. This forces me to think hard on which apps I want to keep. I remember reading that if I reach its limit the phone will not work properly as intended. So I limited myself to 10 downloadable apps leaving 40mb of extra space to be safe. Most of the apps run fine with no slowdown unless they happen to be emulators with games that require faster processing.Stuck with Gingerbread OS. That means I can't use apps meant for later versions. Also since the LG OS uses the ARM/6 CPU some apps that can be run on Gingerbread may not work if using this processor.Physical Keyboard:it's bigger than my Rumor2's physical keyboard pleasant to type with. However major downside for me is the backlight for  the keys. Unlike the Rumor2 the backlight doesn't stay lit. They automatically shut off a few seconds later unless pressed. I can't find the options if any to keep them lit. So my nightly texts are a bad experience in this regard.Camera:Max Picture size is 3.2mp while video is the old VGA 640X480 standard. Reminds me of the P&S; cameras prior 2005.Considering the small CCD it has its not best in lowlight at all. Picture quality is okay, and usable still not on par with my old Canon A310 from 2004. Physical camera shutter  button on the phone doesn't respond very well if wanting to take multiple photos. So the onscreen shutter button is best be used in that regard. Lacks a timer and flash. So essentially good enough only in well-lit conditions, but not with fast moving subjects. Video quality is the same with picture quality. Definitely not replacing my P&S; camera at all.Overall its a decent low-end handset for me as a texted.Didn't touch on every single detail, but eh  likely prior reviewers already done so.I do recommend getting a battery extender for this phone especially the fat variety that comes with a backplate for it.

Donato", "ReviewID": "R3144QXTD0XGP2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hello,This is my first review, so you won't find any under my name. But I am a real customer. It's taken a lot for me to even write this. I was looking forward to using Virgin Mobile since I've also used AT&T; and Verizon. But I wanted a phone with a lower monthly charge. The phone is great. I can get emails, surf the net, the battery life is much longer than I expected, and I make calls just fine. The one thing I can't do is receive text messages, which is about 90% of my communication. I can send them and they are received by the other parties. But I have yet to receive a single text message from anyone outside of the Virgin Mobile (VM) network. Since all of my friends and co-workers are either on AT&T; or Verizon, text messaging is useless. I called VM customer service: my phone was reset three times with no result. I called again and was told to turn off the phone, reseat the battery after 15 seconds, then restart the phone. I was assured that in 10 to 15 minutes, all my text messages would display. I did that process twice and still no messages. I called two more times to hear from the first \"live advisor\" that it would take 4 days to fix the issue. I was horrified. When I called back again to say that amount of time really wasn't acceptable, I was told by the second advisor that it would take 9 business days. I could not believe what I was hearing. I asked to speak with a manager. None were available. When I expressed amazement, disappointment, and annoyance at the situation, I was told only then that they would expedite my ticket to resolve it in 24 to 48 hours. Now seriously, their network isn't connected properly to AT&T; and Verizon? I can't possibly be the first person who's had this issue. And I can't believe that something so basic has been overlooked and that the amount of time it takes to resolve it is so long. I gave this two stars because if the network isn't functioning properly and you are primarily a texter, the phone is useless. This is strictly a VM phone. It's not like an iPhone where you can change providers. So be sure if you get this phone to immediately test to see if you get text messages. If you aren't, call in for a ticket immediately. If you are like me, the wait will be unbearable.Once this situation is resolved, I'll add an update. And I might change the rating depending on how quickly they resolve the issue. I was told that they would adjust my monthly change for this month since I've not been able to use the feature.UPDATE:The text issue was given to the tier-2 department and was partially fixed within 24 hours. I made sure that I could receive texts from my AT&T; and Verizon friends.I even sent myself SMS from gmail. That worked also. Unfortunately, I no longer get automated text messages from Amazon when a product is shipped nor when a delivery is made. This is a big deal since I order a lot of supplies from this site. In Amazon, I made sure to update the service provider for my phone. And even though Amazon Customer Service and I both updated my information, I'm still not able to receive texts from them. When I called VM to see if they could correct it on their end, I was told that they can't handle automated text messages. Bummer!As for the phone itself, the sound quality isn't as good as other providers. I get a lot more, \"what did you say?\" from people. Dropped calls happen a little more but not much to cause serious annoyance. And since I'm paying less than half what I used to, I can live with it.UPDATE: September 7thHere are some additional issues I've been dealing with.Amazon text messages: I'm still not getting them even though VM now saying that I can get automated text messages. They keep insisting that it's an amazon issue. But I've called Amazon customer service and I'm fine on this end. Tier-2 techs are still working on the problem. But since this is the third separate time I've called about this issue, I'm not holding my breath that it will be resolved.Storage space: I purchased this cell in April. By July, I started getting low storage messages. I haven't downloaded a lot of apps, or store a lot of pics or music on the phone. A big part of the problem is that there are default apps on the phone (like Facebook, Twitter, Poynt, SCVNGR, etc.) that I can't delete or move to the SD card. These apps take up a lot of space. Once my cell gets to a certain storage level, I can't read new text messages (which is my primary form of communication). I have to delete apps I want to make space just to read new TMs. That's happened about 3 times already, and it takes a while before I can read the messages so yes it's very annoying. There's apparently a way to freeze unwanted apps using titanium backup. I haven't researched it yet, so I can't say how effective it is.Minor email issue: I get email from gmail and hotmail on my phone. When I get a hotmail message, I get notified once per incoming email. However, with gmail I get two notifications per email: one from my gmail app, and one from the phone. I called VM Customer Service to find out if I could turn one of the notifications off. Sadly, the answer is no, I can't do that.Dual Phone numbers: Some cell phones can support two phone numbers at once. This phone doesn't have that feature. When I called VM CS to ask if they had phones that could support dual numbers, I got a very sarcastic response. She actually laughed at me and said no cell phone could do that. I politely said that there were phones that could support two numbers and that she clearly answered my question. I'm actually pretty tech savvy, so I could have done without the sarcasm. But to actually laugh at customer who's asking a question is just down-right rude.VM CS: I can tell that the customer service reps try to be polite. But even as some of them try to be, they can be pretty condescending.  As a result I'm not always patient with them when they talk down to me. Another pet peeve I have is that they shorten my first name even when I give them my entire first name. It wouldn't be so annoying if it weren't for the fact that they say my name in every sentence.On the positive side: The phone is durable. I'm a bit of a klutz and have dropped the phone a few times. It still works, hasn't exploded on contact, and hasn't cracked. For that, I'm very grateful.

You must have a charger with you if you leave the house for more then 3-4 hours and you plan on heavy use.

The Optimus Slider is worlds faster and more reliable than my previous Virgin Mobile phone the Samsung Intercept but it still has some problems. It occasionally shuts down and the only way to restart is to remove the battery. Also, sometimes it will get really hot and blow through all your battery power in about an hour as if every app on the phone is running at once. To alleviate this problem I highly recommend the Advanced Task Killer by ReChild. Installing this app appears to have fixed that problem but I have to be dilligent about killing apps. Other than these two issues I've been happy with this phone especially coming from using one of the worst smartphones ever, the Intercept. However, if it breaks I probably won't buy it again. I'll be tempted to try out something else. Overall though I don't regret purchasing this phone and it was worth the low $180 price.

I have a cell phone, not Virgin Mobile, and it works just fine from my house. Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint Network. Before I purchased the LG Optimus V Slider I searched their Coverage Map on the internet from my house, at the library and went to a Sprint Store to make sure I had coverage from the Sprint Network. They all said I had coverage at my address. So, I purchased the phone. What could go wrong? What could go right, nothing!!!!?  I called Virgin Mobile to activate the service, and I was connected to someone in India who told me I didn't have service at my address. I told her three maps from Virgin Mobile and one from Sprint from different locations said I did have coverage at my address. She said \"so sorry\" and hung up. Then I emailed Virgin Mobile and asked them about the issue. That was a week ago and I haven't heard back from Virgin Mobile. They said in the auto response they had a huge backlog of requests. I wonder why? So, I am going to return the phone and stay away from Virgin Mobile forever. Some people swear by Virgin Mobile, I am inclined to swear at them.

I used to own a LG Optimus V before but then I ACCIDENTALLY washed it in the washing machine. It sucked when I heard slams in the drier and thought to myself \"wheres my phone?\"But, oh well. Now I have this one and I am glad that I bought it. It is definitely an upgrade from the old Optimus that I had. The 3 big things that I have noticed are these:1. Sleeker UI (user interface) It is black instead of the regular white I think it is because of the new version of the Operating system which is 2.3 instead of 2.2 on the old Optimus.2. It is much snappier thanks to the new processor going at 800mhz instead of 600mhz.3. The most obvious thing that they did with the phone is add a sliding QWERTY keyboard which I hardly use cause I am still used to typing with the screen.All I have to say is that this phone is definitely an upgrade from my old one.

Not knowing the optimus slider was coming out soon, I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Indulge for MetroPCS. However, on top of Metro's poor customer service and already bad coverage, I also had to deal with a phone with what was probably a bad antenna and suffered a constantly dropping data signal. The issue was unable to be resolved despite a number of phone calls and I got fed up and went back to Virgin Mobile with the Optimus Slider. It was less expensive than my Indulge and has a slower processor, also some of the apps I had on my Indulge aren't compatable with this phone for some reason. Also I miss having an extra row on the keyboard for numbers like my Indulge had, and don't like having to press the \"Fn\" button for each number. I guess I just have to get used to it, I imagine there is less space on the keyboard because the whole phone is a bit smaller.Overall, though, I am glad for my decision. I'm glad to be back with virgin mobile, which is definitely a superior company to metro, and I am glad to have a reliable data connection even if it is only 3G, my metro phone was 4G and although there were times when it ran very quickly, it was in reality usually very slow (when I had a connection at all-and I'm supposedly in a maximum coverage area).

Back in the day when apps were small in size, i was on cloud 9. Nice size, responsive and qwerty keyboard was all i needed.  Although i did have sporatic functioning of the wifi. Where it would connect to the network then after an idle period would not transmit data. I looked over that prob b/c all i had to do was stop and start wifi to get it to work again. That still happens btw. Fast forward to 2014 and you have problems.1. 512 internal memory - This doesn't cut it for todays apps. Unless you don't install any apps your going to run into memory issues. I've rooted mines in order to install Link2SD which allows you to put internal memory apps on the SD card. That in itself isn't a clear fix b/c even though the app is linked to sd , memory usage still registers under internal memory. Belive me, it sucks when your phone starts giving low memory warnings. It causes you have problems running apps and upgrading them. Almost all apps upgrade frequently and with each update they eat more memory. ( i screen updates now for that reason). That trend won't be ending anytime soon with the larger memory phones coming out.2.  Small screen - most phones these days have large screens that make it easier to type using the screen instead of a qwerty keyboard. (don't get me wrong, i still love the qwerty, but it seems to be going away on newer phones)3. Camera isn't worth using. No flash, any (and i mean ANY) movement creates blurred pics. low light pics are extremely dark but its a low end phone so you shouldn't expect much. But when i compare to some newer phones it makes me want to slowly hide my phone in my back pocket.  Just keep a point and shoot handy.I think nowadays this is more of a older persons phone.

It broke about a month ago and the touch screen COMPLETELY doesn't work. I can't use the screen and if it weren't for the keyboard, I wouldn't be able to use the phone. I had to use all apps by using the arrows on the keyboard. I have reset the entire phone twice and it still won't work. The overall phone (while it worked...) was great. If you switched from OV there are a lot of benefits...Plus---The keyboard is A LOT faster than swype or the regular android keyboard on the OV and makes typing very easy.-The speech to text search app in the phone works great and a lot better than the OV-No \"butt-dialing\" -- the phone doesnt open by touching any of the home buttons on the bottom of the device.-Sound is louder but not too much better for quality.-Faster and better looking quality on the screen.-The phone is really comfortable in your hands, yet still a good size (not too big or small)-The camera is *a little* bit better than the OV. Takes better picture .-Battery life much longer! Lasts at least 3 hours longer than OV-Call quality betterCons---Very little space -- I had constant notifications that I could not download apps because I was low on space. I.e., I suggest getting a second microSD for extra space when needed.-I don't know if anyone else has been in my situation of it breaking, but it could happen on another slider or with a similar situation.OVERALL:I think this is a great phone for someone who wants to be able to connect easily and doesn't have time to slow down in there lifestyle. Although if you've had the OV before, you probably won't see much of a difference. That just might be me. I recommend it for people who want a smartphone that is simple and easy to use.

I switched to the Slider off of an older, clunkier phone that barely had a \"store contacts\" feature. Now I've had it for several months and I'm pretty happy with it.The Android OS makes it very intuitive, customizable, and fun. I've dropped it twice from elbow height and both times there wasn't a scratch on it. It sometimes takes a while to open processor-heavy programs but in general is pretty quick with most of its functionality (barring shoddy apps that crash if they aren't designed well). The full keyboard might be a difficult adjustment if you've never had a smart phone before, but in general I'm pretty happy with it, and the sound is surprisingly crisp, even when you use speaker phone. The external speaker is a little tinny with music, but it IS a phone. Likewise, the camera (3.2 megapixels) gets the job done if you have good lighting, but it isn't exquisite.Virgin Mobile is a great provider if you're like me and live in an urban environment. In big cities, it's everything you need: cheap ($35/month for a great data plan, hot damn), reliable, and reasonably fast (3G is all right, but it's much faster when connected to wifi). However, beware if you stray too far from a city, as you'll lose reception pretty quickly.Overall, it's a great phone.

It was my first smartphone and I was impressed right off the bat. While the camera seriously sucks (worse than my last phone which was also 3.2 MP) the overall phone was alright. I found that it's very hard to use the sliding keyboard with my long fingernails, but Swype and voice command works well enough that I don't need it. If someone sends a group message it comes in blank every single time, which is really annoying. The battery power isn't terrible (though it isn't good, either). The speaker is of decent quality. Over all I thought it was a workable phone...It's been 4 months now and this phone is already starting to have serious problems, I regret my purchase a little more each day. I'm a very light user, mostly texting and navigation with a few apps that are from trusted companies. The phone freezes constantly, just about every time I use it now, even if it's just a simple text. Sometimes the phone won't respond at all no matter how long I wait to the point I have to pop the battery out.At the end of the day I definitely wouldn't recommend this phone, or any LG phone for that matter.This is my third LG phone, and the third phone I've had problems with before the 2 year mark.I'll never buy another LG product again!--------------------I've endured this phone for 8 months now and I hate it more than words can describe. I was hoping to use this phone for 2 years but I just can't deal with it anymore.It's the worst cell phone I've ever owned, hands down.This phone freezes every single time I send a text. Every. Single. Time. If I never have more than 50 messages it will unfreeze within a few seconds, but any more than that and it takes several minutes for it to become responsive again.As of last week it has decided to start freezing as the alarm is going off, forcing me to either listen to it until it unfreezes or I have to pop the battery out.I've done a factory reset 4 times now and I've deleted all the apps that I don't absolutely need, which is a very temporary solution and it completely defeats the purpose of having a smart phone.I like to donate my old electronics, but no one should have to experience this piece of garbage.

Ramos \"Doc Taz\"", "ReviewID": "RNHA1OQG2JVS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't currently own this phone. Still, I've been able to sort of play with one for a few days. The processor is faster, so in stock form, is more user friendly compared to the V. Memory is still an issue, but like the V, if you only need a few apps, this shouldn't be a problem. Many apps can be moved to the SD card, and yes, the phone can be rooted if needed. The CPU can't tolerate much overclocking or underclocking; it can only go about 50 MHz in either direction before problems arise.I'm basing this review on a few days of use with a phone that I helped my dad choose. He wanted a model with a QWERTY keyboard, as too many touchscreen actions don't appeal to him. I have no plans to root his phone, though I may explain the process to him further if he is seriously interested in it. Otherwise he is happy with the way the phone works, so I don't foresee having to do this for him. If this were my next phone, yes, I would root it. There are a few ROMs available for the Slider, including the Mobster ROM. Most of the devs for these ROMs also don't recommend clocking the processor more or less than 800 MHz. The reason of this is of course the overclockers' classic enemy: heat buildup. Nothing's worse than a phone that turns to toast when you least expect it.All of that being said, it is possible to do a bit more than the usual with this phone. The keyboard can be useful if you run terminal emulators. Remember DOS and GUI-less UNIX terminals? Yeah, you know who you are! Type away all the Linux commands you can remember; most of them work here. :) Games? It does run quite a few well. I tested a 3d golf game, and a motorcycle 3d racer. Both ran fairly smoothly, with little slowdowns. YouTube video ran well, too. Web surfing is quite good for a lower end Android phone. You'll notice it when zooming full size pages to size.In short, this really is an improved version of the V. My only niggle is the lack of LED flash for the camera. At this point, that might break the deal for me, as I am fairly adept at touchscreen typing, after a year of using the V. If you simply need a QWERTY, this is still one of the better deals for a no contract phone in the USA, in mid 2012.

YAY ME! Anyway, with the Virgin Mobile plan of $35 a month, you can't go wrong. You will get everything an iPhone user gets for almost a third of the price!!! Me being a college student, this is what I need and can afford.OK, so this phone is AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT!!! Alright, the battery will most likely be bad (I never tried it), but install an Extended Battery for it like I did (READ MY REVIEW ON IT FOR MORE INFO!!!).Anyway, the slide out keyboard is awesome and useful when typing for accuracy. Speaking of typing, I DO NOT like the swype keyboard, but it is optional so don't worry. Now the slide out keyboard does have one big downside..The stupid back button is next to the A button.. So if you slip and click the back button, you will lose your typed message.. Also the spacebar on the slide out keyboard is complete TRASH. You literally have to push directly in the center in order for it to pick up the keypress, you can't just press the edge of the spacebar.. Whatever, it's still faster then the touchscreen when aiming for accuracy.Now, the phone does not have that much internal memory. Now you're thinking to yourself, \"It comes with an SD card, I don't need internal memory.\" WRONG! The stock apps suck up a lot more memory then you would think... Yes you can move some apps you download to the SD card, but most won't let you. So you won't be able to install a HUGE amount of apps. Plus remember that it will ask you to update apps (you can ignore it though) and that will use more internal memory for internal apps. Supposedly, you can ROOT and delete these stock apps, etc, but I'm not down for the risks and plus I haven't found a reliable up-to-date guide.As for the phone itself, I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I moved from a Pantech AT&T; Prepaid GoPhone to this phone and it is the best choice I've made in a long time! I have come across a couple Wi-Fi glitches, but maybe that's because I don't live in a cell service area..All in all, I recommend this phone to anyone wanting a GREAT smartphone with a top-line Operating System with a CHEAP monthly plan!

I can upload my videos straight to my youtube page, I can watch youtube and have so much fun on it, and google play has free apps, I have only gotten one of the apps but I have looked at the other apps they have and if your an app person this would be great for you!Its slides open real easy. It also arrived in the mail 2 days earlier than the estimated deliver time (earliest time)The picture quality is great.I am inlove with my phone and I would recommend it to any one who wants simplicity and a good looking phone, I like my phones to look good and this one is just wonderful :) This is so great and Im suprised that I paid this low of a price for a good phone like this.

Coming from a verizon bill nearly $100 dropping down to a $50 bill is a good thing. The few problems I have or had are a few dropped calls, but thats sprint I would think. On my last phone I was able to have my phone on vibrate and when someone texted it gave 3 long vibrations. This phone do not. It vibrates a quick second and thats it. It never notifies you again that you have a text. The same goes for a missed phone call, it makes no vibrations ever again if you missed a call. The only way for you to no if you have a text or missed a call is to look at your screen or this tiny little light that turns green. Also I cant find how to make 3 way calls, but thats probably just me, though I looked everywhere on how to do it. The phone is also a little slow to bring up web pages or anything that requires the net like hanging with friends game.

For example the manual says to plug in the micro-SD card, but this is hidden from easy access in the battery compartment.This phone is not recommendedFollow-up January 24th 2012 (This is also posted on comments):This phone is very difficult to use. For example the calendar will not easily link to G-Mail. It continually defaults to the daily view, and you need two more steps to get to the monthly view.The calendar in the new phone will not accept tasks or appointments, and I still have to figure out how to do this after 3 days of research. Also, using the calendar means defaulting to the Google online calendar which means expensive web use. I do not trust the Google calendar, as you now have no privacy and your records go in to the database.I am still looking for a small, simple calendar app, and will try the Pure Calendar app. (Found one : CalenGoo)New installed apps do not show up as icons (for example CalenGoo). You have to manually install it, and this is not easy. There is no weather icon, and hookup to the Weather Channel is not easy. The pull-out keyboard, whilst handy is not easy to use either.You have to read the manual over and over, or you will mess up.I find with my heavy use that the battery life is 10-12 hours, which is unacceptable.Follow-up February 9th 2012:I am now happier with the phone after a very detailed examination of the downloadable manual.I learn something new every day.But there are still problems:- Not easy to use- Battery life poor- Unable to install drivers from LG web site. This site is terrible.- Do not put a shell on the phone. It is very difficult to remove.- Buy a 16 MB microSD cardWhen you activate the speaker to listen to messages, and then have to punch in numbers to delete etc., you cannot use the onscreen keyboard, but have to use the pull-out with its awkward use.So..... I guess I'll try the Motorola Triumph, and probably get upset again. I'll have to wait for a truly great Samsung phone.I was spoilt with my HTC Inspire, and I long for the old days. Pity I'm so poor that I have to use Virgin Mobile.Definitely not recommended.Follow up Jan 28th:I now find the phone much better after installing:Astrid To-Do List and Reminder, JuiceDefender Ultimate (also need the free basic app), CalenGoo (Calendar) and Evernote.- I still don't like the poor battery life, and the need for a 180 page manual (downloaded from the Virgin Mobile site).- The manual that comes with the phone sucks as it is poorly printed, too small print and the icons indecipherable.- The camera is lousy and is only 3 MP. At least a 5 MP camera is desired,and would cost LG about 75 cents. The pictures are also hard to view.I now think that because of their Virgin Mobile's lousy phones that I should switch to another company.Truly awful customer service, with a human voice very hard to get.Still not recommended.Follow up one month later: (February 9th 2012)- Still hard to use.- The keyboard is hard to use with the light coming from the front. The red keys are invisible. Why LG did not make the keys white with black lettering is unbelievable.- The LG website is terrible. I have been unable to download the drivers for the USB port.- What really drives me crazy is when the phone rings when it is on sleep. Thee are three steps to answering. I've missed many calls.  In other phones, I just tap the screen and connect.Download the manual from the LG website and read it carefully. You will go crazy otherwise.([...])Don't buy a shell for the phone - it is difficult to remove.Do buy a larger micro-SD card (16 MB)I am happier with the phone now, but it is a beginner's phone, and is far from ideal.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone is a lemon, keyboard awful, Virgin HORRIBLE", "Author": "ScreamingMiMi", "ReviewID": "R3NSHIDRIJUC8E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Based on good reviews here and elsewhere I got this phone.  I wanted a physical keypad and you can't beat $35/month.Here it is in a nutshell.  Got phone Wednesday and called to port my old number.  Thursday the screen froze.  Called VM and guy disconnected me when he couldn't answer my question.  Called back and was told to remove battery.Saturday number still not ported.  Call VM who had the wrong acct number. Got disconnected on that call too.  Says it will be done in 3 hours. In 3 hours I try to activate my phone. Freezes again.  Call Vm again get a guy with a brain.Two hours after activation I could no longer get on the internet. I send an email and on the 4th go round someone finally escalates it. They say 5 days for an answer.  Sunday screen freezes while texting.  Monday texts show as being drafts even though they were sent.  I still cannot use my phone for anything but texting so it's going back and hello iPhone.The phone itself.  I'll talk about the keyboard since that was the big draw for me.  I have a few complaints about it.  First the keys are too rounded so for me they were really hard to type on.  Maybe that is a personal preference.  The function options are in red which are very difficult to see even in good light.The return key is right next to the A so every other word I would be back on the home page with a draft saved.  It was a major inconvenience.I cannot NOT recommend this phone enough if for no other reason than Virgin Mobile is horrible.  They say they are sorry for my problems like robots and after my 10th call it was so condescending I wanted to scream.So I am out $35 although I am going to write a scathing letter the Virgin Mobile Corporate.  I paid $35 for 30 days of use, not 21.  This is completely unacceptable.

I called back in 7 days and they said the ticket was closed because i was trying to port the number ? i said i only wanted to switch my account and number to the new phone , they opened a new investigation ticket and said they would get back to me and never called back.

I don't really blame the customer reps or even the techs , this is a problem with management. there seems to be nothing wrong with the phone and maybe its something to do with the phone being bought from amazon and not VM. my only option now is to try and return the phone. If you are considering VM for mobile service you should go to their facebook page and go back a couple of months to see their problems which are on other blogs also, i have been a VM customer for several years with out any problems but something happened recently with their managment.
