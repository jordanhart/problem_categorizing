I hate when people say they love the phone and it seems like a fake review but in all honesty, everything about this phone is incredible. The only negatives I've found is it isn't as fast (hardware wise) as a windows phone and you have to unlock the phone to change the song while listening to music. And if you're stuck between this and the s4, just consider the new Android 4.4 (kit kat) is coming out on the s3 and note 2 before christmas", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP, MOSTLY HATE TILL TODAY", "Author": "Harry Samuel", "ReviewID": "R3UEQ2B35PL2SO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The engineers of this phone forgot the field test it. What must have happened they left work to test it over the weekend, they ALL thought they forgot the test phones. Lets face it with the phone and its dinky OEM battery who knows they have it with them.WHY WOULD SAMSUNG THINK A 2100mAh BATTERY WAS RIGHT FOR THIS PHONE. THEY MUST DRINK A LOT, OR JUST PLAIN STUPID.Who makers a phone with a 5 hour battery?  Does anyone work a 10 our day in Korea? What about when your heart takes a little jump and you have a trip to the Emergency room at 1pm  and they keep you for 23 hours. And your phone battery only has 4 or 5 hours tops.What total jackass picks a 2100mAh battery ?????? drunk, high, crazy ?Go to Hyperion Battery web site and order REAL batteries. First usage I finished at 24 hours with the 4200mAh GREAT BATTERY first use, will undate over time. Follow this post.I have many other rants but this is the start. Start with the Hyperion 4200mAh direct from Hyperion, great deal, better than zerolemmon and other guy who sells bad batteries. Hyperion has the best, PERIODUPDATE 01/12/14 The Hyperion 7000aHm is to big, and really not needed. The 4200mAh is really the best choice. I got the 7000mAh, cut my OtterBox to fit as best it can, maybe in a few months of use the rubber will stretch for a better fit. The 7000mAh does not fit in the ZeroLemon without some cutting, have not done that yet.The 7000aHm WENT FOR 52.5 hours over three days. The size is an issue, and it might just be the battery I got, it is two batteries put together. I will call them to ask. Hyperion does not check size with the ZeroLemon.I will stand by my advice to buy two 4200mAh and then cut up an OtterBox or buy the ZeroLemon. It is impractical to charge any of the high capacity batteries in the phone if you plan on running them to 0% when they shut off as I do. The 7000mAh is a great battery, buy how often do you need 52.5 strait hours? I use a great low speed charger, now I can time how long that takes.I will use this cell phone for a long time, it does what I need, and very well, but if you buy it DO NOT BUY A SECOND SAMSUNG BATTERY, THE SAMSUNG CHARGER, and the Otterbox case (unless you have a dremel to cut up the OtterBox) it was all a waste of money. The Samsung battery is CRAP. You need to buy a ZeroLemon case and two Hyperion 4200mAh batteries. And hope the Hyperion are as good as I hope they are. Wish Samsung had made a good battery for an otherwise very good phone.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "along w/square trade this is another fantastic seller", "Author": "John J.", "ReviewID": "R1A4VG7CISKC3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought a Samsung Galaxy s3 from Oakland wireless on 2/3/14 and by 4/5/14 the screen had gone black...i emailed them thru amazons email system explaining the problem and the next day maybe sooner they had responded to my email...there was a few emails back and forth and for every one of them in a matter of hours they responded to me..they answered questions about accessing data i wanted to retrieve off the phone and other questions not related to returning the phone...quickly and in a way that was easy to understand. this seller is sending me a new phone with a free return label to send the defective phone back,and he's doing it without using the extended warranty...just on his own...if i could give this seller 10 stars i would.they really got me out of a bind!!! t-mobile wanted 150$ to replace the phone & Samsung  said that the warranty from them was for 1 year after they sent the phone to Oakland wireless....and they had it over a year so the only thing Samsung would do was try to fix the phone & they wanted almost 80$ to do it whether it fixed the phone or not..i had just paid 375$ for the thing & didnt have the money to do either of those return/fixes so when Oakland wireless stepped up and did what they did they sold me..i will be using this seller again!!! and i very highly recommend them to everyone!!!!!!!  they treat you the way you deserve to be treated. use this seller with a very high level of trust..they are a rare breed. i wish every seller was as good...heck 1/2 as good would be fine..this company is the cream of the crop..i dont know these guys from adam & im not connected to them in any way, shape, or form except for having purchased an expensive phone from them..and having them solve a messed up problem that really was looking like i was going to be stuck spending more money on a 400$ phone that was only 2 months, old that broke down...thank you Oakland wirless", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone at a great price", "Author": "Hojosan", "ReviewID": "R3GEI0CWL45ZYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a used S3 for the kids to use on our new T-Mobile account.

The things that bothered me is that, this seller claimed that they had screen gaurd on it since day 1 (not true) I did recieve it with a screen protector on screen however full of air bubbles and crumbs under it (Don't say something that is not true just to get customers, I stick with the companies that are straight forward and I doubt I'm the only one) and the other thing is thw the battery life, its a brand new phone to me so I still have yet to load up rhe memory, just wish mt battery wouldn't die in a 1/4day so I could actually use my phone.. ordered a new battery in hopes it works. Is what it is, ya get what u pay for and I went into it knowing it was used. Still a killer deal and awesome phone, was packaged nicely for shipping however charger I got with phone won't work.. oh well it is a super cheap charger at drug store down the road.

Beautiful design.  Runs very fast, plenty of memory and storage capacity, with purchase of separate 64GB micro SD card.  I actually get data downloads of 23+ MBps on my home wifi, which runs at 27-28 MBps.  My old Samsung was so slow, always using 90%+ of installed RAM, couldn't run the apps I wanted, it was a dinosaur smartphone (Galaxy Centura), only got 8-9 MBps on my same home wifi.  T-Mobile has a great promotion right now of a $30/mth plan with 5GB of 4G data but only 100 talk minutes.  For me, that's perfect.  Also, Samsung has a promotion with Dropbox where if Dropbox is pre-installed on a new Samsung device you get 24GB or 48GB of FREE cloud storage (depends on your carrier, with T-Mobile I got 48GB).  This was a surprise to me, just like free money.  I bought mine at a discount from the biggest big-box retailer, very happy with the phone.  So many features, it will take me a while to learn how to get the most out of it.  Will update review after some time.Update 2/25/2014:  Still love this 5-star phone.  Still learning how to use some of the features built into it, like S-voice.  I bought a couple spare batteries with a slightly larger capacity, so I always have an extra with me, but I rarely need it.  Gets me through the whole day fine on one charge.
