Reser", "ReviewID": "R3LXT31T25LVY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has it all. Apps, battery life, and ease of use.AppsPeople seem to be overly concerned about the total number of apps in a marketplace. I too was initially concerned about the number of apps but found out I shouldn't have been. I took the plunge buying a q10 specifically for its keyboard hoping that the apps would be there. I was happily surprised. Found every app I wanted and found in the process that it was possible to install android apps using a chrome extension and an online converter. It was so easy!Battery lifeThis phone keeps going and going. I swear I have an energizer bunny in my smartphone. Used the screen 7+ hours and still have 50% left. Used Pandora (Apollo) for a long time too. The phone wont die.Ease of useThe UI just makes sense. Might take a little to get used to, but coming from a Bold 9700 and a Jelly Bean tablet, I found myself swiping away easily beating my friends to open an app to check weather/traffic and among other things.Overall this phone has many great qualities. I just wish other people would give it a try. Android and iPhone have a lot to learn from Blackberry.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q10- what you should know", "Author": "Olenea", "ReviewID": "R262ES5UKVTFHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.First and for most, to me the best attribute of Q10 is its crystal clear call quality, speaker and sound that incomparable to any other device2.always great reception3.long battery life, plus battery is replaceable , so i will always have battery that can hold charge up to 2 days4.build quality, strong and pleasant to the touch, it feels very nice in the hands, made of premium materials5,keyboard buttons, it feels much better typing on actual buttons, plus there is bunch of shortcuts that touchscreen don't have6.as far as software--Ui is smoothbrowser is super fastcamera features are nicehub is usefulswipe features are clevernative apps looks greatcons- not all the downloaded apps from bb world work wellif you are coming from iOS things you will likegreat reception, call quality, hub for all notifications, faster typing experience, longer battery life, buid quality is more sturdy, better security of the platform( to whom it matters)thinks you won't like- you want like preinstalled  apps like maps, fb, ln, twitter, whatsapp- they all don't run as smooth as on iOS, also some big name apps missing- instogramm, Netflix, vine, viber, bank appsYou won't be able to sync through cloud to your macbook or iPad.you won't have siri, even thou there's pretty good voice commend app, but it is not as polished as siriif you are coming from previous gen bbyou will like- speed, speed, speed- this ui is much faster, browser is super fast compared to older bb, you will get more apps, better screen resolution, a bit bigger screen, same quality battery life, 4G speed, better camera, hubyou won't like making an adjustment to new user interface, you will be missing trackpad and dedicated call buttons at first, you won't like some modifications to apps, you will find some shortcuts from older bb missing.if you are coming from Android (sg)You will like buid quality, you will love call quality and you will be amazed by battery life, you will like having familiar features like nfc. you will like having hdmi port, expendable memory, you will like typing on keyboard and keyboard shortcuts. you will like new ui, and security features of blackberry- being able to decide what  type of personal info each app can get, and protected privacy of bb communication.you won't like Size ( its much different from galaxy) , you won't like not having some apps, and having some that don't work as good as on android,I recommend this phone to everyone, as long as you are informed about  what it does great and what it not.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Melissa Nesse \"meljes\"", "ReviewID": "RZGLX7HCPCNFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it, switched from Galaxy s3 and love to finally have a phone with buttons again!Easy to use and great phone!", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Q10!!!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3RHCR6ZQXN020", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay so before I begin with this review, I have a few caveat emptors. I have been using BlackBerry devices since 2005, only trying Windows Phone 8 and Android for only a few days each. As well, I've only owned this particular model since Tuesday. Lastly, I have the AT&T; version, SQN100-1, so mine is locked and has carrier branding. If you ask me, your experience with this one Amazon.com is selling will probably be much better!Okay, so I had (still have) a Z10 and was feeling dissatisfied with its mediocre battery life. By mediocre, it lasted from 10 AM to 7 PM to get to the red zone with heavy use. Apart from that, it was a marvelous phone. So, I looked at my AT&T; portal and it said I was eligible for a Next Upgrade and that they'll cancel my existing contract...and the Q10 was hella cheap! Nostalgia from my BlackBerry Bold 9900 made me feel compelled to buy the device. That keyboard is iconic to the BlackBerry brand and to its (rapidly dying) followers, it was the epitome of the subculture and a symbol of cultural identity. And so I ordered it!I got it from FedEx (although they just threw it to my yard. Rude) on Tuesday and immediately, I opened it. Turned it on. WOW, I needed some time to get used to the physical keyboard. But only 5-10 minutes. Haha but that swipe up to type gesture and the slide left to delete gesture from my Z10 is gone now because I have the physical keyboard! Now, I'm typing so incredibly fast on it and I tried to use the Z10 and I forgot how to type on touchscreens! In only 2 days!!! So why am I telling you this? Because this keyboard feels NATURAL to the thumbs. It involves no looking at your keys (although the special symbols might require some getting used to). The way your thumbs contour to the slightly raised edges of the keys. The two different shift keys. A dial pad built into the keys. It's just natural and it's how textual conversations should be like. None of that autocorrect stuff. Haha (although it does allow you to turn on word suggestions)The battery life on this device is AMAZING! Right now, I still have 50% battery life! I unplugged it at 10:30 AM ish (it's 10:36 PM right now). That's amazing! And only on a 2100 mAh battery too! Dual core processor clocking at 1.5 MhZ! It must be the software combined with the hardware! Take that, energy star!Okay, so you're probably thinking that I'm hypervalourising this thing because it's new and because I'm a \"fanboy\". First off, don't call me that. Haha but I'm serious with this device. The BlackBerry Hub is well integrated and the alerts pop up atop any screen you're on and you can reply without ever leaving that screen! BBM Voice sounds phenomenal, you'll think you're listening to HD radio. BBM Voice with screenshare for instant collaboration. Miracast and WiFi direct. The ability to download any android app (that doesn't require google accounts) through the google play store.You might think, oh the screen size is too small for me. Well, maybe you're right. To me, it works for viewing instagram and vine since those are all squares anyway. The quality of the screen is great too! It's good for emails, viewing pictures and videos (yes videos) and if you need it on the big screen, you can do miracast or plug it in with the native micro HDMI port! Yeah. Micro HDMI port.So, how am I having such a great time with this when other people online are hating theirs? They haven't upgraded to the latest BlackBerry 10 OS version (10.2.1.1925/10.2.1.537) which is HEAVENLY! Oh did I mention fast and lag-free? (take that, lagdroid!) and like I said, you can install android apps on it if you can't find your favourite app on the BlackBerry World app store. Download Snap (google play client for BlackBerry) or Amazon app store!This is definitely a work oriented device. Built in office suite, mdm, hella secure blah blah blah. But it can be a lot of fun too! At least I'm having fun with this. Oh I should also tell you that I typed all of this on that BlackBerry Q10. Yeah. Because it's so natural that it feels good to type on a small device for once! Beautiful too! Carbon fibre anyone?In sum, I highly recommend this device. I've said this before to many people: this must be how true love feels. Best decision upgrading. No I do not work for BlackBerry, you cynical person.

Email, text, scheduler, minimal browsing if I need to look something up RIGHT NOW, instead of waiting a few hours, when I don't have access to a computer. Even a screen the size of an ipad is too small to do any real work.I am not so insecure as to need constant ego stroking from acquaintances that I need to look at facebook or twitter hourly on a phone. Interacting with people is done in person. A phone is nothing but a tool.If I want to read a book, I get a paperback. If I want to watch a movie, I do it in the living room. If I want to use AutoCAD, Khan Academy, play computer games or use the internet for something, I use a desktop computer. If I want news, I listen to NPR or the BBC.I bought the Seidio BD4-HKR4BBQ10 Convert Case and Holster Combo for BlackBerry Q10 - Retail Packaging - Black to protect my phone. It is an excellent product. I cannot compare it to any other cases FOR THIS PHONE. I have used other Seidio cases before and have zero complaints after over four years of abuse working on an ambulance. This case has a lip about 5/16\" to protect the screen, and adds significantly to the bulk of the phone, but I find it much easier to hold, and I am quite reassured that my screen is safe from damage when I drop my phone. No Zebra stripes, no cute little animals, no flashy colors. Just plain black. Once again, WORKHORSE, not show-pony.I also bought the SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A  here on Amazon, and installed it. I formatted the micro SD card IN THE PHONE, just as if it were any other new SD card and it works fine.I do not like that I cannot uninstall some apps on the phone like the silly Games app or the Story Maker, which forces me to put them way far away in a screen I never go to. That is an issue with the OS though.I'd also like to get a replacement lower faceplate to get rid of the AT&T; Death Star logo, but other than that, I'm happy.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "It has it pluses and minuses.", "Author": "rjcmystic \"rjc\"", "ReviewID": "R28H4XSH5GZ6R8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been fond of Blackberry for years and have never been an icrack addict with all that unnecessary fluff.  So when the Q10 was released it immediately caught my eye since my Torch's browser was impossible to use.  I waited though and read reviews and did research. Finally I bit and obtained one.  I am still working through its features. The build quality is superior.  I loved having the keyboard retained.  The sound is impeccable.  the browser is fast and a joy to use over the previous versions.  The cons.  Well I am not a fan of the Hub. I liked viewing my e-mail accounts separately. Moreover the active sync feature would be great to have, if you could disable it. Why?  Because if you use a web e-mail based system you cannot delete your e-mails on the blackberry and retain them on your web account.  By deleting them on the blackberry you delete them everywhere.  This wasn't the case with all the old blackberry's.  Why is this unfortunate? Well if you want to keep a particular e-mail you need to leave it on the Blackberry, which then eats up your usable memory and eats up your battery life, making the unit relatively unusable. I've now got to go into my web mail and transfer it before I can delete it on the Blackberry ( no I do not use Outlook ).  Blackberry used to be great for business e-mail use.  Now while improving the browser functions they have minimized its usability for us e-mail addicts.
