{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I HOPE PEOPLE READ THIS BEFORE THEY ORDER", "Author": "Jeff T", "ReviewID": "R2Z7ZGSODK05V1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At the time I was reviewing my options to order a phone, I read the different comments by the sellers, as well as the feedback by previous buyers.  I cannot stress the importance of this when ordering a phone.The long and short is that I ordered the same device from another seller first.  And in the selling comments, it \"implied\" that the device will ship quickly.  However, if you read the fine print, or the delivery window, that truly told the story.  It is my belief that certain sellers may actually list an item more than once, and over the several week timeframe they have to ship it out, well, I beleive they end up shipping it to the highest bidder.  Basically, I never received the phone that was described as perfect.  Might be a scam.That brings me to this seller.  Not only did I receive my phone, (described as good condition), but in reality, the phone i received was FLAWLESS!!It truly was PERFECT!!  The original apple box was intact, the headphones, charging cord, and outlet were all in the original packaging sleeves, and the phone looked brand new!! Not even a tiny scratch.We just activated it yesterday, and so far so good. So I'm just saying, if you are looking at buying a used iPhone, make sure you consider buying from a seller with reviews...and good ones at that. I really think this is important to share with others looking for iPhones.  Especially after having the bad experience in trying to buy from someone who posted a long delivery window.  I believe the delivery window gives them time to achieve the most amount of money while the people who ordered it had their dreams crushed while waiting for a phone they thought they would receive.What happens, is that at the end of the delivery window, the seller will send a bogus apology letter to the buyer stating that they could not ship it because they found some malfunction on the device.I SWEAR THIS HAPPENS!! I have such a letter to prove it from an order placed (on a different cell phone) several months ago!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy used...", "Author": "Tom \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R3R92G0N16Z5WW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "...without checking the serial number against the lost and stolen list with your carrier.

A Verizon Wireless rep suggested that used phones purchased through one of Amazon's used item stores where probably a safe bet. Referencing an email from Amazon based on my past searches, I looked at the phones sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals.This was a used phone, packed in the original Apple sealed packaging. No problems, cosmetic or otherwise. Phone was easily set up and activated without any assistance from Verizon Wireless service reps.When activating your phone to replace the dead phone, be sure to use the \"Reset to Factory Settings\" option under settings which essentially makes your used iPhone a \"new\" phone. I also found my current iCloud backup on the phone and restored that so that my apps and contacts would be current.Dialing *228 from the new phone will contact Verizon Wireless and activate the replacement iPhone. You will be prompted for the number of the phone you are replacing and the last four digits of your Social Security number to verify you are the legit owner of the account (you were asked for this info when the account was created). In a few seconds, your new phone will be activated and ready to use.There is no need to follow the documented iTunes activation procedures to get the replacement phone online.Regardless of what other articles say, there was no need to know the ESN (MEID) of the old or new phones or remove the battery to find this info (note that a charged iPhone displays its MEID under settings).", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I ordered a 32GB and was delivered a 16BG", "Author": "Mr. Mobile007", "ReviewID": "R37ZA2IGCVLMVP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I dislike that I was misinformed about the the product.

Freeman", "ReviewID": "R1SC0LY1CQQNMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family has a Verizon family share plan with unlimited data.  With Verizon's new policies, we cannot get any more subsidized phones without losing our unlimited data plan.  We currently need to replace a few phones with \"global\" phones, so I have been looking at either purchasing new without contract, or purchasing used.I took the risk and purchased a \"used - like new\" phone from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  The phone arrived in the original box, but the box was rather messy and held shut with scotch tape.  Inside the package, the charger, cable, and headphones were all there and appeared to be unused.The phone itself had no scratches whatsoever but did have a tiny nick in one corner.  However, I had to look hard to find it.  Under casual inspection, the phone appears brand new.  The prior owner must have protected the phone well with case and screen protector.The phone had been fully reset and cleared so it came up the same as a factory fresh phone.  I had no trouble activating the phone with my existing Verizon account.  This was my biggest worry because I have purchased used phones before that had been stolen or lost and Verizon would not activate them.  In general, if a phone is replaced under warranty, then the original phone cannot be re-activated.The only problem I have was that the micro-SIM card was missing.  Normally, Verizon provides a micro-SIM tied to your own number that is used when you are travelling internationally and need to use the GSM network.  It is possible that, even if the SIM was provided, it wouldn't have worked for me.  I made a quick call to Verizon, and they are sending me a free SIM in the mail.I have only been using the phone for two days now.  The battery seems to be holding a charge well.  I will update this review if I have any problems with the battery.So far so good.  If I don't have any problems in the next few weeks, I will be buying another from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  I am still uncomfortable with purchasing a used phone from a random vendor.=== Updated Jan 2014 ===Nine months later, and all is well.  I have now purchased three \"like new\" 32G iPhone-4S models from Amazon Warehouse Deals so everyone in the family has a global phone.  The first two came in previously used iPhone boxes.  The third came with plain cardboard packaging.  All three phones were in great shape and all three came with headphones, charger, and USB cable.  I have no complaints whatsoever and will buy from Warehouse Deals again.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Belia", "ReviewID": "R28BSODXIWSBGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPhone was a gift for my granddaughter and upon receiving the iPhone we had difficultly trying to activate the iPhone with Verizon.

Business colleagues using Droids who have seen what I can do with Siri have frequently made a point to quickly find an Android Siri clone to install on their own phones.I mean, sure, the camera is fantastic.

However, there are some major applications I highly recommend you get as soon as you get this phone.  Trust me, your phone will love it.  But first, some key features I love about this phone.Display:  It's not AMOLED like the Samsung Galaxy, but it still has impressive viewing angles.  If you tilt the phone, the colors don't shift, like they do on your computer monitors.  The brightness dims a little but itn's nothing bad.Camera:  Wonderful pictures.  The 8MP camera makes my pictures look like a professional photographer (if you know the right apps)Craftsmenship:  I understand apple is criticized for overpricing their devices based on \"looks\".  Well there is truth behind this.  I think it goes behind the craftsmen ship.  While it doesn't have as spectacular edge and corner craftsmenship and an aluminum backplate designed to protect the display from drops unlike some companies that use plastic in the iphone 5, it still is minimalistic and seamless.APPS recommended, for any iPhone.1)  App Advice:  This tells you all the latest news in the Apple world, gives you loads of app guides and genre listings (ie Photography apps, Childcare apps,e tc.)and even tells you the free apps for the day.  Now why this is important is because they only list apps that have a GOOD score and have gone free for that one day, unlike other apps where they careless list apps that are free and have been for weeks or list apps that go free for a day but have sucky reviews.2) Camera +:  Once you are done taking pictures with your camera, take your photos into this and apply filters.  It makes your photos look 300% better, they really do.These two apps alone will: raise your phones value (supplying yourself with quality paid apps that you got for free) and make your phone look like a photo powerhouse.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I was looking for.
