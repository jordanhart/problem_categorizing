I know it is a knock off of a name brand phone so there has to be a real user manual some where.  The one that comes with it is in such small print it is very difficult to read And it doesn't give enough info for a person who has never had a touch screen anything.  I cant even find out how to make it ring loud enough to hear it.  I put my t mobile sims card in it and it did all sorts of things but I have to have a real manual if I am going to use it and since I can't find the real brand.  I will probably send it back.  But if some wise soul has an idea on who might be the real maker of the phone let me know.  It is like buying the generic can of beans at the store and trying to figure out which company actually packaged and sold them under some name that doesn't exist.
