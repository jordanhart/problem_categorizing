Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally.- Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable.- It's BLACK.THE OK======- Passable voice quality. (Maybe it's just because it's GSM technology, and coverage is not fantastic in outside of cities.)- Slim profile, though a little heavier than my previous handset- Nice colors in screen. Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays.- Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside.THE BAD=======- Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook.- Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics.  Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.)- Low camera resolution. Other new phones have close to twice that resolution. Pics always kinda dark.- Camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 or radio. Some of the newer Nokia and Sony models are close to iPod Shuffle capacity already.", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Black (RAZR) is Beautiful", "Author": "NOIR X", "ReviewID": "ROGQYEVVZYKCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Black RAZR V3 is the wireless phone I have always wanted.  It's that simple.Before having bought mine, I would read commentary from people who would cite all of the features the RAZR doesn't have:  \"I could buy the (insert model number of cheaper, but still expensive phone which does 100 different things--all of them poorly) and get more for a lot less money.\"  When I would research a model recommended by these self-proclaimed gadget freaks, I'd find that it's dimensions make keeping it in a pocket an awkward and uncomfortable proposition; I'd find that the pictures it takes are not nearly of comparable quality to those taken by even a modest digital camera; I'd  find that the lo-res video it can shoot serves no practical purpose;  I'd find that web-browsing, game-playing, Instant messaging, streaming television content, all suck up battery-life and ultimately make the device useless for the unlikely purpose of placing and taking phone calls; I'd find that the phone casing is composed of cheap and flimsy plastics which make me wonder how long it wll last; I'd find that little attention had been paid to how the phone's design will contribute to, or detract from, user comfort.  After my investigation, I concluded that for all the money I would save by buying \"Phone X\" over buying a RAZR, I would still have paid hundreds too much for a filmsy hunk of cutting-edge technojunk.  (Don't take my word for it.  Look around on the Net for comments about the RAZR around the time of its inroduction and see the recommendations from consumers that people choose the Motorola V600 instead.  Then look at the consumer reviews of the V600 on this site.)The RAZR has a camera, a web-browser, Instant messaging capability, and a whole array of other features all of which are listed in the product description.  To the extent that the RAZR does these things adequately I will offer little, if any, comment--mainly because I don't care about them.  That to which I can and will attest is that the RAZR exceeds my expectation on how it serves AS A PHONE.Using my own criteria, a wireless phone should draw and hold a signal; It's earpiece should deliver clear sound at a volume which can compete with background noise; it's mouthpiece should pick up the users voice clearly; it should be compact enough to allow for placement in clothing pockets without creating prominent bulges; it should be solidly built out of durable materials which are not prone to scratching; it should have decent battery life.  And yes, anything for which I pay hundreds of dollars should be designed with aesthetics in mind: there are far too many wireless phones which look like disposable children's toys, or like awkward, all-purpose, button-riddled gadgets.Using the above criteria, the RAZR V3, particularly the Black model, is close to perfect.  The sound from the ear piece could certainly be louder, but I have yet to have a caller's voice drowned out by the noise of busy New York City streets.  The people to whom I'm speaking have reported to have heard my voice loudly and clearly.  Battery life could be longer, but then, the same could be said about many wireless phones which are bulkier and have larger batteries.  I have used the phone on both T-Mobile and Cingular networks and found that it draws a strong signal on both; it has never dropped a call.  I found the speaker phone to be loud and clear despite my expectations to the contrary.  Is the much-lamented Motorola phone book program clunky?  Yes it is.  But the RAZR's voice-dialing works well, making it possible to avoid scrolling through the phone book if one hates it that much.I'll try to boil it down with a somewhat clumsy analogy: Complaining that the RAZR doesn't do enough in the way of tech-gimmicks to justify its price (which is considerably lower that it was when it was introduced) is like complaining that an exotic sports car isn't worth the money because it doesn't have a cup holder, a GPS system, and DVD player like the Minivan you've been looking to buy.  That ridiculousness ignores the engineering that makes the sports car a superior performer on the road, and the attention put toward making it sleek and aesthetically pleasing.  The RAZR's performance has made concern over signal strength a thing of the past. and its design is unmatched--not just for it's ultra-compactness, but for the solidity of it's build.  That makes it worth what I paid for it.  And my inability to speak to the quality of other phones on the market put them out of consideration.Besides, as they say, black is beautiful.That the RAZR cannot serve as a business-card scanner doesn't trouble me.  For those who need to have whichever feature-laden mobile gadget is most desired at the moment, buy a Samsung MM-A800, clip it on you belt (you'll need to), and earn yourself the right to say your phone can do just about everything--poorly.", "Date": "May 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Form over Function", "Author": "Deanna Breglia", "ReviewID": "R2TZJ78XDZ7IFH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Don't expect this phone to work any better than a Motorola V551.

Nothing has changed.Don't get me wrong, this matte black phone is slim and sexy and lightweight fun and easy to slip into a pocket.

I don't wear make-up, but if I did, I can imagine that I'd always be taking a toothpick to all of those little crevices between the keys on the flat keypad all the time. As it is now, I'm constantly wiping the screen and keys.-The battery life is not long and if you're going anywhere overnight, remember to bring your charger.-The operating system is the same as other newer model Motorola phones, so don't expect a big upgrade there either.If Cingular is your provider, the sim card from your current phone will work in this unlocked version nicely. However, make sure you've saved all of your numbers and info on the card and not on the old phone before you take the sim card out of the old phone, because it doesn't slip into this phone very easily.

They kept telling me that V3's limited features are not worth my money and that I would be better off sticking to my trusty Nokia phone.  Besides that, they said that a Motorola is not very user-friendly.I conditioned myself to thinking that I will not complain about the limited features of a V3 only because I really wanted to have one so badly (because of its stylish appearance and size). I did buy a V3 despite my husband's objections and was surprised to find that the V3 is more than just a basic phone!! It has some features that I initially did not expect it to have.  You just need to read the manual and tinker with the phone to unlock your phone's potentials.  Another surprise, my black edition V3 is able to CAPTURE, and not just play, videos....Most of V3's functions are a lot similar to my Nokia phone, so I didn't have to make a lot of adjustments getting used to the V3.  You can even tailor the buttons/assign functions to keypads according to your preference.The only thing I think Motorola should've done is to have copied Nokia's technology in terms of browsing the phonebook/directory.  With the V3, you need to go through each person in your phonebook on a per alphabet basis to find a specific number.  With the Nokia, if you want to skip some names that start with the same alphabet letter, you simply key in the next letter in the person's name so you get less names to scan through.Also, it's a pity that my battery's life is so short - it lasts only about 2-3 days with minimal usage.Also, it would've been nice for my phone to have an infrared capability, although with the bluetooth technology, I guess I could live without the infrared.Overall though, my Motorola V3 is such a joy to behold!!", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Don't drop it!!!!", "Author": "R.

I am not usually picky about \"technology\" products. However, when there is a very noticeable difference between my old, cheaper phone, and a new, more expensive one, I cannot help but wish I bought another phone.Here are the things that I hate about the RAZR the most (there are more, but they are things that I can, more-or-less, tolerate:1. It's too slow. Whenever you're scrolling through a list and pressing a \"down\" or \"up\" button a multiple times, it still scrolls with it's usual speed, however, when you stop pressing the button, it keeps on scrolling the number of times that you pressed that button.2. Most downloaded ringtones sound terrible when you play them on this phone. Seriously, it sounds as if you're hitting glass bottles.3. I hate the fact that if you assign a ringtone for a particular contact, this phone plays this ringtone when that contact sends you a text message, instead of just a beep for all incoming text messages. This gets really annoying when you're texting back-and-forth with a person. I don't wanna hear that loud ring every minute. Text messages are not usually urgent. A beep will suffice.4. The phone is not loud enough. I'm not talking about the rings. I'm talking about the fact that it's hard to hear the person on the other line.5. This phone doesn't have a notepad (where you can store miscalleneous information) like all the other phones. Now I have to find \"creative\" ways in which I can store my information, for example, by saving it as a text message draft.6. Not enough memory for old text messages. All other, cheaper phones let you store a good amount of text messages. This one doesn't.The reason I have this phone 2 stars and not 1, is because there are a few things that I like about the RAZR:1. I like the big screen.2. I like the fact that you can put your phone on \"Silent\" and still have your alarm ring. This phone allows you to set the volume of the rings for teh incoming calls and the volume for the alarm separately.3.

Oliver \"biogirl50\"", "ReviewID": "R30QPOCMAIOI97", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all let me say that I did not purchase my RAZR from Amazon. I purchased my phone from my local Cingular store. I have wanted one of these phones since they first came out. Here is a breakdown of my opinion of the phone:PROS:*Thin, elegent looking phone. When the phone is opened it really is amazing how thin it is.*Suprisingly durable. Despite the fact that it is so thin, it is relatively hardy. I thought it would be easy to break (especially when open) but it is a sturdy little phone.*Large, vivid screen. The inside screen is quite large and images, menus, colors, etc. show up very well. (As with all cell phones, it is harder to see in bright daylight though.) Outside screen convenient.*Speaker phone is better than on other phones I've had (mostly I've had Samsung).*It is a desired phone, and every time I get my phone out someone makes a comment about it.*Some other reviews have mentioned problems with the volume of calls, and that menus are clumsy. I disagree with this. I have not had any problems with either of these. As a matter of fact, I like that you can rearrange pretty much any of the menus you want to. Placing what you use most at the top of the page and what you use least at the bottom. I have also not had problems with dropped calls.CONS:*Outside screen does not display time in such a manner that is easy to see when the phone is not in use (you must push one of the side buttons or open the phone to light up the outside screen).*As mentioned in other reviews, the phone collects fingerprints and oils from your skin very easily. I have to wipe off the screen and buttons every single time I use it. Especially if I have on makeup when I use it.*Twice since I have had the phone (I've had it close to a year) it has just shut down on me. The so-called \"white screen of death\" I suppose. Luckily a cold restart (taking out the battery for 10 seconds and then turning the phone back on) solved the problem.THE ONE REAL PROBLEM:The only thing that was frustrating to me about this phone is that within a few weeks of getting the phone I started to notice sone dust collecting under the main inside screen. Over time more and more collected. Within 3 months, the whole bottom right corner was just covered in dust and it was maddening. And there was nothing you could do about it since it was underneath the screen. Luckily my phone was under warranty, so Cingular replaced it for me. Would you believe the new one they sent me did the SAME THING! Actually it collected dust faster then the first one I'd had. Feeling quite frustrated, I called customer service again, and the sent me ANOTHER phone. Luckily this time no dust collected under the screen. I've had this last replacement now for 8-9 months and haven't had the problem again.Overall, I really have loved my RAZR. Once I got the dust problem resolved, I have had no other complaints. I would recommend that if you purchase this phone, make sure you also get a warranty, and watch closely for dust accumulation. If you don't experience that problem, I hope you enjoy this phone as much as I have.", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone would buy again", "Author": "Nathaniel K. \"Nat\"", "ReviewID": "R3KA6R5RR1VISN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is both stylish and functional.

The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.

But, it's only as good as the software that makes it actually work. The AT&T; software I had would not allow you to make separate profiles, and it required you to log on to ONLY the AT&T; network to get ring tones, wallpaper, etc. All fine, if you're an AT&T; customer - But this completely misses the point of buying an unlocked cell phone in the first place.I tried to fix the situation by \"reflashing\", i.e. putting on generic, useful software that comes with a truly \"unlocked\" phone (see e.g. [...]). As soon as I did that, the phone seized up, and demanded a \"Subsidy Password\".

Maybe my old one just wore down the coating and this one isn't worn down yet and so the coating feels different, but it feels cheaper to me than my old one.  I guess time will tell.I had to buy a new phone when my old one's display went out and I didn't want to get locked into a 2 year contract, so got this one.  Unlocked is nice.  I thought about getting something fancier, but this phone works pretty well as a basic cell phone and I don't really want to be paying $40 extra a month for wireless internet right now.All the good things about this phone involve its small size and the fact that it's a flip phone.  It fits in the pocket nicely.  The flip phone means your pocket doesn't call people since the buttons are closed up inside of it when it's flipped closed.  My last one lasted 21 months being rubbed against other stuff in my pocket and the coating got chipped and beat up but the phone kept working.  In fact it's still working, but the display went out one day when I was charging it and never came back, so I needed a new phone so I'm not dialing blind and unable to read text messages.The bad points are that the software isn't particularly great and it's hard to find things and make it do what you want.  The address book is really limited and you have to enter multiple entries for the same person if you want to put multiple numbers in for them.  I can't really imagine browsing the internet or watching videos on this thing, though I guess maybe someone does it.

In that time, it's been unusually trouble free. Okay, once or twice, it has freaked out with a whitescreen but I attribute this to heavy use and some cheap aftermarket batteries.The good: Yes, it's sleek and pretty. It's well built. It's packs away in a vestpocket. The range beats most other phones in my area--I get more bars than anybody I know in concrete buildings and I actually live in one.It has the features I need: bluetooth, speaker phone, conference call, etc. And a few features I don't need: camera--I'm a very small investor and I'm not Steven Spielberg. Still, I keep a foto of my family as a background screen--it's a nice touch.At 95 bucks, you can't top the price for this kind of quality. I paid $250 for my current V3 Razr when I bought it overseas. And I'm buying a second phone as backup and to take advantage of the commonality of all the accessories I now have. Plus, my wife is eying my current Razr rather hungrily and she'll probably wrench it from me before too long, anyway.The bad: Battery life is only fair; I get a full day in my home office with 3+ hours of calls and most of those bluetoothed for handsfree action. But you have to expect to recharge nightly. Even moderate use of an hour or so necessitates a nightly recharge. I can live with this. I just can't afford to have my phone fail on an important call. So I charge it daily. Often, it's on the recharger at work while I use my bluetooth headset. This works for me. It's always ready to go when I am.Hey, I consider 3+ hours of use to be a serious workload for any cell phone. It's really not fair to beat on your phone on a daily basis and then complain about its performance.For the benefit of those worried about the warranty, well, I live abroad. The Razr is a very popular model. There are numerous service centers with people skilled in the repair this phone. If it's not up to snuff when you open it on day one--send it back to Amazon on their 30 day return policy.But if it works fine, then rest assured it's no big deal to get service for it in any large city abroad or in the U.S.I give it 4 stars for all of the above reasons. To me, the good outweighs the bad. I don't need a ton of features. Just a few that work consistently. And I have 2 years of mostly heavy but trouble-free use so far.

I ordered this phone as a replacement for my damaged RAZR and it was sorely lacking in every department. My original RAZR was awesome. I dropped it (into a puddle, shorting out the keypad) and I decided that since it had served me so well, I would replace it with the upgraded V3 model.For one, it is a European phone. For most things, this shouldn't matter but there are a few terribly niggling details that can't be overlooked. Spelling is all British. \"Personalise\" is spelled with a \"z\" instead of an \"s\" in America. It's a minor detail, but it adds up since every bit of spelling and terminology difers from a normal US phone. You won't know exactly what you're doing if you've used US phones and get this phone. Things are generally in the same spot and named similarly, but it's different enough to be frustrating. Additional example: Dates use the European format of DD-MM-YYYY, instead of MM-DD-YYYY.Texting with this phone is a nightmare. The autocomplete draws from what looks to be French, Italian, Spanish and maybe German as well. I didn't want to delve much more deeply into the phone as I was already irritated beyond measure. My family communicates with texts fairly often and to have the ability to type out a quick text message with the help of autocomplete effectively disabled is simply not acceptable on any level. It turns a 20 second message into a 5 minute message, punching in every single letter.In addition to all that, I plugged the phone in via the European charger + adaptor (with my mind reeling that it's not simply a US charger in the first place) only to find that the battery wouldn't charge. I tried my charger from the old RAZR and got the same problem. Spending this kind of money to talk for maybe 2 hours before needing to get an entirely new battery? No thank you.Lastly, the few calls I tested it on gave terrible reception. I'd blame the destination caller if it weren't to a land line and I'd even blame Cingular/AT&T; if the phone hadn't been reporting perfect service.Now, from other reviews, it sounds like many people get good phones via this order system. I will state this: If you got lucky and pulled a working American RAZR from this draw, congratulations. I say: Once bitten, twice shy. No more buying phones this way for me, not until there's considerable more documentation on-line about what's really going to be shipped.I'll be going to Cingular tomorrow to buy a brand new one after going to the post office to return this piece of junk.

This phone, while not the top of the line, is certainly a solid phone with a crisp, if low, sound.  It's pretty comparable to the SLVR, which I had before this phone.  (The SLVR's display cracked.)Like other reviewers have probably mentioned, it is a little wider compared to even the other members of the Motorola line (such as the KRZR or the SLVR), and I have to admit it felt a little delicate compared to the candybar phone - it's probably just my experience using chunkier phones.  I equate this phone to the Corolla of phones - it's a solid phone, nice little perks, a lot of people have them, but not the top of the line.I received a British English version of the phone, which is perfectly fine with me, and unlike phones sold in the US, it has a number of different languages available on the phone.  (This is a huge perk for me, as most phones in the US only display English/French/Spanish and maybe Portuguese, but the version I received had French, Arabic, German, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish language support.)Pros:- Slimline casing- Proven and popular design- Widely available accessories- Excellent Bluetooth support - buttons are in no danger of being pushed while in handsfree mode if the phone is closed- Wide keys with raised ridges- Unlocked - can be used with any available GSM SIM - even in other countries- Does not support as many low frequencies as Nokia (which gives a clearer talking sound)- Decent speakerphone technology (but not perfect)Cons:- BREW OS - harder to get applications from the computer to the phone- Does not come with Motorola synchronization software- Older OS and less feature-rich than newer phones, even later versions of the RAZR line.- Web key a part of the dialing pad, right above the call key - be careful not to hit it if you don't have a data plan- Low audio signal sometimes - can be very quiet in a high-noise situation.Matter of Opinion:- Motorola menuing system - please note that this system is NOT the one used by U.S. carriers, which normally flashes their own branded menuing system onto the phone (like Verizon).", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Horrible experience!", "Author": "Edgar Aldana", "ReviewID": "R1Y0KJ1KS3AIP1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not what I expected...false advertisement!

Well, 10 days after buying it from Amazon, I closed the phone, only to realize when I reopened it that the face had cracked.  I couldn't believe that Motorola would make such a flimsy face and charge so much for the phone.

The RAZR V3 is a Quadband phone and can be used on any GSM network in the world.For many fans, there's no dispute; The Razr V3 is the coolest looking phone.  The Motorola RAZR V3 is available in a stunning anodized aluminum finish in Silver, Black, Pink, Blue and Maroon.Motorola's Razr is one of the few cell phones that all nationwide wireless operators support, that is simply because Razr V 3 looks great, offers high-speed Web browsing, and has a vibrant screen. In addition to being remarkably thin, only 14 mm., the RAZR V3 is surprisingly lightweight as well, weighing only 95 grams.The Motorola RAZR V3 also allows the user to download videos from the Internet. The Motorola RAZR V3 has been on the market for more than two years, and still a very popular phone.The amazing Bluetooth headset that accompanies Motorola RAZR V3 has a blue LED to signify call status and a multifunction button to answer and end calls.The Motorola RAZR V3 includes a lot of messaging features which include SMS, EMS, MMS and email. Like many other phones it includes date, clock, currency converter, calendar, calculator and alarm clock.The Motorola RAZR V3 is the thinnest flip phone ever made, a mere 14 mm., light weight and very attractive, however, Motorola should increase the phones memory drastically. The essential improved needed for Motorola RAZR V3 is an expandable memory.If you're looking for one of the thinnest and most stylish flip phones on the market and can tolerate few drawbacks, then Motorola RAZR V3 is the phone for you.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE/REALLY EASY TO USE", "Author": "Y.

First, I love this phone.  We bought three of them in 2007. Phone 1 is still going strong.  Phone 2 was dropped or got in water (teen son) and died.  Phone 3 was virtually never used...it was a secondary phone I kept in my purse and occasionally turned it on, but in 7 years I bet it had no more than 10 hours of talk time on it.  Seriously!  It was never dropped, it had a protective case, it still looks brand new.  Out of nowhere, when I turned it on all I got was a black screen that was a Bootloader screen that gave software versions, and said I needed to program it and connect a USB data cable.  Sounds  do-able, but no go.  I've searched everywhere, I've taken the phone to various phone guru repair people, and no one can do anything with it.  They are guessing that the internals (ROM perhaps) is corrupted, or some such, but the bottom line is that nothing can apparently get it going agian.  I've emailed Motorola with all the relevant information, but frankly, I don't expect to hear back from them.  If I do get useful info one way or the other, I'll note it on this review later.Meanwhile, I wouldn't really advise buying a used Razr because it's a real roll of the dice at this point, and just know that if you have issues with what you buy, the likelihood of fixing it seems to be less than zero.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "100% recomendado", "Author": "Mayra Pereira", "ReviewID": "R3NVM9WNG97HV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for my personal use, has a good camera for photos and a good description, I like the size and design is perfect.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "did not work", "Author": "Karen S.

It was such an amazing phone back in its time and I would like to believe that the RAZR design is still great.So, because I have used a RAZR from Motorola before, let me warn you that this product is NOT a RAZR in terms of quality.In the Amazon Hands-On review, they talk about a metal body. This product's body is made out of a cheap plastic. I would go so far as to say that the Motorola W376g that I use for Tracfone, and only paid $20 for, has more durable plastic than this product. Also, the hinge mechanism felt really flimsy, much like the plastic body of this product. When taking off the protective plastic film, which is used almost everywhere off the phone, I noticed that the film protecting the top speaker, above the screen, moved slightly. In theory, I could easily break out the top speaker cover easily with enough prodding.I was not able to test calling as the sim card was meant for overseas use. However, the onboard software seemed capable, if not dated. Camera seemed to be working fine and took a few test pictures. Product read messages and contacts from the sim card as expected.While I was sorely disappointed that the hardware was lacking, so long as it worked as expected I may have been able to overlook the hardware not being up to standards. Fortunately, this thing died on the 3rd day. The battery refused to hold a charge and the phone would not be turned on, even while plugged in (even though it was working while plugged in on the first day). When trying to turn it on, the keypad glows blue as expected, but then it simply turns off. When plugged in, it shows the Charging screen as expected, but there are white lines on the bottom of the screen, which didn't show when it was first working or charging.Honestly, I am sorta relieved that it broke down now rather than later. When I had the product in my hand, I was so confused as it looked like the RAZR of old, but it didn't feel like one. The fact that the plastic body did not feel solid made me a bit on edge as to how long this phone would have lasted overseas. I felt so embarrassed that this phone was a gift because it simply was not what I was expecting. When I bought this I expected a RAZR, a solid phone that has worked in the past, but what I received feels like some cheap, knock off product that just uses the same design.Returned the product, which only gave disappointment and wasted my time.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "motorola razor unlocked", "Author": "bertha", "ReviewID": "R2GTB4RTHAEIYQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mothers birthday and as my mother says \"it feels like a toy phone\".

Costello", "ReviewID": "R21SXSW4359RJU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I think one of this phone's best (and one of its only) features is its slim size.One of my gripes about this phone is that the battery stops holding its charge after about a year's use, and you must buy another to get it to work for more than a day.  I recommend buying the extended battery pack instead of the Motorola replacement.  This phone is incredibly not durable, and the first time I dropped it without its case the outer screen shattered.  For this reason I would recommend buying the silicone case that's sold for pennies online in various places (I dropped it dozens of times with this case on before dropping it without its case).  Overall the phone takes somewhat decent pictures and videos, but don't expect them to look good at sizes much bigger than the phone's screen.The phones ability to use speakerphone mode while closed was a valuable feature, and the phone's internet capabilities made the phone useful for browsing the web every now and then, but not for everyday use.I dropped my phone in water twice by accident, and took the battery out right away.  This quick thinking allowed the phone to continue working, but once when the phone was accidentally left on a table under the spray of some sprinklers, the phone finally stopped working (I didn't remove the battery in time).The refurbished version of this phone proved to be a complete failure. within three months I had gone through more than 5 different phones before settling on one that only usually worked, and usually made calls.The phone would occasionally decide that it was time to restart, even in the middle of a call, so not only was I disconnected, but I had to wait for the phone to start back up.  In addition to this the last refurb I received got terrible reception, but again I settled because this was the best one I had received up until that point.5 months after receiving my last refurb, it died completely despite the much more careful care this phone recieved compared to my first RAZR.  It simply bricked itself, and now it serves as an expensive paper-weight.Overall, the V3 razr is a mediocre phone with a not-so-great retail price.

It wasn't convenient to have it power down during an important conversation.  So, I took the SIM card out and put it back in the V190.  The V190 may not \"look\" cool but at least it's reliable.  I now have a KRZR K1, but I will hold on to my V190 just in case.  My husband never had a problem with his RAZR but I do know a couple of other people that had the same problem with theirs.

Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally.- Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable.- It's BLACK.THE OK======- Passable voice quality.

Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays.- Decent bluetooth range.

Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook.- Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics.

They are wonderful, customer service has been wonderful and this awesome user friendly phone died after 3.5 months.  I was so upset so before sending it to motorola for warranty repair, i went on ebay to buy another one.  Listing said \"new\"....I removed my sim card from my dead RAZR and shipped it to motorola.  I receive my \"new unlocked\" razr and put my sim card in.....Nothing was there! An error code popped up and the date in the phone was for 2004...hmmm, I call customer svc and they look up error code on the internet since they said this number was not an AT&T; code so long story short it was a TMOBILE code and this phone must have been 4 yr old maybe refurbished.  After about 4 hours of phone chat with approx 7 different tech people, we determinted that i've lost all my sim info....why? who knows, we also determined that since i'm not able to receive pics or send any, that this phone's codes do not match the already preprogrammed AT&T; razr phone codes.  TIP- IF YOU BREAK A PHONE, ESPECIALLY  AN AT&T; ONE, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NEXT ONE PURCHASED FROM A SELLER HERE OR EBAY IS ALSO WITH/FROM THE SAME PROVIDER.  I AM NOW RETURNING THIS RAZR BACK TO THE SELLER and getting a new one that IS AN AT&T; phone with the proper codes already installed.  ANOTHER TIP- THE RAZR THAT DIED AND WAS SHIPPED TO MOTOROLA HAD A TON OF PICS IN IT.  THIS IS NOT SAVED TO YOUR SIM, EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR PICS AND YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT HAVE THEM WHEN THE PHONE IS RETURNED TO YOU.  I am looking forward to my new razr, the AT&T; specific one and when my original one is returned (from the warranty work) i will have an extra one for back up.  This is a user friendly phone, not heavy duty, rather dainty so be careful with it...mine broke right in the hinge pin and never powered on again.  Over all, i love the phone.

I need an unlocked GSM phone for travel out of the county. It worked fine but it is hard to position on the ear to hear well. Belt clip that came with it broke right away. There are not any good cases for this thing, and I have purchased a few. The blue tooth worked better with it than the actual phone for hearing well. Camera is as bad as everyone says it is. I don't talk alot so I get 3 days on a battery charge. This works well on TMOBILE but when Cingular switched to AT&T; the phone sounds like crap most the time to the person on the other end of the phone. I have 2 sim cards and the TMOBILE service is much better! Someone needs to just make a phone ONLY. I carry a good camera and own an Ipod I never use.

If Motorola wants repeat business, they need to earn it. If you use a USB connector on your phone it should accept chargers for devices with the same connector that have the same electrical specs.
