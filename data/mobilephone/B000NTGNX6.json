I was thrilled to see it finally on Amazon. This phone is small enough to fit in your pocket or clutch purse. Needed to have raised buttons, which is hard to find nowadays in a phone. All the bottons are raised. Easy to operate and has many features. I even bought a skin for it, many to choose from for this phone, to make it unique to me. I would recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything you would need in a compact mobile device", "Author": "Concordian \"Maxster\"", "ReviewID": "R2435YNS2SCYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Provided that you're not into PDAs and if you can do without an FM Radio, Sony Ericsson W880i is more than enough meet your savvy. Its stylish design and seemingly incomparable range of features all in a compact phone, would please any gadget fan, music afficionado or even fashionista. This phone is all that and a whole lot more.Packed with the Walkman 2.0 software and a 1 Gig Memory Stick Micro M2, you can just imagine the amount of music you can store with this phone. The firmware supports up to an 8 Gig expansion should the M2 be available in that capacity already in the future. This phone also supports A2DP Bluetooth Stereo headset profile which means this is completely compatible with any device like the Sony Ericsson A2DP Bluetooth Stereo receiver (MBR-100) or the Sony DR-BT30Q Bluetooth Stereo headset which I prefer to use with it.Other than that just like it's predecessors, it comes with 2.0 Megapixel camera. This should be sufficient for day to day use although should you opt for a camera phone with a higher resolution, this phone is not for you.The screen resolution is a compact version of the W900 series so the display is really crisp and clear. The screen resolution is higher than the W800i or even the W810i.Only setback might be for people with big hands. The keypad would not be appropriate for them. This phone would be very difficult for them to use.Lastly, this phone comes with 3G and a VGA camera for video calls. The last feature not only seals the sweet deal, but you would never find another phone out there in such a compact state with all these features which can literally fit in your left shirt pocket.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Cool phone...but came with UK charger and Japanese Menus", "Author": "Starck", "ReviewID": "R28RJPPI1MVIEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Only just received the phone, and it seems great so far. Was a little surprised to find a 3-pin UK charger (with a cheap nasty adapter for US power outlets). The phone would not charge, so I investigated and it turned out that the CHEAP NASTY adapter-plug (not a sony product) was at fault. I had to bend the contacts in the adapter plug a little so that they would make contact with the pins on the charger. Not such a big deal...but wanted to share this in case anyone else is having problems. Also, the menus at start-up were in Japanese! Luckily I made a few good guesses and ended up at the English/Japanese selection screen. Apart from these minor details, so far the phone seems great. Love the design & shape of the phone. Has plenty of features, most of which I'll probably never use, but as a phone I love it so far.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Slim and Easy", "Author": "S.

It may be nearly two years old, but its miles ahead of the average junk phones people seem to like in the states.  I have T-Mobile and i was able to easily find the carrier mods on their website to get the features working right. Why waste 300- or more on the newer and bulkier models, or the touch screen accident prone phones.  Trust me and get this.  <also comes in a nice black and orange color>", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "For $189, the best MP3 multifunctional phone. Period", "Author": "Jaffrey W. Ali \"Relentless Pursuit of Technology\"", "ReviewID": "R1V7OKOVSX2UIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using a Sony Ericsson W880i for a month now. I upgraded to a 4GB memory stick (works fine), I use a Sony Ericsson H970 bluetooth stereo headset and am on ATT network. Here is a quick summary of my experience with this product:Pros:1. Walkman - create playlists on the phone, good sound quality (better than my ipod for sure), good user interface, superb stereo bluetooth.2.Bluetooth - implementation is so good it blows away any other product I have owned. It is super fast to connect and works flawlessly with the integrated blutooth in my car and with my Sony stereo bluetooth (H970).3.Others - I get access to my office email, gmail with no problems. It automatically synchs wirelessly every 5 minutes, text and MMS also work great.4. Design and Build quality - fantastic! I got an W890i also and the W880i just looks and feel better. Trust me. The W890i was much cheaper looking and feeling. This is a fantactically designed and built product.5. Camera is decent for on the fly use. I would not use this as my primary digital camera, but it is totally OK for taking a quick picture or video and sending it via email or MMS.6. Very very stable OS, never crashes or locks upCons:1. Not suitable for writing long emails! However, I need my phone to mostly read, I write short one liners if needed.2. The keys are small, but I am completely used to it after a month.3. 3-G works only when I am in Europe, in US I can't use ATT 3-G.4. No wi-fi and np 3-G in US means browsing the web is pretty slow. I try and use the mobile versions of web sites. I also use the Opera Mini Browser which is a free download IF I need to browse the web.Overall, I think this is a really excellent product. Based on my experience with this phone I am more likely to buy a Sony Walkman phone again. Just remember that this phone is for people who want a phone with an MP3 player and lightweight email access and web browsing. If you're a heavy email or web user then this phone is not for you.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great phone at a not-so-great value.", "Author": "Yourhero", "ReviewID": "R2ZQBDUBJPXENQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having spent some time in-store playing with this device, and doing a fair amount of web research, I cannot say that I am an expert on this phone, however I can tell you that it is a handy little device.That being said, for a great deal less, you can get the w810i, which is thicker, and not made of the sexy metal frame, but includes a built in flash/flashlight, and EVERY other function that this phone contains. Unless you have the cash to drop, and want a phone thats just a wee bit sexier, I would suggest the w810i instead.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "Kevin A.
