{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The phone delivered to me is a Samsung phone, but cannot be activated by Verizon", "Author": "Tyrant", "ReviewID": "RFOFUBE8T3QSH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone delivered to me is a Samsung phone, but cannot be activated by Verizon.  I ordered and paid for the phone because I needed a \"NO CONTRACT VERIZON PHONE\" to replace one my mother-in law broke.  She is currently on my Verizon account, and I am currently under contract with Verizon.  The model number and ESN tag on the phone Global Distributing sent me is obviously not the original tag, and has been replaced at some point in time.  Regardless Verizon cannot activate phone, and says the tag on phone actually identifies it to be a Motorola phone.I have tried repeatedly and futilely to contact Global Distributing at (208) 391-5347 (phone number is number published under seller's information, and is also number given to me by Amazon's customer service).  I have tried for 5 days to contact Global Distributing, and have left several specific voice messages on their Google phone service.  I have yet to receive the courtesy of a return phone call from anybody other than Amazon customer service.After involving Amazon customer service (best most responsive customer service I have ever dealt with), and receiving refund from Amazon I finally received an email from Global Distributing whinging about refuns.Global Distributing needs not to whine to Amazon about refunds, but needs to do the right and proper thing by contacting customers, returning phone calls, and selling proper products.  No refund was requested by me, but was the last resort since Global Distributing refused to return my phone calls.  I ordered and paid for this phone on April 6, 2013.  It has been 10+ days, and I am no closer to having replacement phone in hand.  I am disappointed in the response by Global Distributing.  They need to treat their customers like customers.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "cell phone", "Author": "kim pinker", "ReviewID": "R3GYTZB346IOA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it stopped working 6 days after we bought it.

It's a basic phone. It worked for about 2 months and then the phone just stopped charging. I used another charger that was compatible with the phone and it again did not charge. The battery was dead. In 3 months time, the battery died. This is unacceptable to me. Thankfully we had an old phone in the house and I was able to switch out the batteries and now it works fine again. Beware of old batteries when you buy from this seller!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "twas good", "Author": "ben", "ReviewID": "R3CVDSABXEREWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it was exactly what i wanted, no problems with the phone.
