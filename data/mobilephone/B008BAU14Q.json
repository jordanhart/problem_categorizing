{"Reviews": [{"Title": "As always, a great value, but this time with no compromises.  (with update 15SEP2012)", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "R1LAIVUU5PRVG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Virgin Mobile has always been a great value, delivering acceptable phones and service at a far lower total cost of ownership than the big contract carriers. In the past though, Virgin's phones have been about a year behind the current technology at the time of their introduction and the over-all experience was far lower than what you could get if you were willing to pay more. They were, as I've said in my other reviews of their earlier phones, a good value because of their cost, but not great because of their phones or performance. Their phones were usually about a year behind the newest releases from the hardware makers, and their network service from Sprint is slightly lacking in some cities especially compared to Verizon.This HTC EVO V 4G runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), which is currently (at the time of this review) the newest version of Android. It has a fast processor, good camera, is 4G capable, has great battery life, and has overall great performance. Although it has been out for over a year on Sprint, it is not nearly as far behind the mainstream as previous Virgin Mobile offerings have been. Between my wife and me, we have tried pretty much every Virgin Mobile \"Beyond Talk\" phone. They have almost all been good, but with flaws, performance tradeoffs, and were noticeably behind the mainstream phones that the big carriers were offering at the time. The HTC EVO V 4G is the first one that is not only a good value, but also rivals the mainstream on-contract phones in terms of performance. I'm not saying that it is as good as the newest phones on the big carriers, but the difference is becoming far less noticeable.  The cutting edge phones are still getting better, but now at a slower pace which is allowing phones like this one to be a closer match.Size. This phone is a little bulkier than the Motorola Triumph, but is comfortable to hold and use. It still fits in my pockets with no problems. It is heavier than the Triumph or any other VM phone, but for me, I don't find the added size and weight to be an issue because they enable the huge 4.3 inch screen and exceptional battery life. Having Wi-Fi, 4G, 3G, Bluetooth, and GPS all in one phone, and all work so well also probably contributes to the size. I would prefer it was flatter (like the Triumph), but don't have an issue with its form factor.Cases. Since this phone is identical to the one that has been on Sprint for over a year, there are plenty of great cases available for it, including ones from top of the line companies like Otter Box.  There are many times more accessories available for it than for previous Virgin Mobile phones.Screen. I love the 4.3\" screen size, and this one is even sharper than the one on the Motorola Triumph. It is great.Touch Screen. The touch screen is very responsive, accurate, and precise. By far the best touch screen I've ever used. Even better (or equal to) the one on the Apple Ipod Touch.  I use that comparison because I've always felt that the Touch was better than the Android phones I'd had in the past.Keyboard. The touch screen keyboard on this phone is awesome. I don't know for sure if the keyboard they loaded on here is the stock Android 4.0 one, or if is part of HTC Sense UI, but wherever it came from, it is awesome. My big, clumsy, fingers mash at the screen, and instead of having to retype everything, it automatically comes up with what I intended to write. It is the easiest to use and simplest touch screen keyboard ever. I love it. It is so good, that I would have bought this phone just for the keyboard.  Occasionally it will get a correction wrong, and you have to select the correct word from the choices it gives you, but this is very rare.  Even when that does happen, it isn't too much of an inconvenience, and when it does happen the phone seems to learn from the results.  You never get the same mistake twice.Battery. The battery life on this phone is incredible because of its increased size and better power management and network management. It lasts 2 to 3 times longer than the battery on the Motorola Triumph. Because of its size it also takes a long time to charge, but I'm OK with that.  For me, other Virgin Mobile phones seemed to be very inconsistent with their battery performance.  On the Triumph, for example, the battery would often go from full to empty way too fast, and without stopping at any points in-between.  That never happens with this phone.  In a low signal area, or if you are doing a whole lot on 4G, it can drop fast, but the gage always shows you what is happening so there are no surprises.Network management. The only network management problems I've had with this phone is those instances when the wifi it is connected to is not working properly. Instead of reverting to 3G or 4G, the phone will lose internet when it is connected to a wifi network that isn't properly providing internet access. This is a pretty serious flaw and is very annoying, but can be overcome by turning off wifi or having the phone \"forget\" those networks that don't work well. You just have to be aware of the issue and be careful what wifi networks you let you phone connect to. Otherwise, it is better than most other Virgin Mobile phones at keeping connected to the Sprint network and performing well. It is also great at making seamless transitions between 3G, 4G, and Wifi, always switching to the best available choice.Camera. The 5MP camera on this phone performs better than the 5MP camera on the Motorola Triumph and many other cell phone cameras. It isn't as good as a compact camera or even the iPhone 4S, but it is at least fully usable. Android 4.0 has a lot of camera software improvements over Android 2.2. It focuses better, is faster, and comes with cool and even useful effects.  This is the first cell phone camera that truly is a replacement for a real camera.  Again, I'm not saying that it takes pictures that are as good as a Canon or Nikon, but they are good enough that you won't mind using them.3D. You should look to someone else's review if you are interested in an evaluation of its 3D performance. For me, the 3D features of this phone are a waste of space. I'm just not into 3D. I will say that it is easy to turn off, and doesn't really get in the way at all.4G. This is my first 4G phone, and when there is coverage, it is incredible. I am in the process of moving from Detroit (where there is no 4G), to Austin (where there is). Having 4G is an incredible improvement, even just for web surfing or for using Google Maps. I love it.Internet Sharing. The ability to share this phone's internet connection is awesome and works really well. It works great on both 3G and especially 4G. It is simple to use, and at $15 a month is a much better value than a Mifi card.Call Quality. The call quality is great on this phone, and is much better than the Motorola Triumph which sometimes sounded muffled. It is clear for both you and the person you are talking to.Bluetooth.  The Bluetooth on this phone works great both with a headset and with my car.  I love how it seamlessly transitions from my Podcast Application (Doggcatcher), Navigation, and phone calls.  I really didn't expect it to work as great as it does.Processor. This phone is snappy and doesn't seem to have any processor induced lag at all. No matter what I run or play, it works the way it is supposed to, even when I'm multi-tasking. The processor seems to be more than adequate.Durability. The back case on this phone comes off too easily. It was even off in the box when I first got my phone. I addressed this by getting an Otterbox case for the phone, but over-all, I don't find the back cover design to be that good on this phone. I will update this review if anything breaks or causes any issues on it, although I think that putting the Otterbox on it will prevent any problems. If you are planning on using it without a case, you might have issues if your back cover is as susceptible to coming off as mine is.Reliability. So far, I have had no issues with applications or functions crashing on this phone. It works consistently and flawlessly. I will update this review if I find anything getting hung-up or crashing.  I have had the phone since they first released it, and still haven't had any problems.HTC Sense. This is my first phone with HTC Sense UI. I would prefer that the phone was just vanilla Android because HTC Sense UI doesn't add anything that I care about, but it also doesn't seem to cause any problems or get in the way. HTC Hub provides some pretty good ringtones and wall papers. Overall, I find HTC Sense UI to be neither a good nor bad thing. It includes some things that I use, but if it wasn't there, the stock Android versions of things like the Music Player and Calendar would have been fine. Stock Android makes it easier to switch between brands, which I think is the exact reason the manufacturers like to do things like Sense, to increase the cost to customers for switching brands in the future.  HTC wants to get you used to Sense and Samsung and Motorola each want to get you used to their skin.If there are any topics that you wanted me to address that I failed to, please let me know in the comments and I will update this review for you.// Update after 6 months. 15SEP2012 //I have had this phone for 6 months now, so wanted to give an update.  It continues to work very well.  I'm considering getting the Laza Zcell extended battery that Danny K. has been raving about, but only because it sounds cool.  I am not really having any battery life issues with the stock battery.One thing that I was surprised with about this phone, and am very pleased with especially compared to other VM phones, is that they are constantly updating the software.  The Triumph, Intercept, and other VM phones I had never seemed to get any software support from VM or from their OEM's.  This phone gets patched and improved constantly (about every 1 to 2 months).  I have been happy with the phone ever since I got it, but knowing that they still have people devoted to keeping it current and fixing bugs that users find makes me even more happy with it.  It is my first HTC phone ever, on any carrier, and their continued support for their product will probably keep me coming back.I have now issues to report after six months.  The phone is still working well.  We like it so much that we bought a second one.  We are now a 2 EVO house.  We usually have two different VM phones, so we can compare them, but until they come out with something better, we'll probably be sticking with the EVO for a while.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I made the move Motorola Triumph to Evo 3D!", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "RM7HEIBKU39JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading so many reviews both negative and positive I decided to make the move. My local Radio Shack had a limited time promotion on the HTC Evo 3D for Virgin mobile and knowing the problems I was having with my Motorola Triumph I had to make the move. Especially since I would have 30 Days to return it back to the store. Here are the facts:GPS on the evo connects in 10 seconds and that's in my house (I use waze app all the time)Triumph can't connect in my house and usually takes more than 5 minutes to connect.Audio is louder and sounds better on the HTC Evo (especially with poweramp app)Triumph has a problem when you unplug earphones and replug in the sound jumps.HTC Evo has no lag when pressing buttons or appsTriumph has lag and sometime you must press 3 timesCall quality is better on the HTC Evo and testing this in low signal areas I haven't missed any callsTriumph sounds muffledHTC Evo 3d pictures give me a headache, 2d pictures are very nice, I don't see a major difference between either phone.Battery on the HTC Evo beats the  Triumph hands down. And I like the option to add a larger battery if needed. I use 2x battery saver app.Sent a text message in a low signal area and 1 time received a radio interference message, but the text still went through.3G is noticeably faster (I used speedtest.net) with my old Motorola and the HTC next to each other. I'm sure this is because of the dual processor and improved memory in the HTC.4G is insane! 7,485 kbps download.If someone calls you and you can't take the message and they leave you a message on voicemail, you can listen to the message without dialing into voice mail and delete it after listening so no minutes are used, very cool! On the motorola triumph you had to dial into voice mail.BTW, my Motorola triumph was on the $25 dollar plan and my wife was using a Samsung intercept so I gave her my Motorola. If anyone has upgraded from the Samsung intercept to the Motorola triumph. You know its a no brainer and the Motorola wins hands over, but although the upgrade from the Motorola to the HTC Evo is not as drastic, it is an improvement over the quirky things that the Motorola does....UPDTATE1:Have had the phone for 1 month and haven't missed 1 call. There are reviews that say they have had call problems or texting problems. See update #5.UPDATE #2:Factory battery is better than the triumph, but I order the extended Laza Zcell battery and cover for the HTC Evo on Amazon. The reviews are incredible and the battery lasts for more than 2 day on normal use!UPDATE #3 Revised:Received the Laza Zcell battery and cover and it is fantastic. The cover fits perfectly, charged the battery overnight and my 2x battery saver app says I have 114hrs till the battery runs out! Mfg says you will get max battery after 5 charges. The bottom of the back case pops out about 3/16 and the rest of the case stays slim. This actually makes the phone easier to hold and with the new back cover the top power button is easier to operate. Also you will not need a battery saver app with this battery, but if you do it will extend your battery operation even longer! After 5 charges, and the phone being on for 7hours, my 2x battery saver app says I have 191hrs left! This is insane!UPDATE #4The HTC Android version is 4.06. It has some very cool settings that are not on the Motorola. For example. When the phone is ringing you can set it to lower the ring tone automatically when you pick the phone up. You can also increase the ring when it is in a bag or pouch and it will lower when the phone is pulled out of the bag. You can also set your phone to automatically go to speaker phone when you turn it upside down.UPDATE #5I received a text from my brother (I don't really text much at all) when I responded I received the weird code alert and radio freq message, I selected OK on the message and I believe it still went through. My response to my brother didn't require a response but it did remind me of all the people that are complaining about texting on this phone. Here is what I did, go to your phone keypad and type ##25327# then a screen pops up, at the top press the word menu, it will then say reset, press reset, then select yes to resetting and saving personal info....This should fix any texting issues. I did this and have not had any radio interference messages since. Keep in mind this is not the same as going to the PRL update. It is more than that and resets your phone with out loosing your personal data.UPDATE #6Still loving this phone! Did more texting this month with my family with no problems. Everything above still stands. This is without a doubt the best VM phone I have ever had. If you have a 3D tv, you can take 3D videos and set your 3D on your tv to side by side and watch your videos in 3d. Very cool, much better than watching 3D on your phone. Still experimenting. Also one thing I don't like is to answer a call you must move the green icon into a circle. So I installed an app called easy answer. Now when a call comes in I can look at the phone and just hold it to my ear and it will automatically answer. It detects that you have the phone by your ear. How cool is that? Also I installed a 16gb sd card so I could install my favorite movies. I found that the phone is so powerful (dual core CPU) that it will play HD videos that my old Motorola triumph would not play! Love this phone and I'm so surprised that there are so many negative reviews.UPDATE #7Just leased a new vehicle and needed a good HTC 3D Evo smartphone holder. Found the iOttie one touch smartphone holder. It is easily the best vehicle holder I have ever found. Amazon sells it, check it out, you won't be disappointed it attached to my dashboard that like many has a non smooth vinyl and fastened beautifully. Its 12 degrees in NJ today and its working without a problem. It will also attach to your windshield. Just sharing with all the HTC 3D evo fans. One negative is it will not work with the extended battery. So I'm back on the original factory batteryWill update as I use it more.... Very happy with this HTC Evo 3g V.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone for virgin mobile", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1UKP951D81P0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best phone for virgin mobile!! I didn't buy it through amazon, I went to best buy but I have had no problems with this phone..great buy at 300$ because the monthly rates are so low.

Everyone had their tablets and cell phones.  Of all the units in the room, I was the ONLY one who couldn't get good reception-- either on WiFi or 3G.Today I tried to top up my time on their site.  The response:  \"We cannot accept a credit card to top up time.  Please purchase a top-up card at a local store.\"  Are they SERIOUS?  I've had no credit card problems, I was using a debit card with plenty in the bank (a card I've used many times before on VM) so why this sudden new policy.Sorry... this phone is just lousy, and so is Virgin Mobile \"service\".  I'm cancelling my service as of today and switching to a different company.  This is literally one of the worst companies on the market-- and with some of the poorest products and service I've seen anywhere.Back to the original review:This is a potentially great phone, unfortunately with several fatal flaws:At the top of the list:  \"RADIO INTERFERENCE RESOURCE SHORTAGE.  CAUSE CODE: 64.  ERROR CLASS: 2\"  This is a widespread and well-known error among the VM HTC Evo community.  What this error means is that your phone is now inoperative.  It won't make or receive phone calls, won't send or receive text messages.  The only known solution to this is to go through the cumbersome process of totally resetting the phone.  For some users \"Update the PRL\" seems to do the trick... a process that takes a couple of minutes.  This problem occurs often... for some users weekly... for others once or several times a day.  What this error boils down to is that the phone has lost all contact with all communication towers to the point that it has lost its identity and ability to communicate-- even if it comes back in contact with said towers.  Why this happens is difficult to discern as Virgin Mobile techs are not forthcoming with info.  Most users seem to think the problem lies in one of two areas:  1) a serious flaw with the HTC or 2) VM over-crowding their lines (personally I have no idea, but reports are this doesn't happen with phones other than HTC.  I wouldn't know about any but this phone.)Whatever the source of the problem, it's gone on for some time, is widely discussed on the Net, and apparently has no permanent solution.  That rates this phone one star. Contacting Virgin Mobile resulted in them telling me they created a \"software fix\" Nov 15, 2012 and to download that release.  I purchased my phone well after Nov 15 and had already updated the software (other people have reported the same bogus \"software error\" runaround).  Other users report contacting HTC and being told by that company to contact Virgin Mobile.  My guess:  there is a serious hardware error here and neither company wants to 'fess up and issue an expensive recall that could cost millions to fix.A second problem is battery life.  The included battery is under-equipped for a phone of this power.  It will not last a full 12-hour day under normal use.  I don't know how that compares to other smartphones as this is the first I've owned. Extended batteries are available, but they increase the bottom half of the phone in size and make it incompatible with most cases on the market.A third problem is that it doesn't use a SIM card, which means you cannot easily transport your existing phone data (call lists, etc) to this phone.  While that's not insurmountable, such limitations to some folks are not acceptable.Fourth problem:  VM 4G claims are total hype.  The phone is capable of 4G, but Virgin Mobile isn't.  If one looks at their coverage map-- see how many 4G areas show on the map.  Metro New York City might have 4G somewhere, but you'll find none elsewhere.Fifth problem: Poor reception.  According to the Virgin Mobile reception map... I am in the middle of a \"dark green\" area which means I should have great reception, 5 bars.  I'm doing good to get 1-2 bars.  My sister lives in a \"light green\" area which means \"moderate reception\"... and there is no signal at all there. VM has clearly over-rated their coverage, both in phone reception and speed.To be fair, Virgin Mobile has the least expensive plan I've seen on the market, a plan which suited my needs perfectly.  But what value is low price when the service doesn't work?The phone itself is easy to use, large screen, that rather amazing 3D screen (yes, it's a gimmick, but a great gimmick).  Unfortunately the 3D camera lens sticks out of the back of the phone, making it impossible to securely lay flat on a surface (a minor issue for some, not so minor for others).The camera is awful.  Even in the best condition it takes grainy photos.  The time between clicking the shutter and the photo actually being snapped is significant to the point that you almost never get the photo you wanted to take (I'm talking a full second, at least).  There is no anti-blur technology I'm aware of, so photos are regularly out of focus or smeared.The phone is priced decently (even low compared with some others) but in truth, one can understand why.  If it regularly loses functionality, what price does it warrant?Sorry, have to give two thumbs down on this one.EDIT, Dec 28 2012:  I received an email reply from customer support at Virgin Mobile.  This is the same reply they've been sending to users for months.  It provides a temporary solution and claims they will be coming out with a fix... but no fix has been forthcoming and the claim (imo) is not trustworthy.  I would consider it a stall to cause people to keep their phones past the return period, hoping to \"soon\" receive a fix tfor the problem (I've seen this kind of thing before).FROM VIRGIN MOBILERegarding your concern, Virgin will soon be releasing a MaintenanceRelease to resolve the problem. In the meantime, please follow theinstructions below.- Click the Phone icon and enter ##CLEAR#.- Click Menu > Reset.  The device will re-boot.  Service will bere-initiated.- The issue will be resolved.  Please test your phone by sending an SMSmessage to your own phone number.- If the issue reoccurs, you should follow the same process to resolve.Impression:  buyers should note VM has been making this promise for months without follow-through... and that they will have no idea the phone is not working until they try to use one of the processes that it effects (such as sending a text message or making a phone call).  This means the phone will be very unreliable if you have this problem in your area(and from what I see about 30% of users do).Follow up report Nov 4 2013:  This phone is still using Android 4.0.6 when the latest Android (as of this date) is 4.4.  Contacting both VM and HTC produced what I consider a \"form email run-around\"-- the first stating how to \"update\" the phone OS (which of course I already knew and has no effect-- as they're well aware).  The second email claimed \"it takes time to update Android versions.  Please be patient\". As of this date the OS hasn't been updated in a year; how much time do they need?Does Virgin Mobile and HTC just stop supporting expensive smartphones after the sale?  Which brings the question:  why would a customer wish to purchase another phone from either HTC or Virgin Mobile if OS upgrades are not supported?Bottom line Virgin Mobile misrepresents their coverage, evidently knowingly sells defective phones and then lies to their customers about the fix status, and fails to properly support the system after the sale. I would recommend doing business with this company only if you live in a strong signal area.  Expect little or no service following the purchase.Nov 25 2013: Virgin Mobile has discontinued sales of this phone and from what I can see no longer supports it on an OS level.  Purchasing it (or any other VM phone) would be inadvisable unless you live in a very strong signal area.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the cost", "Author": "Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "ReviewID": "R33WU0F3UOKO8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow, it's been an interesting year to be a Virgin Mobile customer. I've been on this carrier for years and years, and mainly have had to put up with third-rate (or some would say, fourth-rate) devices. That, I figured, is the price you pay for... well, price. VM was a fraction the cost of any other carrier and all I did with the phone was make calls.Earlier this year however, VM launched their Beyond Talk program and while more expensive than their old (now branded 'Pay-Lo') service it was still a darn good deal. And furthermore, they had some phones that were actually pretty darn decent. I sprung for it and got an Optimus V, and interestingly started using my phone for things other than making calls. I now can't really live without it, which I guess is a word of warning for those that don't want to be tethered to an expensive chunk of circuitry, but it's just too handy not to have now. With a modern Android smartphone you can do pretty much anything you would do on a small laptop- plus make calls and texts without wi-fi. I guess the peak of the madness was when I set up my phone console to deploy my company's website. That was more just to see if it was possible, but it shows just some of the things you can do with one of these guys. It's also replaced my portable GPS, alarm clock, notepad, and serves as a wifi hotspot when necessary.Now, VM has really started to outdo themselves with their device lineup. These are pretty darn new- the EVO V 4G is essentially the Sprint EVO 3D which was released in 2011. It's not the latest, greatest smartphone out there but it's pretty darn close to it. At the current price with no contract, it's a darn good device. If you're not willing to drop upwards of 500 bucks for an iPhone, this is definitely the next closest thing in the current VM lineup. Here's a brief rundown of the device:The EVO V 4G is physically a bit larger and bulkier than an iPhone, but not hugely so. It has a rubberized back panel and two 5 MP cameras for taking 3D pictures. It has a dedicated camera button and 3D slider, volume buttons, and a power button. Everything else is handled via the touchscreen, which has 4 dedicated function touch keys and a gorgeous 4.5\" screen. Overall the device is a tad on the heavy and large side, but about what you would expect from something with its power.The device is powered by a 1.2 ghz dual core Qualcomm Snapdragon system-on-chip setup, with 1 GB of RAM. It comes with about 1 GB of internal user-available memory and a 8 GB microSD card. These are pretty generous specs by any measure, and it shows- the device is able to run pretty much any app smoothly, even the more graphically intensive games. It comes with Android 4.0 (ICS) and is very responsive in pretty much all situations. Additionally, it comes with practically every hardware feature- bluetooth, wifi, 4G antenna, GPS, accelerometer, light sensor.Note I said 'pretty much' all. One beef I had with this device is that its camera shutter speed is really slow- a LOT slower than the iPhone and most other Android phones I've used. It seems marginally faster if you don't use the physical camera button, but is still bad enough that you'll likely get a lot of motion blur just from having your picture subjects moving while taking shots. And it doesn't take a lot of movement- or very rapid movement- to do this, either. Turning off autofocus and face detection seems to help a bit as well, but the bottom line is it's hard to get good photos with the camera(s). The good news is once you do, it tends to be really sharp and clear. The 3D photos are kind of a gimmick since they're only really good for display on the device itself, but a cool touch nonetheless.Call quality and reception are both good- as clear as any other phone I've used. Generally speaking the wireless functionality just works without your input, though sometimes I've noticed the device fails to pick up wifi when coming into range of a network it 'knows.' The big downside of the EVO V 4G's wireless ability is the 4G part- Sprint's coverage is none too spectacular for this, and more often than not the strength is so low that it keeps dropping off (and I live in the middle of Silicon Valley, CA). If you're out in the boonies, forget it- it's just not going to work. The worst part is if you have 4G on, it totally burns your battery trying to search for 4G all the time. In fact for a while I thought the battery was defective until I read about this on some Android forum.That said, with 4G off it performs pretty decently anyway. Don't expect to stream HD video and you'll be fine- most browsing and web related apps have no problem at this speed. With VM's quasi-unlimited data plans, you can pretty much go to town with these features, which is great. Battery life is about average for an Android phone- usually I charge it every day and am fine.There does seem to be some sort of glitch with SMS on this device, where sometimes it'll fail to send messages with a meaningless error message about 'radio interface resource shortage.' I found that updating the PRL seemed to reduce the frequency of this, but once in a while I still do get it. No doubt, this is just one of those bugs from migrating the device from Sprint.Overall however, this is an amazing device that's a great deal by any measure. In some respects it's a better device than the iPhone given its expandable memory, options for user customization, high-powered CPU, and of course way way lower cost. On a note though- although the screen itself is pretty tough, I found out the hard way that the seal on it is anything but. If you even get a bit of moisture on it, there's a very good chance it can seep down beneath the screen (between the LCD and backlight) and get stuck in there. Do NOT- repeat, do NOT put on those wet-application invisible shield protectors on this device! Quite frankly, the screen is tough enough that it's probably unnecessary anyway, and it's just too risky to try even if you've got the insurance.Pro:Beautiful screen, solid build.Darn cheap for what you get.Expandable memory.Very powerful and responsive in general.Even at $35 a month now instead of $25, VM's service is still a steal.Has pretty much every feature you can think of, and some you probably didn't.Cons:No more free mobile hotspot, costs $15 a month or requires rooting (which pretty much voids your warranty and any support).Micro-SD slot is behind the battery, which necessitates removal of the rear panel. Not exactly easy to swap out.Camera shutter speed is mediocre, which can lead to serious motion blur issues.4G coverage by Sprint is bad, which means in most cases you'll have to leave 4G off or risk killing your battery.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a nice phone when it works", "Author": "Chris \"nicodemus145\"", "ReviewID": "R2LIGERTUV2F2U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like this little tablet.

Virgin told me they were sending an update to all EVO customers that would fix the notorious \"Radio Interface Resource Shortage\" error message that pops up for one out of every 5 to 10 texts (when you get that error for text by the way, it means you can't place calls either), and I should expect it \"tonight or tomorrow.\"  After a week and no update, they said it actually wasn't through them, and they said they'd give me a download link from HTC's website.What they really sent me was a link to email HTC with any questions I might have.  When I asked about the update, they said it could be up to 45 days before I get the update.  They said they could not push the update to any particular customer, and they could not provide a download link for me to manually install the update.  A second email sent 2 days ago has not been replied to.When your phone cannot send texts or place calls when you really need it to, it's not really a phone.  I understand this update's supposed to work miracles.  But after replacing one EVO V for another, multiple resets for both, and then this half-hearted response from HTC and Virgin's (notoriously bad) customer service, I cannot recommend this phone for anyone who might need a cell phone for emergency use.  Yes you can temporarily fix an immediate issue by toggling back and forth between 3G and WiFi, but have you ever had to sit there and be patient with a phone in a traffic accident, or when you're just trying to answer a quick question for someone?  Casual users more interested in facebook or apps should be happy with this.  But if you work a dangerous job or you're worried about your children's safety, this phone will fail you when you need it most.- UPDATE -I got the update a week ago and have not had any problems since.  I'm glad I held out for it because it's a great piece of hardware, and like the guy at Best Buy said, \"it's by far the best pre-paid phone we have here.\"  The wait and the runaround were so unfortunate though.  I hope it stays strong and that no future updates undo whatever they did.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone, problem-free after updates", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "R1RQ1PXBWNO8FE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I was a little nervous at first after reading about all of the problems this phone has had. I have had a HTC One V for awhile and have enjoyed it, but when I saw the price drop on the EVO I figured I'd give it a try, and I could always switch back to the One V if it didn't work out. The One V has been a great phone. Suffice to say, I will NOT be switching back.For starters, switching as always for me (I've been with VM for awhile, 5 or 6 phones) required that I call VM to get it done, but no big deal, and the switch was done and everything was working in about a half hour. As soon as I activated it and started playing around with it, I quickly noticed just how much faster and more responsive it is than the One V - it is definitely and immediately noticeable. The two cores make a huge difference. Where I live the 4G is spotty, but when it works it is fantastic; the 3G is not bad at all. I downloaded the HTC software update and the PRL and profile updates and have not had any of the connectivity (call or messaging) issues that have been reported with this phone. I believe that they've got all of those kinks worked out. Like I said, 4G is spotty, but other than that smooth sailing.I was worried about the GPS because it is listed only as AGPS and HTC's site says it needs cell service to operate, but I used it for about a day in areas where I know there was no service and it kept tracking me. The maps wouldn't update, but my position was kept current even without service; I downloaded Mapdroyd offline maps, so that won't be a problem again.The screen is great. One of the reasons I got the One V originally was because I didn't want any more big phones, but this one is really not all that much bigger than the One V with a significantly larger - and better - screen. It is very responsive, crisp, has better viewing angles, and is generally just easier to type on, watch movies, or play games with. I will miss the ICS-designed capacitive buttons of the One V and I don't like the search button at all (keep accidentally hitting it, probably my only real gripe about the phone), but it's not THAT big a deal. A minor annoyance, not a dealbreaker, and something I'll just get used to (again, since I used to use Gingerbread-designed phones...).The camera is OK, nothing to write home about but not bad either. The 3D does work, but seems more a gimmick to me. I'll never use it, but it's there if it's important to anyone.The battery life is really not bad at all. I ran a stock battery for the first couple of days, and I was getting through the day with battery left over with moderate usage. Of course Android phones need to be charged every day, something I think alot of people who complain about battery life do not understand... Adjust screen brightness, display time-out, watch for runaway apps, etc. But relative to other Android phones this one is not bad at all. I got the 1900mah Anker batteries and did definitely notice a difference; I had to struggle to kill the battery (purposefully running it down for several cycles to do calibration is always a good idea)... I got home yesterday with over 50% battery with moderate usage. Not bad at all. Of course if you're doing heavy gaming or something that will kill any Android's battery very quickly, but this one is relatively good.I always get a case for my phones because I have slippery fingers. I usually get Otterboxes or Tridents, but didn't want to make this one too big, so I got the Acase one for it and could not be happier. It is a PERFECT fit and seems like it will give adequate protection.It has been pretty much problem-free so far, and I am pleasantly surprised about that considering all of the reported problems. Happy enough to order another one for the wife for Valentine's Day... :)UPDATE 1: After another week with the phone taking it all over Texas, I have a few comments to add.  - The Anker battery is awesome. I get home from work usually with 70-80% with light to moderate use, about 50-60% when using GPS  - I use GPS alot in my job, I am an investigator and am driving quite a bit to unknown places and rural areas. The GPS is generally GTG, you just need to have preloaded maps or have Google Maps with the target area loaded before you leave a service area for it to work. Mapdroyd works great.  - I have lost service in some rural areas. I think the antennae was slightly better with the One V, but it's not significantly worse, just some remote areas that I got it with the One V the EVO won't pick up. It's still pretty good service, and coverage is 80% or so even in the rural areas, clost to 100% in the urban areas.  - 4G is certainly spotty. Inside my house I can sometimes get a connection, sometimes not. When I get a connection it's always double 3G speeds. I go out on my balcony and I am getting 7mb down every time. At the local park it's spotty, at the city square it's 6mb down... you get the picture. When it works it's awesome, it's just spotty and I don't rely on it. It's a bonus when it works.Still very happy.

S-OFF and unlock, and root this phone, add a custom ROM and you're good. Overclock it all over, save battery, add features. Enjoy. It's a fast phone if you do it all right. Stock is fine, but it felt too limited for me. I usually run my phone at a max of 1.7 GHz and use a 4 MB cache for my SD card. I got the 2x Anker 1900 mAh battery pack with charger.

I decided to switch because I couldn't get 3G speeds on my iPhone at home, I had to go to certain areas to get 3G.  Even then, 3G coverage was limited.  I had 5GB's of up to 4G data speed, but I could hardly utilize it.  On top of that, I kept getting debt collection calls and various schools/apartment complexes calling for the previous owner (took a few threats of asking for their address so I can send a cease and desist later before they stopped calling).I decided enough was enough.  I used to have the Blackberry Curve 8530 on Virgin Mobile about 2 years ago, but I accidentally left the phone in my pants pocket and it got ruined in the wash, I regretted it every day since.  It was a good phone at the time, probably still would be at this time.I wanted a new smartphone, but I didn't want to spend a big amount of money on a new phone, I ended up not looking much because I knew that phones were expensive.  I remember seeing this phone being at least $300 a few months ago.  My friend got this phone and told me that Virgin Mobile will have a sale on their phones every once in a while.  I decided to keep eyeing their website and saw that the EVO V 4G was on sale for $150 rather than their usual $180-$200 price range.  I couldn't resist getting this particular phone, it pretty much has everything I want in a phone that I was looking for.Internet speedsI can get 3G in many more areas than I could on my iPhone on T-Mobile.  I live in a rural area and I get little 3G coverage, but at least that's something compared to my old provider.I used the Speedtest app to find out how fast 3G and 4G speeds were in the Orlando area.  On 3G, download speeds average from 400 kbps to 1.2mbps with upload speeds around 300 to 600 kbps.  When I tested 4G (rather limited coverage), I saw download speeds around 5mbps and upload speeds around 1.2 to 1.5 mbps.  Those speeds are just using the phone itself, I have yet to try the mobile hotspot.CameraThis camera has a 5MP digital camera with a 1.3 MP front facing camera.  There are two cameras on the rear facing for 3D pictures and videos.  When taking 3D pictures, it is a 2MP resolution.  The video camera records at 1280x720p at up to 30 Frames Per Second (The shutter does bring it down if recording in low light).  If you don't want HD videos, you can also record in 960x540, 640x480, 320x240, and 176x144 (for MMS).  The phone can take 3D videos as well, but that is stuck at 720P.  The flash can be used when recording videos, it can be turned on or off while filming.The quality for 720P came out better than I thought, the sound quality isn't the best, but it's better than the sound on the last digital camera I bought.The auto focus works alright on this camera.  What I love is that I can focus while the camera is recording a video just by tapping where I want the camera to focus on.MemoryWhen you buy the phone brand new, an 8GB Class 4 Kingston MicroSD card is included.  The card is already inserted into the phone.There is a gigabyte of memory of internal memory on the phone, but not really available for the user exactly.  You must have a MicroSD to take pictures, videos and even play music.  Most apps are able to install on the internal memory, but most often will store data on the MicroSD card.  Some apps can also be moved onto the MicroSD Card.Processor & RAMThis phone has a 1.2 GHz dual core processor and 1GB of RAM.  I haven't had any crashes yet caused by an error from app.  With that kind of processor and ram, you can actually multi task with this phone.  Example: Listening to Pandora while checking your email or downloading apps onto your phone.Since this phone operates on Virgin Mobile using the Sprint Network, you can't make a phone call and browse the internet at the same time if you're on 3G/4G unless you're using a VOIP App.Battery & ChargerA 1,730 mAH removable battery is included with the phone.  There is a wall adapter and a USB cable that is included.  The USB Cable is needed to charge with the wall adapter.  The wall adapter charges the phone at 5 volts, 1.0 amp.  Charging through a usb port will provide 5 volts, 500 milliamps.Buy a spare battery with the phone if you can, you will need it if you're a moderate to heavy user.  Moderate to heavy use can kill the battery in about 3 hours depending on your usage.  It will take about 3 or 4 hours to charge from a dead battery to a full battery.The battery doesn't come charged, there's only enough charge for a few minutes so you can get it plugged in to charge.  You will need to charge it up for a good amount if you want to try taking 3D pictures, I think if the phone has less than 20% of a charge, it won't let you take 3D pictures.Edit 3/17/2013Mobile HotspotI have had the chance to try the Mobile Hotspot feature on this phone.  In order to be able to use the hotspot feature, you will need to pay $15 a month for it or it won't work.  You can change the WiFi name and password to whatever you please, or even no password if you please.  While the hotspot is on, you can't use the phone's flash if you decide to take a picture.  You can still use the HTC while the hotspot is on (except make phone calls, Sprint's network is incompatible with making a call and using 3G/4G at the same time).  For example, you'd be able to watch a video on your computer and go on facebook or twitter from the phone at the same time.Make sure that you have 4G enabled if you wish to use it before turning on mobile hotspot.  You can turn 4G on or off once you turn on mobile hotspot, but if you turn on 4G after enabling hotspot, any devices connected will be disconnected for a moment or two while the phone searches for the 4G signal.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Virgin Mobile finally has some decent smartphones! This is a winner!", "Author": "drdoug99 \"Reader, gamer, etc.\"", "ReviewID": "R9E25Z0NDF8DC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work in IT and have fixed computers for the past 15 years. Keeping up with gadgets and video games, etc, so I'm the goto guy for anyone that knows me when it comes to technology. Funny enough my last and only smartphone before this was a Palm Pre, then I had a crappy Kyocera dumbphone on Virgin Mobile for 2 years before that. So I have not played with the latest technology when it comes to phones, but I've always kept up by reading reviews of the latest phones coming out.When I bought this phone, Virgin Mobile's price was $189, but they were running a promotion for $139. A steal for a quality phone like this. If you have virgin mobile, and are wondering if you need to upgrade to a real smartphone, don't hesitate to get this. It's great. Don't buy into the Apple hype and get a last gen iPhone 4 or 4S, for the price of one iPhone a family of 3 could each have one of these!Basically, here's the highlights of what I like about this phone:Good things are, Android 4.0. As of this writing my phone has Android 4.0.3 I believe. About half the smartphones on Virgin Mobile are still coming with Gingerbread 2.3 Android, which in itself is not super bad, but for the small price difference, you might as well get the most up to date version you can, which is the 4.0. Basically this is a much improved version of Android, will be more future proof for applications and games to work with, and all in all this is what you want.HTC Quality of phones. I have always read that HTC phones are pretty quality. This is true for me. The phone feels heavy, but heavy in a quality way, that everything is sturdy and solid. I've been using the phone for a couple weeks without a case, and it's comfortable to hold, the back casing is a nice textured rubberized grip, no complaints with anything loose or falling off.Speakerphone quality is good, the speakerphone when talking to people is loud and clear. Listening to games or music is plenty loud, many time I have to turn the volume down a couple notches.Screen brightness is excellent, I usually have the brightness on the 1/3rd lowest brightness, and it's plenty bright. Turning on full brightness I'm almost afraid to look straight on at the screen so my eyes don't melt off.Technical stuff, the screen is a higher resolution then the Samsung Galaxy S2, the Evo 3D is 540x960 versus Samsung's 480x800. But the trade off is that the Evo is a LCD screen, versus the Galaxy s2 is a Super AMOLED....much better viewing angles, more vivid looking colors despite the lesser resolution.Then another bonus is the graphics processor in the Evo 3d is better than the Galaxy s2, which is cool since I wanted to see what kind of games I could get, and not be limited. There's some pretty snazzy games out there for Android, so far there's only been a handful of games that require Nvidia's Tegra chipset that I haven't been able to play. Also since the graphics processor is better, I'd figure that would have to account for better phone performance overall too, so it's a win-win.Camera and Camcorder: This is a great replacement for a point and shoot camera. Has bright LED lighting built in, quality is very good. Takes about 1 second per picture, and it has lots of built in \"modes\" where you can have goofy faces or change the lighting effects or whatever. Camcorder works great, again high quality 720p on a phone is just crazy!!!!-------------------------------Bad things:Battery life. All phones battery life we wish would last forever, but this phone especially is bad. Usually just sitting in my pocket at work for 8 hours doing nothing the phone will be at 30 % at the end of the work day. So getting a spare battery or extended life batter would be a good idea.--------------------------Conclusion:That's really about it. Call quality is good, sounds nice and clear like any other phone I've used, land line or cell phone. The crazy stuff you can do since it's a smartphone is just crazy, and everyday since I've had it I've just been customizing it, finding cool new apps or things to do with it.

Read on to learn why.On paper, the V, which is a Virgin Mobile re-tooling of the HTC evo 3D, looks like a winner.  It has top-tier dual-core processing power, 4G capability, versatility on the Sprint network, and that much touted, oh-so-cool 3D screen.  And while you can find many glowing (indeed, euphoric) reviews on this phone, none of them address a few very important, often ignored, deeply disturbing technical flaws.1) SEVERE network signal issues---This was the most immediate problem right out of the box.  The V consistently and unfailingly drops data coverage, often going from 1G, to 3G, to 1G, and then no signal at all, sometimes in as little as a minute.  I live in an area that gets fine data coverage and slightly below-average call reception.  I have had Blackberries, AT&T;, and Motorola phones all worked fine within my area.  I have never had an issue with data coverage.  If I look out my west bedroom window, I can see the blinking light of a Sprint tower not two miles away.  When I contacted VM about the issue, I got the usual corporate read-from-a-manual garbage: pull the battery, update the profile, and so on.  Nothing worked.  Call reception will be fine, then drop like a rock with no warning on any call within a couple of minutes.If this were a fluke, I could understand, but a quick search on online forums, like XDAdevelopers and androidforums, reveals that this is a very common issue that is unavoidable.  The software is simply broken, and HTC nor VM will do anything about it.  Google \"htc evo v signal issues\" and you will get an eye-opening response.  Three out of every ten people are having this same problem.2)  Battery life---This one wasn't much of a surprise, given that an integrated 3D display requires two displays to run simultaneously.  As such, anyone would expect the battery to drain fast, but here's the problem---before I even got to the 3D shenannigans, I was barely getting an hour of wifi-connected web surfing.  The battery simply drains like a perforated boiler.  Flip on the 3D, however, and you can almost actively see the battery meter run dry.  An extended battery solves the problem, but did HTC honestly believe this battery life to be acceptable??  I have read one reviewer describe the battery life as being \"incredible.\"  How he came to that conclusion I have no idea, unless he was using the word as it its literal meaning; that is to say, having no credibility.  On that point, I would have to agree (and stop one step short of thinking it was a case of paid review farming.)3)  VM customer service---This is not so much a jab at the phone as it is the people willing to back it.  Yes, VM has excellent customer service, but only so long as you have a phone that works.  If not, their \"technical support\" consists of outsourced undergraduates reading pre-written tracts.  None of the people I talked to had any idea how a phone really worked, but they sure can tell you how to pull a battery out.  What they WON'T do is fix your problem by taking back your phone and replacing it with another model.  Curiously enough, when I sent emails to their technical support line, it took them an average of two days to get back to me.  It was due to \"an unusually high volume of technical requests,\" they said.  Unusually high, indeed.The software in this phone is broken.  If you get a bad one, be prepared for the consequences.  VM is having a blowout sale on these right now, and I suspect I know why.

My first comment upon receiving it was that it felt like it was made for military use.It's a rather large phone, so I don't recommend it for small pockets - make sure you have something else to carry it in if you don't have much room there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - I love having the large screen. Still, it's something to bear in mind.The 3D photo feature is just fun. It works very well and allows you to store your memorable moments in a whole new way. Or your not so memorable moments. Really anything you feel like taking a photo of. Unfortunately, since most phones and computers don't have the capability to display these photos, you'll have to convert them to 2D to be able to view them off your phone - but no worries, it can do that too.I did experience some network glitches shortly after activation, but they seem to have gone away.Also would like to add that apparently Virgin Mobile HAS added 4G service since the product description was written - I turned on the 4G antenna just to see what would happen, and sure enough it connected and works great.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone, too delicate.", "Author": "nchl", "ReviewID": "ROGJINH3E3LH0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I enjoy the phone, it's superior to my old phone in so many ways, is faster, larger screen, clearer images, the camera(s) are better, to name a few of the qualities I enjoy about it.

After doing some online research I was a little hesitant to buy this phone because of some of the negative reviews I had read on Amazon.com. The price was right, however and I decided to take a chance on this phone and it has not let me down.First off, the 3D thing is sort of gimmicky and if you are interested in this phone just for that I would have to say don't buy this. The 3D camera leaves a lot to be desired, but I did not buy it for that. I did buy this phone because of the processors that it came with. It has a dual core processor which screams along with the HTC Sense GUI that this comes with. I have yet to find myself wishing for a faster phone. The screen is beautiful, and the touch screen is very responsive. I haven't had any connectivity issues at all, although I have not used this on 4G as we do not have 4G service in my area.All in all I would have to say that I have no regrets buying this phone and if I had a choice between this phone and some of Virgin Mobile's higher priced phones, such as the Galaxy SII and the iPhone, I would choose this phone again.

I sold it for $115 & bought the HTC Evo 3D 4G from Virgin Mobile for $149 (Sprint's No Contract carrier that uses the Sprint network) via Walmart.com. Here is a quick list of my observations (or the good & the not so good).The Good1. The phone itself comes with ICS (Android 4.0.3) and HTC's Sense 3.6 - the 1.2 GHz snapdragon processor is blazing fast. The UI & features are excellent. Google Maps allows for talking in an address and immediately looking up the address with street view showing the location (and giving directions). It just may replace my GPS (I bought a separate USB cradle for charging and it works great for sitting on a dashboard when docked). Action is smooth and the \"live\" weather background is like \"dreamscene\" in Windows Vista Ultimate with the clouds moving like you are flying. Awesome eye candy. The phone reception is strong (much better than iPhone & the AT&T; network).2. The battery is the weakness, but I purchased the extended battery so this is not an issue. I prefer having a phone I can hold onto instead of it being super thin (it helps if the phone is dropped when combined with a rubber shell as the screen is less likely to shatter) so the extended battery and replacement back helps immensely.3. The wifi is crazy fast, and 4G (wimax) is also fast (a huge difference when compared to 3G).4. Skype video is awesome (who needs facetime????).5. The ability to transfer from the old phone to the new phone regarding contacts and data via Bluetooth (and a wizard) is crazy good.6. Very easy setup to Facebook, email, etc.-------------------------------------------------The not so good1. The controls on the screen are very \"touchy\" and you have to hold the phone in a certain way to ensure it isn't going nuts opening apps/tasks).2. The side mini usb port is poorly designed (it looks like it could break easily). I am just extra careful with it (versus the Apple port on the iPhone which is more durable).Overall, a great phone for using for email/messaging, phone/voice calls, playing with apps, multi-tasking, etc. Much like a PC or laptop, I know this isn't like a VCR and \"just works\" when being turned on. I know when the O/S (Android) is having a hiccup, I just shut down / restart (when in doubt, reboot). I rarely have to do that (no more than I did with my previous iPhone). For the money, this is a HUGE bang for the buck (for $45 a month for unlimited data - unlimited messaging - and 1,200 minutes call time). And yes, I know Sprint throttles data.... but at the 2.5 GB point, I understand (which is why the Wi-Fi aspect helps keep that data usage down and I get fast speeds when I do need it).HTC EVO V 4G Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)-------------------------------------Update 1 - The phone is exceeding my expectations.

This phone improves on the Optimus in every way, and was certainly worth the money to upgrade.This is running Android 4.0.3 with HTC Sense 3.6.  I like the new, faster look and feel, whether it be due to HTC or Android, or both.  Activation was easy on Virgin - no problems that others have reported.  I just replaced my Optimus with the Evo.  All works!I have 1GB of memory to actually USE: on the Optimus, I had room for only about 8 apps on the phone, that I could not move to the sd card, so I was constantly getting \"low on memory\" notices.  On this Evo, I have all the apps I want on there, and still have 411 MB on the phone to load.  I move all the apps that will move to the SD card.  Some don't.  I'm thrilled with all the extra memory.The phone is bigger, giving me a bigger screen, easier to search the web, make phone calls.  The touch is lighter, and much faster to respond. I don't text much, so I can't comment on the \"radio interference\" some have reported.  I've had two dropped calls in about two months, which while not perfect, is okay:  I called them back.  No worries.The camera in 2D does fine: the 3D for me is unnecessary.  I use the 4G network, or 3G, to stream music from Google Cloud - works better than the 3G I had with the Optimus.  Apps that sometimes crashed on the Optimus run fine on the Evo.I use the headset AND the car charger I got with the Optimus with the Evo.  Both work well, though I have read that a faster car charger would be faster!  The one I have works for me.While I was listening to a podcast (using Pocket Casts), I got a phone call - the podcast paused - I pushed the mic button on my headset - talked my talk - then the podcast resumed.

I was very weary on purchasing the phone due to the very low reviews I viewed on Amazon as well as the rumors that there was radio interference errors that plagued the phone. I even watched youtube videos of users who couldnt even get their phones connected to the VM network and activated. Im not sure why this is occuring for those users but I can only make a few guesses.I havent tried to recreate this issue, but the other day I had the 4G activated because i have access to it in my home (Stratford, CT area.) I drove to work that morning and realized that the area did NOT have 4G access because there was a notification that came up which made this evident. (A wifi looking logo with '4G!' under it.) During this time my wife text me and said she recieved a weird error message tho I was still able to recieve her message. I turned off my 4G and the phone immediately went to 3G. During this time before I could switch the 4G off I could still text and recieve data. Im guessing that if there is no 4G access in the area, and the 4G is activated, this may have something to do with errors that ppl are recieveing. This of course is just a hunch. Now, I make sure to turn off the 4G access when it isnt available and I havent had not one issue with it. Ive text over 75 messages so far, downloaded many apps, made calls and checked my voicemail with not one issue at all.My EVO V came in the standard black, no Sprint logo with the black and red Virgin Mobile battery backing. Ive heard of people having problems with the Evo V's with the sprint logo in the plum coloring. Im also guessing this could be a problem as there were 2 different versions built for each company but are still identical to each other.So far ive had no issues with this phone. The pictures are gorgeous, the service is excellent, the screen is bright, the audio is clear, the touch screen is effective. The only thing I cant say is great is battery life (The sole reason this is 4 stars ainstead of 5. Battery life with the standard battery and heavy usage just plain sucks.) Because of this issue I purchased an extended life battery which gets me thru the work day and then some.Overall, this is a great phone with no reportable issues at the moment. I will give a update in about 3 months to give you all an idea of how the phone has held up over some wear and tear.I do however have the voicemail logo at the top of my screen but it says I have no voicemails...

My intent is not to be verbose as much as it is to be completely thorough.  I hope it helps someone else avoid what I went through.To start, prior to buying this phone, I was with ATT&T; for over 12 years straight.  Sometimes they billed me incorrectly, or caused an error, but it was usually corrected pretty promptly and with little difficulty.  I switched only because the cost of service had simply gotten too high.---I ordered my Virgin HTC Evo 4g from Virgin Mobile at the end of November from Virgin's website.  I received it on Dec 1, 2012.  The phone would not connect to the network.  I tried using the internet for about an hour to connect through the portal, and use the automatic setup on the phone itself, neither worked.  So, I called tech support.  After an hour, they told me that it would take up to 72 hours for me phone to connect to the system, due to my number being ported.I have worked in the cell phone industry for years, and know that we always tell customers that it may take up to 72 hours, but I have never had a customer even leave the store without their phone being functional after a port--even with other Virgin mobile accounts.  Apparently mine was different.  After a full 72 hours my phone did start working.Withing the first couple days I noticed several things:1-battery life was atrocious. This was not my first smart phone, and I am used to a new phone battery lasting a full day with normal use.  This one lasts a full day with VERY light use, even using the GPS once will reduce the battery very substantially;2-Repeatedly, the phone will show a \"Radio Resource Interference\" error. When this happens the phone will stop working;3-If 4G is turned on (I am sure that there is actually no functionality to this \"feature\"--it is more like a switch to make my phone not work), then I am not able to make any calls, or use the internet functionality of my phone.  I have sometimes tried a call 20 times (showing full bars) yet when I turn 4G off, the phone works again;4-When 4G is on, occasionally an icon will appear in the notifications area telling me 4G is available. When this happens it will ask you to tap to see 4G service options-when you tap, nothing happens;5- I might be alone on this, but the HTC Sense shell that they have over Android is terrible-even the phone book is super-confusing (once again, I am pretty much an android power user). For instance, there are multiple entries on my phone book due to using several google accounts.  When you click the de-duplicate option, it says that there are no duplicates, even though there are tons.  The Camera has no function I have found to turn the loud shutter sound off.  I always feel that I must be missing something obvious, but there is no way to simply tap the address bar to type in a url in the included web browser.  You actually have to tap and erase the url character-by-character in order to type in a new one (I simply use dolphin browser instead).  There is no way to turn off the notification bar's list of last used programs. When you click on the clock it takes you to World Time, instead of the alarm--and you can't adjust this. The voice search option in the phonebook is totally useless, even though in my last android it worked almost miraculously.6- I have full bars maybe 10% of the time--no matter where I go.  Maybe 75% of the time I have 1 or 2--despite Virgin's coverage map showing full green for almost everywhere I go.I am not a picky person, by the way.  I loved my last phone and had virtually no complaints--there are things that I would have changed about it, but nothing is perfect, right? I am doing my best not to compare this phone to my last one, though.So, after about a week and a half of trying it out, I called tech support.  The tech told me that this was a common issue they were having with all of the Evo 4G's (the Radio Interference and reception, and 4G issues), and that it was something we could fix.  He told me to take the battery out for 15 seconds, and then put it back in.  Then dial ##clear# and do a reset.  Then the phone would reconnect and update.  Then it would work perfectly.  He said he would call me back in a few minutes, after I did the process to see if it worked. I did all of this, and waited to see if it would solve the problem.  He did not call me back.The problems were not fixed, if not actually made worse.  Some days I might get the error message once.  Some days it would happen literally every 30 seconds, making loud error honk noise that you cannot disable.  I waited about 3 days to test and troubleshoot.I called again and went through all of the same issues.  The technician took my wife's phone number down and said he'd call me when she got home to troubleshoot the problem.  When she got home, I waited.  When it got to be 9PM, over an hour and a half after he said he'd call, I called them.  I went through all the same things as I had each time.Finally, the tech told me that he'd send me a replacement phone.  He told me that when I got the phone it would not have a back cover, battery, or charger.  I should use the ones from my current phone.  I asked him if this meant that they were sending me a refurbished phone.  He said yes. I told him that since I had purchased a new phone, I should get a new phone and not a used one. He said that that was the only option, unless I mailed my phone back, then they would refund me, and I could buy a different phone.  I thought this was also unacceptable, as that meant going for at least a week with no phone at all.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.The supervisor reiterated what I had just been told by the technician.  I was annoyed and inconvenienced  but not angry--especially since none of these people actually caused my problem.  I never get angry or irate.  I expect to be treated respectfully, so I treat them that way too.  In this case, I told him that these were unacceptable answers and that I wanted to speak with his supervisor.  He told me that I could not talk to anyone higher than him, but I could email a general feedback email address if I wanted.  I told him that I would think about my options and consider changing to a different service.  I told him that I definitely didn't want to have a refurbished phone sent to me.  He confirmed that the order for that had been cancelled and annotated.I received a refurbished phone in the mail 2 days later.  Though I did not want this, and was told it would not be sent, it looked to be in great condition, and all I wanted was a working phone anyway, so I tried it.  This phone had the exact same problems, plus the visual voice mail did not work.  It always said I had no messages, even though there were messages.  I had to dial my voice mail every time in order to receive them.To be fair, it did seem to have slightly better reception, and that when 4G was on it only occasionally would not make calls or connect to the internet.  These problems still persisted, but were about 50% better.I called tech support again about 2 days later (yesterday).  First  I went through the battery, ##clear#, phone reset, reboot process (this is what you should do before your call so that you won't have to waste time on the call--they will always tell you to do this). The tech told me that he would have to talk to me using a different phone.  I told him that this was my primary line, and that I would not have a different phone until after my wife go home.  He said he could call me back if I gave him her number, at the preset time.He actually did call me back. The technician spent over an hour with me, trying to fix this problem.  At the end of our call, I tested my phone.  Any call that I attempted led to an error message that said \"You are not authorized to make this call.\"  The technician told me that it would take up to 4 hours for my phone to work through the network.  I was not happy about that, but he said that there was nothing he could do.This morning, I still could not make calls, even to customer service.  I called back and talked to a different technician.  Each time that I call, they have me do the same process, ##clear#, turn the phone off and on, take the battery out, do a phone update, etc.  This never works.  The technician told me, after nothing worked, that she was going to escalate the situation further, and that I would get a call back.  I asked how long this would take, and she said 4 days.I told her that 4 days was highly unacceptable, and I wanted to talk to a supervisor, that I wasn't mad at her, but I was unsatisfied.  She said that she would transfer me, and then hung up on me.I called back,  and asked to talk to a supervisor immediately.He was very helpful, understanding, and told me that he made lots of notes and would be escalating the problem.  Since this was my primary phone, he told me to call back and ask for the Rescue Department whenever I could and they would report to me what has happened.  He also said that I would be compensated.  He also indicated that problems like this could be why they decided to reduce the price of the phone in the first place.  I said that it would have been more reasonable to pull the phone from the market entirely if it didn't function properly.We will see what happens. I am reporting this entire process to the FCC.  I rely on a cell phone for business, and am losing money both by having paid for a service that I am not receiving, for taking my time repeatedly to call tech support (at my count a total of 9 times, almost every time for over an hour, once for 2 hours and 15 minutes--this is not counting the times they have hung up on me in transferring a call), but also because I need my phone in order to make money for my job.I cannot think of a time when I have received as poor customer service as I have with this phone and with Virgin Mobile as a service.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone makes me feel old", "Author": "E.

The problem with the phone is compounded by the poor customer service provided by almost any MVNO. If you get lucky and don't need to call customer support, it's possible Virgin Mobile would be a good choice. But not with the VM/EVO V combo.I've now spent in excess of 20 hours on the phone with their various support departments, and was promised that a software update would solve the issue, and the update would be released by November 16. When the update failed to materialize, I called and demanded a replacement. The replacement came, and they sent the wrong phone. -.-After going round and round with them, explaining that they messed up and sent the wrong replacement phone, they finally did send another EVO V, but it too returned the error within one week. So, they are shipping replacements with the same issue, and without the update applied.They are sending another replacement, which will be promptly dumped onto eBay.

My ONE V was easily strained by even light multitasking, and would often lock up on me. Thanks to the dual-core CPU and 1GB of RAM on the EVO, I don't have to worry. The EVO is better in every way over the ONE V, except for the screen. The EVO has basically the exact same pixel density (4 more ppi), but the color is just not as vibrant. Looking at the EVO, the colors are satisfactory, but then when compared side-by-side with the One V, it is a huge disappointment.Despite the screen, I am more than satisfied with my EVO V 4G, and love the gimmicky 3D feature. For the 3D, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that normal 3D videos (like a ripped 3D DVD) will play on the phone with no problem. I had thought that it might only support videos recorded on the device itself. I watched The Amazing Spider-man in 3D on the phone, and the 3D effect was just as good as that of an $800 Vizio 3D TV, though with a MUCH narrower viewing angle.Love this phone, and apart from the Galaxy S3, it is the best phone you could get for Virgin Mobile (Galaxy S2 would be a close second, but is ruined by the pathetic pixel density).", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Prepaid Smartphone I've ever bought", "Author": "M.

I work from home for my company which is based in CA and I make calls all over the country everyday. This little phone has not only helped me to do that, but with crystal clear speaker phone sound  (on both ends and that is verified), I can record my calls for memory recall later and don't have to have a headset on my ears all day.Plus it doubles as an mp3 player and internet radio device that I play music with all day at my desk. The best part of that is if a call comes in or I make one, the mp3 or radio sound pauses automatically for me so I don't have to scramble to shut it off if my boss calls.Additionally, the phone comes equipped with a VPN client so that you can setup a secure transmission line and data stream if needed which is a huge plus in my line of work. It syncs my contacts and organizes them into groups that it will allow me to send mass emails out to entire groups of 300+ in a blink of an eye. Something my old phone could never have done. Oh, and I also found out last night while I was goofing around that the phone can talk to my 3D LG television on the other end of the house. I was fooling around with some settings in the music section and my son yelled out what just happened to the tv. The song I was playing on my phone started playing on the tv and interrupted his show. Pretty funny. The bottom line here is that this phone is stellar.I have not had any problems with the screen going nuts on me like many reviewers have but then again, I did spring for the docking station as well which means that I don't have to handle it as much.

Valdez", "ReviewID": "R1JGXZGJVIL2WV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Summary: Phone failed in first 3 months, HTC botched the repair and still hasn't rectified the situation after more than a month.This was my first Android phone and the first phone I ever bought outright without a contract. I have no complaints about the phone itself, other than the fact that the screen backlight failed in the third month that I owned it.  That is when the nightmare started.Being that the phone is not subsidized by the carrier, you're on your own when it comes to repair.  What it meant for me, since my phone was still under warranty, was calling HTC, getting an RMA number and sending it in (at my cost).  To their credit, that whole process went rather smoothly.  I sent the phone in and it was back in my hands after about a week.  However, when I went to power up the phone, my heart sank - the Sprint logo popped up on the screen and I knew I was in for a hassle.  They sent me back a phone that was locked to the wrong carrier and Virgin refused to activate it.Calling HTC again, my case was referred to escalations.  What this meant was, in contrast to the quick, responsive experience I had when first called in, I would have to wait 10 days to get a response (actually, in my case, I had to wait 13 because, having not heard anything, I called them back 3 days in and the agent was kind enough to \"re-escalate\" my case which somehow resulted in the timer being reset on me).  I eventually received a prepaid overnight shipping label, sent in my phone, and been left to wonder why they sprung for overnight shipping when my phone has apparently been sitting in their shipping dock ever since.I'm severely irritated by the whole situation. It's annoying enough to have a product fail on you prematurely, but that I can at least understand - no company can achieve 100% reliability on a product.  However, to botch the repair and then make no effort to resolve the mistake in a timely fashion is, to me, unforgivable.

I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for about 6 years now and I've never had a problem with their services.  I like their selection of phones but until a year and a half ago I didn't even bother looking at their smart phone selection.  I decided it was time for an upgrade and decided on this phone.  I am so happy with this phone.  I was also thinking about getting VM's Iphone, but after doing a little research I realized that everything that I needed was in this phone and for half the price of the Iphone.I consider myself an \"Average Joe\" and this phone has plenty of features for guys like me.  I'm happy just being able to text and play games just to waste time but add to that a number of other apps that help you navigate, find the cheapest gas in town, customize your own radio station, etc. and you've got it made.  TIP: Do a Google search for the top free Android phone apps and you'll come across a number of articles that will recommend all of the cool and necessary apps you'll ever need.  Add to this the fact that you can listen to music, utilize social networks on the go, mobile WiFi for your laptop, Bluetooth capability, and you realize that this phone has plenty of power to boot.  I enjoy the fact that I'm not tied down to long-term contracts and that's where Virgin Mobile shines.You do have to pay an extra $15/month for WiFi and the \"unlimited data\" is not really unlimited, 4G coverage will fluctuate depending on where you live, but all of that fades into the back when you have a phone with plenty of features at a great price.  Make sure you get the Laza Extended Battery, believe me, it pays for itself 10 times over!  The only downside is that they don't make an OtterBox case for the extended battery.  Before I got the extended battery I had the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case and that thing was like a suit of armor for my phone.  Hopefully OtterBox will come out with a special Lazo Extended Battery case soon. I also got a ZAGG Invisible Shield for the face.  I had a ZAGG IS for my last phone and it did an awesome job of protecting that phones screen.  Oh, and don't forget a 32 MicroSD card upgrade for all the pics you'll be taking.

Bresin \"Dusty\"", "ReviewID": "R351MN6EQBCUM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I have had this phone for a little over a year and it's great. I have been with Verizon, AT&T;, and now Virgin. With little to no reception from my house with AT&T; I get fairly decent reception while taking calls (sometimes I have to step out on to the porch). The data where I live is always 3G but doesn't matter because I have WiFi hooked up in the house, and the phone still receives signal all the way out in the garage. When 4G is available (in the city) it's just like being connected to WiFi, it's super fast. I just recently took a trip to New Jersey, and purchased the mobile hotspot for the extra $15, and connected my mothers Ipad, and my sisters Kindle Fire HD. Both devices and my HTC where flying high I was surfing the web and lisening to music, my sister was doing the same, and my mother was on Amazon watching a movie in HD. I love Spotify and surfing the web, text is great and phone calls are always clear. The Battery does get hit pretty hard if your listening to music over the web(about 4 hours) but if it's just occasional web browsing, a few phone calls, and messing around with apps I don't have to charge it until the end of my day around 12 to 14 hours. Durability is also a plus I have dropped it in a puddle of water, dropped it from about 8 ft. and take it to work with me daily(very dirty). Overall this phone is great, I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to surf, text, and talk.

Hands down the best virgin mobile phone I've ever had. Still haven't had any problems with the phone, and finding accessories like cases is easy since it's an updated HTC EVO 3D. The 3D feature is pretty sweet and there are even a few games that utilize the feature, the only thing is the 3D viewing angle is slim so if you go to show someone a 3D pic or 3D youtube video they would have to hold it, multiple people can't fully see the 3D. This phone is also very fast the 4G works great and you won't see loading screens for very long and games look great. The graphics on this phone are great, really sharp and clear. This phone has also never crashed on me which is a very rare thing for most androids. The only negative thing is the battery life will significantly drop if you forget the 4G on or if you watch or use the 3D feature a lot.

It also lacks hardware buttons on the front, which my old phone had, so I had to get used to using the lock button to wake it up. The 3D camera and screen work surprisingly well, but don't let that be your only deciding factor--it is definitely gimmicky. Battery life (after the battery is broken in) is only slightly worse than the Optimus V. I could probably go 2 days between charges, but I usually don't. I'm almost always on Wi-Fi, though. I worry about the big glass panel on the back for the cameras (and LED flash), but it has some kind of coating on it that seems to be doing its job.

I have tinkered around with other android devices like the Vizio Co-Star and other attempts to tell cable how I really feel about them, but this is my smartphone, android or otherwise. I don't talk a lot on the phone, but I did want the ability to get online on the go, price check deals, play games or something while waiting, and this fits the bill, nicely... mostly.I like the shape of the phone. I know others tell me it feels heavy, and it doesn't see too bad to me. I've tinkered around with it one handed for example. The screen looks great. The sound is pretty good. Expandable memory is a plus, and I have yet to install anything I can't run. There are some downsides though. The battery life is awful. If anything is going to get me to upgrade the device, it's this. I can't stand how short it is under even moderate use. I understand smartphones use a lot more energy, but compared to more expensive phones, you can really tell on this one. I've had to reset the phone a number of times, as in way too many times, especially when handling the WiFi. For reasons unknown, it will connect to my WiFi but not actually connect. It's a strange situation where it has an IP address but it's not online. It shows the the WiFI icon, but the are no bars. A reset fixes this. Occasionally the screen gets garbled, but only when transitioning or a window pops up. A reset usually fixes this.My biggest gripe of all, however, has nothing to do with the phone and everthing to do with Virgin Mobile. My experience with their customer service and porting a number was awful. We're talking no less than 6 to 8 transfers per call between two departments calling three days in a row until a problem, their error, was fixed. And in addition to that, the service here is slow. It's only 3G in my area, and while its better than nothing...

Much better than my last 2 phones (Samsung & Motorola)- Fast processor. Even when I'm not connected to WiFi this phone whips through web pages with no problem.- Turn by turn GPS. This feature is AWESOME! Always been accurate and you can set it to speak the directions out loud to you (like a traditional Garmin or TomTom GPS) or you can turn that off and just look at the map. I also like that it shows you an actual photo of your destination (thank you Google Earth!)- \"Visual Voicemail.\" I love this feature, instead of having to listen to your voicemail and then go through the keypad to delete, replay, skip, etc. there are simple visual buttons on the bottom of the voicemail screen, like a trashcan for the delete. It makes it so easy to breeze through your voicemail when usually you have to sit and listen through the recordings and your options. Also, it has a feature where you can just read the voicemail instead of have to listen to it which is very handy if you're checking your voicemail box somewhere that you need to be discreet.CONS:- Size and weight. This phone is pretty thick and bulky and quite heavy. Aesthetically it's just not that pleasing.- The camera lenses on the back are raised so they stick out more than the rest of the back plate. This makes my phone slide all over the place when I place it down on a hard surface and could be easily scratched.- The external speaker isn't loud so this phone doesn't do much good for listening to music if you don't have a docking station. Also this affects the speaker phone so sometimes when it's on speaker I can't hear the other person well.In general, my gripes about this phone are minor.

Then it went so very bad.", "Author": "travick", "ReviewID": "R3MVAH1AXUZ1HF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "While this phone is very thin, light, and has a decently-sized screen with an ok-processor, it's still a very fragile phone. I put a screen protector and a case on it as soon as I got it because I paid the full $250+ for it back in October 2012.At first, everything was just fine: screen was responsive, speaker sounded great, 3D camera worked as well as a 3D camera on a phone could, didn't experience much lag unless I was running a very intense app, etc.Unfortunately, the fragility of the phone became apparent when it accidentally dropped from my lap as I was getting out of the passenger seat of a car about a month and a half after I got it. Yes, it was my fault that my phone dropped, BUT I had a pretty decent two-piece silicone-and-hard-plastic-shell case on which absorbed the shock. Apparently, that wasn't enough since, about a week or two later, I started experiencing some jumps and twitches.I didn't think much of it since I figured most phones had that and some of my other friends that had this same phone (but on Sprint) and had the same problem of some minor jumps and twitches. It wasn't enough to completely interfere with day-to-day usage, but it was annoying when it would occasionally press a random letter when I was typing or activate another point on the screen when I was using an app or playing a game.Fast forward to now, June 2013, 8 months after I first started using it, I've dropped it just once more (again, from my lap as I was getting out of the car, so it wasn't very high at all) with the case on and everything. It was fine for about four days, and then I started noticing more jumps and twitches than usual; it was difficult to swipe up the unlock ring (I had to flick the ring up from the bottom of the screen since there was a dead zone JUST above the unlock area so I couldn't drag the ring up) typing was becoming a nightmare, and the screen would indicate a touch-point on a part of the screen somewhat far from where I was actually touching (in essence, it was indicating that I was touching two places at once when really I only had one of my fingers touching only one part of the screen.)I checked various forums in regards to this phone and this specific issue and it seems that it's a very common problem. Most of the people dropped their phones once or twice and from a pretty low height and voila, screen glitches. Some of the moderators and more technologically-experienced users deduced that the jumps and twitches were due to a cracked digitizer that came as a result to a drop and can be replaced by HTC or your carrier for roughly $35 (I'm not sure if the prices are different since the posts are from 2012)I know the phone owners, such as myself, are at fault for dropping our phones. However, you'd think that phones of this caliber wouldn't be SO DAMN FRAGILE. I have friends that have dropped their iPhones and Galaxy GS3's with simple bumpers or thin cases and never experienced this kind of problem!I'm very disappointed in the quality of this phone. Yes it lasted me 8 months, but that's still a very short time for ANY type of phone. HTC shouldn't have made the digitizer on this phone so fragile. I can't recommend this phone to anyone anymore. Although VM took it off their website, so I'm assuming they stopped carrying this phone. Good thing too because then others would go through the same problems that I and many other HTV EVO 3D users have gone through.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "FAST shipping -- Great Phone", "Author": "Alicia Hager", "ReviewID": "R33FI2P83BJSXC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We'd been scraping by on our three year old Samsung smartphone and so when the necessity of a new phone presented itself we weren't sure what to buy. The Evo is sleek, light, has good battery life if you don't play Angry Birds all day (note to self), holds a charge in stand by quite well. Using the browser is really fast, the phone has no lag in responding to input at all, touch screen is very responsive and the keyboard is big enough for my husband to use comfortably. We love it! We would suggest a speaker dock and case as accessories. The 3D camera is really cool, front facing camera works well and the regular camera with flash is very sufficient for us and our on the go type pics of our kids. Call quality is fine and phone is very easy to navigate. We would buy another one!-- About a week in I would add the following: When you \"sync\" Facebook or any other account to your phone every single contact will sync. If you have 500 friends on Facebook you will see them all. I have not been able to figure out a way to only sync specific contacts like I was able to do with the Samsung, so have the sync turned completely off.

It is very, very poor. I would have given it 2 stars for this reason, but thankfully there is a extended battery for it that you can buy called a Laza ZCell. I bought it here on amazon and it more than quadrupled my battery life. If you buy this phone, you are truly not finished purchasing until you get the laza zcell battery also, trust me on that.It has a fast processor meaning that browsing the web, using apps, playing games, and anything else is going to be very fast. I do not have 4g in my area yet but the 3g almost always loads web pages quickly for me. When I first got this it was new with them and I paid $250. It was worth it then and at this Amazon price is a great deal. It works great and I have so far used it for anything and everything. It is a pity so many people on here are giving it bad reviews because of the errors they are receiving. Sorry for them but mine works perfectly. Another superb feature is the 3D. It takes great looking 3D pictures and you can even do some cool 3D video capture with it. This feature is very cool.Overall I am super satisfied with my phone.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Liked it at first", "Author": "CM1", "ReviewID": "R16TVO94KB61ZZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first thing I noticed about this phone is how heavy it is.  That was a negative but I liked the phone as it was an upgrade from my little slider and the voice reception on speakerphone was great.  However, I have to rate this phone 1 star for the following reasons:  The battery life is absolutely terrible.  If you google htc evo 5 extended battery you'll see for yourself.  I have tried a brand new battery and have the same result.  It drains very quickly.  It drains quick even when you don't use it.  If you use the net or the camera the battery will be drained in no time.  Over the holidays I had my phone fully charged and as soon as I started taking a couple of pictures it started draining to battery warning.  I had only taken 2 to 3 pictures and was already at half power.  The phone has a 3 d camera but those just turn out really distorted and hard to look at.The operating system is ok but the voice control is very frustrating.  I can't voice in a text without numerous errors that end up making typing it out the only option.  Also, the camera has high pixels but the photos come out blurred.  When you are aiming the camera even trying to hold it absolutely still, it still goes in and out from blurred to clear.  It's a total crapshoot when you hit the shutter.  When it does take a good picture they're great but 80 percent of mine were bad either blurred or they would be incredibly dark.  You can hold the phone at the same object and it will flip back and forth to light to real dark.So although just looking at the specs it seems like a great value I found this phone to be very problematic.  My friend with an iPhone was taking great pictures, surfing the net continuously, and had no problems with battery life.So there you go.  Biggest problem: battery (tried 2) problems makes the phone non functional and photos are very hit and miss.  I got a clear focused one maybe 1 out of 5 times.  Oh and I tried the hotspot and although the phone is fairly fast on the net when you do the hotspot the connected device was very slow.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Affordable, good phone; bad network", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3L11QY4TMGK7G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After nearly a decade of average phone use I decided I needed to upgrade to a phone with more capabilities, mainly for email and web with a decent size display. Because I absolutely refuse to pay the ridiculous amount of money that Verizon and pretty much any other network requires for data, naturally I turned to prepaid and I decided to go big or go home with the Evo 3D rather than a cheaper phone with similar capabilities.Rather than writing some sort of essay, it's just easier to list the pros and cons with explanations where necessary:Pros:-The price! I pay $40/ mo. for unlimited data (with throttling), unlimited text, and 300 minutes! Before I paid $30/mo. on Sprint for just 300 minutes...Can't beat the price!!!!!!-Big display-Good microphone-overall good design (with exceptions for the home button (see below)-sturdy build quality-loads of good, modern features and options-decent hardware (I went with this one over the other Evo mainly because of the larger screen and the dual core processor)-Visual voicemail! I love this feature...Especially because I hear some people have to pay for it.-Data, 2.5 GBs before throttling. 2.5 GBs is quite a lot, especially since I use Wifi most of the time, I usually end up only using 1-1.5 GBs per month.-Ubuntu for Android. Not released yet, however as a huge Linux fan, this looks amazing, and from what I've read, this phone will support Ubuntu for Android when it's released.-No HDMI, but it has MHL through use of the microUSB port - Two in one!Cons:-AWFUL network!  To elaborate: I've had Sprint for many years, and Virgin uses the same towers, as a result, you get the same mediocre service. I rarely have full bars, but usually have one or two, which is just enough for phone calls and sending the occasional text. It's \"Good enough\" but quite frustrating a lot of the time...Another problem with Virgin is the phone can occasionally \"lose communication with the network.\" Now, the first time this happened I had no idea what was going on, my phone could not receive or place calls, nor send or receive texts. The internet still worked on Wifi, but not on the mobile network, which wouldn't even connect. I let this behavior continue for about 12 hours before giving in and calling Virgin mobile. Some substantial amount of time later I spoke with a technician that apparently \"reset the communication\" to my phone and I was instructed to remove the battery and leave it out for about 15 minutes. This whole bit sounded like a load of BS, and it most likely was. The next time this happened (and it has happened A LOT!) i simple removed the battery, left it out for a minute or so, then rebooted. Everything was fine after that. This would be a great solution if my case wasn't a pain to remove and put back on. To this day, I don't understand how a mobile communications provider allows this sort of dysfunctional behavior with their phones. By the way, this is not limited to my phone, a friend of mine has Boost Mobile (same Sprint towers), and he has the same problem.  Note: After the previous update a couple weeks ago, this problem has not happened. I will update this review by removing this statement if it happens again.-No local 4G.  Sprint doesn't offer 4G in my city, kinda sucks, but 3G is good enough -Update on 3G, see update 12/29/12--I don't like the placement of the home button  A lot of times while typing, I may accidentally hit the home button with the side of my hand and it will close the app. This doesn't happen with the case on.-The keyboard sucks! This is not Evo 3D inclusive, but rather Android's problem.  I can actually type faster and with much more accuracy on the keyboard on my iPod Touch (A MUCH smaller screen) Android did an awful job not leaving any space between the letters, but instead made the letters much bigger.-Standard smartphone battery life: 12 hours under normal use, less than 4 under heavy use...Bring your charger with you!-Outdated OS. To my knowledge there are no plans for releasing Jelly Bean for this phone under Virgin Mobile.-Sometimes calls don't come through. This is different from the problem above, I'll set my phone down in an area with plenty of service, but only a voicemail will come through and no missed call.-The camera: It seems like the phone must be held ABSOLUTELY still for a decent photo...They blur so easily! It usually takes 2 or 3 tries to get a decent picture.Final notes:-I don't really use the 3D much, as stated above I only chose this one due to the dual core CPU and the larger display. I tested the 3D, and it's a neat feature, but not worth paying more money for. I've only taken like 3 or 4 3D pictures, it's really no big deal.-I will update this review if anything changes.Update: 12-29-2012 -------------------------I've found another con with the data (3G):I'm usually on WiFi, as my house and work both have it and I rarely use the phone for video streaming or anything that requires a relatively fast internet connection. I've only really streamed video over WiFi, but I recently went on a trip where I didn't have access to WiFi and tried to stream video, and even though I had a constant 3-4 bars of service and \"3G\" (and not throttled, I was only at about 500 MB of data) the video was only standard definition and still unwatchable, the \"3G\" is far too slow for streaming unless you have constant full bars.However, The phone is working much better after the system update, the \"Radio interface resource shortage\" texting issue described above was definitely fixed, I haven't had to remove the battery since the update. My biggest complaints are still Sprint's terrible coverage, the 3G is slow, and the keyboard is awful (and I can't possibly stress how awful the keyboard is...)Final Update: 7-10-2013 -----------------------Switched to iPhone 4 from Virgin Mobile.Reasons:-The phone started to randomly restart/crash with more frequency (which caused me to miss an alarm in the morning).-The keyboard...It's literally the worst thing ever. The iPhone has a MUCH smaller screen, but its keyboard is sooooo much better.-Battery life. This was not a problem with the actual battery. The phone got to the point where I would charge it up at night (make sure very few apps were still running) and set an alarm, then the alarm wouldn't go off because the phone was completely dead in the morning 8-10 hours later of not being in use. According to the usage, most-all of the battery went to \"phone idle\" and \"cell standby.\" However, I could charge it that day to 100% then it would last another 15-20 hours before dying. In other words, the battery would sometimes drain really quickly, or sometimes it would last forever. Too finicky for my taste.-The bottom of the touchscreen got a bit strange after a while. Pulling the ring would sometimes not work and I'd have to do it several times before I could actually unlock the phone.In conclusion, it's a good phone (maybe not for the current price when compared to the iPhone 4 for $30 more) with a TON of features (far more than the iPhone 4), but the software just isn't as thought out as on the iPhone. I almost never used the 3D features of the phone. I'll probably keep the phone anyways to use as a backup if anything happens to my iPhone and possible to play Android only games; but overall, the iPhone is still better.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is the worst phone ever!!!

I've since installed an app called Speaker Boost from Google Play, and it seems to help, though it still isn't as loud as compared to the Optimus Elite.2.  Not a big fan of 3D, and when looking at the pics, it does make my eyes sore from staring at it too long.  So for the most part, I just stay with 2D images.  The pictures are nicer as compared to my Elite.  Sadly though, 3D pics or movies can't be sent via text, as the phone reverts the images into 2D mode for transmission purposes.All in all, the Evo V is a nice upgrade from the Elite.  I love the bigger screen, and yet, the phone is still manageable to be held with one hand while typing.  Another aspect that I love, is that when I receive a voicemail, I don't have to dial in to retrieve the messages, all I have to do is access the voicemail icon, and it plays back the missed messages.

But not the carrier.", "Author": "C. Chiu", "ReviewID": "RMF0YZK510NVQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone in hope to replaced my slow and outdated Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept. I also own an iPhone 4 from work, thus I will include the iPhone 4 into comparison also. I love the phone, and the reason it loses 2 stars is due to carrier. Since this phone is Virgin Mobile only, I believe this 2 stars deduction is justified. Data speed do not include wifi connection experience.Price: I purchased this phone when it's at $230 brand new, which is a VERY GOOD price for a phone with its spec. (Until $150 during Cyber Monday sales and the release of Nexus 4)Battery life: a full charge can last me through a whole day of use (12 hours). I don't make call or sms as much, however, I do use the phone constantly for facebook, google reader or research (gas prices, nearby food, shopping research etc.) Considering the screen is larger than my iPhone 4, the battery life is longer (my iPhone 4 battery drains to 10% in 8 hours with similar usage, Samsung Intercept dies around 4.5 hours).Camera: The camera is not sharp. The image is constantly either too dark or too bright in one area, you will have to adjust carefully yourself, thus not so much of a point-n-shoot camera. The low light performance is not great, and much easier to have shaken image than iPhone 4. The 3D camera is cool, but somewhat useless as you can't share the 3D photo to others. Overall, it's ok in area with abundant lights. The most annoying part - you cannot set the camera sound to silent unless you want to go through the trouble of setting the sound OGG file to silent manually in Android files.Screen: it's HUGE and bright! (Comparing to the general iPhone and regular smartphones) Screen is relatively sharp, it may not be retina display, but it is up there. Web browsing or Facebooking is quite comfortable on it. I have no issue using the phone under the sun or indoor (in contrary to Samsung Intercept).Performance: I can play most of the Android games smoothly (i.e. Angry Bird, Where's my water, etc.) I have yet to have a chance to try out 3D games. All the app runs quite smoothly, including web browsing, facebook, etc. The issue with phone crashes when making/ receiving calls in Intercept is a no issue here. I can listen to music or play Divx videos with no hiccup.4G: it might be a good thing for people in the WiMax coverage area. My area do not have this privilege so I can't test it. One thing I do know is that with 4G on, the battery drains REALLY fast (-25% in an hour) and the phone gets burning hot.Data Speed (*NOT THE PHONE ISSUE*): Since this phone has a medium-high hardware spec, I am more certain now that Virgin Mobile has obsolete data speed comparing to other no contract phones such as Straight Talk which offers true 3G. With SpeedTest App, I get 0.3 mbps or NO SPEED in sub urban area (Greensboro, NC), while my StraightTalk on iPhone 4 gets 3~5 mbps constantly. The slow speed definitely affect the experience when web browsing or facebooking.If you are an avid Virgin Mobile and Android user, I will definitely recommend this phone. If you only need a fast smartphone for texting or calling, then this is the phone for you. Otherwise, if data speed is a main concern, I would not recommend Virgin Mobile AT ALL. This is a GREAT smartphone for its price range, however, you can only use Virgin Mobile thus making this phone somewhat useless.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like this phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2ZWUT7MR7DT0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't understand all the negative reviews.

Burke \"CCrocker\"", "ReviewID": "R300QBL61IPDMI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone about a month and I haven't had any problems; however, some of the \"cons\" on this phone that have been listed by others, seem very understandable.  I am willing to say the phone is smarter than me, so may take me a while, if ever, to realize some of the lesser quality items mentioned.I did buy an extra battery but my phone has shown no signs of quitting on me before I can get back home to plug it in to charge.  I have ordered a few phone covers, make sure you get the right ones so the camera lenses match up.  Two different styles come up when you search for cases.The Amazon Appstore is fantastic for finding free apps.  Everything I want my phone to do, I search for an app if it didn't already have it, and I find one!  So I am very happy with the quality of helping me organize and multi-task all I have going on.  (Not that another phone wouldn't, but this is the one I have and I'm not one to ditch a phone and start over---too much work!)The phone isn't light, I bought my kids the HTC One which is a little smaller and is considerly lighter.  That seems like a good option and nice phone if someone is debating between the two, and I think it has had more positive reviews than this one.This screen is large and nice for viewing most anything.  All the buttons work and I'm figuring out what is most important to me.  I have had issues loading songs to the disk, it is not as straight forward as it is with an MP3 player.  That is one of the reasons I decided to switch phones and combine two things into one.  The disk that came with the phone said it had an error and you couldn't just put it into an adapter and use the card slot on your laptop...which is how I normally load music.  I have figured it out to some extent but seems like the same method doesn't work each time.Would I recommend it?  Yes if you have reasonable expectations.  Back to the are you smarter than the phone?  If so, then you may want to continue research and find a phone that IS smarter than you.  Reading the reviews is the best thing for figuring out if a phone is what you need.  I really appreciate people that review with pros and cons because you don't know some answers until you get one, maybe it will prevent you from making a mistake.

I was very excited to get this phone at first. I ordered online from best buy. My first HTC EVO V had a dead pixel so I had to return it, my second HTC EVO V had a dead pixel and the vibrate function did not work so I had to return that one!, the third phone had another dead pixel in the screen. I am now on my 4th HTC EVO V and I'm very disappointed!. I constantly get this notification titled \"Radio Interference\" it doesn't matter where I am or what time it is, this notification pops up randomly and when it pops up, I can't send or receive messages or even call. I've done research on this problem and it seems to be something that is wrong with this particular phone. It's a deal break for me, especially when I am waiting on calls from work and the \"Radio Interference\" notification is on my phone I can't receive any calls, then an hour later I have a voicemail that I had no idea even existed. Besides all that this phone has alot of pro's. The camera is pretty good and the 3D is fun to play around with. The Android 4.0 OS is very easy to use and highly customizable with apps!. The battery life is decent, it depends on what you do on your phone for that day. If you use it for only texting and have your screen at 50% it will last you a whole day. High end games from the app store seem to run pretty good. Overall I'd give this phone about 3 out of 5 stars. If it wasn't for all the problems I had when first purchasing the phone and the constant \"Radio Interference\" notifications this phone would be perfect. I wouldn't  recommend this phone, i'd save up for a better one because from my experience it's pretty much like rolling the dice, there is a 50-50 chance you will get a decent phone or a bad one with either dead pixel problems or the vibrate function not working or even the very frustrating \"Radio Interference problem\".", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seemed great at first, but maybe I got a dud", "Author": "DJ Apoc", "ReviewID": "RPBOX1JURYLX8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At first, this seemed like the best phone I could get from Virgin Mobile. I did not particularly care for HTC's Sense UI, but found it workable with some tweaks.Unlike the other, lower end Android offerings from Virgin, the PCD Venture, and the Chaser, this is a much better quality phone. The build quality is decent for the price, and it feels good in the hand. It has a tendency to get warm, but not uncomfortably so. It's reasonably fast, and the 3D display looks fantastic, although it strains the eyes.I loved it for a couple of days, when suddenly I began getting \"SMS errors\". The next day, the phone simply refused to make or receive any phone calls, even with full bars, despite several restarts, and restores. I was sad to have to let this one go, but maybe I got a dud.

This phone forced me to go with AT&T; because I didn't have a reliable phone - sure I'm paying more, but what's the point of a phone that only has service 20% of the time?  To add, the issue wasn't going to an area with no service...I could be standing in one place and have perfect service, then all of a sudden it dropped to nothing, then a few minutes later, I'd get full service again.

The phone itself is great and I have no complaints.  The problem is with the phone account.  I just opened the phone today, in brand new packaging.  For some reason, the serial number tied to this phone is already in use.  The serial number matches the sticker, phone software, and printed information behind the battery.  So I know it is the correct serial number.  They even verified the serial number matches my order.  But this serial number is already activated on another account.  Somebody fudged up somewhere.  When calling customer support, nobody seems to know what is going on, and so they keep transferring me to different departments and putting me on hold.  I was on hold for an hour and a half before finally hanging up.I cannot create an account without a valid phone, and therefore I can't sign into their website to contact customer support via an email and I can't leave feedback there about this phone.  They stated that they cannot do anything because I cannot verify I am the owner of the account and policy will not allow them to work on the phone with anyone but the original owner.Until further notice, I am stuck with a working out-of-area number tied to someone else's account.  I am unable to purchase minutes or activate the account under my own name.  The good news is that I do not have to pay for use of this phone as it is a working number.  The bad news is that the number is from the other side of the country and if it is shut off for any reason I am left with a brick.  Hopefully I can get this resolved, but I do not know who to talk to about it, as nobody knows what is going on.UPDATE: After finagling with customer service for a while I was able to get the six-digit password tied to that phone and was able to log in and change the account information, password, and phone number.  It wasn't originally my account but now I am able to log in and manage it.

Usually a power reset would fix the problem but during the initial phase i would pull the battery.  I assumed due to my massive amounts of app downloads this may have caused my phone to lose it mind but it appears to be a false assumption.  With all that being said i would give this phone three and 1/2 star if i could because of all the issues listed above.

It still performs very well, but I wish it took better pics.  To get the best picture quality, you have to filter it through an app like Snapseed.  Still, it's a great phone for $200 and I think it's comparable to the Iphone 4S and SG2. I'm just a low tech guy, so I hope you take that under consideration for my review.

Calling for support, I was told to remove the battery and that it would need repair. When I received the phone back in the mail, there were no details about the repair and no instructions. Now, the phone had to be reactivated, but that process failed even though I tried numerous times. Unbeknownst to me, the motherboard was replaced in the phone and the device now had a new MEID/serial number, which was not in the . Six months later, the company still has not gotten around to putting that new number in their network database so that I can activate it.I wasted $300 on HTC for a phone that has no possibility of ever working again because of a technicality in their limited warranty repair service. HTC handed off this disaster to me with the claim that they took care of their responsibility to the buyer under warranty -- though, obviously their policy of repair with new MEID is responsible.This is not a one-time thing or a rant from me, one unsatisfied customer. Numerous of their CSRs have told me this is a very common problem they get phone calls about every day. They refuse to send me a phone which can be activated right away.Thus, I will never, ever buy another HTC phone (for instance, I had to buy yet another phone to be able to have service again and though an HTC phone was at a lower sales price, I chose to get a Samsung instead of throwing my money away with HTC).

Better screen, bigger screen, faster processing and android 4.0 to do a lot more things than 2.2.The 3D doesn't mean anything to me but it seems to work well. Just a throw away feature to me. The videos captured in 2D are decent but the pictures are WAY better. LED flash means better night photos where the video at night or in a darker room just looks blah.4G isn't in my area so I can't comment on that, i got the phone because it was on sale and had a bigger screen and faster processor, not because of 4G or 3D, those are just gimmick features to me.One annoying thing is the position of the speaker on the back of the phone as well. So if you lay it down and want to listen to a song on it through speaker, it gets muffled a lot. Also the placement of the camera lenses makes me feel like I'm going to scratch them but the material in front seems pretty sold so far.Last comment is on battery. The big, bright screen and many news and weather apps seem to drain this phone faster than my last one but for my small use it hasn't been a problem. I can go a whole day without charging it and no problems unless I'm using maps or streaming a lot of music, which I don't do.

I have a 20 second delay for calling out and others have a 20 second delay calling me. Once the number is dialed, it takes 20 seconds before you hear a ringing and the call is in the process of being connected.On to the HTC Evo V 4G. What is the purpose of taking a photo in 3D? Is it just me or is this worthless? (Maybe it's just me.) What I didn't like is that there is a slide button on the right side to take either 2D or 3D. Why? Why couldn't this just be a setting in the photo app?One of the biggest dislikes is that the ringer volume and the notification volume are tied together. It's not an ICS thing, it's an HTC thing. I prefer to have the ringer volume turned up so I can hear it ringing in my purse or pocket, but I have the notification volume turned down, because that isn't as important to me. I had the HTC One V before the Reverb and that was my biggest gripe with that too.What I DID like is the FM receiver. To be honest, this is my reason for switching from the Samsung Reverb to this phone. (And the fact that it was only one hundred thirty nine dollars at the VM website.) The TVs at the gym all have radio stations to dial into in order to listen to them. While I mostly watch Netflix on the phone while doing cardio, I might want to watch a show on the TV. I figured the HTC Evo V 4G would do that plus watch Netflix, etc.  The FM receiver isn't advertised as included with the phone, but the app can be downloaded at the Android Forums via this post: [...] (You'll have to copy and paste the link.)You have read the bad reviews.

Hanford", "ReviewID": "R13XDAVBXBGNVS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update 05/18/2013: I finally decided to dump this phone.  It was at the point where I could not go anywhere without the cord.  The phone also could not be held when making calls because it would get so hot (and it was not from the battery but the antenna area).  Service reception continued to be poor even in urban areas and call quality was poor for people on the receiving end.  I left some voicemails that were apparently too distorted to even understand.  Calls were dropped and sometimes callers would get sent directly to a message that I was unavailable without the option of voicemail.  Camera quality continued to be sub-par even after cleaning the lens and case.  I disabled GPS during the last month to conserve power which added a couple hours each day.  I replaced the phone with the LG Optimus L9 P769, 4G (T-Mobile), which so far has clearer call quality, better speakerphone, improved on-screen keyboard with more space between keys, blazing fast 4G where I used to have 1X, and is about half as heavy.I got mine in November 2012, and it was ok at first. Then it stopped receiving 3G data, even when I was within areas where my previous VM LG phone did. It's nearly impossible to do anything data-related on the go (thankfully, so many places I go have WiFi now).  It also had the dreaded text message error until sometime in January when it got an OTA update. When I'm with my wife who has T-Mobile, I usually have to use her phone for practically everything other than calls if we're not on a WiFi network.  I've never really been exactly content with the service from either provider, but my older VM phone used to at least be on par with T-Mobile.The phone gets very hot when making calls, so much that I use Bluetooth or speaker whenever possible, and the battery has a knack for running down within 30 minutes of being unplugged if it feels like it.Camera quality is totally unacceptable with blurry, hazy shots in all but the brightest light, and even then the colors are washed out. 4G speeds are great, but half the time the phone struggles to get a signal even when in metro areas with excellent 4G coverage.The GPS antenna has to be some kind of joke.  It takes forever to pinpoint your location, and loses it as soon as you turn off the screen.  Really a problem when trying to use Navigation, or just plain find your location on Google Maps.  Practically useless.I did get a very nice OtterBox for it to keep it safe, which is probably the best thing about the phone that's not really even part of the phone.I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. There's a reason the price has decreased by more than 60% recently. Look elsewhere, and don't be fooled into thinking this thing is a \"good deal\" like I did.  I'd call Virgin Mobile's (overseas) customer service to try and get a replacement, but I'm not sure an hour of stress, torture, and repeating myself to three different operators is worth the $150 I paid.  I can at least make calls with it most of the time, so for now I'll continue to use it, but it's one sorry excuse for a smart phone.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "crazy", "Author": "cullyG", "ReviewID": "R167EPWFPBMPI9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "why would i pay 10 dollars more for this phone when its only 180$ on the virgin mobile website?!?!Come on people, just buy it from the actual website.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fraud.", "Author": "chidi", "ReviewID": "R3VDGC5ZIHGFGG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is in bad order.

Have only had it three days and two of the days I've had no 3G or even telephone service from Virgin Mobile.  Other than that the phone itself has great features and works flawlessly on wi-fi. With no phone service from Virgin Mobile (or very undependable at best) I'd need to have a backup phone if I were to keep this thing.  A couple years ago I also tried Virgin Mobile and it was horrible.  Thought I'd give them one more try - lured in by this nice android.  I'm surprised they are still in business - taking people's money and not providing the service.  There should be a class action lawsuit for sure.UPDATE:  After pursuing the issue further with Virgin Mobile, I now have phone and 3G service.  I didn't make any modifications to the phone on my end - it was something at their end.  So, I am changing my review to 3*, instead of 1*.  If Virgin Mobile continues to provide the service I pay for in the next few months, I will update the review again and add another star or two.10/10/12 - LAST UPDATE:  I'm returning this phone.  Still have no service at all - for days in a row.  Just took a trip and had no phone or internet the entire time (in Chicago area). I am a VERY light user - average 25 calls per month, 1 or 2 texts per month max, and internet usage is very low also because I mostly use wi-fi, yet Virgin Mobile can't even supply this minimal amount of service.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Possibly the worst phone I have ever owned", "Author": "Marc G.

Boy was I wrong. Virgin's coverage in Kentucky is horrible (compared to AT&T; which is the only other carrier I have used in 10 years).Batterly life poor: the battery will only hold up for about 2.5-3 hours (and that's stretching it). Not three hours of VIDEO, just three hours of intermittent phone usage, emailing, etc. So, if you don't plan on have a 120V outlet surgically implanted on your body, don't buy this phone.Application responsiveness: the overall application performance stinks. Apps are sluggish and it's really annoying.Touch keyboard: I never had a problem texting from my iPhone.... the stock android touch keyboard is poorly laid-out and extremely difficult to type with. You can get a psuedo-iphone keyboard app, but it's $4+. UghTo top it all off, my phone has gotten into the habit of not taking a charge after the battery has completely discharged.
