{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best phone I've ever had", "Author": "arlenok", "ReviewID": "R5OHDR2T8BZZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this after debating getting either the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One. First off, battery life is amazing with GPS off, which is to be expected with its humongous battery. The screen is gorgeous and represents colors better than the galaxy which tends to make colors overly bright. The remote feature is definitely cool especially since you can use it to power not only tv's (like with the S4 and htc one) but other appliances too such as fans, dvd players, cable boxes, etc... basically anything that uses a remote and if its not in the database, you just point your remote at the phone and it learns the functions. The camera is really great as it has hardware optical stabilization, unlike the others with just software stabilization. But the most important aspects are the performance specs, 2.26 Ghz quad core cpu with 2 GB of RAM - this thing is the Bugatti of the phone world.If I could name any problem it would be that the phone is extremely smooth (almost silky smooth) and while it does feel really good in the hand, it can be a little slippery at times; I got used to this though so it is no longer a problem. Speaking of how it feels in the hand, at first I was a little concerned about button placement but after a few days I realized that having the buttons where they are really does feel natural as your fingers naturally come in contact with that area as you hold the phone.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone with a few flaws", "Author": "DP21", "ReviewID": "R1597EIYIG6KC8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros-1. Excellent performance. Incredibly fluid and pleasant experience.2. Very long battery life.3. Nice big display. Excellent for watching videos on the go.4. Camera is excellent. Almost as good as a regular point and shoot.5. 32 GB of internal storage.6. The buttons on the back are great once you get used to them.Cons-1. Can be difficult to operate with one hand.2. Software bugs.3. No MicroSD card slot or removable battery.4. Quick Remote can be much better.5. LG launcher could be better.6. It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don\u2019t use a cover.Having used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.Pros (continuation)1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the \u201cnight\u201d mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don\u2019t think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.Cons (continuation)1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesn\u2019t have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesn\u2019t receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You can\u2019t take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.In conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don\u2019t think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isn\u2019t. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect", "Author": "ROBERTO J. MORENO \"Robfactory\"", "ReviewID": "R1W944I19UJ31G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG G2 has been called innovative.It has won design awards.However, it has failed to become a mainstream phone.I did a review 2 months ago comparing the HTC One and the LG G2. In this review I went over the basic differences between both phones. I didn't give a conclusion because I had the phone for two weeks and I had not customized it the way I wanted. This included rooting the phone and doing several tweaks.I will note the stock and tweaked versions of the review.Screen:Well, I'm two months in with the phone and this will be a full on review of the device. The first thing you'll notice about this phone is the 5.2 inch screen. It is a full HD 1080p IPS display with 423 ppi resolution. This is housed in a 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 frame. The G2 is one of the thinnest if not the thinnest bezel smartphone in the market. This makes the screen look rather large compared to same sized phones with larger bezels.The colors of the screen are overly saturated. This is something that has become common practice. It makes images pop and also makes images brighter and the cost of losing real life image quality. In no way is this phone supposed to replace a tablet or E-Reader, but as a commute reader, it will be more than adequate.The screen is also part of a new technology called Graphic RAM (GRAM), which caches an image when the screen is static. This means when the screen is not being refreshed on a new image, the CPU and GPU do not have to be used. This can enhance battery life, according to LG.Pros:1. Amazing screen to bezel dimensions.2. Good viewing angles.3. Good under sunlightCons:1. Over Saturated colorsBattery:The phone's non-removable Li-Po 3000 mAh battery is one of the main reasons I switched from the HTC One. I often go out of my provider's reach. This causes the phone to search for a signal and drain the battery rather fast. Not only that, but I also leave the GPS, data sync (GMail, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, tumblr, LinkedIn, Google Offers, TuneInRadio, DropBox, Box, Google+) on, while using the MP3 player.On a regular 6 hour outing with reception coming in and out, using the camera,editing photos, uploading stuff to social media and listening to music, I would drain the battery about 40%. So the phone still has 60% of battery life left.Battery Tweaked:After rooting the phone I used a couple of ROMs and MODs.Currently, I am using furnace-0.0.7 kernel. This kernel has different optimizations which include tweaks to the voltages, CPU overclocking, fast charge, and battery extender among the many.While using all of the software above, I have managed to drain the battery 30% in 13 hours. Leaving the phone with 70% battery life.Pros:1. 3,000 mAh2. Need I say more?Cons:1. Not removable. Then again, you won't need to.Camera:No camera is perfect. In fact, all cameras have a compromise. This is especially true when it comes to mobile phones.The bad:The OIS on the 13-megapixel camera is not this good. In fact, the camera has had several issues. First of, the camera depends too much on software stabilization and denoising, it then uses the two-axis optical image stabilization and multi-point auto-focus to help produce a stable picture.Here is where the problem lies. Rather than using the hardware stabilization more and then the software, the pictures at times come out as if they were painted. This is more evident in night time photos. The over processing and software stabilization makes the pictures come out oddly Van Gogh-esque, which is not a compliment.Modes:The phone's software is very much like Samsung's Galaxy line. Click on Mode and it will give you a graphic example of what it does and an accompanied text explaining it.The best mode for daylight photos is Intelligent Auto (IA). However, for some reason, LG made the software default to normal.Now my questions is, if you taut IA as being a great feature and the best of all the camera settings, why not make it the default mode?Another issue with the way the camera software is that it doesn't keep the previous mode selected.For example, I'm at a sporting event and choose the Sports camera mode. I take a shot and go back to my home screen. If I want to take another photo, I have to go to Mode again because it goes back to Normal as default mode.Night mode and image stabilization are a problem on this phone. As stated above, since the phone depends on denoising software and stabilization first, and then the physical OIS, it softens the photos to a degree where it looks drawn.Click on the photos below to enlarge.Focus: Not for the rapid photographerOne thing you'll notice is that the focus on this takes a while. If you try to hurry the shot you will get something like this.This is just unacceptable performance from a high end phone's camera.However, don't let this discourage you.The Good:The rear volume - acts as a camera activator when the phone is on standby, it also lets your capture a photo once the camera app is up and running. I found this useful for taking candid shots.Multi-point Auto-focusThis is something I wish more companies would use. By letting the camera have multi-focal points you get a cleaner picture. And yes, some companies have used the multi-face tracker, but not on random objects.DaylightWhen there is a good amount of daylight, this camera is amazing. The shots are clean and clear. The colors are very accurate. It doesn't help that the screen also accents those opaque colors at times. Depending on the scenery, I usually pick between Dynamic Tone Range (HDR) or IA. The only time I pick Normal is when I don't have time for the menu.Either way, here are some shots: I use the Wide Angle setting which is 10 mega-pixels.Since you get 13 mega-pixels (10 for Wide Angle) you get a lot of details per shot. This enables you to crop and edit a photo without much loss of definition. It also allows details in depth.Camera Pros:1. 13 mega-pixels2. Quality under good lighting3. Intelligent Auto setting4. Volume (-) camera launcher and shutter.Camera Negative:1. Low light capture quality2. Focus set time3. Camera UI's lack of keeping the last Mode setting.Tweaked Camera:I've been using Xdabbeb's Camera Mod. This mod enhances focus times, night time shooting quality, overall image quality, it adds 1600 ISO and it lets hardware stabilization become eminent in the process. For information click on the link.Video:The version of the phone I have only has two noise cancelling microphones, which is ok, but could be better with three. Since the third microphone would have been in the back of the phone and capturing the audio from the front.The video above will go over the different video features.It's pretty neat that the camera is able to support 60 frames per second in daylight and well lit areas. This gives the recording a more realistic view and flow.This setting will only be available on 1080p.I wish they would have set it for 720p and lesser quality videos.By recording in 1080p 60 fps you will soon realize that the files are rather large. So be careful when filming videos that you do not fill the phone's drive.Asides from that, I noticed the video quality to be quite good. You get Normal, HDR Recording, Live Effect (which makes you have funny faces), Dual Recording (use both front and rear cameras in one shot) and Tracking Zoom, which is explained in the video.The Negative:The video camera lacks a clear focus. In some phones you are able to click on the screen and get a visual mark of where the video is trying to focus. Sadly, this phone doesn't have that. I've noticed that when I zoom in to an object at a distance, the video will quickly lose focus and become useless. This is something I wish they would fix.There's no slow motion.Tweaked:By using the same Xdabbeb's mod, we get more options in the settings menu. We are able to use 60fps in 720p videos. We also get better focus times and anti-shaking. This is on top of the OIS.Pros:1. Good Quality Video2. 1080p 60fpsCons:1. Lack of focus notification2. Digital Zoom and the lack of focus speed.Camera Overview:The camera's quality and details are great. It's a really good 13 mega-pixel camera if you are going to shoot landscapes, have the camera conveniently set up to take a shot, or are taking regular pics.The major problem I have with this camera are the focus times. They are horrible. That, and the optimized image stabilization algorithm. I mean seriously... if you have the hardware, depend on that rather than the software which is making most low-light photos come out as if they were oil painting.Audio:Phone now days have become more than just phones. They have become point-and-shoot cameras and mp3 players. This phone is able to playback MP3/WAV/FLAC/eAAC+/AC3/WMA files. They make a point in their presentation to mention this is the first smartphone on the market to feature 24-bit/192kHz hi-res audio playback.At that definition the sound is quite good. Especially if you have a good pair of headphones /earphones.The only drawback to this is that a regular track can be more than 100mb. The average person has about 3 hours worth of music on their phone. That would be a total of about 8GB-10GB.Calculations based on this scale.Storage:This is a perfect entry into storage. The US version of the G2 has a fixed 32GB hard drive. The drive on this phone is actually quite fast and sufficient for most.However, there is no expandable slot. This leads to the issue of why are you going to have a hi-res player when the hard drive space is limited? After all is said and done you get about 24GB of HD space. You add apps and cache storage and that's about 22-20GB left.CPU and RAM:The phone has a 2.26 GHz Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon\u2122 800 Quad-Core Processor, which is the latest on the market. It also has 2GB of RAM. This is enough to power any top of the line phone and tablet.Buttons:Having the Volume +, Power On/Off , Volume - on the back of the phone has yet to be a negative. When I use my mobile phone, I usually have my index finger next to the camera lens. I realize it has taken some getting used to, but I like it.Features:KnockOn:The major software feature this phone has is the KnockOn feature. Tap the screen twice with your finger and it wakes up the phone from standby. It's a feature I use quite frequently when I have the phone on my car dock or bike dock.QSlide:This feature lets you use defined apps on top of your current screen. It's a feature I really have not used.QuickRemote:I found LG\u2019s Quick Remote software to quite complete and easy to navigate. However, the IR Blaster is quite small and you have to point the phone directly into the TV.Final Impressions:The phone feels the same as a Samsung Galaxy S3/S4. It is made out of plastic and nothing on the phone is removable. Since the phone is mostly screen, I would recommend getting a case for it. If it falls chances are the screen will shatter. The G2 I possess has a silicon case that adds a bit of heft to it. This makes the phone feel sturdy on my hands. Also, choose the white version. The black version of this phone is a fingerprint magnet. Plus, the white phone looks nicer in my opinion.Do I like the phone?Yes, I do. The phone has many advantages: battery, screen, audio, and image quality.The two main negatives are the lack of expanding storage and the camera quirks.If you set your phone to create and use high quality media, you have to allow the capacity for it. It would have been easy to allow for a microSD slot like in the Asian markets.The camera suite leaves a bit to be deserved. In my opinion the HTC One has the best camera suite. The Zoe feature is amazing and something Android mobile manufacturers should imitate. Having said that, the image quality on this phone is amazing. I actually could go out and say it is in the top two in most Android categories.Overall, I would recommend this phone and give it an 8.5 out of 10.Pictures taken with the phone and edited with VSCO CAM or SnapSeed, Or PicSay Pro, or Pixrl-o-MaticFor photo samples go to my site robfactory . come", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG G2", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "R175KX9FZIX0Y6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Display 9.8/10Simply gorgeous. 2nd only to the HTC One. It's a 1080p, 5.2\" IPS, very thin bezel panel. It IS the largest panel in the smallest body at this time possible. It certainly doesn't feel like a borderline Phablet. While it has impressive specs, the proof is just looking at the colors. Not too saturated, but a high enough contrast that its images leap off the screen. My only caveat is that I'm not a huge fan of on-screen buttons.Design/Build Quality 9/10It's a plastic body. While it's not the HTC One, it's a notch up from the Galaxy S4. I say this because its a sealed body. You don't have the removable back cover for access to the battery, SIM, or SD card access. While these may be cons as well, this has improved the structural integrity of the phone. The design of the rear volume, and power button is an ambitious change. It's like trying to write with your other hand, well not that awkward, but still moderately uncomfortable.The feeling in the hand is excellent, again hard to believe a 5.2\" display is in this body.Performance. 10/10The latest chipset (Snapdragon 800) on the market is loaded in this with 2GB of RAM. I won't bore anybody with synthetic benchmarks. It just a beast. NOTHING has slowed this down, not even LG's own user interface, more about that next.Software. 8/10First I'm not saying it's bad! LG has taken the same road as Samsung and has LOADED the software with every little thing they could. Some are gimmicky, some useful. While you can disable most of these in settings, what you cannot do is uninstall them. The knock on feature to wake your device up, is probably about 80% accurate on the first try. It's a very innovative method of turning the device on and off, it just doesn't always respond. Side note regarding LG's software future updates: they are sparse, and borderline nonexistent. Don't bet the jackpot on getting KitKatBattery life. 10/10The battery is the best thing about this device (with the display being a close second). I have had so many different phones and battery life has always been a issue. Not anymore. I have an Exchange account, Gmail, over 100 texts a day, 20-40 emails, web browsing, 4000 min a month, 5GB of data...I am a power user. The 3000mah battery cannot be killed.  It's even more impressive it's running the most powerful processor in any Android phone. That's like a Corvette getting the fuel mileage of a hybrid!Camera/Video 9/10The optical image stabilization helps my shaky hands out, while the 13mp eye captures great detail. No complaints with the limited pictures I've taken.The video capture is what is stunning. The OIS combined with the 60 frames per second produces home videos that rival most home camcorders. Well I haven't seen a camcorder in a long time, but you get what I'm saying.Call quality/signal/data 9.5Earpiece is excellent. Loud and clear. Not hollow sounding either.Signal on AT&T; and StraightTalk has been excellent. Download speeds up to 30mbps, upload 15mbps LTE in Cleveland Ohio.WIFI range is excellent.Speaker phone is average. I wish the other speaker grill at the bottom was another speaker! It's the main microphone though. The speaker is not the worst out there, but could of been better with the iPhone style speaker setup.This phone is awesome.

So for the price it was great, especially since Amazon does not charge you tax on the full retail price of the phone like most places do.The GOOD:-Big, bright, clear screen.- Ability to add apps and different screens on the lock screen without having to unlock the device.-4G is really fast, I actually went over my limit when I stepped outside of wifi and the 4g took over and downloaded all the stuff I was trying to do with wifi. This was before I figured out that you CAN limit the amount of data your phone will use. Make sure to set it to a least 20MB before your actual limit that AT&T; gives you.. (i.e. 2gb limit with AT&T; means you should set it to 1.8gb limit on the phone to be safe)-Great camera with stabilizer.  Apparently this is why most of my pictures turn out VERY clear even if you're moving.  I'm not the selfie taking type so I'm not too familiar with the clarity of the front facing camera but it's still high end quality according to the specs.-Lots of great specs including the 32gb built in memory--Roughly 25 after android operating system is installed so they don't tell you that beforehand-IR Blaster--Love this feature. If you lose a remote, want a universal remote for all your household entertainment, wants to change the channel at a sports bar or just want to impress your friends... This is the thing to do it.  You can customize it by rooms too. So you can program every tv in your house and tell it in which room it's in. No need to insert 3 digit codes, the phone does all the work.-Built-in flashlight feature with a really bright light compared to other devices..--Will be easier with a shortcut added to your home screen and lock screen.-Makes every iphone, including the newest 5s look like a baby.The BAD:-Not a big deal but the box it comes in is ugly. LG did not do much to make the phone more appealing like Samsung and Apple do.  I suppose this may have helped with costs.-The design of the back buttons vs having them on the sides is difficult to get used to.. In fact it doesnt feel right even after having the phone for several months.  This may be a deal breaker for some.  It's even more awkward trying to take a screen capture (Center button and bottom button at the same time)-The battery specs are probably without any apps installed. Once you have apps installed and running you will see your battery life DRAIN.  So depending how many apps you have installed,  you may not be able to use this phone very long. Keeping it dim helps preserve battery though, but it makes it hard to see in bright light.  I managed to recently upgrade the software and I think it's 4.2.2 now and it has helped the battery.  I've only had it a day but it's significantly better results.--It's good to have a battery saving app (additional to the Battery Saver option that's already included) and to have your task manager shortcut to open up the ram and then close out any open apps periodically.  I also have the battery saver option on all the time and have adjusted my settings so that it kicks in automatically no matter what the battery level.- The phone heats up SO MUCH when you're playing any kind of game... even the small, light games.  I have a nice thick case so I don't feel the heat unless I touch the back of the phone where the buttons and camera are, so I can only imagine how difficult it would be to hold the phone for a long period of time when playing a game.- It's not as popular as the Samsung devices so accessories are limited, especially at low prices online, so you'll pay a few bucks more for a case.  In store you'll probably pay the same retail price but only bad/dumb shoppers pay full retail.- Not that great of reception, I'm assuming its because 4G is always activated.. So it's also a bad thing that you can't disable 4g and use 3g or even 2g (EDGE) for your phone calls.-The back case is NOT removeable.. at least not while maintaining your warranty.  This is a big negative because if you want to replace your own battery later on you may break the cover.-The memory is not expandable.  That's right you cannot add in more external memory with a microSD. I did not find this out until after I had bought the memory. I suppose with the 25gb of useable space it comes with you may do fine,but I like to have no boundaries to my memory.-----If you want to keep LG and don't mind a bigger phone, you can get the Optimus G Pro, this one does have expandable memory and I believe the back cover does come off", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever bought", "Author": "Collin S.", "ReviewID": "R1UCJUY3OL2EBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is fantastic.

IMO this phone rips apart the S4 and any other phone on the market except the Galaxy Note 3 which benchmarks a little higher most likely from cheating software manufacturers rig the phone with now that will overclock if a benchmark is being run or it could be from having an extra GB of DDR3. The battery life is incredible by default and turning off location services and making sure google now is closed in the background makes any current gen android phone impressively power efficient, let alone this beast. Camera is awesome especially in low light compared to Samsungs cameras. The 800 series snapdragon absolutely destroys processes and is completely unnecessary but wonderful. The UI appears to be somewhat bloaty with the phone having about half it's ram being used at any given moment but this allows for a truly smooth and fluid interface. This is the first android phone i've ever owned that doesn't have the usual little software quarks. Every now and then i get an app(usually 3rd party) force close but to the date i haven't experienced a failure restart or any crippling error. My favorite feature is the knock on unlock. tapping three times lightly about an inch above the LG logo on the front is a fool proof way of having it work 95% of the time.Cons: There isnt a whole lot i can say here as i really love this phone. The touchscreen is a bit overkill sensitive but i can forestall that and say that it works with gloves. The speakers are insanely sensitive and can create an echo on calls if you don't turn down your ear piece from max volume. There is one glitch that may have been patched at this point but sometimes the keyboard goes haywire and you need a restart. Ive had the phone a month and its only happened twice but not recently and there was just an update that rolled out December 2nd i believe. DONT DROP WHILE CHARGING. Im an idiot and detached the micro usb port from the casing from a drop so now it has a lot of play in it but it is still attached to the circuit so it charges for now.Best Accessories: IMO the best looking case is the Spigen Slim Armor but it is terribly slippery and uncomfortable to hold. I got an Otter Box commuter case for free and it is very ergonomic and protective but i'm not a fan of the look so much.Overall buy this phone if you're considering getting a current gen android you won't be disappointed. Im going to exclude the the Note 3 on the grounds that it is a specialized device that is for a particular customer.
