{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This phone has some great features", "Author": "tech*geek", "ReviewID": "R1VLK5KIZ3T4LF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A lot of the reviews here criticize everything about the phone, some of these things i cannot deny, such as the pocket dialing, random screen freezes and shutdowns, and a primitive touch screen.  BUT, i have owned this phone for 4 years now, and after watching phones evolve over time there are a few things that I absolutely love about the phone.- One of the beast Non smart phones I can find (I don't pay any data fees, but I know peoples plans vary)- The camera takes great photos and videos- The BEST *physical* keyboard I have used on a phone- Micro SD HC storage (I am using an 8 gb card)- Touch screen is very convenient- Apps that you will Actually use (calender, notepad, calculator, alarm clock, bluetooth)- Physically durable to scratches and dentsAs I said, I don't pay for data, and when looking for phones wanted one that had a decent camera, sd storage, and a qwerty keyboard, and an easy to use app system.The Camera is a Schneider Lens with a 3.2 MP auto focus lens that takes 2048 X 1536 resolution still images and 640 X 480 video.  For a non smart phone, the only camera I have seen better is that on the Sharp Kin 2.  There are some fun settings to use for the camera but what i find most important is that you can record as long as you want with a micro sd card.The keyboard was the selling point for me on this phone.  I wanted a physical keyboard, and today's smartphones don't offer ones this size (the next closest is that of the motorola droid 3.  The keys are raised, there is space in between every key, and you can feel as well as hear a physical click when you press the key.  It is a 4 row keyboard including numbers, and as I said, this is the best keyboard i have found on a phone, I text blindly in class all the time without having to look at the keyboard.The micro sd card slot is easy to access and and with storage the size of your sd card you can store music, movies, pictures and videos and easily transfer then to your computer.Now personally, I use the touchscreen to access the apps I use (calender, alarm clock, a fantastic note pad, calculator, and music).  It allows for an easy access to these functions, and i also use the screen to dial numbers and do basic functions if i can only use one hand.  I use the front touchscreen to read texts, then open the phone, and a reply box automatically opens so I can easily respond with the full keyboard.I typically open the phone up if i want to text someone, and all you have to do is start typing their name, your contact book goes to them, and you press a dedicated text button and get going easily!!!I love the phone, its 2011 and I plan on buying another one because I dont need to spend money on the distractions that data plans have to offer for 30 dollars a month.Hopefully you can see past the minor technical issues and unresponsive touchscreen and see the positives for the phone", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "I personally loved it", "Author": "Honesty", "ReviewID": "R2SKHW81SSECZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for 2 years, but switched to a stupid samsung intensity 2 over the summer because it was time for an update. I didn't want to waste the money for the data fee on a smart phone.My new phone has been a piece of garbage since the day I got it. I was so close to tears when I walked into verizon and they said they stopped making the EnVtouch. I loved it so much that I wanted another one. I never had problems with the touch screen, I actually liked the sensitivity of it because I have long nails, so it was so perfect for me! It didn't fit into my skinny jeans very well, but the full flip up keyboard with the internal screen was awesome. The battery did start to die off quickly within about a year and a half... but it only costs $3 for a new one here on amazon. I am going to buy a new one and switch back as soon as possible!One thing that I suggest to people who are having problems with this phone is that you should go into verizon every few months to get your phone updated. I only did this once through the time I had this phone, but once you get the \"update\" it starts to run like new again. If callibration is off on the touchscreen they can fix it at the store, or you could go into the settings menu and fix it yourself.

You could tell the wall charger was extremely used and subsequently, didn't work.  Immediate RED flag.  Called Verizon, gave them the MEID# that is located inside the battery compartment.

He posted it under my bad review on their site.  So, he is calling me and Verizon liars.  In hindsight, I noticed that every bad review that was posted for Cellphones-4u, he had a reply that they were in essence, thieves or liars.  Do your homework.

I'm not sure why all the people who gave this phone a bad review got bad phones, but I never had any problems with mine whatsoever.  No pocket/purse dials, the touch screen works like a dream, battery life...fine.  I don't normally review things and a lot of people don't if they are happy with what they get, so maybe that's why there are more negative reviews than positive.  I just felt the need to get another positive review on here.It is a great phone for those who want to get that smartphone feel without the price.

Did you purchase them from Verizon or on Amazon from a third party retailer?  My wife and daughter both hade one and they worked very well for 3 years.  That is why I decided to purchase one for my granddaughter.  One of Amazons retailers called Cellphones4-u was advertising BRAND NEW!!!!  phones.  I called the contact phone number to varify that they were BRAND NEW.  The person I talked to assured me that they were.  As I said before, my wife and daughter had these phones before.  Their phones came in original LG packaging.  Upon receiving the phone from Cellphones4-u, I opened the package to find that the phone was in a Verizon box, unsealed, loose in a plastic tray.  Didn't put 2 and 2 together right away.  Plugged the phone in with the wall charger and found that it wouldn't charge.  There was enough of a charge on it that I could turn it on.  Found that the touch screen was almost non-responsive.  That's when the light bulb came on.  I called Verizon and asked if they could tell me if this was indeed a new phone.  The lady asked for the MEID# inside the battery compartment.  I gave it to her and she proceeded to tell me that the phone had been on 3 separate accounts, starting in Feb. of 2010. I contacted Cellphones4-u and he insisted that it was new, even after I told him what I had found out.  He had another sent to me via another retailer Mobile Hotshots, and it was the same thing.  A used phone.  I posted a negative review on his page and he is still insisting that the phones are new, in a rebuttal to my posting.  The question still remains.  Why would Verizon take the phones out of the LG packaging and put them in one of their own boxes?  My point.  If it wasn't in the original packaging maybe you didn't get a new phone.

I just purchased my second phone today because out of my negligence, I broke the first one.  The picture quality is great, it's light weight, simple and not too confusing. It could be a lil louder but who needs the whole world to know u got a text or call?

I still have it today but only because I'm under contract with Verizon. The first few months I had it it worked great except for a few minor things like the screen cutting off. Then it got worse. My battery couldn't hold a charge within 4 months of the purchase. I literally was having to plug the phone in every 5 minutes. It was extremely annoying so I took it back to Verizon demanding an explanation. Which didn't help at all - their employees don't know the first thing about this phone! I ended up going back twice after the initial visit and eventually had the entire phone replaced. I'm 4 months away from an upgrade and let me just say that I cannot wait.

It's not required anymore, so all you have to do is call and they will cancel it.

Not because I want the next big thing, but because this phone is the biggest pain in the tuckus I've ever had to deal with.What should I mention first. Should I mention that this phone has the worst \"locking\" mechanism ever? On more than one occasion I've pulled my phone out of my purse to discover that the phone's sliding touch screen has responded to something in my purse, slid up, & either made a phone call or gone into one of the phone's programs. One night it decided to call my landlord at midnight. Another time I pulled it out of my purse to discover that it'd managed to purchase a ringtone at random. (The ringtone was \"Born in the Hood\", if you're curious. A good song but not one that really suits me as a ringtone.) Then there's the fact that it loves to drop calls. It doesn't get the greatest reception.Now I've had the \"pleasure\" of owning a Razr, which was eventful in & of itself. I can safely say that I'd rather take my fragile Razr than this piece of garbage. It's pretty looking & the touch screen stuff is nice at first, but it's a huge PITA.Save your money & go after something that isn't this phone.

I was not upset when i wrote the review or anything, just said that there was no Manuel in the box....Perhaps in the future, before making inappropriate and unnecessary comments in a public forum, you will take the time to ask a simple question, if you are not sure about something.  While the item is NEW and EXACTLY as we described it in the listing, you will note that we specifically did not say a manual was included.  We listed exactly what you would expect to receive in this package when you purchased it and the manual was not listed.  This is because manuals add unnecessarily to shipping weight and 95% of people do not reference them.  The manual is also available for FREE download online in PDF form.So, the lack of simple communication on your part had the cause of downgrading our performance rating when you based your entire review on a part of the purchase which was not listed as being included in the first place and that is available to you free of charge, if you want it.  This is completely unfair to sellers.  Your feedback comments had nothing to do with the transaction, the speed of delivery, the condition or completeness of the item, or the fact that you got an exceptional deal on a new item that is otherwise no longer available because it has been discontinued by the manufacture.

The touch screen was one of my favorite parts about it, if you're a girl, and you get your nails done, you understand. This touch screen, all you have to do is slide the corner of your nail over the screen and it responds. Normal heat activated touch screens are a pain in the buttocks for people with long nails. The touch screen has some problems though, since it responds to pressure instead of heat, it will unlock itself in pockets, purses, bags and otherwise and call/text random people.The fact that I had this phone without a contract means that I got it specifically for texting, and I only had to pay a fraction of the contract price, but prepaid, this phone has some data charges I wasn't expecting. Apparently because the phone has a touch screen, Verizon decided to lable it as a smartphone (which it most certainly is not) and put a minimun data charge onto your bill every month. So instead of paying for the unlimited texting and the calling, which would have only been 50 dollars, I had to add on a data plan, and my bill ended up going up to 75. Now that may not seem like much, but I'm a waitress at a pizzaria, I don't have that much money. Actually, it was that price that made me give up the phone all together and go with another service provider.This phone doesn't have very bad battery problems, as people have been saying. It only does if you leave it on camera in your pocket, or go online a lot (which is a pain in the butt on this phone.) When I had it, I could listen to music all day, and by the end of the day, I would still have a bar of battery left. If you leave this phone sitting, it can stay powered on for up to four or five days. The only battery trouble I had, was these batteries wear out quickly, the battery deos not have a separate backplate, the battery IS the backplate, so if the phone gets dropped, or if it is loose in a bag for long periods of time, it will become loose, and randomly shut itself off. The best fix for that... buy a new battery. they're only about $2 on amazon, and they will fix your problem for a little while.The aqccesories that you can get for this phone aren't great, the cases are cheap and break if the phone is dropped, and because of the design of the phone, they snap off and don't do their job very well. what I found works well are the gel cases, they hug the phone and protect it the way they're supposed to, the only problem is, sometimes the keys don't match up on the keyboard. What I did was, I got a clear case, It makes it easier to see through to where the keys actually are.The keyboard is amazing, its easy to type on, easy to understand, and it was the entire reason I got the phone. When I first decided to get this phone, I was switching from my EnV3, which had software problems and just shut off and never turned back on... I realized that the thing I was going to miss most was the keyboard. The keys are big enough that they are easy to press, and they respond nicely so you don't have to push super hard to get them to work. When the phone is new, sometimes they're stiff, but that's normal and fixes itself with use.All in all, if I wasn't leaning towards a smartphone, I would definately buy this phone again.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy!!", "Author": "Marchita", "ReviewID": "R144T7SKIEZSAO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is a bit heavy and if you are a smartphone user it will feel clunky and slow.

While it's not the absolute worst phone I've used, I will be VERY happy when I get a different one. I know at least five other people with this phone who feel the same way.Here are the big issues my friends and I have encountered with the enV Touch:- Mediocre call quality- Huge, poorly-located power button makes it easy to push accidentally when the phone is in your pocket or purse- The phone itself is bulky and doesn't fit in most standard backpack or purse cell phone pockets. When I try to put it in my jeans it looks downright ridiculous- About a bazillion electronic problems. In addition to randomly turning itself off, both of the phone's screens regularly freeze or just go blank- Crappy, unresponsive touch screen (you can adjust the sensitivity but it doesn't really help)- Sloooooooow. 'Nuff said- Terrible, clunky web browser with totally unintuitive controls- Autofocus on the camera is a joke, and even with great lighting the pics are inevitably blurryOn the plus side, I do like the QWERTY keyboard and I've found the battery life to be very decent.

I'm on my second one (dropped the first one too many times after 2 years) and I've loved it. I currently have one in my basement as a backup in case the first ever dies. I did have a problem with pocket dialing before I got a Body Glove case.  After that it's been nothing but great.  I keep my phone running for 4+ weeks at a time but, just like a computer, these phones need to be restarted every once in a while.  I'm not going to lie and say that my phone hasn't glitched and needed to be either or shut and reopened or turned off and back on, but seriously, what 3G internet capable phone has EVER been completely glitch free for everyone?  And the reviews for the touch screen have killed me.  Mine has been fantastic for both phones, but then I did take the minute to actually calibrate it to make sure it works correctly with my touch. Fresh out of the box, or when calibrated to someone else's touch, yes the screen is probably going to seem awful, hence the need to calibrate it to your touch.  You also can't effectively use a flat finger gorilla touch, finger tips are needed.  And I will agree that trying to text with the touch screen can sometimes be challenging since it's small as compared to an iPhone, but why would you use the touch screen when you have the fantastic QWERTY keyboard on the inside?!?The bluetooth, camera, and MP3 player have worked great for me and 16GB of removable SD card storage space is also nice.The only truly negative thing with this phone is the side lock button.

The best part about this phone is it has 2 screen! A touch screen on the outside and a non-touch screen LCD inside when you open it along with a keyboard inside! Huge perk for texters or if you don't want to use the touch screen. It has a 3.2 megapixel camera (only downer is it can't zoom..). The sound is crisp and clear, has the basic tools (calculator, tip calculator, calendar, alarm clock etc), and my battery has lasted this whole time and is still going strong! It hardly ever has to be charged! Now here are the reasons I only gave this phone 3 stars...like others have said, its locking option on the side of the phone will get pushed in my purse a lot by anything so its made quite a few of its own phone calls to people on my contact list...this is eliminated if you have a case or holster but its been pretty annoying. And the other issue that I know other women have had too with it (not men though) is that the touch screen gets moisture in it (unfortunately from  makeup on our face and maybe we use our phones more than guys?) and it stops working. The inside LCD will still work and so will the phone, but the outside screen won't.

The old (non-touch) env was great - don't know what happened! If it is in my pocket and I bend over, it turns itself off. If I get a multimedia message and (gasp!) want to look at it, it turns itself off and back on. If I look at a simple text message and set it down, it turns itself off (and I don't slam it down, either!).Sometimes when I get a text, there is nothing but a white or black screen  - and I have to take the battery out and put it back in because the keys are nonresponsive at that time. The speakers inside the phone are great, but most ringtones are not nearly loud enough because I don't keep my phone open all the time (does anybody?). Picture messages are slow sending. There are not many apps that are worth getting for this phone. Battery life could be much better. Also, it is hard to hear people sometimes - the actual earpiece where sound comes out is not the entire part where it is cut out at the top - it is actually a third of that.The two things I love about the phone: Pictures are awesome. Love the keyboard. But, I could get those two things in any other phone. I am SO ready for an upgrade to a non-stinky phone in November!In short, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!

I just thought that it would be a good phone to use as a spare, and so I tried it out for some time. I was expecting this touch phone that would have really bad battery life and a horrifyingly bad touch screen, and I was partly right. the battery easily dies and doesn't last for more than 2 hours during continuous use, but I got a lot more than what I thought I would get. I thought the phone would come preinstalled with verizon's vCast that they use on all of their cheap flip phones and simple candy bar phones, but this was like a spiced up version of that. sure it had vCast, but it also had an all format compatible mp3 player anda web browser and everything else. It also had dual screens, and the inside keyboard is just a joy to work with. Its keyboard is like a precursor to the verizon motorola droid a855. a spaced out keyboard with large easy to use navigation buttons on the right side. I did notice that the inside screen is more vibrant and sharp than the outside touch screen. yes, I know that this isn't a high end phone, but its actually better than it looks. on sleep with use here and there, I got the phone to last 36 hours on a charge. charged it one night, and then used for maybe 10 calls a day, each 1 minute long for three days until it finally said \"battery critical\". It has a 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera sensor and its not the best your looking for, but its good enough to remember memories. Since this phone was created to rival the first iPhone, many of its features try to outdo the iPhone. It has a panorama sensor. It has Video recording for up to 20 minutes with built in storage at VGA quality resolution. It can take up to 100 photos with built in color effects for both video and photo such as sepia, tint, b&w;, and negative. It has 3G data connectivity, and a camera button on the side for convinient photo taking. and it has a business card reader built into the camera. take a picture of a business card, and it'll scan the picture, and convert it into a contact. Quite useful if you ask me. OH, and it has a micro SD slot expandable up to 32 GB. (SDHC). and Dolby Digital mobile stereo speakers and equalizers built in for the 3.5 mm smartjack (supports mic built into headset). It has a tip calculator, calculator, alarm, world clock, voice commands, document viewer (.doc, .docx), stopwatch, notepad, drawing pad, and mass storage reader.

After contact with the vendor, they did agree to send a new battery.The normal way for me to carry my phone is in my front pocket and I noticed that when I would take it out to check for a missed call or text, it would be off, even though I locked the keys before putting it in my pocket. This happens regularly and is quite annoying because once I turn it back on I have missed a call or text.Through all of this I have continued using the phone as I cannot afford to buy a new one. The final straw that convinced me to write this article is the inside screen no longer works. This weekend the inside screen has turned dark except for some random stripes across it.

I've since had it for about seven months.  This phone has had its fair number of hours.  The original owner used the 3G capabilities of the phone to such an extent that she moved on to a Droid.  I, on the other hand, came to the phone from a flip-phone with a broken screen.  I didn't even have texting at the time, so I wasn't too concerned about the features of the phone, so long as it could show me who on earth was calling and who I was dialing out to.  I found a lot of the same problems everyone else complained about: the battery wriggles in the case, causing the phone to turn off and on.  When I tried using it as an MP3 player, it froze all the time (the previous owner reported no such issues, when asked0.  I pocket-dialed people while at work (and I go in to work at six A.M. sometimes).  It came with a couple of game demos, but the games were hard to play.

We soon were comparing phones, one LG flip-phone, two Cosmo IIs, and my Env3.  The clamshell flip-phone, was, well, a basic phone.  Not much comparison there.  But the Cosmo II is a slider.  My screen was significantly larger, the keyboard bigger and easier to use, the camera much higher resolution, and the tools better laid-out.Now, I'm up for a phone upgrade, and I don't want it.

No buttons were touched..sounds unbelievable, I know.The phone lock feature is horrible. When you go into the menus to officially lock the phone with a security code, most of the time it will not let me lock my phone. It gives some stupid error \"data call dormant, end call to lock the phone\". I have to power down the phone and power on to get the lock feature to work.When I plug the phone into charge, 90% of the time I get an error message saying \"this cord is not recommended for use with this phone\", even though I am using the cord and outlet adapter that it came with!\" Also, I can never get a full charge on this phone.

I haven't worried this much about what's going on in my pants since I was 13! Takes terrible picture, horrible video, and the touch screen has the sensitivity of Simon Cowell. Nothing about this phone is good. Seriously. No dialing with speaker phone. The email program frequently doesn't work and is a pain in the ass to use anyway. Just about anything non-feather based causes the screen to scratch. It doesn't cable synch with macs! These are only the major flaws, I could go on but it seems petty.

Horrible camera, bad customer service...", "Author": "Mali", "ReviewID": "R2KNRQJ4YCS58F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had TWO of these die. Also, LG has horrible customer service.The first one I had didn't even last a year. After a few months, it started freezing, randomly shutting off, the screen would get stuck on rainbow-colored static...Then it got worse and just shut down. I took it to a local Verizon where they told me it was over-loaded and dying, and talked to me like I was a very slow child. They said there was nothing they could do and they couldn't get my information off. They told me to take it home and transfer all my info to the card. On the way home it died. I called the LG rep and he told me they had no idea what they were talking about and that what they said was not possible. I went to a different Verizon and they said that they COULD have gotten my information out (which i knew), but it was too late now. I was still under warranty, so they ordered me a refurbished phone- they said I could NOT get a different kind of phone, just the exact same one. Unless I wanted to pay full price, of course. I contacted LG, and they said that while they COULD fix it and get all of my information out of the phone after they fixed it, they wouldn't. They would instead fix it, wipe the information clean,and sell it to someone else. And give me someone else's refurbished phone.  Yes, they admitted all of that.  I lost ALL my information and got the refurbished phone from Verizon.Cut to another few months later. No warranty and SURPRISE! It starts again. Freezing, shutting off, getting stuck...Then one day the touch screen just stopped working. I took it to yet another Verizon. This guy had no idea what was wrong and said I would have to call the national line if I had other questions about what was actually wrong with it. He said that the phone was clearly going to die, there was no way to fix it, and I would have to wait 4 months until my contract was up for renewal to get a working phone. 2 hours later...it unfroze and the touch screen starting working again. For the next 4 months, the phone continued to sporadically lose all my photos except 8, then magically find them minutes later, change my background photos, freeze randomly, static, shut off...then...it died.Let me just say that I will NEVER EVER get another LG phone. I will never let any friends or family get one either.Aside from the problems I had with the phone being a complete POS, when it was working, I was constantly having my purse, my pockets, even my arms (when I was carrying a bunch of bags,etc) dial random numbers in my phonebook.Why didn't I lock it you ask? The lock function,if you want to call it that, doesn't actually \"lock\" the phone and require a password to get back in. I'm not quite sure what the actual function is.The touch screen is impossible to use to text; even with my tiny little girly fingers, the screen would constantly choose the wrong letter or number. The voice dial is just as bad, if not worse. You have to scream at the phone, sometimes more than 5 or 6 times and still nothing- or worse- it dials the wrong person.On to the camera-Don't bother taking photos unless it's something LESS than a 1/2 foot away- there is no zoom. Even my cheap Motorola Razr had zoom. You can't take photos from across the room and crop them later- it will make them blurry.Don't bother taking photos unless you are in broad daylight with no shadows. Indoors, you better be directly under light- but not in the glare. 9/10 times the flash goes off, you get a completely white screen. Without the flash, you get a black screen.I can't tell you how many times I missed something, or how many times I stood somewhere trying 8 or 9 times to get a photo to be visible. I don't know about you, but I'm embarrassed asking someone to hold still for 8-9 re-takes, and admitting I still didn't get it.I may make it my mission in life to make sure no one I meet ever buys this POS- or anything LG!", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "washington", "Author": "Patty", "ReviewID": "R2DH4YAA9VDF1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product was delivered as advertised in perfect condition, and arrived quicker than expected.

And flip it open to find a nice big screen and perfect ergonomic keypad. The thing never hangs or resets. The only buggar is the limit of 10 numbers to a group. but for a phone this old, that's acceptable. I know people knock this phone for the outer touch screen pooping out. and thats a concern. We bought 2 phones. One is fine after 30 days, but the other did have the touch screen fail. 1/3rd of the screen is static looking and unreadable. We are currently requesting a replacement.

I tried multiple times to calibrate the touch screen, but it was never correct.  It was absolutely impossible to dial a number using the touch screen because when I would hit a number another would be entered (sometimes I would type \"8\" and \"2\" would appear\").  I found myself in tears from the simple task of trying to call my grandmother.  The battery life was what caused me to get another phone... it lasted 2 hours on a good day.  Many times I was stranded on the side of the road and forced to walk through snow, sleet, and hail to reach my destination because my phone could not remain on long enough to perform it's basic function- call for help.  The picture quality was terrible.  I have a dog with white fur and black spots.  The pictures are so blurry that my dog appears as a gray blob with a tail.  Oftentimes the screens would simple freeze and I would have to remove the battery in order to use the phone.  This would usually cause me to launch the phone across the room due to frustration, which proves to be quite humiliating while in class, meetings, or other professional settings.  Also, sometimes I would simply set the phone down and the battery would pop out!  I literally could not believe what was happening.  I had to put the battery back in the phone and then power on the device.  15 seconds of my life... GONE!  Once I turned the phone on to find all of my preferences (background, password, text themes, etc) were replaced.  I still can't explain that one.  I did not bother to reset my preferences- it was not worth the hassle.  Instead I smashed the thing to smithereens and invested in a DROID.  It was a cheap phone and barely served as a suitable replacement for the 3 months that I could bear to use the thing.

Ehoever uses this phone will end up using the inside a lot more but the large outer screen makes it clearer to see the time and your background and who texed/ is calling you which is nice. The other complaint is that I much prefer the Env3's menu setup. This phone only lets you pick 2 different phone setups and theyre not the best.

It also freezes and lags constantly.When you first get it, it's fine. It works great, besides for the small lags here and there and the occasional dropped call. But after a week was when it started getting worse for me. I've had this phone ever since mid-December, and I really, really don't like it and am truly unsatisfied.I can understand where the other, more positive reviewers are coming from. At first-of course-it makes for a cool feature phone, although if you're not paying the data plan, about half of the apps are unusable. I thought the small apps, like the calendar or the notepad, were cool at first but then they kept loosing my info.>>Now, don't take this review to the bone, as my phone WAS used. It was in okay condition, it just had scratches and was really dirty. I would normally think something probably happened to it, but a lot of other reviews on here report the same stuff occurring, even on their brand new phones.So, I strongly advise to keep looking, and to try and find something better before you resort to this.

I realized I was using most of the data features just because I had them, but they weren't really necessary.  I was a little reluctant to get the ENV Touch because of some of the negative reviews.  My son is using a Chocolate Touch and it's a great little phone.  I decided to take a chance on the ENV Touch because of the full keyboard and I am glad I did!  This is a fantastic phone.  It has the feel and performance of a smartphone but does not require a data plan.  I went with a $10 bundle that Verizon offers so I can still access my email and VZ Navigator and this phone performs flawlessly for what I need.The touch screen is obviously not as refined as the iPhone but I have to say it's probably on par with a Droid X I had a year or so ago and it doesn't lag or freeze as much as the Droid either.  I can reply to texts or emails using the touch screen for short messages and the full physical keyboard for longer messages.  The menus are easy to navigate and you can put frequently used applications right on the main touch screen.  Music sounds GREAT through headphones and the camera is pretty good and has a flash.  It also navigates through different applications and screens quickly with no lag at all.If you need the latest and greatest, then this phone is probably not for you.  If you want a nice multimedia phone with a touchscreen and keyboard that does not require a data plan, then this is a no brainer.  I am very pleased with my purchase.

Every once in a while I'd try to hit a number on the touch screen and it would press the number below it like I had bear paws and couldn't manage to hit the right key (which isn't the case because i have little girly fingers). At first I thought it might have been me and I just managed to hit the wrong number. After the 4th time this happened, I figured it was the phone. It would happen mayyyybe once in ten uses. That was a few months ago. Now....almost every time I use it I have an issue. I've tried adjusting the calibration numerous times and it's useless. It still insists that I want a '4' every time I press '1'. Imagine if every time you were typing, your keyboard put in an 'h' for every 'y'. Not only is it ridiculously annoying, it makes you feel insane after a while. Texting is a nightmare with the touch screen, thankfully it has a keyboard (probably because the person who designed the phone knew that LG would screw up the touch features).The keyboard is the only saving grace for this phone. It would be even nicer if I could use the numbers on the keyboard during calls (like when I have to press '1' for English) without it automatically turning speakerphone on.

I would rather use 2 dixie cups on a string then use this phone for 1 more day after my early upgrade, which I am counting the days until then so I can finally get my DROID. before this phone I swore by LG, and thanks to this turd with number keys, I will never ever by another LG product again. this phone was trouble since day 1, when I would get an international text msg which cost me money from an address that doesnt exist and cost me .25 every msg, all because of some how, some way, my email???? ok...? then came the infamous everytime i went to see what time it was on my phone it would be off deal. did you get my msg? nope phone was off. did you miss my call or was your phone off? yup phone was off. and the bending over and calling someone 8 times in a row, or just plain shutting off. I would seriously be driving at night and I can see my pocket glowing white because my pants touched the \"locked\" touchscreen, or perhaps my chapstick in my pocket was too close to the phone's personal space so it felt it had to unlock by itself. the touchscreen is useless. forget even trying. unless you have fingers the size of a 3 yr old. texting while driving, ok I know its illegal but yes we all still do it, well yeah not happening with this baby. email... dont bother because your contact list wont show up, and you cant reply anyway. then came the replacement phones. this beauty decided to power itself on and off non stop so it was un-useable. so all verizon would do is give me a used one. well a day later that one did the same thing. now Im on garbage phone #3 and its already starting to mess up. white screen when you get a text. horrible reception. horrible battery life. shuts off. no screen at all, but the number keys are lit up so you know the phone is on but maybe not really there?? well to make a long story short, stay away from this junk. stay far away. thank the lord verizon discontinued them. there is a reason for that, well many reasons. theres way too many to list and Ive already put to much effort in to hating this sledgehammer worthy piece of turd. all I can hope for is a cool 50 cents on a trade in or its getting a ride on the end of my aluminum bat. home run verizon.  p.s. I also would have gave zero stars. actually... make that negative 5 stars. to all out there with an env touch- you have my pity", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "number 1", "Author": "johnathan", "ReviewID": "R36L9X2BPL6RTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the sucks bad everything is messed up about the phone the touch does messed up things and its shuts off by itsself what phone you really want the waste money on a bad phone seriously buy a iphone the best phone out there seriously", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well... it's a phone.", "Author": "Amy E.
