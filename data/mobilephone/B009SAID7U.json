It has almost all the capabilities of it's larger sibling, but so much smaller and more convenient!  I have had no issues with this phone since I've owned it (almost 3 months now).  The screen is bright, the size is perfect, and it runs like a top.  I had a question before I bought it, but no one seemed to be able to answer me, so I will add this to my post.  Although it is from overseas, it WILL work in America.  The charger I received was not an American plug, but the company I ordered it from included the adapter.  Make sure you check with the company you order it from to make sure they are including the adapter.  The only thing I saw that was inconvenient was that they weather app that comes standard, only seemed to want to show Celsius temperatures.  I couldn't figure out how to change it so I just downloaded a different app.  No worries!!  Great phone, great size, great experience so far!!", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Sandraliz", "ReviewID": "R2V3DJ6B5LHS8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice good sice and excellent performance in Venezuelawith my data plan.
