Kiefer", "ReviewID": "R12SEHJ4OCANWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my HTC Incredible since December 2010, and after 2 full years, it's still going as strong as the day I got it (as of December 2012). I think it's been a long enough \"trial period\" for me to finally write a review about it.This was my first \"smart\" phone, and I am really impressed how long it's lasted. Honestly, it looks and works exactly as it did two years ago. Sure, the screen gets fingerprints like all smartphones, but this phone seems to have a natural resistance to scratches. I've had no need to buy any extra protective accessories. The rubberized backside I'm sure is a major reason why I rarely drop it. Also, it is one of the few smartphones these days that still fits comfortably in one's pocket (measures 2-1/4\" x 4-5/8\").I've gotten to know this phone pretty well. I can easily unclip the back cover and take out the battery or access the microSD card. A few months ago I upgraded the card to an 8GB--it installed automatically without a hitch. When I'm not listening to mp3s, I often listen to the radio--whose reception is based on the size of the headphones you clip in.As for the battery life, it takes some management and some common sense:1) all cell phones boost their output power in response to a weak signal from the cell towers. If you're out of range, just go into airplane mode (by holding the off button for 2 seconds).2) If you're indoors turn the screen brightness down. HTC has a built-in widget for this setting. Just add it to a home screen.3) Use Wi-Fi instead of 3G internet. Many people don't know what a huge difference this makes. Using Wi-Fi uses a small fraction of the power that 3G uses. It is counter-intuitive, but connecting via Wi-Fi (where available) actually helps extend daily battery life. There are HTC built-in widgets to toggle both Wi-Fi and 3G on/off.My phone can remain on for a couple of days if I just carry it around to check the time, which I think is on par with other phones of similar size. Android has had auto updates over the last couple of years that I think help the phone run more efficiently.Here's the bottom line: This phone has gotten me through my two-year Verizon contract. It still looks great, it still holds a charge very well, and still does everything I need it to do. What more could I ask for? I didn't know much about HTC before, but I am pleasantly surprised. They've earned my trust with this phone, and I'll definitely consider HTC again for my next phone. I am eligible to upgrade now, but I think I'll hold onto this little guy a while longer while I enjoy the rest of my unlimited 3G data plan while I can.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A sturdy 3G smartphone still running strong after 21 months", "Author": "B.

Since day one it has been a reliable phone that gets strong signal here in Phoenix.  21 months later I upgraded to a new dual-core, 4G phone only because I got the upgrade for free.  I was more than ready to stay with my Incredible for even longer.  The phone wasn't perfect and there were 2 clear downs to it.  The first being the brightness of the screen.  It was not very useful outside.  This was common in all of the 1st generation AMOLED screens.  Second, 3.7\" is the absolute minimum screen size for a usable phone.  The phone I switched to is 4.3\" and there is a noticible difference.  That said, the phone never gave me trouble.  It could play all early generation games, was great on WiFi and 3G alike, and came with a sturdy Sense skin from HTC that I loved.  On the extended battery I got an easy 18 hours of battery life, which was more than enough.For someone looking for a way to make a cheap entry into Android smartphones, picking up one of these used would be a great idea.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "ann", "ReviewID": "R3HUU920A4P1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was nervous when ordering this phone since I have always gottoen my phones from the Verizon store but have had no problems.  works great.  real happy.  received on time.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like my HTC Incredible.", "Author": "T.

But it shows no scratches or cracks. I use this phone a lot and you can hardly tell if its even in your pocket. Sometimes I don't even know that I have it with me.  A couple of things that you should know about is, That its very slick so it might fall out of your hand.

Most people are unaware it is supposed to use a genuine HTC DC-T500 extMicro USB cable for proper fitment and to prevent damage to the data/charging port. From personal experience on this subject, (having bought a brand new Incredible in a sealed Verizon branded box that contained a generic micro USB cable) I can tell you that a standard generic micro USB will fit (sort of) and will probably charge, but even according to HTC, will over time will make the socket loose causing the cable to keep falling out or may damage the port.  Depending on where and how you buy, the DC-T500 cable may or may not be included.  I find it \"incredible\" (in a bad way) that HTC decided to do this on this phone and some others such as the Amaze 4G (which I bought used and has the same issue) and Jetstream tablet devices. It is very strange as this cable only fits a few of their products and does not fit standard micro USB ports. The good news is that the DC-T500 cable fits tightly and perfectly, is (as of this writing) available for purchase, in white or black, here at Amazon (search: DC-T500). You should do research for information about this issue, ask questions about the cable before ordering an Incredible, and decide for yourself if it's worth bothering with.

I believe that I have a good \"feel\" for this phone now that I've used it for a while, and my summary is that I don't think it deserves the title \"Incredible\". To clarify my review, I am reviewing both the phone and the operating system (Android 2.3.4 on my device). I think reviewing the operating system is applicable because HTC has its own custom flavor of Android installed (HTC Sense) and that plays a part in how the phone functions (or not). I'm also using it on a prepaid carrier. Here's my breakdown:The good:1. It's a smartphone that runs Android which has a lot of free apps versus the competition.2. Voice quality is good, I've never had a problem with this. It's a phone after all!3. It records HD video.4. This is a smaller Android phone than others so it is more portable. It fits in my pocket nicely.5. Standby battery life is good if you turn everything off like data, wi-fi, etc.6. I like using my phone as a navigation device, and this phone has standalone GPS which is great. No need to have a cell signal/data connection if you use offline maps.7. 3.5mm headphone jack.8. Flashlight (I use it more than you think).The bad:1. Freezes WAY too often. This is my main issue with the phone, and I would give it another star if this freeze issue didn't exist. Freezing once in a while and having a reboot solve the problem is one thing. I'm talking about the phone freezing and then having to reboot several times before the phone decides to work again. I'm at the point where I'm afraid of turning the phone off because I will have to reboot several times until it decides to stop freezing. Trust me when I say I have done hours of research on how to fix this, and tried all sorts of tricks, with no success.2. Battery life drains quickly if you have connections like 3G enabled or watch video. My opinion about battery life is that you should be able to leave your data connection on all day and not run out of battery. This is actually rather common with a lot of older Android phones so I can't fault the HTC Incredible too much, I just live with it. My main gripe is that my \"smart\" phone is a dumb phone when I have to keep data and other services turned off most of the time so I can get through the day without recharging. I can't use features like voice search or voice text or push email without having to turn the data connection back on (because I'm conserving battery again). The push email works if you \"manage\" your battery, meaning you have an app turn on your connection every so often.3. Has too little phone memory and application data storage compared to how much storage there is on an SD card. What I mean is that I am using a 32gb SD card, with 25gb of free space left. I still have over 6gb of internal storage because I install all my apps on the SD card. However, I only have 99mb of phone memory left and 33mb of application data storage left. What this means is that I get a \"low space\" notification and can't install new apps or even update some of the larger apps on my phone (which by the way are all on the SD card) without uninstalling something. Again I have done tricks like deleting all my texts, killing apps, clearing the cache etc which frees up space but it still doesn't solve my \"low space\" problem.CONCLUSION: Overall, this is not a bad phone, but the \"deal killer\" for me is that the phone freezes a lot. I can adjust to things like low space or short battery life, but a phone that freezes even in the middle of a phone call is not good. I want to like this phone, and kind of do, but HTC could have done better with a phone named \"Incredible\".", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is Incredible", "Author": "N.

I don't have many apps, I've moved pictures and songs to my computer to free up space and \"insufficient memory\" still pops up. Talk about angered!

I bought it new back when they first came out due to being impressed by the insanely fast processor and decent amount of RAM.The phone is a decent size, just right in my opinion. I think today's phones are entirely too large (I'm talking to you Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100 - factory unlocked- 16GB Gray) and it fits perfectly into my large hands. It is also, in my opinion of course, the perfect weight. It's heavy enough to know that it's in your hands or in your pockets, but it's not heavy enough to pull down loose fitting clothes and won't give you a concussion if you accidentally drop it on your face while your laying down.The screen is decent quality. It's more than bright enough and the automatic brightness option works great. You won't have a lot of fun watching HD videos, but for higher quality videos and pictures it does more than well enough.The camera was the best in it's time and I still think it is a great camera. It's 8MP, with autofocus. It really does take great pictures and the 720P video is mediocre. It's nice, but nothing to cry home about. That being said, the flash is often overkill and there is no autofocus in video, which is a common problem in some point and shoot cameras today.The phone is currently (and finally) updated to Android 2.3 operating system. I believe the phone comes stock running Android 2.1. There will (obviously) be no updates to push this phone any further and I don't think it would be necessary to do so. Android 2.3 is the update in which Android changed from the \"Android Market\" to \"Google Play\". It also addressed a lot of the software issues the phone was having.Onto the biggest cons of the phone:It doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway. The phone's battery is absolutely horrendous. Back when I first purchased the phone the battery was below average, and after these two+ years the battery has not improved at all. I'm lucky to get a full days use out of one charge. Of course this can be remedied by purchasing one of the many aftermarket batteries on the market.Another minor issue that many people have is the phone restarting itself. Some people blame the phone overheating and some blame lack of RAM causing the phone to restart itself to clear itself out. I personally don't mind the restart as the phone DOES tend to run smoother after it turns back on, which doesn't take long at all.An issue that I seem to have that I don't see many people having is a failing keyboard. If I am texting many people at once, the keyboard will slide up like usual but it will not let me type anything. I have to wait until it decides to start working which can be 15 seconds on a good day or I've had to wait up to 3 minutes. It's nothing major, but it is annoying.Overall, I would recommend this phone to someone looking for an old, cheap, Android phone. It has it's quirks, but it is a great phone.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "didnt work", "Author": "Tammy Trent", "ReviewID": "R1MNBBTLY2AKLR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It didnt work. i could never get it to turn on after charging. it is dead as a door nail..i never got to use it at all.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "geat phone", "Author": "Hadenuff \"Karo\"", "ReviewID": "RWVH02L1E1A51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a prepaid phone and was my first smartphone.

Doing this forces you to have to re-log into all your apps. Moved as many apps to SD card as phone would allow. The phone doesn't allow you to move the built-in crapware supplied by Verizon to the SD card. From reading the online forums there seems to be some kind of memory leak or log files that keep growing that consumes all of the phones internal memory. The only way to fix is root the phone, voiding any support or warranty from Verizon or any other carrier. This is a known issue that Verizon or HTC doesn't have a fix for.

I received this phone as a college graduation present from my parents and LOVED it. I did my research, and decided to go with the Dinc2 even though the day I got it, Verizon began selling the iPhone. It was great.. until about 8 months later. The charging port stopped working. It would \"charge\" and then die within an hour. I brought it to the store and told them it was the charging port, and, instead, gave me a new battery. When I still had the same problem the next day, they ordered me a replacement phone.My replacement came and I was pretty happy. Verizon's total equipment coverage sends you a \"Certified Pre-Owned\" phone - and I didn't think much of it because I'd had a few replacement Blackberry's and never had an issue. That one worked well.. until the screen died in the middle of June. It literally just turned off and wouldn't come back. I troubleshooted in the store, and they made the decision to send me another \"Certified Pre-Owned.\" Got that one, and it worked for a few weeks, until around the end of June when the phone kept turning on and off on it's own, making it almost impossible to use. Got another one. Then the new one started overheating. Sent me a new battery. Now, this FOURTH replacement (through no fault or wrong-doing on my part) is turning on and off on it's own and overheating every time I try to use it or charge it.I don't know if the issue is with Verizon or their \"Certified Pre-Owned\" program, but either way, I'm washing my hands of this phone. As I explained to customer support, I did NOT want a replacement phone sent to me because clearly I'd just have more problems. I asked them for a different option. They told me I could have a \"comparable replacement\" sent to me - another refurb. phone but one that is NOT the HTC Droid Incredible 2 (and pay between $30-$60 for the battery and back cover) or I could get myself an early upgrade (I'm not technically eligible until January). While I was tempted to upgrade to the Droid Razr Maxx - I decided to upgrade to the iPhone 4s instead. I feel more comfortable with apple products (I have a Macbook Pro, an iPod etc) and like that they sync across all platforms.I wish HTC had put just a little more time and effort into this phone.

I have had non-stop, neverending problems, bugs, issues nearly from day one and sadly I can confirm and report that it is not just me, not just this one particular phone, not just one bad item in a batch of good ones.  The research I have done each time I come across a new problem with this thing has only proven that thousands of other people have had the same problems.  That is not to say that some people who own this phone have had no problems, that may be, but there at least as many who have had the same issues I have.I don't want to be long-winded but some of the problems:Constantly being told that memory is running low when it is not.  Being asked to delete files, programs, etc, because storage is being pushed to the limit when as far as I can tell it really is not even close.Unable to receive texts because of--shocker--storage problems.Pre-installed programs that I have never and will never use that cannot be removed/uninstalled/deleted which of course contribute to the storage/memory issues.HORRIBLE battery life--this phone does not even last one day, and by one day I mean 8 hours, unless I do not use it for ANYthing except texting (when of course I can even use texts at all) and checking the time.Repeated \"forced close\" occurances that come up during texting, internet use, etc.Camera is incredibly slow although the pics are high quality.  Often times taking a picture causes the entire phone to freeze until it decides to shut down and reboot which might take only a minute to do or as much as ten minutes before it unfreezes itself and shuts down.Daily requests to install updates, then accepting it and then nothing happening afterwards.Installing an update (when it actually did install once) which created a lot of these bugs in the first place and which are not truly fixable, according to the research I have done and from what I have found lonline in various forums from others with the same issues.There is no point in going on.  Bottom line is I will never own a Droid or HTC product again.  iPhones may not be perfect, but I have never heard of these types of inexcusable, endless issues with an iPhone, so, I will be switching.  This phone is so bad that I will actually be breaking my contract to get out of using it another day--since at this point any time I open ANY app the phone crashes.If you've read all of the reviews noting the same issues I have noted and you still think you want to try this phone, then go for it.

Absolutely the worst phone I've ever used! The battery life is horrible! Lasts about 2 hours before it dies! I even tried turning off the Wi-Fi and turning down the brightness but that wouldn't improve the battery life! Oh and when you charge it, it takes FOREVER to charge! I was using this as an mp3 player. Then on March 2013, the phone just stopped working! I tried plugging it in to several electrical outlets but it didn't work! Now I have a $120 lemon on my lap!

Closing internet tabs: I wasn't able to figure out if this was a defect in the phone or if the incredible was actually designed to do this.

Unsolicited vibration: for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to turn the vibration off when dialing a number. I got it turned off while texting and everything, but I searched that phone through and through and couldn't turn the vibration feedback off when I dialed a phone number. I was about to throw that phone against a wall!4. Lost photos: this was the final straw. After a day at the beach where I took 80 photos or so, I got home and the photos were gone. Gone!

That's ridiculous. This is clearly an item that has a fault, since it's a software issue and nothing is physically broken, and it's Amazon's or the seller's job to make sure I don't have to go six days without a phone or pay return shipping.Also, the battery only lasts three hours, and once it gets to <15% you can watch it go from 15 to 10 to 5 to 0 in about 20 minutes.

I also really like the easy-to-use interface. Some things I don't like about the phone: Well when I wake up in the morning and unplug my phone, I turn it on and the batter percentage say 100. After about 10 minutes (the time it takes me to eat) the percentage is down to 93. I think that since this is the first Incredible, it doesn't really matter anymore, but I think they should have integrated a larger battery. Second, the scroller wheel at the bottom I really don't like! I only think that HTC put that there to make the Incredible look like an iPhone.  I'm always accidentally sliding my finger on it and changing things. P.S this is a touch-screen phone so I don't think that the scroller is even necessary. Overall, I really like the phone but the problems I just stated, won't be solved on this Incredible but I'm pretty sure they have already solved them on the newer ones.

This phone and I had a great relationship, and I'd like to tell you a bit about it.Durability:I dropped this phone off a 3rd story balcony (~20 feet) onto the road once. I ran down to retrieve it, expecting to pick the shattered remains off the street.Nope. There were only a few rough spots on one of the corners. I never used a case or screen protector with this phone, and somehow it put up with my abuse, which was often quite extreme. I've even left it out in the rain once. I know, I'm terrible to phones, but the point is that this thing is indestructible. And it's actually possible to replace some of the parts (like the screen), unlike many other modern phones.Design:Hands down, the best looking phone ever made (in my opinion). Trust me, it looks even better in person. It really showed what was capable in terms of phone design. The size is just right - very easy to hold and operate with one hand.Processor/screen/software:The screen is only 840x480, but it's really bright, with great contrast. Not so great outside where the glare is an enemy, but not many phones can deal with that. The processor is quite speedy for everyday tasks, and the Adreno 200 GPU is capable of playing mobile games like Dead Space with no stutter.I'm not a huge fan of HTC sense, which is why I rooted mine and installed Cyanogenmod (which is fantastic), but the stock OS is certainly tolerable. The Sense overlay will occasionally cause some lag, and freezing up altogether is not unheard of.Camera:HTC probably makes the best phone cameras, and this one is no exception. The dual LEDs really light up pictures, usually without blowing them out, and they're very useful for flashlight apps. The amount of information captured in images can be staggering, especially with decent ambient lighting. The lens can get scratched due to the raised metal ring around it, but I never had any issues with it. Pressing the trackball to take a picture is very useful, and I like it better than on-screen buttons.In summary, this phone exceeded my expectations in every way.

Also, replaced the Froyo OS!!!The droid incredible 'S', 2, and 4g are basic incremental updates to this phone and they are still viable smartphones in late 2012.I purchased a HTC droid incredible thru Verizon wireless's CPO program in October 2010, after it had been release spring 2010.I had a few clear intentions: I wanted a certified phone due to the cost and the fact I knew these phones were as good as new.I believe the price w/ 2 year contract was $99 for two phones. My original phone was great, and I had it \"rooted and ROM'd\" runningSkyraider 3.5 which at the time was one of the best replacement Android 2.2 roms. I subsequently drowned that phone, andit was replaced with another CPO phone. I again gained root privileges and customized the phone to my needs.Except by this time, Verizon had released the Android 2.3 OTA update. I found a suitable de-bloated version of this OTA and installed it. This phone along with an inexpensive 1900Mah battery that I purchased from a USA seller on 'that auction site' had a long life.However, with the dawn of 4G LTE speed, the larger 4.xx size screens, and the desire for a faster CPU led me to upgrade.But HTC hit a homerun with this phone, probably never to be repeated. It's highly recommended as a 3G smartphone esp if you ROM it!Some of my favorite DINC roms: MIUI, Skyraider 4.x, Cyanogenmod version+, and the ones based on stock gingerbread.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC droid Incredible", "Author": "rainsong3535", "ReviewID": "R3NN2C5ZHQS8ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A refurbished model yet working beautifully.

Nothing works quite like it is supposed to. There is not enough memory for apps, and there is no way to increase the amount of memory space available. Result: apps freeze or simply delete their own data all the time. The touchscreen freezes up and you have to restart the phone to get it to work. I've had to re-set this phone six times, and I've lost all my data twice. This is the most frustrating phone I've ever owned. The advertisements are lies; the phone doesn't do anything it is supposed to do. Don't buy this. Get something that works instead.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buggy, charging jack and buttons broke.", "Author": "justsomeguy", "ReviewID": "R3MLROV5FDP5CY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hi. I've had my HTC Incredible for just over a year now.  When it worked, it was pretty cool.  The battery lasted a couple days, the functionality and apps you could download worked pretty well.  But inside of the 1 year mark of owning it, it all went south.First, the battery died.  Over time, it would last less and less until finally it just up and died and wouldn't take a charge. Fine - I bought an extended battery that worked well.Then, the charging jack broke.  That's the little port on the left side of the phone.  Won't take a charge, won't work for copying photos/music to and from the phone. So, along with buying a battery, I bought some (cheap) external battery chargers and some more batteries.  It works OK.  Still can't get more than 24 hours of use from a battery (god forbid you actually USE apps on this thing - they KILL the battery).Next, the power button died.  I can't turn it on and off.  I have to click it a million times to hopefully make it activate the screen.  I certainly can't put it to sleep anymore, and I've accidentally called people because of this.-In summary, it's just not well-designed.  I didn't even mention that I had to re-boot the phone because I could no longer get the \"marketplace\" app to work.  That was a HUGE pain in the butt.-When the iphone 5 comes out, I'm switching.  I'm done with these shoddy impersonations of what is simply the greatest phone out there: the iphone.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$65.97", "Features": "Slick, thin smartphone with 3.7-inch SLCD screen\n8-megapixel camera with flash. 720p Video Recording.\nAndroid 2.2 OS with Google and multitasking\n1 GHz Snapdragon processor for outstanding performance\nClear ESN , Ready To Activate, No Contract Required", "Name": "HTC DROID INCREDIBLE Android Phone Black (Verizon Wireless)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WdpOIxuxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004AFVEOC"}}
