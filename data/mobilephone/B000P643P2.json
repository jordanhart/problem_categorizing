Slick Design", "Author": "AreYouKidding?", "ReviewID": "R1FV820T8IY0F7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A long-time Motorola phone user now converted. Not only is this phone lightweight and amazing looking, it's feature packed.Pros:- Crystal-clear calling. No static and loud when needed.- The screen is amazing. The resolution is awesome. By far the best I've ever seen on a phone this size.- This phone is tiny; in a good way. Super-slim and tucks nicely in your pocket. Being that it's a slider, you'll never have to worry about pocket-dialing. :)- The software is very easy to navigate. This is nicely improved over the Motorola interface of my older RAZR.- The MP3 player rocks; no pun intended. The Walkman software lets you sort by Artists, Albums, Tracks, Playlists and more. This is light-years ahead of the my old RAZR's MP3 player. This one rivals any standalone MP3 device I've used.- The stereo headphones that comes with it include a 3.5mm adapter. While the included headphones sound great, this adapter gives you the flexibility to use your Bose, Shure or other stereo headphones. A very nice option.- Unlike \"some\" other sliders, the camera is protected and kept under cover when the slide is closed. This works great in keeping dust off the lens.- The 2.0MP camera is actually pretty good. It takes great outdoor photos.- I LOVE the fitness/step counter. It measures distance in steps and calculated miles along with the calories you've burned. It also keeps a daily average and each days results.Cons:- No 3G- Sony Proprietary Memory Stick Micro M2 versus easy to find and less expensive MicroSD- No LED Flash or Photo LightIn conclusion, if you are looking for a super-slim phone with great call quality and superb music capability, look no further. This Sony wears the Walkman name with pride.Note: I recently bought a SanDisk SDMSM2-4096-A11M 4GB Memory Stick Micro (M2) and it works perfectly. 4GB of music!!!", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Don't buy from Wireovia!cell phone falls apart in a few months, they sell defective products.", "Author": "WanMing A Wong", "ReviewID": "R6JTZON72Z9U1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If I have a choice, I would give them no star.  Unfortunately, I need to give them one star for \"hate it\".  The cell phone Sony Ericsson W580i Unlocked I bought from WIREOVIA through amazon starts falling apart just within few months.  After all the hassles and emails between me and the customer service person back and forth.  Their response:  they not are going to fix it but \"suggested\" me to pay them another $25 for the warranty for another phone cause it passed 90 days warranty.  I already pay close to 100 bucks for a cheap phone and now you are going to ask me to pay you more for what?  Another piece of crap?  Please!!!  I need to tell you all that I previously owned the EXACT SAME model twice. The two phones that I purchased from other companies never give me any problems.  IT's solid and that's why I want to stick to the same model of phone.  But boy, this is not what I thought I can get from here. This company simply sells defective, low quality product. I always thought amazon sell authentic products with good quality since I had great experiences with them.  However, I recently found out that there maybe fake and counterfeit products out there and you get \"fake\" stuff in amazon still.  Please be aware!  Keep in mind that I am careful with my cell phone, I hardly \"rough\" up my phone.  That's why I was even more disappointed that the product falls apart so easily.  Here is the breakdown of the defects:1. The size of the phone is different from the original.  The protective case I got from my previous phones does not fit into the phone I bought from them.  This makes me question the authenticity of the phone.  It's a slide phone and the bottom cover does not fit.  This happened right at the time I got the phone, but thinking about the phone being \"new\" and in a box with all the stuff.  With just the size difference, I thought it will be alright and thinking it is no big deal.  Thinking about the hassle to return and got another phone, with good faith and trust...I thought I give the phone a try (this company has good reviews) Boy!  I was wrong.2. 2 months later, the top M2 memory card cover starts to \"pop\" up and unglued itself.3. Around 3 months later, the battery dies shortly even I don't use the phone.  I always charged my phone at night before I go to bed like everybody, but if I leave the phone unused for the day.  The phone will definitely dies and needs to be re-charged.  That never happens to any cell phones that I owned before.4. Around 3-4 months later, the connection between the charger and the phone got weird. I need to \"tilt\" the phone in the certain way in order to be in the \"charged\" stage.  Again, I never encounter such problem with other phones until I got this phone from this company.5. Around the same time, 3-4 months later, the phone bottom cover start to fall apart.  And this is major!  The key pad is unglued and falling apart.  I am always careful with my phone, and like I said, I had the exact same phones twice before...this never ever happens to me!I hope this helps people to aware for the reviews next time, fast service and new phone doesn't mean they sell decent good products.  I definitely got a defective one from them.  If you don't want your phone breakdown few months later, and don't want to be pay more dollars out of your hard earned money to buy warranty for the LOW QUALITY products, PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM THEM. I certainly would NOT buy from sellers like them from now on.  And I will be more careful with reading the reviews from other buyers from now on.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Walkman FM radio +++ but small keypad", "Author": "Mother of Twins \"Life in the sloth lane: Sure...", "ReviewID": "R2061706GDH4GP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too.  This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as \"handsfree\" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red \"jewels\" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson", "Author": "MJ", "ReviewID": "R2VMPTXG6PL1S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my favorite phone by Sonny,actually I have purchased this phone twice before, therefore, I new what to expect in dealing with this item.

Turns out my first phone never worked with the local sim card. This phone at least worked every now and then (hence the 2 stars). But, it would frequently say no sim card detected and I couldnt make or receive calls. I would have to remove the battery, jiggle the sim and replace the battery. I missed calls whenever this happened and I didnt detect it soon enough. Maybe this is a problem of the phone brand.
