It sounds more to me like he sucks at the skill that typing on a phone requires, probably not patient enough or has pretty big fingers. It has been a joy for me to use for the last month of having it. I am coming from a Black berry and this has been vastly superior. The touch screen is not only very responsive but you have the built in option of just sliding your fingers from one letter to the other to type which makes if much more effortless than the typical input method and i didn't have to download an app to do taht.Its feature rich and beautiful to hold and look at. Matter of fact just about every one who has seen me with it and played around with it wants one. If you are looking for a dual sim, go no further but even if you are just looking for a single sim its def worth the buy. There is one serious down side but I would still have bought it when I think of all the others pluses - the HSPDA is only a mere 7mbps. Way way too small for a phone of this price and design. The other downers like battery capacity is pretty typical for these smartphones so I won't discredit this model for it but it's really drains too fast no matter how I try to save power. Overall a def 4 stars for me.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "works just as advertised", "Author": "ry", "ReviewID": "RXQOL6LI5AVKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "battery lasts roughly 35-40hrs with over 10hrs of talk time, great camera, sensitive touch screen, might need just a tad bit more processing power", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelent", "Author": "HECTORBRITO", "ReviewID": "R1K575LO4N5YTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone need a dual sim mobile ( work very well in venezuela)", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERY SLOW RESPONSE, manufactured elsewhere and as such, no tech support whatsoever", "Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "R1IHZARNY7SOY4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone unlocked so I can use it where I live in Central America.  A few days of having it and using it, I noticed that the reaction was very slow, but didn't take it too seriously.  It turns out that after a month, it really is a very slow reacting phone and I want to understand why.  To open an app, it takes about 15-20 seconds for anything to react.  I thought the phone would offer good value for the price, etc...it turns out that you really do get what you pay for.Worst of all, I contact Samsung Tech Support (which is what Amazon suggested) and they traced my IMEI number and the model.  It turns out it was manufactured in Pakistan which means I have to call Pakistan to get any sort of technical support, which is a huge deal if you're living in Central America.It's frustrating to find a phone, trust a retailer, and find out a the end that the phone isn't even working right and worst off, you can't even find a solution to the phone's problems.LESSON:  FIND OUT WHO THE MANUFACTURER IS before making a purchase that could require some sort of technical support.  The Seller also noted that the phone used a micro SIM card, it does not, it uses a regular sim.  I already had a micro sim which is why I targetted a micro sim card phone.  This review is also on the Seller in that they didn't disclose the info correctly or doesn't know their products enough to know that even if it was a manufacturer error -they weren't aware of it. Sellers should know what they are distributing, no?

Has all the major functions of a Samsung phone: great camera with flash, easy setup for email client, loud ringing volume.2. Large screen with large numbers for dialing.3. Came unlocked as advertised with no scratches, nicks or dents- was brand new in the plastic with all accessories and manual.Cons:1. It is Dual SIM Standby NOT Dual SIM Active- we found this out the hard way when customers started complaining about not getting us, not even voice mail. The settings function by forwarding the calls of the inactive SIM to the active SIM. This may incur carrier charges for some persons. The alternative to this is to deactivate the call forwarding by going to the settings and deactivating \"Dual SIM always on\" and selecting one SIM card to act as the primary SIM while the other acts as the data SIM. This is a waste if you are using two different carriers to minimize on off-network calls (as in our case).2. The processor is EXTREMELY slow. It freezes when you try to hang up from calls or even when searching your contact list. Don't expect it to save you when those 2 seconds count.3. The phone automatically designates the SIM not in use as on standby. If this is not remedied, it will send calls to voicemail or will not give the caller a response.These are what we have noticed thus far. I gave it three stars (and not two) because it still functions somewhat with the two SIM cards even though it's not the way we would have liked it.

I checked the specs, decided it was sufficient for what I wanted, and received relatively quick shipping.  Since then, it has been nothing but disappointment.  I should have paid more attention to the fact that the majority of posted reviews were out of India, and I had never even heard of this model.  It doesn't seem to be used in the US much at all.  The phone is slow and buggy, takes several seconds for the screen to turn on or off, and it beeps every 3 minutes while charging (I've timed it).  It takes several seconds before processing anything, from sending a text message to opening Facebook.  As Louis CK said, yes, we should be astonished and amazed at the fact that we can speak to somebody across the country and access data from around the world (so how dare I complain that it takes a few seconds), but when spending a good chunk of money, these issues are mostly non existent in comparable products.  Therefore, I regret the purchase and would not recommend it to anybody that I know, or to the strangers here on Amazon.  Thought it was a great deal and outsmarted myself.

We could get phone calls and texting to work, but couldn't use data over the cell network. We were told it would not work after calling consumer cellular directly, but we figured out how - you have to manually configure the APN on the phone. After doing so, the internet works fine over the cell network.This link was helpful: [...]According to the consumer cellular FAQ ([...] click on \"I have a non-Consumer Cellular phone. How do I set up messaging and web access?\"). Then enter the settings provided (which are also below):Service Name  MMS  WebProxy Address  proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com  <blank>Proxy Port  80  <blank>Proxy Push  Disabled  EnabledAuthentication Type  Secure  SecureUsername (CSD/GPRS)  <blank>  <blank>Password (CSD/GPRS)  <blank>  <blank>GPRS access point  att.mvno  att.mvnoHomepage  [...]  [...]This would have been good to know, especially since the tech help at consumer cellular did not tell us about it - instead told us to 'try the phone outside.'
