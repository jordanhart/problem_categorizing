{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone for first time cell phone users.", "Author": "Scott Stevens", "ReviewID": "R31KFVF5X8RY8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did not purchase my Samsung T101G tracfone on Amazon but at the local Dollar General store.  It came with a packaged deal which included a belt clip carry case, phone car charger cord, ear phone piece and the free unlimited double minute plan.  All that for $10 (which is dam good considering if all these items were purchased separately would come to $65 total).  At that price I could not pass it up.  That being said, I am a first time user of cell phones and the Samsung T101G is what I am beginning with.  It is a great phone for first time ever cell phone users and is perfect for those who want a simple cell phone without all the fancy bells and whistles of the more expensive models.  I was looking for a phone to have for emergency purposes and for general contact with the outside world when I traveled and this particular model phone is perfected for that.  Reception has been decent in most areas and I have had no problems so far with making and receiving calls.  The phone has many other features like web browsing and text messaging with which I am still experimenting with, so I can't give you an honest review yet on those features.  But if your looking for a simple, inexpensive cell phone that does what a phone should do (make and receive calls) without all the fancy bells and whistles, the Samsung T101G is a excellent choice.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "So many features, such a great phone", "Author": "E.

For the price i cannot believe you get so much, we are talking texting for 0.30 minutes out of 1.00 minute. calls overseeas for no more than calls made locally. I would recommend this phone, especially for emergencies, you only have to buy a $20 card every 3 months which can add up to 120 minutes", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Serious Deficiencies, Useless Manual", "Author": "Motor Head", "ReviewID": "R1HM83EHWI9MH5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone from Target Stores because I wanted to try Tracfone as a cell phone service provider (according to Consumer Union, they are the best prepaid service provider).The phone has several serious deficiencies that cause a great deal of annoyance :- User manual is woefully inadequate (e.g. no explanation of auto lock feature, security, etc.)- User manual on Samsung's web site is only available as a pdf file and cannot be edited to print  as  individual pages- User manual that comes with the phone is equally inadequate- When you store the phone in its carry case and close the lid, the phone will  frequently turn on, since some of the buttons protrude. If you accidentally touch the \"browser\" button, you will be charged 0.5 minutes for access charges !Since this phone is likely to be be purchased by people who do not use a cell phone very often (for emergency contacts), the user instuctions need to be much more explicit/detailed, and the ergonomic design of operating buttons that can accidentally be activated leaves a lot to be desired.

Sweeney Jr. \"Flying Zamboni\"", "ReviewID": "R1CICDKK4JBI24", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For a low cell phone bandwidth user like myself, I generally use the phone when I need roadside assistance or when I'll be home much later than planned, this seemed like the perfect fit for me.  It dials wells, wasn't too hard to set up, but the documentation as noted in other reviews is greatly lacking.However if the cellphone is on and I close its carrying case, it opens up the web browser and deducts 30 seconds immediately.  You can NOT have this phone on and carry it in it's case, your pocket or purse.  It will dial up the internet and cost you 30 seconds, and if you don't catch it, it will continue to do so every 30 seconds until you stop it.  I lost an hour worth of airtime due to this before I finally figured out what was happening.  Samsung should require a confirmation to logging into the internet with this phone.I'm trading this one in for a LG 420G flip phone, hopefully that one I'll be able to keep in my coat pocket without it dialing into the internet without my knowledge.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "5-Star Phone", "Author": "A.

Tatakis \"Chucktee\"", "ReviewID": "R2KWQZUVM3BJQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this Tracfone when I travel and noted that it has gotten knocked for being a simple unit with a vague instruction manual. However, I really like this phone as I have been followed around by associates when I travel because it's the only phone that can link to the signal towers in the area.  Also, it very robust having been dropped many times. The battery lasts a couple of weeks between charges  with light usage, perhaps a few minutes per day. I've gone away for a week with multiple calls per day and the battery charge was adequate. Otherwise the circumstances would be very trying.The Blackberries and Iphones are superb business units but their range is limited. What's more annoying than being on location and unable to communicate, no signal? I've never had that problem but I've had to recently loan my phone to several others for that reason.We all should recall that this is a $20 phone and for that reason alone for the performance it represents it's an exemplary unit. It has never let me down during the dozens of client visits and I've purchased one for my wife to use during emergency calls as it is very dependable.On the road it's my business phone, alarm clock, timer, calculator and MMS unit.

As others have said, the manual stinks and I was never able to lock the keypad so various buttons got pushed when it was in my pocket. And worst of all for me, the speakerphone was \"On\" and I could not turn it off. Not only could everybody around hear my converstions, but the person I was talking to could hardly hear me because of all the ambient noise (traffic, televisions, other conversations) being picked up by the speakerphone. Since all I need is a simple cell phone for emergencies, I bought an LG420G which works great. The Tracphone service is fine and cheap (especially with a double minutes card) so now I'm happy.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Internet browser eats your minutes", "Author": "Sandra", "ReviewID": "RU9TKQBCPQ7GI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like some of the others reviewing this phone, I had the same problem with the internet browser eating up my minutes.  If this phone is slightly bumped while in your purse or pocket, it activates the internet.  I called tracfone twice and also emailed them, and they told me to buy a case for the phone.  I asked them if there was a way to deactivate the browser button and they said no.

It is a durable phone. But whenever I'm working and it's in my pocket it either connects to the web accidentally because the browser button sticks out and before you realize it, you've burned up minutes on the web. And I BS you not, my phone somehow calls my local fire/emergency. This all happens when it's locked and in my pocket.

BUY FROM any other company - you might get something worth using.  Tracfone has a great $ game - the phone comes with \"FREE\" Voicemail you cannot turn off.... but you cannot receive calls after activation until they initialize it after a customer service call - so every voicemail drains your minutes. Remember you cannot receive text or send or return the calls! I started with a $24 phone, $50 worth of minutes.... 4 hours with customer service and Service Supervisors who \"hung-up\" on me and refused to return any calls making me have to use long distance (international) to try and get an incoming call.  Finally, we just gave up.  We used the remaining few minutes to call out and threw the trash away.
