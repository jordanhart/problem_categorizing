So far no sign of that and after fitting with a gel sleeve? It has taken quite a beating and still works as great as first day of use. I have used several different data services, tethered, bluetoothed, mobile apped....used it to do online coursework in a pinch. No app issues ever and the quality picture, sound and video expected of Samsung delivered. I wish I could buy two more. Im keeping this one as back up in case anything ever does happen to the original. So far, not a worry, not an issue. Aces on this phone alll around.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I recommend it to you", "Author": "MEYLYN007", "ReviewID": "R2TA6NWC7ADGMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product was new, good quality.

Note to self, the original language was in Russian, so use the internets to figure out the keystrokes to change it to your language preference.I usually use a Galaxy S3, so this was a great mini version. I used it primarily for messaging, maps and the internets. The pictures look pretty bad on the screen, but if you upload or transfer them to a computer, they look just fine.It's battery life was really great, and it worked well with the different sim cards I had to buy. I definitely recommend this little phone as a back up or as a phone to use while traveling internationally, I do not recommend it if you are looking for a day to day smart phone, the screen is just a little too small for that type of use.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "simple and nice overseas", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RYCM8OU1GHF7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A gift for my wife (she does not like cellphones).

What upset me more was it was given quite a \"makeover\" - sealed box, handset beautifully wrapped in plastic giving me the feel of a new one, accessories in pristine condition. Once I inserted my SIM (I had to go through the hassle of cutting my SIM into \"micro\") the flaws started coming out. I had the Facebook, email and what's app configured of a Spanish lady inside the phone with pictures and all *Yikes!* The scroll key was totally unresponsive.
