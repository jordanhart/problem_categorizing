{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phone is great but NOT unlocked!", "Author": "Nari", "ReviewID": "R1KQ609MZCTNUY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this product about one month ago and bought another for my wife.  The phones were delivered on time.  The ones I purchased online had no carrier logos but upon arrival I discovered T-mobile branding on them.  So I thought 'ok, no problem - it's supposed to be unlocked,' and went ahead and slipped in my sim card.  What I did not mention as yet is that I live in Trinidad and Tobago (in the Caribbean) and travel a lot, hence the purchase of an unlocked phone.  Upon switching on the phone, I was greeted with a very cool green Android guy.  Unfortunately, I could not get past that screen - because lo and behold, the phone was not unlocked (as advertised)!The only reason I did not automatically return the phones at this point (as advised by the Amazon Rep.) is because it would have been such a hassle to do so.  That's only the first part of the problem.  I then thought that I could just get the phones unlocked by those smart tech people you see in the malls all over the place...  Only to discover that I needed a data plan to even get past the first screen (mind you, this was ALSO NOT advertised).  The end result is that I ended paying about $100 each to get the phones unlocked and activated. I close by saying that the only reason this review did not get only one star is because after  the headache I endured to get them unlocked, the phones are actually great phones.  My wife loves hers and for someone who is not too interested in gadgets - she is absolutely hooked on hers.  My advice is that if you live outside the US, do NOT purchase this phone - it might be okay if you live in the US (but I can't really comment on that).", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprise: phone has a crack on the back and locked to T-Mobile", "Author": "Jerry Chu", "ReviewID": "R201S6EN8IV6G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bouhgt this 'unlocked' phone to be used with AT&T.; I know AT&T; insists data plan for smart phones, which I don't need, since I have wifi most of the time. But I also know AT&T; closes an eye on non-AT&T; smart phones. I'm very happy with the phone, except for a few problems that I encountered:1. The vendor did not disclose a crack on the back cover, and that the phone was actually locked to T-Mobile.2. The phone came with old firmware, probably Android 1.5, I couldn't tell, since I couldn't get pass the google log in (requires network data connection, no Wifi). This first generation firmware only works for people who have T-Mobile account with data plan.3. I went to a T-Mobile store and signed up for T-Mobile prepaid plan, got a new T-Mobile SIM card. But still no network connection. The T-Mobile store wouldn't refund me the $25 cash that I handed to them 10 mins before, although the contract says I can cancel it the first 2 weeks. I did borrow 2 separate T-Mobile SIM cards from them to try out, and no connection. 0 bars (APN info was programmed correctly). They told me to get another phone. At this point I thought the phone is defective, and I probably can only use it as a WiFi device.4. Then came a breakthrough. I downloaded Android 2.2.1 firmware to the flash card and reflashed the phone. This is a generic version without T-Mobile customization, and I can skip Google log in. Phone is up and running, connecting to T-Mobile. I did try almost every firmware that I could find on the internet. The phone rejected most of them for bad signature (probably T-Mobile specific signature), and some downloaded firmware are corrupted (too short). So if the file is smaller then 50MB, it is corrupted.5. T-Mobile wouldn't SIM-unlock it unless I wait 40 days and prove that I paid retail price for the phone. Eventually I paid $15 for a company that specializes in unlocking HTC phones to provide the unlock code (another company that can unlock everything couldn't unlock it. I'm waiting for a refund). Anyway, I now have it running with AT&T.;Although this is a first generation Android phone, it works well with Android 2.2, very responsive. Sound quality is better than my Aria.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "htc locked", "Author": "carlos", "ReviewID": "R34FI3XHFJCFXV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I buy my touch htc this article, I am pleased with the purchase, and that the specification of article status was unlocked and not true, is blocked or locked.

Enjoying the amazon.com excellent service and customer service throughout the years, I sent the product to my friends the exact way it was received from amazon.com.Upon receipt of product at the country of destination, it became evident that the product was not new and the it was a T-Mobile LOCKED phone and not an HTC Unlocked Android Phone in a factory sealed box.Imagine the disappointment of a 9 year old girl receiving a REFURBISHED, LOCKED brick which cannot be used with a local SIM card.Due to the costs of shipping and the duties paid at the country of origin, returning this phone to the USA for it to be returned to amazon.com, makes no sense.

Scott", "ReviewID": "RSZCH9JRYBVR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buyers please beware that this is an unlocked phone but still requires a SIM card with a data plan to setup.  I'm not sure why HTC required the phone to have a SIM card with a data plan to set it up but it does.  I use T-Mobile pay as you go.  I simply switched to a daily data plan, setup my phone and then promptly switched my plan back to a pay as you go.  I ended up spending a whole $2 to do this, no big deal.  However if you have AT&T; the setup is a little more complicated and you need a SIM card with a data plan.  If you have a friend that has a SIM card with a data plan you can borrow it for 5 minutes and then use your own SIM card.  Once you setup the primary gmail account on the phone you can use WiFi and change the SIM card when ever you want.  I bought this phone for texting and calling and use WiFi for the data.  The phone is really cheap compared to other Android phones, I hate contracts so I always buy unlocked phones.  This is a great fit for me.  However at this price point HTC had to sacrifice a few things, one being the processing power.  It can be a little slow compared to other $500 android devices, but at being 1/4 the cost you can't really complain.  One other minor annoyance is the headphone jack.  In order to use headphones you need to use their adapter which plugs into the mini-usb port. The adapter does allows you to pause and start music without pulling it out of your pocket and using the GUI which is nice.  But this means you can't charge the device while listening to the headphones.  For the price this is a great phone.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "item was not what was advertised", "Author": "theronmo1", "ReviewID": "R3DV2M7ZUQWWPZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I placed an order for a t-mobile my touch phone. The item arrived and immediately there was a problem it was not 3g as advertised. I called tmobile gave them the name and serial # of phone and they informed me it was a candian phone not capable of 3g and would not work. I contacted the seller and they agreed to send me another phone. When that one arrived it worked for about a week. I then started having problems with it working on 3g again. It would come and go. I again took the phone into tmobile only to be told again it was not really 3g capable and would eventually stop working on that network all together. I then contacted the seller once more. This time the customer service rep was not so nice. He basically told me I was just trying to get a free phone. I assure you I have no problem paying for a phone but I want what I pay for. He then said I could send back the phone and once received they would issue me a credit. He was not willing to pay for the retuen shipping as if this is my fault and I should pay? He also said I had to have the original box. It had been over a month and I no longer had the box. This has to be one of the worst companys to buy from. I urge everyone to shop elsewhere.

I was a bit skeptical after reading all the poor reviews saying the phone was locked but decided to try it out due to the low price and the Amazon Prime quick shipping. I got the phone delivered earlier than anticipated (Saturday evening) and after opening the smiley face box, found a plain unmarked white box with a label on the underside with the UPC and IMEI information. The inside of the box held the phone itself, along with a charger, cord, ear buds, and a quick start guide. There were two pieces of loose papers which contained (1) return information and (2) wireless settings to connect to the Cingular/AT&T; network. There wasn't a Users Guide and I couldn't figure out why the phone wasn't charging after I attached the cable and plugged it into the wall socket. I managed to locate the users guide online and after removing the back cover, I found a plastic lining around the battery, along with the SIM and SD card slots. I inserted a SIM card that I got from the local electronics store (activated so I got a new cell phone number), and removed the plastic lining from the battery & put the phone back together.After that, the phone was charging fine. There's a bright green MyTouch 3G screen that appears upon powering up, followed by the Android logo. So far, so good. When you get to the main screen, there's a quick tutorial on how to use the phone, which you can skip, followed by either creating a Google account or activating the Google account you already have (I chose the latter). Unfortunately, while I could get the phone to recognize the SIM card, it wasn't provisioned as a SIM that had any data service on it. So I went back to my local electronics store and picked up a pre-paid monthly talk/text/data plan (+$50). It took some time to get the plan activated (non-related to the phone or Amazon, just the provider service) but once the unlimited talk/text/data plan was linked to my SIM card and phone, and I changed the internet settings (WAP/MMS details), things were running perfectly.The MyTouch 3G makes calls, sends texts, takes pictures, and allows me to go online (Wifi). So far, my only complaint is that the touch screen is a bit non-responsive; you have to press a bit firmer some times for the phone to recognize you're tapping, especially text. The keypad is also a bit smaller compared to other phones with a full QWERTY and I found the typing a bit cramped (& I have small hands).  Finally: without the users manual, it's a bit difficult to recognize the various icons popping up at the top of the screen when I was initially using the phone to download apps and such. But maybe that's just a personal idiosyncrasy (though the 'connected to a Wi-Fi network' is an important one).All-in-all, the phone is working great so far state-side on a non-major teleco plan and I hope it does as well with foreign GSM networks in Europe & Asia.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Well Built But Sluggish", "Author": "G. Dill", "ReviewID": "R14CVGZDT7457Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had my phone for two years and overall it's a decent phone, but nothing outstanding.My biggest complaints are: It takes about 3 minutes to boot up and about a minute to shutdown. The touchscreen is sluggish and sometimes quite unresponsive. The rollerball is really unnecessary. There is a slight delay in typing on the display keyboard. And quite often the wrong letter appears on the screen after typing. This is particularly true of the letters on the outer edge of the QWERTY keyboard. The audio level on the earpiece is not very good and sound quality is slightly diminished. The battery life is about one day depending on how often you use the phone. I charge my phone every night. The charger has an unnecessary bright blue light on the plug that emits enough glow in a dark bedroom to keep a person from sleeping at night.My biggest praises are: It's a strongly built phone. I have dropped my phone countless times and the screen has never cracked and the phone has never broken. The display is crisp and the coloring is vivid. Perhaps the best display I have ever seen on a smartphone. The ringtones are nice and loud especially for those of us who are hard of hearing. When I have a good Wifi connection the browser and email client are very fast. I particularly like the built-in GPS, especially when using Google Maps.This would have been the perfect phone if the built-in processor was slightly faster. But, because it is sluggish I give it a low 3-star rating.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "good phone fast delivery", "Author": "meimei", "ReviewID": "R20AFK47M92VM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone.

So, you CAN'T install Instagram, LinkedIn, Netflix, etc. So annoying.- If you upgrade the Android version on this phone, the phone is unbelievably slow.- Some of the apps that you can install freeze all the time and/or won't run. I can't even get Google Voice to work properly.- Gets hot, even with light use (texting, editing settings like ringtones).Overall, I'm very frustrated and feel this phone purchase was a waste. I had an old half-broken iPhone. Even my half-broken iPhone is better and faster than the MyTouch 3g. The MyTouch 3g is simply slow, frustrating, freezes, and it's old (so it won't run a lot of today's current applications).If you want a basic phone and don't are about apps, this might work for you.

This phone has to be probably the worst android compatible machine ever. I know it's the first generation Androids but honestly it's very much slow. My texting was faster than the response the phone had. I wrote one sentence to my friend with no errors and it took about 2 minutes to show it on the screen. The keyboard is small, the back case is flimsy, the camera is absolutely garbage, no headphone jack unless you buy the adapter (bought it from a computer store for $5 bucks). I buy my phones to resell but I knew no one was going to pay anything above $50. So I had to sadly cut my losses and sell it for $50 to a nice man. I recommend this phone only to little ones who want to learn about Androids. Oh, and my friend had purchased a 3G from here and he states it does not have unlocking access. His AT&T; Sim Card did not work.Too long didn't read---Only buy this phone if you're a beginner, want to call, small texting, and average browsing. Don't buy this phone for daily use.

Of all the phones I considered, this one was the overall best value for occasional travel use. The phone was unlocked as advertised but you must keep in mind that most mobile companies do require a data plan for smartphones. Also, to use the data capabilities you need to adjust the APN settings for the service provider. You can try to find these settings online or there are apps in the android market that will help with this.I recommend borrowing a friend's AT&T; or other non-T-mobile SIM card to get past the initial startup screens.  You can then use the phones wifi abilities to access the android market and load any apps you want (at least APN tweaker-free app) so you are not wasting vacation time doing this after you buy your prepaid SIM. Also, the phone will want to update to Android 2.2.1 which can be done via wifi as well.For the phone itself, the processor is slow especially after the update to 2.2.1 but this was expected being an older phone and a big reason why you can get this unlocked phone so cheap without a contract.  You could refuse the update if you are concerned with this but you would not be able to use stared locations in you goggle maps account.Overall if this is for use on a one time or for occasional trips, buy this phone.

It only makes sense to buy this phone now if you do not want to be able to install or use instagram, angry birds, or any other current popular applications; the phone is not capable of supporting them no matter how many updates you do. Touch response is extremely slow while texting or browsing the web, and the phone easily becomes overwhelmed if you are running more than one application at a time, causing it to repeatedly restart itself. The only feasible use for this phone is as a basic first phone for a child. I can not believe the mytouch 3g is even still being sold for over 40 dollars or that it has a 3 star average rating. If you want a phone just for call and occasional texting, stick with a cheaper number pad phone, this is pretty much the touch screen version of those.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Im giving '1' star cuz there is no '0' star", "Author": "Manny Blaq", "ReviewID": "R1BL34RB4IP0QP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't believe when they say their item is new, It my just be clean in good condition. phone was missing the antenna and two buttom screws that hold the antenna and cover.

I have changed my cell phone contract to pre-paid service, and my AT&T; landline to Ooma VOIP for 2 years already, which saved me a lot of money! Since I have to spend money to buy a cell phone, it has to be some kind of smart phone, not the cheap pre-paid phone. That's how I found this HTC my Touch 3G with a good price.I want the cell phone with micro SD card slot, so that I could add more memory space if necessary. This is the function most cell phone companies are not offering, especially for Apple products. You have to pay extra money for a little bit more memory, which is ridiculous to me.Another factor draws my attention is the ability to replace the battery. Nowadays a lot of cell phone companies simply seal everything, which prevents you from opening the cell phone. If battery dies, you need to send it back to technicians or buy a new one. I don't really know the philosophy behind it, but I honestly do not appreciate this kind of marketing trend at all.  This is the reason why I buy this HTC my Touch 3G. It has everything I need.After I have received the cell phone, I immediately found out that I need a data plan to activate the cell phone, which is a big headache for me, as I did not buy the data plan. I just have the simple 1000 minutes prepaid plan. Eventually I have to borrow my friend's SIM card with data plan to activate the phone. After the activation is completed, the cell phone works just fine without any problem.Later on I found out HTC is releasing the Android 2.2 upgrade for this cell phone. I was trying every way to download the firmware without any success. The cell phone is not recognized by my computer at all. Finally I contacted the HTC customer service asking for help. They operated my computer remotely with my approval and to my surprise; they helped me upgrade my firmware through the web in 30 minutes. I should have called them long time ago.I'd like to give it 5 stars, but I could only rate it 4 stars. It might not be HTC's fault. I think it probably is Google and T-Mobile's policy to lock this cell phone to Google Gmail account and the T-Mobile data plan. Another marketing strategy to guide the consumer to spend more money I guess, which made this unlocked phone locked in some way. So I could only give it 4 stars.This phone is good. I find no complain about it. You can go online without data plan if you have Wi-Fi spot . You can add memory, replace the battery, take the camera shot, etc. If you are not the one who is following the fashion trend of i-Everything, or addicted of texting all day long, I personally believe this cell phone would serve you years well without any problem. Just one reminder, it might save you a lot of trouble and headache, I learned it a hard way: Call HTC customer service as early as possible to upgrade the firmware.

I am going to throw it in the garbage and buy another phone from a different manufacturer and a different seller. The seller was dishonest in not disclosing that the phone is a reject. If you want to buy it be careful whom you buy it from!This is probably a reflection on the particulare seller I purchased the phone from and not the phone itself because I bought another identical phone from another seller (it came in original HTC box) and that phone works just fineRegarding numerous comments many other reviewers wrote that the phone is locked to Tmobile, this is not entirely true. The phone does come with the Tmobile logo on it and initially tied to TMobile, but the phone can easily be switched to another GSM carrier: You can adjust the settings (there are instructions on how to do it including a videa posted online) or (much easier) you can initiate a connection to Google gmail account through TMobile. After this initial call, the phone becomes totally unlocked. If you are not currently a TMObile customer, you can probably borrow a TMobile SIM card from a friend for few minutes to initiate the first call, and then return the SIM card.In Summary, the phone is fine if you buy it from an honest seller who will send you a brand new phone in its original HTC packaging and not a reject in a generic white unmarked box!", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed!", "Author": "thecomputerguy06 \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R3KUUKZ8HOJQFP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I've been a computer technician for 13 years and I was super reluctant to get a smart phone.

I Replaced this MyTouch 3G Phone 3 times for various failures. I won't go into details about the T-Mobile service and dealing with their customer service regarding this phone in particular. Let's just say my contract is 1 month from being up and I am leaving T-Mobile forever.First of all the 100mb of actual phone memory is ridiculous. You can only install about 10 apps at any given time.  Irregardless of the size of your memory card inserted into the phone (I have an 8GB mini SD card installed).  Yes you can move your apps to your SD Card However if you want to actually use them, they must be moved to your phone's memory. It's extremely easy to overload your phone's memory with apps as most average apps are between 3-10mbs.  In fact the MyTouch 3G comes pre-installed with google Maps which takes up just over 10mbs only by itself.Secondly, when using any streaming apps (Pandora, Netflix, etc.) the phone heats up EXTREMELY FAST (in a matter of minutes) and stays hot throughout use.  Which brings me to my next point.When streaming, if you receive any type of notifications (email, text, phonecall, etc.) the program(s) you are using crash due to the limited processing speed. You will then need to restart the app and occasionally restart/reboot the phone due to the app freezing up. Needless to say this phone has an EXTREMELY difficult time mutlitasking programs. The processing speed makes the netflix app absolutely completely unwatchable as the video and audio are several minutes apart.Physically - when dropped (from waist level) the phone separates into pieces. The backplate is thrown from the device and the battery is ejected.  Luckily the only saving feature is that this phone tends to keep the mini SD card in its slot. (The G1/G2 when dropped would literally eject the mini SD card.  If the G1/G2 phone were dropped at night in a parking lot you might have to return and hope your Mini SD card was still in the parking lot).Back to my review, the sliding function of the phone is precarious at best 1 of my 3 phones, the spring broke and the face would no longer slide/lock back and forth.  The glass on the face of the phone is extremely fragile. The second MyTouch 3G, when dropped the glass cracked in a spiderweb fashion with only the plastic screen cover keeping the glass pieces together. The keyboard backlight function is intermittent, often going dark in the middle of typing a text message, this is a complete malfunction especially in a darkened exterior.  The fragility of the keyboard itself is also a detracting point as several keys stopped working.Lastly the battery life of this phone is one of the worst I have experienced with an android device. At best the battery life is about 10 hrs (of Non-Phone use).  If the phone is in constant use, the battery life drops to about 3-4 hours maximum. If streaming battery life is closer to 1/2 to 1hr maximum.I am currently using my 3rd MyTouch Device. The coverage service, the customer service, and the phone in general are an overall headache. I would Never recommend this phone to anyone, Ever. I will be excited to be rid of this brick!Incidentally when confronted with these problems, T-Mobile customer service ENTIRE response and or resolution to these problems are \"I'm Sorry\".", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "new phone", "Author": "hjf12", "ReviewID": "R1GS83H909BK9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was easy to program.
