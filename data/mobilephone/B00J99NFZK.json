{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best smartphone of 2014 - yet!", "Author": "sank2010", "ReviewID": "R1M1HYJW6S1R6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually go through 5-6 android phones every year and end up with three of them. Here is a tiny list of my favorite android phones from last few years2013:  i) Sony Xperia Z1 (Camera, performance) ii) LG G2 iii) HTC One (m7)2012:  i) HTC One X (that wonderful screen)  ii)Sony Xperia T iii)  Samsung Galaxy S32011:  i) Samsung Galaxy S2 (Excellent screen, performance) ii) HTC Sensation iii) Sony Xperia Arc S2010:  i) HTC Desire ii) Motorola Droid X  iii) Sony Xperia X10(Nexus 5 would have been on my 2013 list if there was no G2)Anyways, back to 2014, I own z2, m8, and s5. I'll keep two of them and will be looking forward to upcoming devices.By the way, mine is a d6503 unlocked model and it supports ATT & Tmobile LTE.So why do I think z2 is better than m8 and s5?Screen: It's a tie between z2 and m8. Both are IPS RGB displays and can produce excellent natural colors. s5 uses an improved amoled screen which is also wonderful but still it's just not as realistic looking as z2 and m8 and I say that after trying its cinema and other modes. I'd also take an RGB amoled over its pentile amoled screen to get a bit more sharpness while reading text-heavy websites.Performance: z2 and m8 are powered by 2.3 GHZ 801 processor and s5 comes with an 2.5 GHz 801 processor. However, s5's UI/bloatware combo is the most cluttered one and fails to take advantage of the faster processor and GPU. z2 has the cleanest UI and m8 is also heavily customized, but that doesn't bog down its sense UI. HTC certainly did a wonderful job with their UI.z2 comes with 3GB ram compared to 2GB ram on the other two and is the best performer in multitasking thanks to the light UI and biggest memory.Audio: m8 shines with its excellent stereo speakers. z2 is very close behind with its own stereo speakers. s5's mono speaker is just average. Besides, z2 is the only one that comes with built-in noise cancelling feature, which would be appreciated by any audiophile. Mine came with an Sony MDR-NC31EM noise-cancelling headset and it is easily the best OEM headset I have ever used on any android phone.Camera: z2 wins here by a long shot. I'm very disappointed at the low-light shots from s5. s4 was very bad in this respect and samsung simply didn't improve the camera by a good margin. My last year's z1 takes much better night shots than s5. m8 also takes excellent night shots but falls behind in daylight shots. s5 takes good daylight shots but z2 produces more realistic daylight images. If you don't mind a little unrealistic fancy colors, you may be happy with s5 camera. It's an entirely different story at night though as s5 simply can't produce decent images at night and I took 90% of my pictures in low light situations at clubs, pubs, and indoor parties.Battery life: z2 wins here by a slight margin with its bigger 3200 mAh battery. s5 and m8 also have excellent battery life. However, none of these can keep me running for two full days. I finish my days with ~30% battey life on z2 and ~20% on my m8 & s5.Design: m8 and z2 both win by a very big margin. s5 design is just bland.So if you're looking for the most balanced 2014 phone, z2 should be at the top of your list. M8 is also an excellent choice. And I'll be looking forward to LG G3 and Nexus 6 for my third 2014 phone.Cheers.(By the way, I don't understand why some folks have negatively rated this phone just because of its gray market ~$1000 price tag. Mine is an import and they cost a lot as phones are not cheap in Europe and Asia. Sony is going to release an unlocked version of z2 in the US for around $650 (as was the case with unlocked z1)  which is essentially the same as the no-contract price of other flagships in the US market)", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Brillantly Designed Phone - Many Features - Georgous Appearance", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RMQCMX1LB1HIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the phone today. I've used the Sony Xperia Z, so I could approach the Z2 with some familiarity. The display is big, bright and provides a feeling of naturalness and depth. The sound is gorgeous for a cell phone. I'm listening to Jennifer Koh play a Bach violin partita and it's as if she were in the room. For a brief time I owned an HTC One, and its touted \"Beats audio\" sound may have been good for listening to pop or rock, but it could never compare to the Z2 in reproducing sounds as complex and nuanced as a fine violin, a true soprano's (or baritone's) voice, or a string quartet. The iPhone 5s is positively tinny in comparison.It is a phone, after all, and call quality is terrific. I had no problem at all setting up Bluetooth phoning in my car, or in Bluetoothing to other devices (e.g., a Bose speaker) and a kanex keyboard). Texting with images works well (get the automatic downloaded APN settings for your carrier -- mine was AT&T;), and e-mail is fast and easy to read.This is an unlocked phone so it comes with virtually no bloatware. Since I backed-up my previous Android to google, all my music, videos, contacts and whatever were loaded automatically onto the phone. It took very little time to set it up with music, videos and photos loaded. I use a Sony 64 Gig SD card so total useable storage on the phone is about 75 Gig, more than an iPhone that costs a similar $850.It came preloaded with a version of MS Office, but I was able to download MS Office 365 for free and to connect to Onedrive. Using Word, I actually performed real work editing a book I'm finishing.Battery life seems more than adequate and with an SD card slot data storage is limited only by the number of cards you have. It is waterproof, and to protect it from the elements there are hatches over all the entry points -- data card, micro USB port, SIM port, etc. Only the earphone jack is uncovered and as understand it, that fact doesn't affect the waterproofing at all. Leave a hatch open and the phone will let you know on start-up. In lieu of closing and opening hatches I bought a Sony magnetic charger and I'm using Airdroid to load files onto the SD card.Photographs are utterly brilliant, with natural coloring and very fine detail, better detail than I saw on a friend's Nokia, which claimed a 40 megapixel image.I like the phone very much and have nothing negative to say about it at this point.I ordered the phone from \"Heavy Duty\" in Evanston, Ill. I got it in two days. The service was unbelievably rapid and responsive.One last thing, it does receive LTE on AT&T; service.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Getting closer to perfection", "Author": "Tor Slettnes", "ReviewID": "R1J3733LFUGF0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm extremely picky when it comes to smartphones.  Or rather, never quite satisfied with what's out there.  I now have, in more or less active use:** This phone: The Sony Xperia Z2 (as of 2 weeks ago)** The HTC One (m7) (since May 2013)** The Nokia 808 PureView (since June 2012)I've also bought and since returned (mainly due to ho-hum camera performance):** A HTC One (m8) (which IMO should be named \"HTC Duo\")** A Sony Xperia ZL, an Xperia T, and an Xperia ionThe main thing I'm looking for is a good camera - but with the constraint that I must also be able to \"tolerate\" the phone as a whole.  (Hence no iPhone, no Windows phone, and no Samsung, though my wife has a Galaxy Note II and a Galaxy Mega 6.3).  To that end, I've been trying really, really hard to \"tolerate\" my 808 PureView for as long as possible, and then tolerate it even some more -- the camera is simply that good!I was then really thrilled to see that the Xperia Z2 became the first phone to beat the 808 PV overall in the DxOMark mobile ratings!  Meaning: It was \"objectively\" measured and classified as the world's best camera in a phone.  I'd had short-lived but good experiences with Sony's Android flavor from the prior Xperia's, and with Sony Ericsson's phones overall since well before that.  So this should be good!So let's just dive into that bit first.======Camera======Among my three phones, the HTC One and the Nokia 808 PureView are two extremes; the Xperia Z2 is somewhere in the middle.Compared to the HTC One (m7):** The Z2 has 5X as many pixels (20.7 vs 4 MP).  However I find that the Z2 also has  a lot more noise/digitizing artifacts at the pixel level, and tends to oversharpen images a bit too much.  The result is that there is not really much more detail - if any at all - in the Z2's pictures than those of the HTC one.** Consequently, the Z2 produces - even proportionally - larger filesizes.  An 8MP image captured in the Z2's \"Superior Auto\" mode usually comes out at ~4MB, vs a 4MP image from the HTC One at ~1MB; a size:pixel ratio of 2:1.  (This is largely because random noise does not compress as well as \"cleaner\" surfaces).** The Z2 has better color reproduction.  The HTC One's colors come out a bit too warm,  often with a yellow tint, and with less lighting also a bit dull sometimes.  Also it is very prone to whiteouts - especially around bright spots in an otherwise dark scene (e.g. streetlights).  The Z2 color and color depth are excellent, and whiteouts are controlled.** The Z2 is also less prone to overexposure than the HTC One; this is maybe the biggest bane of the latter.  (Aside from the marketing hype surrounding megapixels, and the HTC One's lack thereof).** The Z2 tends to get more \"blurry\" pictures.  In fact, the HTC One is perhaps the most \"blur free\" of all smartphone cameras.  There are several reasons for this:-- The HTC One has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) hardware, while the Z2 relies on less effective Digital (software-based) Image Stabilization.-- The HTC One's exposure times tend to be shorter than the Z2's.  Even thought both phones have a wide (f/2.0) aperture, the HTC One has bigger pixel sizes and so is more light sensitive.  That allows slightly higher ISO values and comparatively shorter exposures.-- The HTC One's unique \"Zoe\" mode, which lets you capture 30 pictures in a quick 3-second succession (essentially a full-resolution 3 second movie), and then pick out the best picture - or even the best parts of a combination of several pictures.  (The Z2 also has a \"Burst\" mode, but it is not very practical to use)** The Z2 tends to have a slightly longer autofocus delay before snapping a picture. OTOH, it also has a physical shutter key, which allows you to half-press to focus beforehand.Compared with the Nokia 808 PureView:** The Z2 has a slightly less insane native pixel resolution:-- 20.7MP vs 38MP in in 4:3 aspect ratio-- 16MP vs. 34MP in 16:9 aspect ratio  ... but also a smaller sensor (1/2.3\" vs 1/1.2\").** Both phones do oversampling in their default shooting modes though, bringing down the pixel counts to 8MP (Z2) and 5MP (808) and thus allowing for some level of \"lossless\" zoom -- moreso in the 808.** Pictures from the Z2 are MUCH noisier. They appear oversharpened with with many artifacts and \"blotches\" at the pixel level, while images from the 808 are VERY clean (in good light at least).** File sizes are MUCH larger on the Z2.  An 8MP (3840x2160) image captured with the Z2's \"Superior Auto\" mode runs at ~4MB on average, while the exact same resolution image from the 808 PureView runs at ~1MB. The cause is even more evident here: The 808 images are both cleaner and preserve more detail, yet consume only 1/4 as much storage space per pixel.** Both cameras have accurate color reproduction and relatively controlled levels of blooming/whiteouts.  Colors in the Z2's images are slightly more saturated by default.** The Z2 has slightly faster shutter action and autofocus - and much less \"hunting\" (especially in video mode; this was in fact is the main reason the 808 finally lost out in the DxOMark tests).** I haven't had it long enough to get a good sense of exposure times compared to the 808, but they appear slightly shorter so far.  (The Z2's \"Superior Auto\" mode makes decisions based on the scene, so this makes it a bit harder to compare side-by-side).  The Z2 certainly has wider aperture (f/2.0 vs f/2.4).** The Z2 has \"better\" macro performance, meaning you can get closer to the subject than with the 808 and its larger sensor.  (The PureView zoom largely makes up for this however).** The Z2 offers a \"burst\" mode to take pictures in a fast sequence.  There are two modes: \"Standard\" and \"High Speed\".  I have not experimented much with these; leaving them on by default causes some unwanted behavior.** The Z2 offers digital image stabilization both for stills and videos, the 808PV only for videos (and not a very good one at that).  This was another detractor for the 808 in the DxOMark tests.** Android phones in general don't work well with the Mac, and require special software to import photos into iPhoto.  Sony's \"Bridge\" software for the Mac is nearly unusable - it consumes 100% CPU for long periods of time. You also cannot sync with Bittorrent Sync in Android 4.4 (unless you have a rooted phone).  Therefore the \"path of least resistance\" is often to import photos via \"the cloud\" (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar).  Very hokey and not very good if you're concerned about Big Brother.  I tend to use Android File Transfer to manually copy pictures from the phone into a temporary folder on my Mac, then import to iPhoto from there.The Nokia 808, in contrast, appears as a camera on the Mac; you can import photos directly.=====Audio=====The built-in speakers are GREAT.  IMO they even dethrone the ever-so-famous ones in the HTC One - you can get even louder without any detectable distortion.But the main reason I waited for this phone rather than getting the now-much-cheaper Z1 is that it features built-in noise cancellation via the included headset!  This works wonders when on a noisy train (which I am 10x/week) - you can even have relaxed phone conversations in that environment!The headset has dual mics by your ears, which seems a bit counterintuitive - but I've been pleasantly surprised at how easily the other party hears me even in noisy surroundings.  Sony clearly know what they're doing here.========Hardware========It is a BIG phone - moreso than the (5.2\") screen size would dictate. You've heard this before, but because of the square edges, it feels even bigger in your hand.  It's also not the most ergonomic phone to hold - e.g. when reading an eBook in bed at night.Its \u00b5USB charging port is behind flaps, so unless you want to deal with that several times per day you'll use the included charging dock that hooks up to the magnetic port on its side.  THEN the problem is that you cannot use a case!  Or rather, a case that exists today.  (The charging dock comes with two `grips' for the phone, one is slightly wider to allow for a case, but not wide enough to allow for a case that exists TODAY).It takes a 128GB card - once larger sizes are available there is nothing physically that would prevent those from being supported as well. (Unlike the 32GB -> 64GB barrier).I'm almost 79% certain I'll keep this phone (it's a great phone overall), so I've ended up also purchasing a matching Sony XSP-N1BT car stereo from Crutchfield - it should arrive this week.  This allows the phone to be \"docked\" in front and be used as the control panel for the stereo itself - and it includes the magnetic charging connector for the Z1/Z2.  In fact it works great with ANY Android or iOS phone that way - but is uniquely suited to the Z1/Z2 due to this charging connector.Your other option for your car would be to wait for a Brodit/ProClipUSA dock specific to this model - like that for the Z1, this should include a magnetic charging connector once released.(You could of course also use one of their universal docks, but would then have to use a standard \u00b5USB charging cable and deal with the flaps).========Software========Sony's Android UI is clean and - like the phone itself - elegant.  Of course, being extremely picky, I still have a couple of things to point out (where the HTC One does better):** There is no single row (e.g. 1x4) calendar widget available on the phone.  There is a 2x4 one that (a) will occupy 1/2 of an available home screen, and (b) looks kind of clunky.  I've installed a 3rd party one (\"Simple Calendar Widget Pro\"), which looks elegant but which doesn't always take you to the correct calendar entry when you tap it.** If you have multiple mail accounts (aside from Gmail), note that there is no icon or icon-like widget to take you straight to a given mailbox (with just an unread mail count).  Instead, the default Mail icon shows you the TOTAL number of unread mails across all accounts, and to read mail from a specific account you'll have to open then reader, THEN from the pull-down menu select the account you want to open.  (I seem to remember such icons were available in earlier Xperia's, they are certainly available as \"shortcuts\" on the HTC One).** I've grown to love HTC's BlinkFeed (now that it's optional, I actually WANT it). There is no real equivalent on the Z2 (Socialife falls a bit short). Maybe I'll try Flipboard, though I don't like registering for every single thing...** The built-in keyboard is better than HTC's, but I still prefer Swype.** Every new version of Android gets a little bit more annoying w.r.t. balance between security (increased) vs usability (decreased).  Some of this can be \"fixed\" by rooting the phone.  Rooting the Z2 is possible, but currently involves unlocking the boot loader, which in turn means permanently destroying some DRM keys that are installed on the phone.  Some Sony services (I gather, Sony Entertainment Network purchases or similar) would then become unavailable. Maybe not a biggie for most, but I'll wait a bit to see if someone comes up with a non-destructive way to get root.** I got the Taiwanese flavor of this phone, which comes with a couple of localized (Chinese) software applications that are impossible to uninstall.  If you have the patience, wait for Sony's official release in the US.  (Or else reflash with US firmware once available).** Unlike stock/unlocked firmware from Nokia or HTC, this phone does NOT automatically configure mobile network settings based on your SIM card.-- If you're on AT&T;, in order to get internet access over 3G/4G, you need to go into: Settings -> Wireless & networks -> Internet Settings -> ATT.-- If you're on T-Mobile, you need to manually add these settings under: Settings -> Wireless & networks -> Mobile Networks -> Access Point Names.  (You can probably look these settings up online).** Also 4G/LTE is not enabled by default, this has do be done in: Settings -> Wireless & networks -> Mobile Networks -> Network Mode==============Practicalities==============This is not a Same-sung; this is the kind of phone that you'll either love or hate.And as my rating indicates, I'm (mostly) in the love-it camp.It is big and very square, so it will definitely get noticed.  So will its fingerprint-laced surface - both front and back!  This should be reason enough to get some anti-glare screen protectors.  (Clarivue has ones for both sides of the phone).It is of course waterproof, which also means that there are some compromises in terms of usability.  Aside from the \u00b5USB/\u00b5SIM/\u00b5SD side flaps, there is also very short travel distance in the buttons on the side.  In particular, the volume up/down (which double as zoom in/out) buttons are a bit difficult to press.But those are trivial matters if you consider the bigger picture: You get to own a phone made by the same people that made phones for James Bond!`Nuff said.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony Z2, my impressions", "Author": "Michael from Acura", "ReviewID": "RHWWOLA8L3XKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Two parts to this review. First the seller, second the phone.I bought from FGS Trading, they might of cost $5.00 more but was well worth it, I changed my mind and wanted a different color so I emailed them. They emailed back and told me if the could the would, and still make sure it shipped that day. Well they did, I switched from white to purple, because of some staining issues I found out about during some research done after the fact.Also FGS sold me a phone that had over $80 worth of accessories, the sony magnetic dock, and the noise canceling headphone.  What a great surprise, and well worth the extra $5 i spent.This phone, the Sony Z2 D6503, wow. I am using a nexus 5 as my daily, and have a note 3, and Z Ultra as alternatives.Size - The phone is larger, but coming from the nexus which has squared corners, its very usable. If you don't mind using the nexus 5 you won't mind the Z2.Display - clarity seems the same as the nexus, but better that the note 3, and z ultra. The colors are so much better than the nexus5, and the Z ultra, and not near as artificial as the AMOLED on the note 3.-processing power - even though it has the snapdragon 801 chipset, and the other 3 have the snapdragon 800, it feels about the same, if not a tad slower (the other 3 are all rooted and running stock KitKat) sometimes when I pull down the notification tray and i get a stutter.Camera - I knew what I was getting, a 20.7MP sensor, but it still blew me away, I took photos with all 4 phones, the same photo, the Sony Z2 using superior auto, which yields an 8MP image, the nexus 5, and Z Ultra at 8MP and the note 3 at 13MP. The Sony destroyed them all, better color reproduction, more detail, and less noise, especially when cropped. All images where viewed on a 1080p 27\" monitor. When I set the Z2 to manual and used the full 20.7MP setting I noticed zero improvement over the 8MP sampled pic.Build quality - not quite to the level of my old HTC one M8, or iPhone 5/5s, but very much the same quality of the iPhone 4/4s and HTC one m7.Sound - the front facing speakers are not any louder than the other phones, but the clarity is taken to a whole new level, but defintaly still below the HTC one both m7/m8, but remember these are waterproof. The Sony noise canceling headphones included from FGS Trading (model mdr-nc31e) are amazing, as good as any in ear buds I've ever bought or used in terms of noise canceling, and the sound quality from them is a few levels better than those typically included with phones(looking at you apple)Battery life, both my nexus 5 and Z2 were at 100% at 10am, and right now it is 9pm,  I'm sure I've used the Z2 30% more than the nexus over this time, and the nexus is at 40%, and the Sony at 70%, wow, color me impressed.So far I love this phone, and I have owned the HTC one m7/m8, and the galaxy s3/s4/s5 (the s5 for 10 days, most over rated phone I have used) the Z2 beats the S5 in every way so far as I've experienced, but I didn't use the fingerprint scanner.I hope they make a compact 4.5 inch version that still uses a 1080p screen, because I would buy that for my wife, as she loves this phone too(but uses the iPhone 5s currently)Improvements - shrink the side bezels, the lg g2 did it.  Get rid of the xperia link when you swipe up, as it shares space with google now, but is about 0.00001% as useful.  Why go with the snapdragon 801 AB, and not the AC. I know its only 0.2ghz difference, but come on Sony why go 99% when making a flagship.  Why have this amazing camera but not offer a duel led \"true tone\" style flash like my HTC one M8, or wife's 5s, and flagship, with best camera ever on a android device, why go 99%", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Adrian Colic", "ReviewID": "R2DDMU3L1DSMLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best Xperia yet, a lot better than anything they have made before.You won't regret buying this", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Phone to hit the market.", "Author": "Myles Mathison", "ReviewID": "R3BOBXD20GEOME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Currently as of 4/25/14 this is the best cell phone in the world!
