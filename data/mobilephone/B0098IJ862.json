I loved leaving behind my $120 monthly bill for the same service at $45! But that's where the joy ended. First, I bought a Samsung Precedent. It was bad. Then I got this ZTE Merit. Lord Have Mercy! It is without question, the absolute WORST cell phone I have ever had! No contest! You couldn't give me one!I went back to the Samsung Precedent. In fact, two more of them. But as someone else stated, you can't take the factory apps off, which means you have absolutely NO internal space. Therefore, after a few texts, I'd get \"Text Memory Full.\" Talk about annoying!After 4 different phones within the first 7 months, finally, two weeks ago I left Straight Talk and went to T-Mobile. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Vibrant on Craigslist and life is so much better! Also, I got tired of talking to Straight Talk customer service people who could barely speak English! And it takes forever to get a rep on the line! Be prepared to give up 1-3 hours of your time with a call.As for the telephone service, overall, it was good. It's the ZTE and Samsung Precedent that sucked! So, buy at your own risk.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price.", "Author": "A.

I got mine at dollar general for $80.  Yes, it has some flaws, but all cell phones do.  The only problem we have with the phone is the memory and that is because you cannot take the factory programs off of it...which I think is a problem for most cell phones.  I have only ever owned one phone that I could take anything off I wanted to.  There is no flash for the camera, which sucks.All in all, for the price I paid and the $100 a month I save on cell service I am thrilled with the phone and straight talk!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken after 4 months (10 days after warrenty up)", "Author": "kirbymom", "ReviewID": "R30F4U1NEH2XL9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First my facebook pages would bouce around and click on the wrong things.Then it would not let me unlock it so it would take for ever to unlock cuz the Lock key would bounce around making me mute it. After trying a few minutes it would unlock but the screen would be bouncing around. So I would wait a few minutes then i could use my apps or make calls or take pics. But now after fighting with it for a week the sensors in pad are completely broken I can't unlock it if I leave it it will make clicks and vibrations and unlock it self and open apps on its own, its always doing math with Pie and Square roots and such with if weird cuz I don't see them on the calulator pad.

Went from $182 (1400 min) to $45 monthly, unlimited talk, text, web, thanks to Straight talk.I read the review about Facebook being a problem on this phone.  It is...  DONT USE the FACEBOOK app on this phone it does dominate everything on the phone.  Took over my contacts, program information, etc.....  and took me hours of research to get it off.  I didn't remove the facebook app, just took all the login, sync andshare things off from it.  That is the only flaw I have found with this.  Internet is faster then Iphone 4s, Google has just as many apps, and as manyfree apps as Itunes.  Even found several of the same app games I love on iphone.The input screen is really nice, easy to use.  Display isn't as nice as Iphone but its still pretty good.  There isn't very much usable memory on phone, youhave to use the Mini SD Card (2G included and can be expanded to 32G), which I like.  Iphone only had 8G of which I never filled.  This phone is a decent Iphone replacement especially considering the price difference.  Coverage has been really good here in the Hill Country of Texas where signalsare usually pretty low.  I'm driving home to Texas City, TX tomorrow and we'll see how the coverage goes.I started with a Tracfone LG840G (Straighttalk is a division of Tracfone and uses At&t; towers, among others) and though the coverage on the trip from South Texas toMid Texas was great, the phone lacked many of the features I wanted.  Service plan cost much more then the Straight Talk and didn't offer unlimited anything.  If it were a $20 dollar phone I wouldn't have been disappointed but, at $59 I expected more.The apps didn't work very well, phone was very toy like, internet was horrible.  The only sites available were the ones from the phone.  Display was mediocre , camera was not very good.  Time flew off the phone as it started subtracting; the second you dialed, when phone rang, when you got messages and while you listened to them.  Minutes added up really fast.  Internet attempts used 2x the minutes.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "It came to me missing parts", "Author": "J.

A few months later, I hated the device. It keeps shutting me off of websites such as Facebook or Google saying, \"Force close!\" If I log onto a webpage, most of the time I can't hop to another one. The phone itself erases my icons at times and I have to reset the phone to get them back on. If text messaging is full, you have to delete every single message you have and 95% of the time reset the phone to get the new messages. I am looking to replace it. It does have drop calls due to At&t; towers. I would never recommend this phone.

I bought this phone because I had a Blackberry Storm 2 and I HATED that [hone because it was ALWYAS shutting off but it did last over a year so I guess it was worth it. Anyways, after that I was extremely excited to go back to Straight talk since there $45 plan saves me alot of money. I was also glad to get an android cellphone because it has so many apps. I bought mine at Walmart for $129 but ofcourse it had to go down to $99 as soon as I bought it. The phone fits good in my hand. It you have fat fingers like me it might be alittle hard to text but not that much and if I turn my phone sideways I can text perfect without messing up. The speaker is loud enough and it's easy to dial and it even has an emergancy dialpad which i love incase theres an emergancy my little girls can dial 911 without a problem. The screen is clear. The camera doesnt have flash but it can be adjusted easy from bright to dark with a sidebar. It also doesnt have a forward facing camera. I think it's worth the price. The only thing I HATE bout it is that you can't fit much apps on there at all because there's not much memory. I have a memory card but that doesnt help much because of the memory on the apps have to take up some on the phone. Overall for the price it's a great phone.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "worse phone I have ever owned", "Author": "Rebecca Sleight", "ReviewID": "R13XZUG7539CO2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is lousy.
