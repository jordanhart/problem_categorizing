Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "RIYK27F07S18O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my unlocked HTC Desire for a little over two weeks.  At first, I was thrilled with it because it has such a nice display and Android 2.1 runs so smoothly.  In the last couple of days, though, it has developed an annoying issue and I think all potential buyers should be warned.  Occasionally when placing a call, the screen will go blank and there is no way to end the call or get the display back.  HTC delivered at least my Desire with this flaw - and there are some hits on Google about this.  All you have to do is Google \"HTC Desire screen goes blank\" to see what I mean.  Apparently, the proximity sensor used by HTC does not work correctly all of the time.  What it should do is turn off the screen and disable the buttons when you place the phone to your ear.  The faulty sensor does not turn the screen back on and enable the buttons when you pull the phone away from your ear.  I am hoping the Android 2.2 update will fix this problem, otherwise I am going to return my phone before the 30-day return period expires.** Edited to add **Two things have eliminated this problem today - and I do not know which helped the most.  First, Android 2.2 was offered on the Desire today and I updated it.  Second, one internet post indicated that a clear scratch protector may be causing the problem.  I removed the scratch protector from the screen and the problem has gone away.  I am not comfortable using it with no scratch protector - but I am much happier with the phone.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "ATT data Issues", "Author": "WrldTraveler \"kestrel300\"", "ReviewID": "R6APBTAG7MT9W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone to replace my iPhone 4 on the ATT network and use while traveling with overseas SIM cards. Additionally, I am trying to migrate away from Mobile Me and this looked like a great option.  I really like the phone and the HTC Sense interface is quite nice.  However, this phone does not operate on the correct frequency for the ATT's 3G data network, so all data is transfered via the EDGE network which has slow data speeds.  Unfortunately, I returned the phone.If you want 3G speeds on ATT, make sure the phone operates on 850/1900 3G frequencies for data.  Even tough this phone operates on 850/900/1800/1900 GSM frequencies the data frequencies are 900/2100 which ATT does not support.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing smartphone!", "Author": "Nattensorg", "ReviewID": "R2PMPUIZO4PR6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the HTC Desire for about a month now, and I'm very, very satisfied with it. Purchased in the US to be used in Brasil, it is working wonders with a local service provider SIM.First off, the phone's design is not as groundbreaking as the iPhone - to me the iPhone 4 is the best looking phone so far - but it's not without its qualities. It has a clean and discreet design, and I like it that way.The Android OS with the Sense UI runs very smoothly with the 1 GHz processor built on this phone. The applications run slick, and no problems in multitasking. The screen is very sharp and very bright, the touch control is fast and accurate, pleasant browsing experience and lots of apps to boost your phone from the Android market.Call quality hasnt been an issue yet, no dropped calls so far. Signal reception is good, and call sound is... well, ok for a phone. The music player is very good, although it lacks an equalizer (I dont really miss it though, because music playback quality is good enough without EQ when using a better pair of headphones than the standard - I'm using the Klipsch Image S4).I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to steer clear of the control freaks at Apple, without any sacrifices (look for the reviews around the web, some sites rate the HTC Desire higher than the iPhone 4, and that means something).", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "The big freezer", "Author": "Jens-Brazil", "ReviewID": "R3QBMEFUCTRX6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got the international unlocked GSM model with waranty to use it all over the world!Now I set down in Brazil with a phone that freezes after 5 mins. of use.

Walker", "ReviewID": "R1HCJMXVX36UU3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The HTC Desire is a great phone, when it works. I ordered this phone from FGS Trading so that I could have it as i travel overseas (I was recently deployed to Middle East with the military). The only thing is, I am one of the hundreds of folks who got an HTC Desire with the bad motherboard that makes the phone do random reboots (Google it for HTC Desire). If I talk on the phone for more than a few minutes, \"reboot\". If I use the internet for more than a few minutes, \"reboot\". If I use the GPS even for one second, \"reboot\".Of course, I tried factory resets. I tried anything I could try using the HTC Forums. I discovered that there were many others like me who were experiencing the random reboots, and the ugliest part of the problem is that the phone doesn't reboot once and start back up... it continues in an endless reboot cycle until I'd have to open up the phone a take the battery out. While I was in the Middle East, I couldn't readily take it in for a repair. I had to wait to get back to the States. In December, I tried contacting FGS for help, and I got this response by email:****************I am sorry to hear this. This is the first i hear about the random reboot problem, but HTC would be the best bet to support the device at this point. If it's a motherboard problem, a warranty replacement would be best (if it was a software issue, a firmware upgrade would help, but it sounds like all the other people you checked with point to the motherboard).Please let us know if HTC was able to assistHappy holidays, and stay safe!****************Yeah, Happy Holidays... Well, HTC said that they couldn't help me, and not being able to do much from my deployed location, I got my sister to send me a Nexus S (which I love). Now that I'm back in the U.S., I have been trying to get HTC, FGS, and anyone else to help me, but to no avail. Here's what I get from FGS:***************HelloThere is not much we can do at this point, since we are not the end user. HTC does not offer warranty support for resellers, they usually ask resellers to accept returns during the first 14 days, and then after that end users are asked to contact them directlyEmma***************I tried calling HTC in the UK and Germany, and from them, I found out the the phone's IMEI is from Vodafone. So now I've been calling Europe to Vodafone Customer Service, and I keep getting passed off to different folks who give me the runaround. I'm at the end of my rope. I'm now going to have to send it to a friend in London who can try to take it to a Vodafone store for me and see if I can get some help. Now, after paying over $450 for a phone, is that the customer support I am entitled to?If you think that you may want service for your phone, do not buy from FGS Trading.

Not something I should of had to deal with right after taking it out of the box.The most significant problem, however, is lack of a 3G connection and no internet connection when outside a wifi hotspot. The internet simply does not work when connecting through your carrier. Lots of people around the world have this same problem and have found various was of making it work.

I think it is time for a review!I love this phone there is just no other way to say it. I think it is stylish and I couldn't in all honesty live without it anymore.Pros:* Thousands of apps are available o the Android Market. I know you have more on the iPhone but how many apps do you want at any one time? I have more than I need.* My life is finally organized. I use the phone for its intended purpose and use the Google services that can be integrated with it. My Calendar is Google and synchs with my online Calendar. I can then be reminded of birthdays I've forgotten wherever I am. I'm also notified of new emails, and I can respond instantly.* It's very accessible, I can make fonts bigger in apps, zoom in on the browser and with my eyesight, that is essential.* Love the HTC Sense.* Love the fact that when I got bored of HTC Sense I tried other ROMS  and got even MORE customization capabilities.* ...and when I got bored of that I put Sense back on* It's constantly updatable. I feel I have a new phone every few months when I change things around.Cons:* I ran out of space on the phone memory quite often. To solve this I only had the apps I needed and then changed the ROM when I felt I needed more. Of course I then realized I didn't need all those extra apps and moved back to Sense.Why do I love this phone so much?Because I don't feel I need a new phone each year. Because I can change the look easily. I have to say, it feels like a new phone every couple of months. It's fast and does everything I need.

I have an itouch as well, which I really like, but above all this phone has won my approval.I am not sure at this point if the Motorola headsets I am using are problematic or if it is the phone interacting with them, but on occasion with two different headsets I cannot be heard by the other party. I see that the headset has connected to the phone and I can hear the other person fine, but they cannot hear me. The last time this happened I turned the headset off mid-conversation and turned it back on, then it was fine. I probably should read those instructions...;)I have been very pleased with the droid apps and find them comparable or in some cases better than the iphone ones.

Hardware wise I really like the rubber backing, nice and secure grip and not slippery like the plastic or metal most phones have. The metallic brown finish is another plus, looks unique and elegant. Love the HTC clock and weather widget and what to say about Android, just like all Google stuff its simple and intuitive - when using the phone or customizing it everything just makes sense. The phone is extremely responsive when swiping or running apps with no lag, also very good call quality on earpiece but only passable speaker. Screen is very nice, I have the SLCD version and have no complaints. Text is sharp and colors are vibrant. Even though it does not support U.S. 3G I chose the Desire over the Nexus One and Mytouch 4G. I like the Desire's look over the Nexus and MT4G as well as HTC Sense, optical trackpad and slightly updated specs over the Nexus. Funny how the phone is the least used function, Edge is not so bad for browsing but when connected to WiFi on my network it basically turns into a mini tablet for me. Web browsing, checking emails and news, media stuff like youtube, checking up on payments for auctions.. and on top of that its a touchscreen remote for my Squeezebox and desktop. Incredible to say the least.Only two cons with the Desire that most owners have already mentioned - the short battery life and usable memory. Battery life is not horrible but not great either, prob get a full day on moderate use. Memory though is definitely insufficient, only about 140MB of space for apps. Even for a light user like myself it is not enough and Ive ran into the low space warning once or twice. Fortunately the good news is that both these problems can be solved with a little modding (the fun part!), hint: google htc desire root. After a few customizations I am able to install apps to the MicroSD card to save space and get max about 2 days on the battery. Again, the default 1 day battery is not so bad considering the phone is used for so many functions, most smartphones average in that range. But I am happy with the mods that just adds on to an already spectacular phone. Btw I would also recommend the Case-mate Barely There case for the Desire, adds a little more grip and protection but does not affect the size or look (hence the name).

Samsung is great, but HTC has a little more innovation and technical aspects which i like and the HTC Desire is great at it.  I had previously owned a HTC Desire HD, but it fell and the screen cracked after a couple days of use and even after repairing it, i jus didnt want it again, but the phone was superb, great UI, physical feel and jus overall construction.  While searching for a replacement, i came right back to HTC and took a second look at the Desire.  Not only that, but my gf wanted a smartphone as well.  I ordered the first one from WorldwideDistributors through Amazon, with excellent delivery time and an excellent product too.  Moving on the phone now......Pros of HTC Desire.Great size.Sturdy Feel.Hardware Specs are great for the price.Camera is up to par.AMOLED screen is superb.The HTC Sense UI is wonderfully easy to use.Cons of HTC Desire, these are the make or break things for u, trust me.Battery Life is just average abt day and a half max with moderate to heavy use (Samsung Galaxy S i9000 is much much better, but so is the price i guess).Internal memory Sucks, jus over 150mb to store apps (didnt see this as a problem as i rooted mine and can store apps on the sd card).No folder support, u cant make folders in the UI, u have to attach to the computer as a SD card and manually create folders (not very user friendly in that aspect).No more Android support, from what i have read, HTC is only going to release support up to Android 2.2 Froyo so if ur looking for something more up to date software wise, need to get something else..Just being petty i guess, but when in ur pocket, the speaker does not ring loud enough and u may have some missed calls.Overall what sold me on this phone is the price, it was very reasonable for the hardware, even though WW had it a couple dollars extra, u pay for service which is no problem for me.  I bought one for my gf and after seeing how excellent the phone was for me, i ordered a second one jus for me from the same distributor.  If u purchase this phone and u are keen on protection, which ive learnt about since i dropped my Desire HD, there are two cases u can get, the OtterBox Commuter series case (much better than the Defender series by far) or the Case-Mate Tough case, which to me is the best case overall, way better protection.I hope this review has helped u decide if the HTC Desire is right for u, i love it, but its not everyones cup of tea and the main personal judging point is if ur a geek and like to dig in to ur tech go for it, if ur one of those ppl that jus want to buy and use and dont care abt the workings too much, not the best option for u, though it is still an option.Enjoy!!!", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Functionality", "Author": "Christ", "ReviewID": "R20LLTQBSJNJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I bought this phone for the Android Operative System, It already came with the Froyo Update, all the cool features were enabled (Menu navigation, HD Video Recording, etc...) the widgets are just excellent, useful and some of them are for fun, like the Friend Stream, which allows you to have your Facebook/Twitter updates in a single window, another nice widget is the Weather, it locates you where you are, if I move to a different city, it will show the current position and the weather (Data transmission required). The camera is Fantastic, it take excellent pictures and HD Videos with Great quality.The phone itself is not too heavy, very comfortable in your hands and so intuitive to use, the Android OS manage everything in such a fantastic way (Phone alerts, text messages, widgets, visual effect) you really enjoy using the phone, I had some problems setting up the Internet for my Service Provider (I thought I already had active, but no =P)but I finally did it, it works like a charm I am able to access Internet and a very smooth way, use my Mercury Messenger application (Downloaded from Android Market), download music, everything; I really like the way how the phone manage my Emails (Email Widget by HTC), you have the option to see just the headers, a little of the message or the whole message. The \"People\" Application (By HTC) allows you to link your phone contact with their Facebook/Twitter/Flickr account, you can select which picture from the services you want to use as a contact picture, if the contact updates that picture, it will be updated in your phone too, you can see all the contact's updates from the People application to have more specific information about that contact specifically. The phone Works really fast (It has never froze with me) even though I have many applications running in background, remember that the amount of applications you have running at the same time is proportional to the battery consumption, besides of the Social Network applications it also has some business applications, like the PDF viewer and Quick Office.Finally, in my opinion is such a great phone for a young guy with social network addiction, like to a Business man that uses his phone to stay in contact.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "the best", "Author": "Edson", "ReviewID": "R1PWSSWLKMIY1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent.

AMOLED vs SLCD=> No sense to compare. But potential buyers, specially those located outside the US, must be warned of the fact that international version mean that one item will be randomly taken from stock and shipped to you..and its configuration can be to anyplace , japanesse, chinesse, and in my unfortunatelly case, for arabian market. The difference is the preloaded applications through ROM memory. I bought an international version thinking that maybe, the cellphone could come with some spanish apps or otherwise some european apps (like language system, news, etc.). But when I received the apparatus and turned it on, Problems started. First: Only two languages to choose for operating system; English/Arabic. Fortunately I understand some english and said 'its ok but wish i have found spanish option'. Second: Found some muslim apps, at ROM level and it means that I cannot remove it, Specially one irritating program which reminds the muslim pray time by \"singing\" a chorus and there were no way to make it to stop neither by forcing it to stop through settings. It made me to be on the verge of flashing the OS. Fortunatelly, and looking through the Web I found the way to make a soft reset and now the program is still there but inactive. Third: Apps related with weather, time and world clock had preloaded arabic cities. In this case it was relatively easy to remove and change cities. Finally, I found some additional apps to compose with spanish dictionary. Finally today I'm fine with the device but after one week of thoroughly visit forums, setting it, etc.I suggest that everybody interested in one of this device, just buy domestic version. After all, I'm sure that ironically, it comes with spanish language option and whatever apps it brings, it always will be closer for europe and latinamerica than this \"International version\".", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amamzing phone", "Author": "Neeraj", "ReviewID": "R335RNKD7H72QR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love my new phone so much.
