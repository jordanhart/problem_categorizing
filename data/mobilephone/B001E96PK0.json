{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Treo - continuation of excellence", "Author": "Chris P. Kunicki \"ck\"", "ReviewID": "R1K124DWTYR2BK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new Treo Pro. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and already plan to hold on to it for the long haul. Little, history, I have had the Origional Treo, 200, 600,  and 650. This is the best of them all.  I swtiched two windows mobile 2 years ago because... well the PALM OS is dead in my book. That aside, I really missed the treo. I think palm gets how to build a nice device.Keyboard: Works great. I find for a thumb keyboard and now with some experience I can fly with it. Personally, I love the thumb keyboard. Perfect for one handed operation with little compromise.Thin: This thing fits very nicely into the pocket and the screen guard is excellent. I dont even know I have it with me and I never accidently Dial anyone. It fits in the hand wonderfully.Buttons.. Some devices are going away from having so many buttons. However I like the ability to launch frequent programs. The Pro is great at letting you customize. (You have many hardware buttons and some of them can also be configured to have an Option + Hardware button application bound to them)Also, you have hardware button access to volume control and wifi.GPS: Works great. I installed and worked right away.Power: this device is not a power pig. With normal use I get a good run off it. Mind you, I use applications on it all day along and SMS extensively.Camera: I havent used it. Frankly, it doesnt matter how many mega pixels any phone has, it still just a phone camera. Quality is never that good. But it is good enough for those fun quick shots.Dislikes: well, the screen is a standard windows mobile device screen. I was hoping for a new device, especially manufactured by HTC it would have a bit more kick to it. However, its very functional and does what I want. One thing I love is how they built into the keyboard access to the brightness control. This is something all devices should have. Its really hard to increase the brightness if you can read the screen. No problem with the treo.The ALT key on the keyboard allows you to access characters not on the keyboard, including accented letters for various languages. What I dont like is that its a little window that shows up with about 8 characters show and you scroll to see more. Well there are a lot of characters, it would be better if they just filled the screen so you can quickly find the special character you want.Windows Mobile Phone Dialer stinks! This is true in my opinion for any windows mobile device. Its a phone, but you have to navigate often 2 to 3 screens deep just to get a phone number. For example, you start typing someones name and the dialer appears. It instantly starts searching for a name. Great! When you select a name by pressing enter, it pulls up their contact screen. (HUH???) yes, you now get to see more info about them. I just want to DIAL the phone number.  Long story short, for simple dialing its more complicated than it needs to be. Second, the Windows Mobile phone dialer always seems unresponsive and slow. Its a phone... but the phone is slow. it makes no sense. This is not a critisim against the treo, but if this your first Windows Mobile device you will be a bit disappointed with this.My Final gripe is that it uses the Micro USB Cable. I dont know why. All I can say is that about 90% of my small electronic gizmos use Mini usb and now I have a new cable standard to deal with. I am sure there is some value to it, but I dont see it. Yes, the connector is smaller, but the cable is still just as thick and just as long. So why I need a thinner (by maybe a few hair widths) I dont know.If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Bane", "ReviewID": "R1QDEL24SQQCCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using windows mobile phones for the last four years, for work related purposes. When my HTC Excalibur flaked out on me last month, I checked around and waited for this to come out. I've been using it for a few days, but so far I'm extremely happy with the experience.The touchscreen/thumb keyboard combo with no sliding bits or bulky moving parts was the selling point for me. I use email and IM on my phones constantly, it's important that it works and is usable. I'm happy to report that this phone does it well. The built in GPS works (ships with Google Maps loaded, but I generally prefer the Live Search application for Windows Mobile). The touch screen generally improves over the basic smartphone experience, as being able to click a link with the stylus is much nicer than navigating with buttons.As speed and memory goes, so far they've been ample, and it's noticeably snappier than other devices I've used recently. I'm planning to use a MicroSD card to get a bit more space, but I do that with every phone. The camera is decent, but nothing spectacular. I do like the camera software on this phone better than the software on the HTC phones.Very minor features I do like:- Time on screen when the backlight is off.- Hardware switch to silent mode- My Treo link to mobile-friendly information about the device in the start menu- And of course, comes GSM unlocked. No carriers loading or unloading software before you get the device, things work like a charm out of the box.Very minor annoyances:- Everything else uses mini USB to charge, it would have been nice if Palm did too. This uses a proprietary end on a USB cable.- It's glossy, and black, but also very smooth. At times feels very slippery, and opening the case to get to the battery can be a pain.- Camera button is not as responsive as I'd like for starting the camera app. Seems fine for taking pictures.Overall, very high marks :)", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, not a Winmo fan though", "Author": "Eimy A.

The wifi is fast, the design is great, many people complain about the small keyboard, but I find it perfect, maybe my nails and slim fingers help, but I really have no complaints, it is a phone not a keyboard after all.Windows mobile on the other hand, has it`s advantages but in my opinion is way too slow, I`m an engineer used to speed and efficiency and I really miss the fast performance of Palm OS, besides, it takes to many steps to do something you could easily perform in a couple of clicks before.It's taking my mind more time to create the habits to perform basic activities, since they take so many steps, to send a message used to take me 30 seconds, and now 60 or 90, I know 30 seconds may not be much, but it is double what it used to take me, and frankly to much for me.It has given me some small glitches like no rings for a couple of hours, and I have to soft reset it to get the sound back, but nothing major or frequent.If you get the SPB mobile shell software you will miss the palm os less, and get more productivity, this program is definitely a must.I strongly recommend to see the reviews in treonauts to choose software and freeware such as skype, skyfire, opera, etc to enhance the experience.I'm happy with the phone, but I surely wish it was a new version of palm os instead of Winmo.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Treo Pro surprisingly impressive", "Author": "doctj", "ReviewID": "R3ED2G16WQM21O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this treo after my phone and PDA died almost simultaneously. I had avoided a treo mainly due to the smaller screen compared to my Palm Tungsten but needed a device with a keyboard and wasn't interested in RIM products.  I initially bought an iPhone but gave it to my wife due to  1. Poor phone functionality 2. Crippled sms (message forwarding, MMS, file attachment; Apple?) , crippled Bluetooth and lack of a hard keyboard.  I was initially wary of buying  a windows mobile device due to prior poor experience with pocket pc software. I have been pleasantly surprised by this device.1. Speed-very fast overall, the only slowdowns I experience is with notes for some reason. I've accumulated 100's of them over the yrs but this is no excuse as my 7 yr old palm could speed through them2. Call quality is crystal clear much better than the iPhone's in my area.3. Bluetooth-this phone is compatible with Audi's car kit and the voice quality is stellar. Palm's site states it does not download contacts to the car but it did download some of them in my case. All the BT protocols of a 21st century device are supported unlike the iPhone's 20th century implementation.4. \"Proper\" GPs-not that iphone wannabe gps. Quick signal locks and 1 month free trial of TeleNav turn-by-turn is nice. I've heard TomTom's software works pretty well with this device.5.Battery life is so so, with email downloading in the background it will last about 2 business days. With a lot of websurfing it will barely last the day. I would say it's better than the iphone, not by much though.6. Touchscreen-finger friendly, I only use my stylus to write ink notes or use Epocrates.WM 6.1 although it looks ugly compared to the iPhone OS, is a true multitasking OS, actually feels like a portable computer. I can wait for a satellite lock loading, go to another program and return  back to the GPS as it finishes.7. Form factor- love the size,  overall dimensions are nice and its quite thin, great job on the design. Keyboard key material is fine for me a Treo newbie.Overall this phone is a keeper, the combination of hard keyboard and touchscreen is great, while the addition of some apps (SPB, skyfire, kinomaplay to name a few) make it a truly superb device.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "My Palm Pro..", "Author": "Mister CHO", "ReviewID": "R28PF0KLZHER9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "after several weeks of researching, comparing, & then waiting for its release, i was very pleased to purchase the Palm Treo Pro. this was my first smartphone & i wanted something that fit well in my hand & also had a lot of practical features. i think that i got both in the Palm Treo Pro.design: it's design is very (dare i say it) fashion forward. unlike previous Treo's, its got a much slimmer profile & fits very well in either a pants or shirt pocket. i like the qwerty keyboard & the directional \"palm\" key works really well for moving from one field to another. i also really like that i can use the keyboard, the stylus, or even my fingertips to use the different programs & features of the device.setup: the setup process was actually not bad at all. once i inserted my SIM card, the phone recognized the settings of my current service provider & integrated all of the network settings seamlessly w/o any issues. it comes with a decent amount of memory on the phone when you purchase it & can be upgraded to as much as 32GB of memory using micro SD.i have found only one issue thus far. after using the device for around 3 wks i'v already broken a stylus. the styli are mostly metal with a plastic head & tip. the connection between the plastic head & metal stylus is the only thing i would suggest Palm redesigns.  otherwise, i LOVE the device..", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "With a big \"BUT\"", "Author": "C. Turner", "ReviewID": "RHHFO91AZXA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For this Treo veteran -- dating back to when it was still Handspring -- the Treo Pro is good and bad news.Good: Slick, elegant, light, compact, great touchscreen, every bell and whistle modern smartphones should have. Keyboard smaller than previous Treos, but still easy for my large fingers to use. Retains the unique Palm switch to silence ringtones. (I find it a mystery why other cellphones ignore this simple convenience. Of course, switches have only been around since electricity was invented, so they may not have noticed yet). A nit to pick: The stylus has inexplicably moved to the lower-right corner, where it's hard to see and remove. Really stupid. Fortunately, with the good touchscreen, it's not needed much.Bad: Windows Mobile 6.1 is a shock. \"Microsoft Modern\" -- clumsy, slow, layers and layers of menus, confusing, inscrutable, given to freezes, crashes. Worse than even Blackberry, which is compatible only with itself and almost as clumsy as Windows. Unfortunately, these two are currently the only choices. (Did I mention that I don't care for either?)But Help Is On The Way! Spb Mobile Shell 2.1 is a software user interface that's what Palm would be had they continued the creative energy that produced its original operating system. Mobile Shell is astoundingly capable, flexible, and fun. (Did I mention that I love it?) A 15-day trial of Mobile Shell can be downloaded at handango.com. Purchase is $[...]. This is the greatest value for the dollar since sliced bread. For those who haven't visited handango, they've got lots of other cool Treo software.Summary: The Treo Pro with Spb Mobile Shell 2.1 is a 5-star almost-ideal-smartphone.

Green", "ReviewID": "R31CL1AQXDFVT7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was switched from a Blackberry to the Palm Treo Pro by my organization, so I'm a pretty captive audience.  Two weeks in, I'm on my third one (replaced twice).  The inconsistency in quality is very frustrating.  I suspect that many of the issues are Windows Mobile, but I have to rate the entire package - they don't offer it with anything else.Pros:- Form factor is nice.- WiFi works well (but drains battery).Cons:- Battery life - will not last longer than a day if you do anything with the phone.- Quality - As I said, I'm on my third one.  Different problems each time.- Finish - shiny black should look cool, but it picks up fingerprints, dirt, etc and looks like you ate lunch off of it after 15 minutes.  (can't blame this just on me - 50 other people using this model have the same result).  I purchased a case that reduced this.- Windows Mobile - It is beyond me that this still is still being released as a phone os.  I used it 4 years ago and it was very painful.  I mistakenly hoped that 4 years of customer feedback and testing would have improved it.  Nothing has changed!- Now power off or soft reset - I have to remove my batter once a day to reset the phone back to working condition.Annoyances:When you're on a call the \"text message\", \"missed call\" and \"voice mail\" notifications go off at full volume in your ear.  Ouch.Windows Mobile \"ok\" key is sometimes \"ok\" and sometimes \"cancel\" and sometimes \"save\" and it's not really obvious.You cannot reprogram many of the external buttons by default (I'm not sure if a third party app will do it).  Other windows mobile phones have a key for voice dialing, or allow you to hold down the Send key to activate it.  This one has not such key, and you can't program the Send+Hold, or the Camera or the WiFi keys, so no obvious solution there.History:The first phone I got wouldn't hang up.  Not with the End button, not with the soft button, nothing!  I had to take out the battery to hang up.The second one started \"losing\" contacts randomly, even though the Phone History would still have information showing.  Eventually the phone froze up.  After removing the battery, the phone radio was out, so I could no longer place calls.  (I couldn't open Contacts or other things).  Could be windows mobile memory corruption. I had to remove my Blackberry battery twice in two years.  I've done it 18 times with this phone in two weeks.  And even that won't fix the problems.The third phone I now have is having random software issues.  Setting will not stay and it will not allow me to install any software.  It says things install (simple things like a ebook reader), but they don't show up (but memory has been taken up).Boy, oh boy... I miss the Blackberry (8830) trackball.  That's the only way to navigate!!", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "A step forward in elegance and power for Windows Mobile phones", "Author": "David D", "ReviewID": "R35ERAKNBGAAWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Windows Mobile phone user for years now. Before buying this phone, I tried a Nokia E71 and then an HP Ipaq 910.  Both phones were not bad, but still lacking in many areas and just not worth their price tag.  This Treo Pro is worth every dime.Pros:- Very slim and light form factor.  I said \"wow\" the minute I opened the box.- Windows Mobile runs lots and lots of software.  Syncing with Windows PCs or Exchange servers is a breeze.- 320x320 display is bright and crisp.- Palm has added so many extras to the base Windows Mobile 6.1 platform, it's hard to list them all.  There is a nice screen saver when the phone is off, showing you the time and if you have any messages or missed calls.  Even though the backlight is off, the screen is still quite easy to read for this basic info.  Also, if you push the red \"End\" button from the home screen, the phone locks the keys and goes to sleep.  Why is this not a standard WM feature?  I can't tell you how many times I wish there was a simple keylock feature.  Turn the phone back on, and you have to hit the middle button in the 5-way pad to unlock the keys.- The buttons around the edge of the phone are perfect.  There's a power button, simple slider control for vibrate mode, a wi-fi button which flips on the wi-fi (holding it in lets you see available networks), volume control, and one more customizable button.  I sort of wish there were a wheel or scroller thingy that lets you zip up and down screens with a lot of text, but oh well.  There's also a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.  On the down side, the USB connector for syncing and charging seems to be a proprietary Palm connector.  I can't seem to find a generic USB cable to match it.- The built-in GPS works great with Google maps.  Sometimes it will pick up a GPS signal in seconds (holding the phone parallel to the ground seems to help).  The built-in GPS in the HP Ipaq 910, by contrast, often took several minutes to lock onto a signal.- The keyboard is small but quite usable after a while.- The Treo is like lightening compared to other Windows Mobile devices I have had.  Previously, I had a Cingular 8525 which had a 400mhz processor.  That device was often sluggish when turning on or moving between applications.  This Treo is also listed as having a 400mhz processor, but somehow it feels twice as fast as the 8525.  It performs like Windows Mobile *should* perform.- The battery life is amazing for a Windows Mobile phone.  I accidentally left my charger at work on Friday, but managed to make it all through 'til Monday with a few phone calls, using the GPS a bit, plus some internet access.  On my previous Cingular 8525, the battery would have been dead at the end of one day of that much use.Cons:- Yeah, the keyboard is small.- Built-in camera could have a higher resolution.  However, it is better than other 2mp digital camera phones I have used.  Also, no flash - not that those little LED flashes really do much anyways.  Indoor pics are pretty weak in medium lighting.- The built-in Windows Media player doesn't have an equalizer or any type of tweaker.  It's the 21st century for heaven's sake.  This is not really Palm's fault since it's a Microsoft program, but until there is a killer media player for Windows Mobile, it will not be a true competitor of iPhone.- The display is locked into sort of a \"large fonts\" mode which will stretch some older Windows Mobile applications all out of whack. This also effectively does not utilize the beautiful screen to its maximum.  However, you can use smaller fonts in IE and that makes web pages look good.- The battery cover is a little tricky to remove.  Once you've done it a few times, you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, the micro SD slot is under there.Summary:If you like Windows Mobile, this is truly fantastic device.  I just hope it's not too late for Palm.  If you're on the fence about moving to Windows Mobile from something other than an iPhone, you'll probably like this device a lot.  If you have an iPhone, keep it, there's no reasoning with you anyway. ;)", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a first smart phone", "Author": "vc", "ReviewID": "R1XUAG4IMUAPI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone, and I like it.  The model year is fall 2008, and it starts to be discontinued during first quarter 2010.  The phone is heavily discounted right now - mainly it is yesterday technologies.  I got mine two months ago for $180 (not knowing they are discounted), and since had added a 8 GB class-6 micro SD card for $21.To keep this review short, I'm just going to talk about the facts and try to keep my opinions to minimum.1.) Battery life is one day for heavy user like me.  I check my email every 15 minutes, write short email, read news on internet, talk on the phone, use Google map to see traffic update, take pictures and upload to Facebook.  I turn on Wi-fi, bluetooth, and data connection all day.  By the end of the day, the battery is all drained.  If I talk more on the phone during the day, the battery will not last all day.  So be aware, if you are a heavy user like me.2.) It took me some time to setup the phone to get T-mobile $10 data plan.  I enjoyed playing and finding solutions like downloading contacts to the phone without using the MS outlook.  In the process, I found out how much I hate Microsoft (it sucks!) and how much I love Google (free stuff works).  Even if you don't use a data plan, the Wi-fi connection works flawlessly, in 5 minutes after I opening box and turned on the phone.  Be warned, I was frustrated at first because I can't get the $10 data plan works.  But now, I'm happy that the $10 plan works, and I hope it will continue.3.) I learned the GPS does not work if you don't have a data plan.  Maybe there is a way to get around, but I do not see a solution on the internet. The Google map still works w/o a data plan, but you just don't have the GPS tracking.4.) The camera, in my opinion, is a shortfall.  Picture quality is gainly, zoom is weak, shutter capture speed is slow, the picture and photo software is crummy, not user friendly.  I like my 10 mp Panasonic camera much better.5.)This is my first query keyboard, and it does not bother me that it is plastic.  I guess I'm learning to use the query keyboard, and I bet I'm also spelling the word query wrong.  Who's care, no body read this.I still like this phone despite these shortfalls.  The phone is built solid.  I dropped it twice (already) on cement floor, and it still works.  Call quality is good, but most important, it helps me get up to speed on mobile phone technology.  Now, I'm excited about the Google phone, and I'm also following Windows Phone 7 development.  FYI, Microsoft is changing the mobile operating platform from \"Window Mobile\" to \"Windows Phone\".

It has the typical WM6.1 Professional OS and accompanying programs, but there are little settings here and there that make it a little or a lot more handy for some of us veteran WM users who have been observing the slow crawl of advancement that Microsoft has made in updated OS's. And some if not a lot of this may be thanks to the manufacturer (Palm, c/o HTC), but let me give a couple examples.Normally, you have to tap and hold for the context menu of a highlighted item. And if you have an extra program, such as Spb Pocket Plus, you may be able to set a hardware button to do this for you, something handy I've done in the past. But the Treo Pro allows you to press and hold the Palm button (the center select button of the 5-way navigation button), and the context menu comes up. And, even though I relied upon Spb for the Close button, it's nice to see this device (and other HTC devices now) have the Close button option embedded. Another example is you can optionally respond to Ignored calls with an automated text message, something that Spb Phone Suite has if you buy it and install it, but the device comes with this feature preloaded. And there are a few others.Yes, there are a few drawbacks, such as the glossy appearance easily getting fingerprints, and the odd fact that there is no real device-off status apart from removing the battery. The Power button turns the screen off with one press, and turns the phone on or off of flight mode when pressing and holding. To access the Reset button, you have to remove the stylus, and it is accessible right where the head of the stylus rests, WITHOUT having to remove the back battery panel (unlike some have said is necessary to access it).As for the screen, some say it is a little washed out, like too whitish. But two things...first, this has decent battery life even if you turn the screen to full brightness (I have push email and two other email accounts checking email all day, along with text, light Internet browsing, and some phone calling), which makes me have to charge it every night, but I'm used to that. So full brightness is a good option. But MOREOVER, the screen is of a technology such that in the glaring sunlight, it has a special effect where you can read everything still! That is a major plus that I will take any day. And speaking of the screen, some don't like it being flush with the rest of the device, but I like that it is that newer type of screen that is more resilient and scratch resistant, and it is just as touch sensitive as the previous types of touch screens.As far as batteries go, I have an extended life battery (there are 2 types out there I know of), and I can go 2 days on a single charge. (The battery I got has the same gloss and matching appearance, but there's another with a non-gloss battery door...I just wanted my door to match the rest of the phone). Yes, extended batteries make the phone more bulky, so get it if you don't mind that. I personally like the phone a little bigger. It makes it feel more firm and solid to me.Every once in a while, a few of the main function buttons will not work on a Bluetooth phone call, but this has only happened twice to me.

My three year old dell was becoming unreliable.  i purchased this phone with trepidation as my girlfriend had lots of problems with her treo.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  I tried the Nokia E71.  Voice quality was poor and often I had to use  a different phone as reception was too poor.  Their was a lot of other problems with the Nokia and I was surprised how much the phone sucked as the reviews were quite impressive for the phone.  I tried contacting Amazon to return the phone but they didn't get back to me and I missed the 30 day deadline.The Treo Pro was a pleasant surprise.  Great sound quality- it actually works well as a phone.  Voice recognition works great- much better than the Nokia- which was useless. Speakerphone works great and quality is same. WM 6.1 is a nice system.  Have really liked it so far. The only thing screwy is Tasks.  I won't show just active tasks.  It also shows future tasks which really makes it useless if you want something to pop up in a month to remind you to give the heartworm to the dog. WM 5.0 did it right.  Why they went backwards on this is beyond me.  I guess it IS windows. Thankfully,  buy a third party application and its fixed.Screen is nice and readable for the size.  I like the keyboard on the Nokia better, but this one is still ok plus i can use a stylus if I get tired of typing.It works well with 3G.  Seems almost as fast as my dsl at home.  Can plug the phone into my computer and use it as a wireless modem.  The camera does not have a flash and is not as many MP as the Nokia, but the picture is actually better.The phone is very intuitive.  I wanted a phone and  pda combo that was reliable and this is it.Thought about an iphone.  But this keyboard is easier to enter data than the screen on the iphone and I can do more with it.  I might get an ipod touch for the apps and music but for a phone, this is more useful.  At least for me.Battery life 2 days.  I charge nightly.  I am not a heavy user of internet at work.  I have it set up to conserve battery life. I keep a sync cable in my bag and can charge it with any usb port (nice).  This phone has been a useful tool and I am really liking it.Cons.  hard to read pdf articles on the phone.  The screen is small but this is not a con, it is jsut the way it is- can't have a giant screen on a compact phone.  That said- NICE resolution on the screen.  keyboard not as nice as nokia (that is the only thing better on the nokia).  that is about it.I am keeping this one.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best smart phone I ever had", "Author": "Jorge E.

However, since I have been syncing my Palm with Outlook for years, the data transfer was pretty seamless.  Naturally I had to redo my speed dials and I couldn't load some of my favorite games, but I knew that going in.  The device is definitely of Treo pedigree, however, and the form factor is a significant improvement. Compatibility with the MS Office suite is a plus (no more dependence on Data Viz).  The device had a lot of menus and was difficult to navigate (kind of like all of the other Windows software I've ever used) but I read a review on the device that mentioned installation of SPB Mobile Shell and that has helped tremendously; it should be the first piece of software that you install!  I also like the unlocked GSM, integrated GPS and the WiFi (all of these were selling points for the phone and worked perfectly out of the box).  Nice job Palm!

I breifly had the palm 700wx so i only have little to compare to but I think I know some of the subtle yet very useful differences.  Here are the pros:1) it's very simple to turn on/off the wifi, bluetooth, and phone antenna in order to save battery life which i really like2) from using the palm treo 700wx, i hated how the touch screen was still active while on a phone call.  i would have to hold the phone away from my face in order to avoid clicking all sorts of things i didn't want to click.  this phone automatically locks the touch screen while on a call and you can only unlock it using the directional button which was a major plus for me.3) The button on the side can be changed to whatever you want it to open.  the 700wx i was told could only be the camera.the cons (why it's only four stars)1) the volume is low unless you activate speaker phone. it sounds like even when not on speaker that the voices are coming from the back of the phone2) i'm not a fan of how the text messaging is set up. i want to open one message at a time to view and then be able to hit respond. if i click on a text it opens it to another screen which doesn't have a reply button until i click back and then the \"conversation\" is highlighted. this is the other thing i don't like. it will save every message you have with the same number into one \"conversation\".3) it comes with no accessories at all.  i originally got a blackberry curve (sent back because it wasn't compatible with my plan which i wasn't told when i ordered) which came with earphones, a holster, the usb charger, a cd, and something else.  this only came with the usb charger and a plug for the wall.  i felt they should have included at least a holster.4) the provided manual is pathetic.  it's basically a ten page pamphlet.  if you want any depth on the functions of the phone, you have to go online5) creating a voice recording is more difficult than it should be. you have to open a program and go through menus in a program just to start one. i want to be able to click program>voice recording and have the app openalthough the cons outnumber the pros, my cons are only minor and pretty specific to what i was looking for. other people may not feel the same way. overall i really like the phone.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Low Cost All-Around Touch Screen 3G Windows Phone", "Author": "Jim Francis \"Jim Francis\"", "ReviewID": "R1NB3CGK1QCW9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a Windows Mobile phone. I spent weeks looking at what was available and everything pointed to the HTC Touch Pro 2 - but that thing is too heavy, chunky/cumbersome and way too expensive in my opinion... so when I saw this phone for two hundred dollars at Dell - I went for it!It's a 3G phone if you use AT&T; but I don't get 3G with my T-Mobile account. That doesn't bother me because I do get 3G where I really need it - in Jamaica, on the Claro network.SCREEN: It's hard to see in sunlight... the fonts are very small - the standard screen \"time\" is a joke... but all that can be easily fixed with a program called \"spb Mobile Shell\" which transforms the Treo Pro into a wonderful easy to use device that looks just like the more expensive HTC phones... I would not want to use this phone without spb Mobile Shell!KEYBOARD: Again, at first it feels weird - the keys are made of a gel-like substance that grips your finger tips and doesn't allow them to \"flow\" with too much speed...but I got used to it after a month or two and now I don't have a problem with it... although it could have been better.FINISH: At first, the black shiny plastic looks kinda cheap. It shows finger prints and smudges like nobody's business... but a quick wipe with a cloth and it always looks new again. Overall, I like it's appearance and I'm happy with it.OPERATION: I've been using it now for a few months now - it works really well. No problems with receiving or making calls. The texting is easy and fast with this phone mainly because of the threaded conversations and physical qwerty keyboard. I've had a few times when I needed to reset the phone - but it's not often and because I'm running third party applications, I can't really complain - again I'm happy with the phones performance.RESET: To reset the phone you really need to remove the battery for a second because there's no convenient switch.WI-FI: There's a great little switch on the side of the phone for starting and stoping wi-fi which I find very convenient instead of hunting through the menus.GPS: It's really fast and works well - it'll find 6 or 7 satellites in a minute or two... much faster than a Nokia N95 that I previously owned.SILENT SWITCH: There's a physical switch for when you go into meetings and you want the phone to be silent - I love this switch and use it a lot. Because of the way it's designed, you can just look at the switch and see whether its on or off (it shows a red color when it's on).For the price that I paid, it's a pretty decent phone... at least until something better comes along!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR NOW!!!", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slow and buggy WM6.1, sleek device", "Author": "J.

I purchased the Treo Pro because it offered everything that the 750w I had been using had, but in a smaller package. After 12 months, I am on my third Treo Pro. I take very good care of my phones, so it is not an issue of abuse. It appears that Palm attempted to strengthen the touchscreen with a more durable plastic so that it wouldn't scratch, but this plastic separates itself from other layers of the screen, causing the touchscreen not to work at all. Unfortunately, you need the touchscreen in order to use the device at all. Beyond that, the device is well designed, but a well designed device that doesn't function is nothing more than a paperweight.Another note: Palm technical support is horrible. Normally, I don't mind because I rarely use technical support. In this case I've used web-based chat, where the support staff knows nothing and barely understands English, and phone-based support, which costs money per call and isn't much more help.At this point, I'm not sure if I'll ever buy another Palm device again.Update: The touchscreen on my third Treo Pro died. That's three Treo Pro phones in 21 months. Now I have an iPhone. I've been using the iPhone for three weeks and can say it is infinitely better. Real web browsing! Easier to navigate!

The first thing I noticed was the extremely nice packaging. Very good first impression, Palm! The phone has held up very well over the past few months. I've dropped it several times and it doesn't seem to be any the worse for a trip down the stairs, which is quite nice. Cases are also pretty easy to get and as a bonus, most iPhone cases fit the Treo Pro.Cons:+ The back cover is extremely difficult to get off the first time. The instructions in the manual are absolutely useless and I have never been able to get the back cover off using them and actually gave myself a blister trying to the first time. (What works the best is to hold the device face down in your left hand and to place your right hand on the back in such a way that the tips of your fingers rest on the Palm logo, then simply slide your right hand up. The cover comes right off.)+ The keys on the QWERTY keyboard are flat and not curved like on the 750, making it extremely easy to typo. It took me about a week to get used to this, but I still prefer the 750 keyboard.+ There seems to be a bug with the camera where it performs randomly and abysmally in low light situations. There is also no flash, which is expected, but a bummer.Meh:+ Battery life is pretty average and pretty much the same as the 750.Pros:+ Very easy to set up, I just put my SIM in and everything worked. I had no problems with making/receiving calls, checking voicemail, sending/receiving SMS/MMS messages, or accessing the cellular network on EDGE or 3G.+ The screensaver is AWESOME. I love, love, love how I can check to see what time and date it is simply by looking at my phone. I don't have to turn the screen on at all.+ Windows Mobile 6.1 is a great improvement over WM6. I enjoy Windows Mobile in general, as it is easy to customize, compatible with thousands of programs, and comes with Microsoft Voice Command.+ MicroUSB charger. No more proprietary Palm doohickey! Yay!+ Headphone jack is a standard headphone jack as well. This is super nice.+ GPS is quite accurate. I purchased Garmin Mobile XT from Palm and haven't had any problems aside from the rare program freeze or crash. In most cases, my location was determined and a route set within a few minutes. Definitely a great feature, I wish the 750 had built-in GPS.+ Bluetooth works great. I had no trouble pairing this device with my EeePC or in using ActiveSync over BT.Overall, I'm quite fond of my Treo Pro and I am very happy with it as a replacement for my 750. I almost never use my 750 at this point as it just seems clunky and outdated in comparison. I do kind of miss the keyboard, though. Especially after the sixth time of accidentally typing 'yourt' or 'twittre'.Edit: I ended up using this phone for two+ years. I was very fond of it, but Windows Mobile is frankly no longer a usable OS. I upgraded to the HTC Vivid, which I am very happy with. But how did the Treo look and act after over two years of constant use? The Treo Pro middle button paint (the silver circle) had almost completely worn off, the glue holding the plastic cover around the middle button (over the four surrounding buttons) was starting to come off and peel away, I had dropped it about eight million times (cracks and chips all over the sides, scratches on the back, but little front damage), the L in the PALM logo on the back had come off, and there is dog hair permanently embedded in the phone. I have to say I do still prefer the 750 keyboard. About a year in, the phone overheated and/or crashed if I asked it to do anything interesting (like...run any app). At the time I upgraded, the battery life was extremely poor. If I made a phone call, the battery would pretty much die immediately.

I am going to take care of the fingerprint problem by getting a silicone case for my Treo Pro.  The sleek/shiny exterior is also the reason that the back is so difficult to remove... HOWEVER, I wanted to offer a tip:  If you use a rubber jar gripper so that you have a good grip, then the back comes off VERY easily.http://www.amazon.com/Maxi-Aids-3-Set-Jar-Openers/dp/B00012K5W0/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1237224322&sr;=8-1In actuality, the back fitting so tightly is a GOOD thing, because it does not allow any space for dust or particles to get down inside of the device.

Apparently they know it is a Smartphone since if I try and change it back to the $15 unlimited data plan I had with a Motorola phone, within a week they change it back to $30.This is a good data phone but a really bad video player.  I installed a few programs and am out of memory all ready.  Call quality is fantastic and AT&T; is right in that you can multi-task on their network.  I can talk and surf the web at the same time.  The screen is way too tiny but not the fault of Palm as all \"candy bar\" type phones have small screens.  Turn on key clicks and typing is a breeze with few errors.  I get 3g speeds for downloads.  Battery life with all the radio's turned off except for the phone is about 3 days, maybe a little longer.  The phone does not get excessively hot while in use as others have reported.  Screeen is bright.  GPS is full and assisted but with the tiny screen reading maps is a chore. \"Palm\" center key blinks when I have voice mail.

In the short while, I've already had to replace 2 styli and the battery. I've owned one other Palm before this one, the 700wx. What attracted me was the stylus operated touchscreen, or finger, I use both in different scenarios. Also I love the QWERTY keyboard (which many companies are getting away from with their smartphones). Finally, I'm OK with Windows Mobile and it's never let me down to sync the phone with my computer, but this would not have been a deal breaker, if it was say Palm OS. Unfortunately, Palm is dying and taking the kind of phone I like with it.I must say the Treo Pro is better than the 700wx, all together. Its best feature though is also its worst feature, its small size. Probably the smallest smartphone I've seen. No more brick, as with the 700wx, or antenna. It just looks really sleek. However, the size of this phone is responsible for the problems I've listed above as well as a few others. Having a smaller keyboard it's very easy to accidentally hit neighboring keys while typing, and it happens often. This slows down email writing and text messages. The phone has also been stripped down and valuable shortcuts have been cut. Access to the stylus has been moved from the top to the bottom, though this is preference, but its affected the stylus in other ways. I also liked the SD card access of the 700wx, on top, for easy swapping or removal. The SDHC card slot is now under the back casing which has to be removed in order to access it.As mentioned before, I've had to replace the stylus twice and I plan to again, and again, because it's a horribly designed stylus. It's been shrunk to an itty bitty size rather than the 700wx's \"normal\" size stylus. I assume this has to do with there not being enough room for a larger stylus, which is probably also why it's at the bottom of the phone. But the worst part of it all and the reason I keep replacing the stylus is because it's made of two pieces that \"bend\" unlike the solid stylus of the past. I can deal with the small size but this construction is pathetic. The end of the stylus you pull from the phone is black plastic, to match the phone, and the rest is solid metal (except for the tip, of course). The problem comes from the bending of the plastic piece at the point of contact with the metal. After a couple months you'll notice how this thing doesn't feel right and then upon inspection you will see this flaw. I've invested in more styli which are on standby.I also mentioned the battery. I just replaced mine (with a big boy battery Seidio Innocell Extended Life Battery for Palm Treo Pro (Black)), yesterday. Only recently had I been noticing that this phone was dying, even before the day was up and even on days with light use. But what, I've had the phone for about 8-9 months now, and this battery problem started about a month ago and steadily got worse. Unacceptable! Size strikes again. I suppose there wasn't enough room for a big battery, even though someone had to know it needs it.So, the Treo Pro has a few common flaws, but they couldn't be more annoying. Not to mention, go to Palm's website and it's like they've disowned the Pro. Sure, there is support. But it's all about the Pre now. The Pro wasn't around very long before the Pre took over. I feel cast aside. And I'm definitely NOT switching to Sprint for the Pre! I guess I'll start looking at a Blackberry.

I had a Palm 680 prior to this. But this new model has Windows mobile operating system which is quite different from Palm OS..so the familiarity factor goes out the window right there. I find Winmo harder to use than Palm OS. I loved the Palm \"desktop\" feature where you could put icons of the most used programs right on the main screen. No such feature on Winmo. Ofcourse, it was an informed decision to buy Palm pro. This product came out in August 2008 and I bought it in May 2009. So a lot of people have already tried it..and as of yesterday there were 41 reviews on Amazon, that were extremely helpful.It is a nice looking phone...weighs almost as much as iPhone. Opening the back cover to insert SIM card was such a hassle. I tried for over 30 minutes to open it..and had to look up a video online for help. But finally got it in. And phone was ready to use right away.On this phone, signal bar is always 1 bar less than other phones..but I can make and receive phone calls. No problems so far. I am overall satisfied with this phone..I got what I expected. I am not a big fan of Winmo though. To open a program, you have to go through layers of menus. For example, I used the clock/alarm function on Palm Treo 680 a lot since I would need to get up at odd hours. The clock/alarm icon was on my desktop main screen. Not so with Windows. You have to click \"start\"..then settings..then system and finally the clock.I feel Palm should get rid of the stylet function. Pulling out the stylet from the right lower corner is not very easy and I am always afraid that I would drop it somewhere never to find it again. But you need the stylet to go through 4 layers of menu..when I used my \"finger\"..it would always miss the mark.Finally, the font size is too small. When I get a phone call.. I have to bring it within 6 inches of my face to read who is calling. Surprisingly, changing font size doesn't fix this problem. You have to see it to understand what I am talking about. Since 80% of my use for this device is as phone, it is very annoying.Overall 3 stars. Lot of scope for improvement.

I was on a budget and found online an unlocked HP Ipaq model 6900. I read the reviews and some were good and some were bad, needless to say I took a chance and bought this thing. The phone was actually a refurbished phone not by the manufacturer, but by a third party vendor, and I had no way of knowing this since the description was misleading (no, it was not Amazon) I started to use the phone only to realize my worst nightmare, the phone did everything well except make calls when I neede to. I also learned that the battery gauge was always reading wrong from one of the HP forums, and when I thought I had a full charge it was actually half charged and the phone could not work.I have since then learned to live with the mistake I made and use this phone as a really bulky PDA or pocket game playing gadget while in the john. I also found out that Windows mobile 5.0 was not the most robust operating system for a phone, much less this one and provisions to update were not allowed.As time went by I learned that Microsoft had updated their mobile operating system and newer and better phones were hitting the market. I was a bit hesitant to go with any of the newer HP products since they were really expensive and I had such a horible experience with the first phone. I did some research on what windows based phone would be ideal for my situation and when I learned about the Palm Treo Pro I decided to look into it. I wanted to see what it looked like but T mobile nor at&t; had this phone, Sprint did, so I went to one of their stores to check it out and the features as well. I really loved the phone, but I was not able to cancel my plan to go to Sprint, so unlocked was the way to go for me.I received the phone and had read some reviews that T mobile did not work very well with the phone, and that everyone was touting the mighty Iphone. The Iphone has some nice software and it is the rave, but when I installed my sim card into this phone, it was ready to go in just under a minute, it came on read the network ID and autoconfigured itself and worked well. I found out from a friend that the newer phones were having their sim cards replaced with more capacity and better handleing of the data. I went to T mobile and they said that there were some cases of this and agreed to swap out the sim for a new one. At that moment was when the phone woke up and started with crystal clear calls, all data was updated flawlessly from my Outlook account from work, the web pages loaded better and this phone has since been everthing that the Ipaq was not.Like others, my only complaint is on the QWERTY keypad being too small, other than that, hats off to Palm for finally releasing a phone that actually does what its supposed to do, and all the software works without incident, many features like the out of the box self configuration was really helpful, wifi works anyplace there is an open hotspot, the micro SD chip can be installed up to 32GB capacity, it is not a battery hog either; I usually get two full days on a charge when using phone, data, mail push and even GPS.Great phone, if you have a GSM service get it unlocked, if you have no service you may want to try Sprint, and even if you dont sign up with them you can see the phone in action.

The problems became worse as time went on.  I contacted Palm on several occasions and was told that the problem had to be with my cellular provider.A couple of months ago, my cellular provider started supplying the Treo Pro themselves, and their other customers were not experiencing the same problems.  After a few more weeks of arguing with Palm customer service, they finally accepted, after an ENTIRE YEAR, that my device was faulty and agreed to replace it under warranty.The new device arrived fairly promptly.

I bought this phone through Dell and only paid about $270.00, so at the time i thought i was getting a really sweet deal,I should have taken the youtube reviews more serious...I will start with some of the good things first.The design is very nice and professional, things are kinda compact in size, but for what it attempts to do, is built into a very slim package. the phone also feels very high quality and lite.phone calls and speaker were always superb.The camera is neat! it takes very nice pictures, records video, and can even do panoramic pics.The battery life is extremely good for a smart phone.here is where things come crashing down...first, there is no off button, serious. you can turn off the screen, turn off wifi, BT, but you can NOT shut off the phone without taking out the battery, so if some app gets stuck or you need to reset to your network, you will have to take the thing apart to accomplish this. dont believe me? google PALM's answer for not including an off button.second, the wifi support is lousy, I would establish a link to my home wifi and my work wifi connections, only to have to reset them every other week because the phone would forget to use them as default.the media player on it sucks! it will play video, mp3. BUT, i found that trying to listen to music on it, tracks would constantly stutter. and forget about using the stereo bluetooth. I had a really difficult time trying to figure out if the stuttering was caused by the headset or the phone only to discover, for some reason, if you shut off the screen while media player is going, tracks will start stuttering, which basically meant, i had to leave it pluggged in with the screen on to listen to music...the final issue i had, was with email. I would go through the process of setting up a pop email account ('gmail', 'work'). things would look good for a couple of days, or even a week, and then all of a sudden I would get error messages indicating 'sent messages could not be sent' or something similar. the email accounts would completely stop working, and the only way to alleviate the issue i could come across was to delete the accounts on the phone and go through the whole process of setting up the accounts all over again.i'm pretty sure a lot of these issues are caused by the fact that it uses 'win mobile'. that seems to be the popular answer. but i would have liked things to have been tested and worked right out of the box. and not have to be a network admin to set up basic wifi...", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "This Phone SUX", "Author": "Skonutz \"Skonutz\"", "ReviewID": "R3PUU0L8FL7GWL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Palm PRO is the worst phone ever. i bought it the first week of its release..i put up with it for a few months and now i have a BlackBerry Tour. in my line of work i meet hundreds of people everyday. i meet one person who also had the phone and she hated it as well. dont waste your money on Palm coz you'll end up having to remove your battery at least 4 times a day just for it to act right. the phone can shut it self off just by the slightest touch and you wouldnt even know. the phone dosent vibrate half the time. the mobile web takes forever. typing \"www\" takes at least 8 seconds just for the letters to appear on the screen. the phone hangs up when people calls you and if your screen freezes which it will the call will show up and nothing will work not even the green button. its a piece of trash. it dosent deserve the star i gave it but Amazon wants me to rate it....", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor Battery Power Retention", "Author": "Patrick Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3ISU7B29K3Q7H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The promoted performance of this 'phone has been prejudiced by what is evidently a defective battery with which it was supplied.

Also I was not able to successfully set it up with my blue tooth headset - perhaps that was my ignorance but my son couldn't figure it out either. The keys are too small for me to use while driving - I am used to an unsmart Nokia. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I realize I am not an experienced smart phone user and some of these issues might be due to my ignorance. But I did try all the support services options and couldn't solve them.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "No way no how!", "Author": "Bill Buyer \"Just another beautiful day in Sea...", "ReviewID": "R2E7AJ7Y3XDZ5S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Absolutely a horrible option for a phone!

So I was really excited when I first heard about the Treo Pro.  Pre-ordered it.  When it arrived, I could not get the back cover off.  Asked my big strong husband.  Asked my big strong kids.  No go.  Had to return it.  I hope next version puts some skids on the back cover to solve this problem.  Oh well.
