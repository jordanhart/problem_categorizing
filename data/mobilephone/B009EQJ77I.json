You may have a slight learning curve if you're used to another make phone, but (at least for me) it's no big deal. My service allows me 130 minutes each month for $10, and this phone works with that plan without a problem. Just put the SIM card in place, and turn it on. If you're looking for a cell that takes pictures, lets you surf the web and cooks breakfast too, this isn't the unit for you. If you want a phone that you can easily carry in a pocket or purse and takes care of the basics, you should really consider this one.

My old phone died and this inexpensive Samsung was a perfect replacement.Pros:- Cheap ($20)- Fantastic battery life (1-2 weeks with what I'd consider normal talk/text usage).- Extremely light & durable.- Small (1.75 inches wide, 4.25 inches long, 0.5 inches thick).- Works with any GSM carrier SIM card - I had no problems transferring my existing SIM card.- Volume is excellent (and I even have some hearing loss).- Standard battery charger included in box.- Signal is strong (I'm in the U.S.)- No stress - if I lose or break it, no big deal - it was only $20.- It even has a built-in FM radio.  I'll never use it, but it's a nice feature for those who would.- Simple, but extremely functional for people who just want a simple talk & text phone.Cons:- The phone may be a little smaller than you expect, but this actually worked out well.  It's light and doesn't take up a lot of space.- There is no volume button on the side of the phone.  To adjust, while on a call, simply press the center menu button upward or downward.- No Internet capabilities, but that's not an issue for me.  My life doesn't revolve around 24/7 connectivity.- The phone arrives with Spanish as the default language (I speak English).  This is easily fixed...You can use a Spanish-to-English translator tool (free online).  Or, you can simply follow these steps:Press...1.  MENU (top left button)2.  SETTINGS (bottom right icon)3.  PHONE (2nd item on list)4.  LANGUAGE (first item on list)5.  ENGLISH (2nd item on list)-----------------------Update (1/7/14):I've had the phone for a month now and there have been no problems whatsoever.  If you don't need a SmartPhone, and you're simply looking for a basic talk/text phone that has over a week of battery life, do yourself a favor and purchase this phone.  You won't be disappointed.-----------------------Update (5/13/14):The phone is now 5+ months old and still works like new.

It only supports the GSM 850/1900 frequencies, which are generally only used in the Americas. You will need a quad band phone, or one that specifically states that it supports GSM 900/1800 if you want to use it outside of the Americas. Take a look at the wikipedia article called GSM_frequency_bands for more information on this.I am using this phone on Lycamobile US, a reseller of T-Mobile service. It works great. The reception is very good, even inside buildings, etc. The call quality is excellent, I can hear conversations loud and clear. And the battery life borders on magical, no worries at all about making sure it's always charged up, it seems to go forever without being plugged in.

It was my job to configure the phones and teach my parents how to use them, which was fairly simple.This phone is a simple unlocked GSM phone, meaning it works with GSM carriers, like T-Mobile, AT&T;, and other carriers that use those networks, like Consumer Cellular. It will NOT work with Sprint, Verizon, or carrier that use their networks. This phone uses a standard size SIM card. You can send/receive calls and text messages. You can not send/receive pictures or videos in messages and you can not surf the internet. It has a few features like FM radio, calculator, timer, and a game or two. The battery lasts for a very long time while on standby.Specifics for use with Consumer Cellular:Put your SIM card in the slot and turn on the phone. You can make calls now, but texting will not work yet. Call Consumer Cellular, preferably from a different phone, and tell them texting does not work on your phone. They will need your phone's IMEI number. To get your IMEI, dial *#06# and it will show on your screen. They will use that information and send you a text to make sure it is working. Now it works.The bottom line is that this is a very inexpensive, very simple unlocked GSM phone that works. Fit and finish is as good as the old Motorola and Samsung phones I used years ago before upgrading to an Android.

Idioma -> English.  The package contains both Spanish and  English language instruction sheets, but they don't tell you how to switch the language.  The fact that it only has 2G seems to not be a problem.  The signal strength meter does not seem to work, but still the reception is fine, and voice communications are very satisfactory.  The battery seems to have good life.  Other people have pointed out a few issues such as pocket dialing and having to manually set the date/time when you first put the battery in.  And sure, it would be nice if it had a standard USB charging port. On the other hand, the price is good, I like the feel of the keyboard, I like the menu system, it has a really handy feature to tell you how many minutes you've used, has a game built into it, and basically it's a likable phone.

I cannot find where to enable it on their website so it knows my account that I created on the tracker site relates to a particular phone.There is an SOS feature in the manual but not apparently on the phone.Trying to find this phone and how to make it work on the Samsung website is painful. Almost everywhere that has a pick-list of phones to choose from, does not have this phone in the list. and you can't get past that point.Note to Samsung: if you have lists of devices, either make sure they are up-to-date, or leave a generic option to keep us from getting stuck in your menu system when you screw up the menus.Updated Review:I tried to activate the FindMyMobile option - mobile tracker listed in the product description and can't get it to work. Samsung US tech support says that they think it won't work but to call Hong Kong tech support directly and ask them.So, it works as a phone, but the Mobile Tracker option listed in the product title seems to be incorrect, at least incorrect for USA customers. I purchased this phone specifically since it had tracking since it was going to be a grandson's phone and likely to be lost. The tracker represented a way of finding it easily.

It makes and receives calls and text messages.  It's GSM and unlocked, so you can use cheap, pay-as-you-go SIM cards just about anywhere in the world.  For the price, you can't beat it.Pros:  It does the job.It holds a charge for days and has very good talk time, but once the battery indicator goes off of full, it drops pretty quickly.  It insists on notifying you when it's fully charged, which I find annoying, but YMMV.It's small and flat, so it fits in a jeans pocket.The FM radio (really? yes, really) actually works well, but only when the wired earpiece (which is also the antenna) is plugged in.  I don't know when I'd want to use it, but there it is.Cons:  The biggest problem is that there's not a lot of memory for text messages, and if you're out of memory, it will just drop outgoing messages (and drop incoming ones if you're not careful -- you can cancel out of the incoming notification, delete some text messages, then receive the message).It does not have great reception (compared to, say, an iPhone 5), but it generally does the job.Both the earpiece and power cord use proprietary connectors, so if you lose those, you're out of luck.There's no bluetooth, so if you want an earpiece, you're stuck with the wired earpieces that comes with it.If it falls off of the couch, the back flies off and the battery falls out.  Then you have to manually re-set the time, since it doesn't get the time from the cell signals.Summary:  If you're between smart phones, it's a great deal.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works in US, didn't work in Israel", "Author": "Anton", "ReviewID": "R3L8MB6AGG773G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought it mainly to use abroad, but it didn't work in Israel with Orange SIM.Not sure what the reason, different bands maybe.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine in USA, no good in Europe, so be careful and read the fine print.", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RMKFDU5DI2000", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice little phone, cumbersome menu system but adequate after getting used to it.

What is worse is that as soon as the phone becomes unlocked, the light is turned on, draining the battery if I forget to turn it off.  Also, the phone is advertised as having an alarm feature and a calendar feature.  This is misleading because these two features have no overlap.  That means that you cannot set a reminder for a particular date with the calendar.  The calendar just shows you the day of the week!  The alarm feature only allows you to set an alarm within the next 24 hours, but you can set something like a dozen alarms.  However, why you would want to set this many alarms in one 24 hour period?  There is no way to associate an alarm with a text reminder.  Also, the phone has even less memory than my old Nokia phone that was more than 12 years old.  It runs out of memory after a couple dozen text messages.  The Nokia phone was much, much better.  Spend a little more money and get a basic Nokia phone.
