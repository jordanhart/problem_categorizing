Like everyone else said, this is a piece of junk that shuts itself off repeatedly.  I put up with all of the other issues, but turning itself off is the nail in the coffin.  The battery is charged, the phone sitting on my desk, and it just turns off.  I type a text, hit send, and it turns off about 30% of the time -- usually without saving the text.  I'm in the middle of a phone call and it just stops sending my voice to the other person.  (I have to admit that my children like that feature!)I only use it as a phone, to send texts, and to take an occasional picture.  I've never used it online.FYI -- T-Mobile doesn't consider the phone randomly turning off to be a problem.  Rather, it's a selling opportunity for a new phone.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish I Had My Other Phone Back", "Author": "Apollos", "ReviewID": "R365WXGLEO5TK7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone a few months ago and have had almost nothing but trouble with it.First of all, there are too many keys and functions all crammed tightly together in way too small of a device. One gremlin showed up soon after I got it. I carry the phone in my jeans pocket. It rings and I reach down and take it out of my pocket, put it up to my ear, and before I even say \"Hello,\" someone is saying that to me: \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" It happens all of the time. What's happening is, the key that you push to answer the phone has already been pushed while the phone is still in my pocket, and the caller is already on the line. It gets pushed somewhere in the process of reaching down into my pocket, taking the phone into my hand, and taking it out of my pocket to answer it. This is VERY annoying.The second negative issue I've had is with the keypad lock function. When I first got the phone and was getting used to the keypad, if I was looking down at a phone number and entering it, if I waited longer than 2 or 3 seconds to push the next key down, the automatic keypad lock had turned on right in the middle of entering a phone number. So I had to push the menu key twice, then push the tiny \"joy stick\" key to get it unlocked, and then resume dialing. Again, VERY annoying. So I turned off the locking function. But then I started hearing electronic tones of keys being pressed while the phone was in my pocket, so I had to turn the keypad lock function back on. But some time later, something happened, and it went from 2 or 3 seconds to lock up, to a full 30 seconds before it will lock again. So now, when I finish a call, I have to wait 30 seconds before I put the phone back in my pocket or else keys will be punched and entered into the phone again during the first 30 seconds that it's in my pocket. I HATE THIS PHONE!Also, the volume control lever/button is not in a good place. It happens to be right where I grip the side of the phone. So sometimes I'm having trouble hearing someone during a call and I quickly check the volume and find that it has gone down to 2 or 3, simply because of where I'm gripping the side of the phone.Again -- too many keys and functions too close together means all kinds of \"opportunities\" for things to go wrong. The pull-out QWERTY keyboard has keys so tiny, it takes me forever to punch each one to send a text message, to keep from constantly straddling keys. Changing over from the special function keys to regular keys, and vice versa, is a real drag, too.I very much regret getting this phone and wish I had my old one back now; it was so simple to use. But I wanted to start texting and was told that I couldn't do it on that phone.This Gravity Text phone is too small for my big hands, but the larger phones are way out of my price range.

I power my phone off about once a day. (My carrier, T-Mobile, says this makes the phone work better.) Periodically I can't make a call because the phone displays \"Emergency calls only\". After a few times having this happen I powered the phone down and back up again. I called T-Mobile and they said that is what I need to do. There may be a software problem but the indication was that it would not be fixed. Another problem I have is I will receive the notice that I have a phone message and the phone has been sitting arms length away from me and did not ring. This happened the other day sitting in my game room with windows along one side that I can see a cell site sitting at my desk. The cell site is visible thru the tree leaves (this is mid March - leaves are small). I was told that the leaves could have caused the problem.

First, you shouldn't have to go to the owners manual to set a ring tone.  The phone randomly disconnects from the network and I have to reboot the phone to get the network back.  When this happened on the first one, I took it back.  The second one does it too.  Big deal?

When I reboot to get back on the network I see my mailbox has all the messages that have been piling up while I believed my phone to be connected.The battery meter is next to useless.

I think it hates me too. ;)  It's mutual.  This is the second exact phone I have had this problem with.  I had my orginal version of this for a few months and the day I took it home it started doing this.  I must be really patient because I put up with it for several months until I finally went back into the store to have them replace it and send me a new one thinking it was just a fluke.  Nope.  Just an awlful phone.  The second one does the same thing.

I really don't expect that much of my phone.Things I do not expect my phone to do:--Access the Internet--Download apps--Give me directions--Play videos--Become a lightsaberThings I do expect my phone to do:--Call people and stay connected.--Text people--Tell me what time it is--Tell me how much battery life it has--Do things when I press buttonsNotice that the things I expect my phone to do are only the most basic functions that all phones should be able to do by default\u2014no more, no less.  This phone spectacularly failed to do every single one of the basic functions that phones are supposed to do.  Here's how:1. Call people:  As others have stated, this phone randomly shuts off when I try to make a call.  This happens quite frequently, and when it happens, it takes several minutes for the phone to reboot and initialize.  I have also had the problem of my audio shutting off in the middle of a call, so that I can still hear the person on the other end, but he/she can't hear me.2. Text people:  Same problem with shutting off when I attempt to send a text.  Moreover, as others have pointed out, the keyboard is very cumbersome for texting.  I actually wouldn't mind this because I have gotten so used to texting with the number pad that I can do it just as fast, EXCEPT the dictionary has the vocabulary of a seven-year-old which leads me to have to resort to the keyboard anyway for many multi-syllabic words.  (I have a $25 pre-paid phone with a better dictionary, but I guess the makers of this phone expected everyone to use the keyboard, so they did not bother to work on number pad texting at all.)3. Tell me what time it is:  The time display often freezes on one time, so I have to slide it open to make it update to the actual time.  The phone did not update for Daylight Savings Time until 24 hours after it was supposed to.  If I had used my phone's alarm, I would have woken up late for a very important Sunday morning appointment.  Fortunately I knew better than to trust this piece of junk.4. Tell me how much battery life it has:  As others have mentioned, the battery life bar may show the phone as fully charged (five bars) for days, but once it goes down to four bars, you have hours before it dies.  This, of course, renders the battery life bar completely useless and is in fact worse than if the bar were not there at all.5. Do things when I press buttons:  Sometimes, inexplicably, every button on the phone will freeze completely, leaving me incapable of doing anything whatsoever.  The only way I could figure out to fix it was to mash all of the buttons on the keyboard as much as possible until it woke up.I almost never write reviews, but 2 stars is much too kind for this abomination, and I'd like to see this phone get the 1-star average it deserves.
