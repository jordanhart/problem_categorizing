I don't think this even deserves one star.Okay guys. Please do read this review, it will make a dramatic difference in whether you buy this piece of junk of not. I was so excited to be getting a new phone! Finally!I must admit, at first i was in love with this phone... untill these problems started occurring with in the next hour. I did not research on this phone, and read no reviews before i bought it... which was a HUGE mistake on my end. The only thing I knew when i purchased it was that it looked like a smartphone, except didn't have that data plan. Which made me purchase it.  Little did i know that the HTC FREESTYLE IS A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A PHONE! Every single person who's ever wrote a bad review on this phone is entirely true.  At least 10 times a day my phone freezes (and then i have to open up the battery compartments, and take the battery out to restart it... turning it off is not good enough. I am being truthful with you right now. When i send someone a text, several people have mentioned to me that i send them that same text at least 3 more times, and i receive the same message from people 5 at the most times. Meaning, when you send a text... that person receives your text 3 more times. And when you get a text from someone, you get that text multiple times again. Another thing i have noticed about this piece of crap is a weird screen that pops up with a red, blue, yellow, and neon green stripe saying \"system error\" , and then you have to turn in off (take out the battery + sim card again). And lastly, at least 7 times a day my phone will freeze in the middle of no where and say \"error, restarting phone\". Its superbly an annoyance. I have only had this phone for 6 days, and i hate it! I've never dropped it once... and i bought it brand new.  PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE!And the last thing i wanted to share with you is... last night i went to go use my phone... and the main screen (it has different screens like the iPhone) Was gone! My htc freestyle home screen with the messaging button, the menu, the time is just gone! I turned my phone and took out the sim card restarting it more than 20 times (yes, i'm counting) And it just won't come back! Now i can not text or call, i'm stuck with this junk! I was going to return and get a new one... but i think the same will happen.Also along with the home screen... i have no more music, contacts, or shortcuts on my phone. It's literally as if i just got it because all my stuff is gone. Even the freaking home screen! THE HOME SCREEN! HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN?!?  Sorry i have took my anger out in these words. I am, just very fed up with this phone. Any suggestions of phones without data plans by at&t; for me to get next .... please email me. bcort99@aol.comThanks for reading, and once again... don't purchase this product. And i'm warning you... i think all HTC's experience these same problems.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best non-smartphone smartphone!", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R2JH4UVGSFVOYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my HTC phone after At&t; screwed me over with my smartphone and my data service's. unable to pay the money to getout of there damn contract i decided to dumb my phone down to a \"basic\" phone, and i must say i LOVE this phone.

Also, it is a touch screen with a touch keyboard; great for texting.  The phone feels great and I like how small it is; i didn't want a super big phone. one of my favorite features with this phone was how customizable it is. when re-searching this phone I noticed a lot of negative feedback's on this device. I learned that there was an update to fix the freezing and restarting issues. The first thing i did was up-date the phone with the latest update. once updated i was excited to have a great phone with a touch screen and no data plan. AFTER having the phone for four days the phone froze at least three times a day and restated a lot. when it freezes you have to take the battery out; this sucks, the back cover is a pain to put back on.  I was frustrated because every morning when i would wake up to a frozen phone. I was worried because if i use the alarm, it may not work because the phone would be frozen. also I was afraid that i would miss calls because the of that same issue.  sadly I decided it would be best to just send the phone back.This phone was a perfect fit for what i wanted GSM, no data plan, small, and a touch screen with the touch screen keyboard.I would've exchanged the phone but, i am in fear of the same problems. just too many people with the same issues.

She has an old Motorola Razr where you need to press the \"a\" button three times in order to type \"c\" when texting.  Cumbersome and annoying to say the least, so she wanted a phone with an onscreen qwerty keyboard for ease of texting and a fairly large screen (easier to view pictures of grandchildren - old eyes).  She does not need to use the internet at all nor does she even know how.Since pickins are slim for my requirements I opted for this phone because it had the features I wanted without having to purchase a data plan.  Those rapists (AT&T;) now require you to purchase a data plan with every smartphone whether you plan on using the internet or not.  What a racket!!!Ok, so the phone arrived and it looks to be the answer to my mother's needs.  But lo and behold, the phone starts oddly losing its charge despite no use and being in sleep mode.  This piece of junk (HTC Freestyle) CONSTANTLY, CONSTANTLY, CONSTANTLY freezes and also got stuck on a Spanish screen once.  Even referring to this sorry excuse as a phone is just plain wrong.Bottom line - I read the reviews and knew they weren't favorable, however, I figured I'd roll the dice because this phone (if it actually worked) would be the perfect answer to my mother's needs.  So, thank you HTC for making our lives miserable for a few days with this nightmare you call the Freestyle.  And thank you greedy AT&T; for putting us in this boat by not allowing the purchase of a smartphone without a data plan.

It's a great phone but the software is too much for the hardware of the phone. I have had 4 of these phones (3 of them were given via the 1 year warranty)and all of them stopped working at some point. I owned the first one for 6 months when it decided to go into a black HTC start-up screen after I had turned it off to prevent the battery from dying. The second and third phones tried to restart but remained stuck at the start-up screen after having them for 30 minutes. The fourth one kept restarting after a phone call or a text. I was able to download the update meant to correct it but caused more issues in use. Calling ATT for a hard reset did not correct this either. I stopped using it and purchased the ATT Avail. However I had to switch back to the Freestyle to avoid the data plan and only used it for less than a month (with the same restart issues) when the screen went blank. I would've gotten a replacement but it's now 3 months after the factory warranty expired so I am out of luck.ATT did discontinue this product due to customer complaints.Pros: pretty and small phone; easy to customize and navigate; with small fingers you can easily text and place phone calls; decent talk time; good phone reception; speaker works.Cons: sends and receives multiple texts, SD card slot is inside the phone; phone can be slugglish and laggy with heavy use; tends to overheat with use or while idle; internet connectivity issues; updates cannot be downloaded or don't fix the issues; little to no selection of games and applications; heavy in comparison to new phones; speaker for the ringer and music are on the back so sound is muffled.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for.", "Author": "ing", "ReviewID": "R12QH5N3KZDB0J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate this phone.
