{"Reviews": [{"Title": "disappointing!!!", "Author": "Pali \"numero 1\"", "ReviewID": "R208XRRSO9NKEV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is probably the worse phone I have ever had.  It is not user friendly at all. I have not downloaded many apps and do not use many apps. I don't use the bluetooth and only use data when I have wifi access.  I know this is not the galaxy 111 but based on the high ratings on Samsung phones I really expected better performance.  I just switched from a blackberry, but this is really disappointing.  Not even the basic features like making a call works well.  Its just two months and I really cannot put up with this for much longer.  Think I will go Iphone.Pros:  Nice size phone- attractive.cons:  The buttons on either side of the centre menu buttons do not light up and takes very long to respond when pressed.  There is no way to cut off or end a call other than waiting until the touch screen pops up with the end button which takes quite a while after you have dialed - this has resulted in the  person on the other end hearing me for at least 15 seconds after I think I have ended the calls.  Battery life started out really great for the 1st three weeks or so giving me at least 2 days without charging using wifi and apps.  Now - about 2 weeks later its down to less than a  day- I have to charge daily.  The dual sim does not allow you to  pick which sim to call from - it has to be set on 1 at a time and to change you have to go to the settings options and change it.  I had dual sim phones before and when you dialed a number there was an option to choose which sim to dial from.  For incoming calls it automatically diverts the calls from the sim which is not set, to the sim which is set without the callers knowing that their call is going to another carrier.Difficult to store numbers in the phone book - in fact from time to time I am unable to access some numbers which I know were stored and I did not delete. contacts which were automatically stored as SNS cannot be edited.Sometimes you dial a number, and press call- it just diverts back to the main menu- this happens regularly now.The list goes on.....I definitely will not recommend this phone.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2RUU951Y9A8VO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is a replacement for the android phone that I bought few weeks ago that didn't allow me to surfe the web.

So happy buying....The memory storage on this phone is crappy I now wished I hadn't bought this phone such a nuisance everytime to see insufficient storage popping up all the time.

The best advantage for this phone is overseas travel where you can buy a sim cards for any amount  in any country in Europe and Australia  - whether Vodaphone, Virgin, Orange etc..... use what you want and just top up as needed - you will get a local number for that country to use. Much cheaper than using a US phone with exorbitant roaming charges. I am using mine here for the time being while waiting for the Sansung 5. I  call overseas regularly - reception great - and photos excellent. I use T-Mobile prepaid unlimited text and calls $60 a month and pay an additional $10 a month for unlimited International calls and text. No need for plans and you get an unlocked phone to use.
