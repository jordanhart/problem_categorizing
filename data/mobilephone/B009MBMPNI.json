It didn't work well for my needs.  I had something to compare it to because I had an LG phone that worked great.  The Samsung kept dropping it's connection to the bluetooth in my car.  It would connect and disconnect whenever it felt like it.  I never had that problem with my LG.  It also dropped calls constantly when I wasn't in the car.  Again, I didn't have that problem with my other phone.  So, now I have another LG and everything is back to working the way it was.I suppose someone who didn't need to have their phone connect to their car or has service other than verizon would be happy with it.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible", "Author": "taeler harmon", "ReviewID": "RENFPFWN0HKWO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "barely worked. kept freezing would shut off nad turn back on randomly. everytime id do something to fast it would flip the screen all funny. and it switched names around and deleted numbers more then once.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "rogue", "Author": "gshsh", "ReviewID": "R28DD8HEFA4G24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought it was a good deal and it was exactly what they said it would be.I'm very happy with it..", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could Be Better", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "R172LWGLBDM110", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The condition of the phone in general was good considering it is a used phone, it didn't look like it had been dropped or handled improperly. My only problem with the phone is that the touch screen is some times a bit off, meaning, I will press on the menu button but the phone shows that I'm touching the \"contacts\" button, when those are not even next to each other, or if I press messages and it shows me pressing on the \"dialer\" button. This action not only happens here, but through out the phone so if I had a list of text messages from various recipients, but wanted to open the first one on the list,  to reply, I would tap the one I wanted to open but instead it would open the second one. I had to calibrate the screen a few times and that work, but it's something that has to be done regularly then. Three times already the touch screen completely stopped working all together and I don't even understand why that would happen.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung SCH U960 Rogue", "Author": "Rachel Long", "ReviewID": "R1BE3WUZ3H2AQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was just like brand new.
