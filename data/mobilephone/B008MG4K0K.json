When it first came i dunked it in a glass of water and my mom almost had a heart attack (she didn't know it was waterproof).  I turned the music on and let it stay in the water and my dad was so impressed he wanted to get one (my dad doesnt like to use cellphones btw). Tried scratching the display with scissors and it got no mark at all! My brother wanted to buy 1 too. Couldnt resist showing it off to my co-workers and i put it in a glass of water at work. Beats the hell out of their samsungs and iphones!!! Opened the back cover and there was some water in it so i had to dab it with tissue esp. In the speakers. U have to really open and dry it after u get it wet though. The yellow back cover is smooth and glossy but it's plastic and not scratchproof (boo). The cover doesnt seem to fit with the sides of the phone coz it keeps on bulging. The glass display is not shatterproof so dont drop it in concrete. In sony's vid the girl threw it in a hill of flour so it acted like a cushion to the phone. The ports are attached by a small plastic which seems to be easily breakable. The display is ok with videos but with pictures u can see its pixelated (like the iphone 3gs). 5mp camera is ok and video res is great. Battery really sucks. It lasts only 1 day with wifi on (as most phones do anyway) but it can last 3-4 days with easy battery saver just for texting and calling only. (that's what cellphones are made for!!) and anyways  i got an ipod to play with. for me the speakers are strong enough (am not really an audiophile). No need for 2nd camera also. Was considering to buy acro s but this one won me over because of its size and its ip67. Its almost the same as my ipod touch 4g and fits my hand easily. Not having any problems with network so im not considering to upgrade its firmware. Maybe those with microsimcards are the ones having problems because mine is just the regular size. My only problem is it keeps flashing when its locked which may drain the battery. Overall, im really happy with this phone because i keep breaking cellphones due to my clumsiness. Im not afraid to bring it in the bathroom or swimming with it in my pocket. Haha.. Would i buy it again? Definitely! I love my bumblee phone!!", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good outside, bad inside!", "Author": "Ging", "ReviewID": "R3VF6VWBZHB8Z5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, i will go directly to the point. I purchased this Xperia Go and arrived on 31.7.12 in Amazon.de. Despite the other good features of this one, like being water resistant, scratch resistant, etc., etc. This phone losses the network signal. The update of firmware does not help solving the problem!

This is it! I downloaded a few games, whatsapp, facebook and twitter and it works quite fast. It came with Android 4.1.2.

Select the manual selection mode instead of the automatic selection mode which is causing the signal loss problems in the service providers network selection. When the setting was switched, the phone stopped losing its cellular signal. Otherwise you cannot go wrong with this phone and you'll love it.
