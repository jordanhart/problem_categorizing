This was bought to replace a lost iPhone 4, which I'd owned for nearly two years, just to give you some idea of the perspective from which I'm reviewing this phone.The Fusion 2 is manufactured by Huawei and packs a single-core 800 MHz Snapdragon S1 processor that is more than capable of opening and running most apps in a reasonably snappy manner. The interface (Android version 2.3.6, \"Gingerbread\") is intuitive and seems more fully-featured and can be customized in more ways than iOS. However, this is not something that I personally can speak to with any level of expertise as this is the first time I've ever owned an Android device. The phone comes with 512 MB RAM and 2 GB of internal storage with a Micro SD card slot for expansion. I've had a few minor issues with apps locking up or closing on their own, but nothing especially troubling, and not with any more frequency than the iPhone 4.It has a 3.2 megapixel rear-facing camera that can capture video and stills--it has no flash and either doesn't autofocus or doesn't autofocus in a way that I've yet been able to figure out. The photos are borderlining on unusuable--I can't get a sharp image of anything at any distance, even under beautifully diffused sunlight. I haven't played around with the video extensively yet, but from my limited experience, the picture and sound quality are both very poor--the ambient noise comes through loud and staticky, and the voices sound muffled.It also has an FM radio tuner, which is a nice bonus that I haven't seen on many other phones. Again, my experience with this has been limited, but so far so good--the two stations that I listened to came in nice and clear.The GPS receiver works in tandem with Google Maps and Google Navigation for adequate navigation functionality with which I haven't experienced any problems, apart from occasional difficulty getting it to recognize a destination that I input by speaking rather than typing, but that was to be expected.The Bluetooth seems kind of finicky when pairing with my Honda Civic--one thing I loved about my iPhone is that when I turned my car on, it would automatically establish a Bluetooth connection and begin playing the last thing I was listening to. The Fusion 2 sometimes forces me to fiddle with the Bluetooth settings to coax it into connecting, and then it won't always hold the connection. My guess is that this is a problem that can be solved if I take a little time to fiddle with the settings, but I haven't had an opportunity to do that yet. Taking phone calls over the Bluetooth has been an unexpectedly positive experience--the clarity is noticeably better than it was with my iPhone 4 and voices sound bassier, richer and more lifelike. Oddly, the improved call quality is only noticeable when I'm talking through the car's Bluetooth connection and not when I'm just using the handset as normal.Skimming back over this review, it comes off negatively, but for the most part, the phone has been a pleasure to use and has filled in quite nicely for my lost iPhone 4 as I wait for my upgrade date. Although this version of Android is now a couple of generations old, it does everything that iOS can and more, albeit not with quite the same level of polish. It comes with a lot of pre-installed crapware and if I had root access and could uninstall it and maybe even overclock the processor, it could actually be a very capable little phone.The things I like about this phone over the iPhone 4 are...1. the power management widget that allows me to toggle WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and Auto-sync on and off as well as toggle through a handful of screen brightness settings2. call clarity and richness over Bluetooth3. the ability to put direct dial shortcuts on the home screen, for one-touch access to the people I call most4. Swype predictive text input5. turn-by-turn navigation that talks to me6. a more customizable home screen7. price ($99.99 with no contract)8. the FM radio tunerThe things I miss the most about my iPhone 4 are...1. automatic, hassle-free Bluetooth connection to my car2. a much better camera3. podcast apps (Downcast and Apple's free Podcasts app) that aggregate, organize and manage my podcasts in a way that makes more sense to me4. higher screen resolution and pixel density5. the apps that I've already dumped a bunch of money intoThe things I do most with my phone are listen to podcasts and take photographs... The lack of an Android app for podcasts that I like and the lack of a good camera are deal-breakers that prevent me from keeping this as anything more than a backup phone once my upgrade date arrives. But overall, it's been a positive experience to own and use.****************************************************************************************************UPDATE (OCTOBER 11, 2012)An annoying issue that's started to come up is that sometimes when I wake my phone up and it shows the lock screen, the touchscreen acts kinda funny--it seems like the processor is still kind of waking up as I attempt to put my unlock code in (that thing with the 9 circles, and you have to draw the correct pattern to unlock it), because it won't register my touches or I'll put the entire pattern in and lift my finger off, but it'll act like my finger is still on there and deciding where to drag it next. I don't know if any of that makes sense... but anyway, if I hit the sleep button to put it back to sleep and hit it again to wake it up again, it seems to be fine the second time. My hunch is that it has something to do with humidity because it only seems to have this problem if I'm in a humid environment (outside when it's raining, or in the bathroom after I've taken a shower).The Bluetooth issue I described in my initial write-up seems to have fixed itself without me doing anything, although it still takes a much longer time for it to establish a connection than my iPhone took--sometimes over a minute. Maybe I just needed to be more patient with it from the beginning.While messing around in the settings, I learned that it can be tethered via USB or used as a portable Wi-Fi hotspot. I can't make an assessment of how well it works, though, because my data plan makes no provision for this type of use. But if yours does, I guess that's another reason to consider getting this phone.****************************************************************************************************UPDATE (OCTOBER 30, 2012)A little more than a month into my ownership period, I'm now having frequent problems with the touchscreen, namely the one I described on October 11, with regards to the problems under humid conditions. Now it seems like it does that more often than not. Also, sometimes (i.e. about 1 out of 10 times) if I boot it up cold, it will take up to a minute for the stock launcher to bring up my home screen. Not sure if it's a hardware or software problem, but it just gives me a black screen. I haven't checked in about a week, but it seems as though there is still no easy way to root this device that has yet been documented.****************************************************************************************************UPDATE (NOVEMBER 21, 2012)I upgraded to a Galaxy S3, which I dropped within a week, rendering it unusable because I suck. And of course I didn't insure it, because why would I insure a $600 phone that is made of glass and for which I don't use a protective case?But you're not here to read about how much I suck...Anyway, I'm back on the Fusion 2... Having an Ice Cream Sandwich device for a week made me realize how much I was missing out on with Gingerbread. Chrome and Hulu Plus aren't compatible (and neither are a lot of other apps for that matter), nor can I playback high-definition video files without the frame rate being unwatchably choppy. Firefox doesn't display webpages correctly when the phone is in landscape mode (the stock browser can handle it fine, but won't allow for tabbed browsing, so pick your poison or try a different browser)... But these are all trifles that I can either work around or can do without altogether.My second biggest gripe of the moment is that I haven't found a way to manage apps effectively. In Ice Cream Sandwich (on the Galaxy S3) there's a multitask button that gives you a quick view of what apps are open and allows you to close them quickly by swiping them away. Gingerbread, from what I understand, is structured in a way that when you hit the home button or back out while running an app, some apps will close automatically and others will continue to run in the background, but it's difficult to know which one. The only way I know of to quit an app is to get to the home screen, tap the menu button, tap \"Manage Apps\", tap the \"Running\" tab, tap the app you want to quit, then tap the \"Stop\" button. The reason it's a problem is that the phone has a very finite amount of memory, so if you're running a lot of apps, processes and services in the background (often unknowingly), it could cause the active app to run sluggishly. This was a big problem the last time I was using Google Navigation because this sluggishness and the audio delay that comes with using a Bluetooth connection added up to the app telling me to make turns after it was already too late to make them....which brings me to my biggest gripe of the moment, which is that there still doesn't seem to be a documented easy way to root the phone. I imagine my problem could be solved if I could get root access and disable or uninstall all of the preinstalled crapware (a lot of which usually seems to be running without my knowledge, when I look at the list of running apps).All this said, it still doesn't change my mind with regards to the phone's value. But you're seeking certain functionality that's only found in the newer versions of Android, this might not work for you.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect entry-level smartphone", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R3PIF3ZWINX6Z7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Someone stole my wife's new iPhone, so rather than pay $400+ for a new one, I talked her into giving this a try. It's a perfect entry-level smartphone. She's not extremely tech-savvy and doesn't need many bells and whistles so it's perfect...she loves it. This is a good phone, especially for the price. It's quick enough and doesn't have any lag issues. Good call quality and reception. The camera is just ok (only 3.2MP) and only 2GB of the phone's \"4GB\" is free so space is pretty limited (but expandable with a memory card). If you don't care as much about the camera being great or having a lot of internal memory, then it's the prefect android phone. It seems very solidly built as well, more so than AT&T;'s more expensive other GoPhone android, the \"avail\". Comparable battery life to my iPhone too.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Switched From iPhone and Won't Go Back", "Author": "BSlater", "ReviewID": "R15V2UT8LVORMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an iPhone 4 that I actually paid full price for and turned into an AT&T; GoPhone.  Long story short -- I didn't think I'd need access to a data plan, which you can't get on an iPhone unless you pay the ridiculous price of at least $70 a month and lock yourself into a 2 yr. contract, but I did need access to some on my MAC documents and syncing was so easy between the MacBook Pro and the iPhone 4. But I wound up with over $200 worth of unused minutes on the GoPhone plan that, as this is pretty much a casual-use phone, I knew I'd never use up.  So, I decided to use all that money just sitting in my GoPhone account by switching to the Fusion 2 Android phone at the $25 a month plan, and buying a $5 a month data plan -- which has turned out to be a great choice.I don't use the internet much on the phone, but on a few occasions I've found it valuable, especially retrieving important email I was waiting for.  I've found a great program called SmoothSync (paid about $2.50 for it) that syncs my iCal calendar with a great free calendar program called Business Calendar - a life saver.  I found a great app called Zedge where I get free ringtones and great wallpaper.  I use a Brother printer and with the Brother app I can print from my Fusion2. I lucked out over the holiday and got OfficeSuite Pro 6 free and the free A.I.Type Keyboard with the Swipe function -- which is a true marvel.  I've got all my AngryBird games, my Kindle app for reading my books while waiting at the doctor's office, and a ton of other goodies -- all for free on Amazon's Android Apps site and on Google Play.I really love this phone and will never go back to an iPhone -- the price is absurd, the iPhone is heavier in my purse, Apple won't allow you to use it with a data plan without locking in for 2 yrs. to $70 a month plan, you can't get apps except thru the App Store unless you jailbreak you phone.  With the Fusion 2 GoPhone I now have access to the internet and am not locked into a contract of any kind, I can get great apps from different vendors (sometimes on sale or for free!), the phone is lighter, I get better voice quality on this phone than on the iPhone, the screen quality is excellent -- I could go on and on.I've had at least a dozen cell phones in the last 12-15 years and can honestly say this is my favorite.  If there's one thing I could change it would be that I'd really prefer that AT&T; change their plan and make it like the non-smartphone plan which allows your unused minutes and data plan to roll over and to come down on the price of the monthly plan.  I used to pay $100 a year for my GoPhone, now it's going to be from $30-$40 a month depending on which data plan I purchase each month.  But still -- it's one of the best deals around.  Straight Talk's $45 a month plan sounds pretty good, but in my area the coverage isn't great quality.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone for this price range", "Author": "Moe Ringler", "ReviewID": "R2HX6THNMDSI8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the phone and called AT&T; to have it activated and although I don't think it's necessary - just as long as you have an old Sim card, it should work right away.

It's my first Android phone. I moved from a standard non-smartphone on a standard monthly plan to a GoPhone plan. I did not want a data plan, but wanted Wi-Fi at home and at work. It's possible with this phone.One thing I thought I would mention is that if you want the 10 cents a minute pay-as-you-go plan, it seems to me that AT&T; makes it difficult for you to select this plan when activating from either the phone, or activating from the website. I simply could not find the option. You can only select 1 of 3 plans when activating from the phone, and they are all monthly packages. And if you can find the 10 cents a minute plan on the website, they make you \"add a device\", and this device is not in the compatible device list. You will find a land line number in the book that comes with the phone, call this number and you can select the 10 cents a minute plan. I suppose you can go to an AT&T; store, or talk with someone. The live chat folks could not even tell me how to do it on the website. If you call the phone number listed in the book that comes with the phone, you will go through an automated procedure that will allow you to select the 10 cents a minute plan. Just say no when they ask if you have a smartphone.I also had trouble trying to cancel my monthly service and port my number to the GoPhone. I called and was told to go to the store, the store told me to call. No one would get it done. If you want to port your number, I would recommend just talking with the GoPhone customer service, they were fantastic and got it done.You can root the phone as well, and then remove all the apps you do not want, it comes with a lot of stuff you won't want.

Pay as you go is a cheap plan with cheap phones. It is unfair to compare them to an iPhone or any other smartphone, they can't even compete.

I now just pay for the time I talk, and I got a basic $10 a month text package, which suites me perfectly. I turned off the data and just use wi-fi, so my monthly usage is about $25 total, a huge improvement over my iPhone contract.The phone is very well made. It's just 3G, which isn't a big deal to me since I don't do data, and it is a tad slow on some of the apps, but it allows me to use my banking app, get email, text and talk for a fraction of what it used to cost me. I have had no problems with this phone, and it works very well. If you're into music, video, work apps and all the bells and whistles, this clearly isn't for you, but if your old flip-phone just doesn't cut it and you want to step up to a solid basic smartphone, I'd highly recommend this one.

Again, it is an awesome phone if you put the work into it. I added some pictures to the customer images section here, so check it out. I'm running CyanogenMod 10.1, and by gosh is it awesome. Do yourself a favor and get a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-016G-AFFP-A), set up Link2SD, and this thing will just fly.The new camera for 4.2/3 Google Experience devices works really nice on it. Holding it and using the volumes to snap pictures really helps with the clarity since it gives you a steady grip. I love the outcome of my after sunset shots too. Really nice for a somewhat crappy camera. I really like using Cameringo with it too, perfect camera app for this phone.And oh yeah, I accidentally walked out behind my carport when it was raining like bucket loads of water. The phone pretty much got submerged in it since it was in my hand at the time. But I was able to wipe it off with a towel, and it has been okay for the last two months since then.It's going to be HARD to go back to an iPhone.----------I am coming from a S2 Skyrocket that has a dented lens. So I'm coming from a phone that has a beautiful 8MP camera, 4G, and an awesome 4.5\" screen. Did I mention it had a better processor?The Fusion 2 feels great in your hands, I really like the back cover - It's grippy and not slippery like the Samsung phones. It took me like 20 minutes to get the back off to put my SIM and battery in though. I guess that's a positive when you think about it though. I have dropped my S2 in the past, and the cover and battery flew all over the place.It's fits nicely in my skinny jeans, which are the only type of pants I own. So that makes me happy. The camera software isn't as nice and complex, but I can live with that.Missing my Live Wallpapers already. I just recently found one with jungle animals made of clay. It was cute.The interface is uglier than TouchWiz, but as long as I don't have to go into settings, I have already sorted that out.Rooting is a must, it will make the experience better. I set my CPU governor to Conservative, and it makes a HUGE difference in performance. I'm also using Dialer + as a replacement dialer, it's beautiful. Dolphin Browser is working nicely too.I thought I was going to have to sacrifice most of my apps, but it was really only my Timetable one that wasn't Gingerbread certified, which is okay because I went back to my other favorite schedule app - Studious.It's not a good phone, but it isn't bad either. It'll work for me until the next iPhone comes out though.----------UPDATE on March 22, 2013I'm adding one more star because the battery life is AWESOME! I've been using it like crazy, and I still have like half of the battery left. It has a great standby, even with the amount of add-ons I have:Holo LauncherHolo LockerGloveboxPower TogglesBeWeather ProGames are working pretty nicely too. I have a good chunk of them that run pretty nice:Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EPAlice of HeartsBeat HazardBIT.TRIP BEATCanabaltDynamite JackEDGE ExtendedFieldrunnersMini Golf MatchUpNightSkyOsmosSpiritsSuper HexagonWorld of GooMost of them are from Humble Bundles though, I'm not sure if the stores would let you install them, but they work otherwise if you want to side load them from another device.One problem I encountered though is that you can't use both the internal storage and external SD card. I'm using a 2GB microSD myself, but I would try and go for a 4GB just for a little more room to breathe for your apps and games. Plan to leave it in there too, because like I said in my earlier review, taking off the back cover is a pain to take off!I got Live Wallpapers working too, and the phone is pretty good at putting everything to sleep, that they don't drain the battery. You'll have to side load them though.

Also if you press the power button all the way down, it won't turn the phone on, you have to get used to barely touching it to turn it on.

I had a basic Pantech phone that worked well but really wanted to try a smartphone. I've had the phone for 10 months and it's exceeded my expectations. This an Android 2.3 Gingerbread with responsive touchscreen and easy to set up. The 3.2 mp camera takes good pictures and decent video, as there are many options to customize your settings when taking a picture. You can add a 32 GB sd card for memory. I haven't used the MP3 player so I can't comment on that.I mainly text and use it for phone calls. The screen is 3.5 inches and keyboard is large enough for easy texting. I have small fingers but it may work for someone with big fingers as well. The Fusion 2 comes pre-loaded with many apps which can't be uninstalled. I don't care for that feature because it takes up space. Battery life is about 4-5 days without heavy use. I've gotten about 2 full days on a charge with heavy texting and using Wi-Fi. After 10 months it still holds a charge well and don't plan on replacing it anytime soon until it dies. The 800 Mhz dual processor is fast enough for downloading web pages and talking at the same time.The phone was intuitive to set up and I didn't use the manual. This was huge plus since I'm not technically savvy. My calls are clear and the Wi-Fi signal is strong when using the internet. Reception with the AT&T; GoPhone prepaid is better than my previous Verizon contract phone. I can get coverage in buildings and in areas where I previously traveled with Verizon that were nonexistent and spotty. GoPhone has many plan options for different budgets and it's simple to change plans as required.There are many Android apps available for this smartphone that make it very versatile to suit your needs.

We purchased a warranty from Walmart as well.  Here is the situation, the phone is about 7 months old, no water damage, no damage at all in perfect condition.  The phone began to freeze up, and send multiple meassages.  As a result, we purchased a Straight Talk phone and transferred the AT&T; number (have always had great customer service and warranty coverage with all family members from Straight Talk).  Since the phone is still under AT&T; warranty I was instructed to contact AT&T.;  BUT... AT&T; will not cover a phone because the number was transferred to a different phone.  I was willing for AT&T; to assign me a new number for the warranteed phone, but they will not do that.  Soo... if you purchase from AT&T; and your phone goes haywire, plan to be without a phone for as long as AT&T; decides.  I am extremely dissatified.  My first cell phone service was from AT&T.;  I transferred my services about 8 years ago, because of the poor phone reception in our area and the extremely high costs.  Well... a lesson learned.

The colored lights that tell you what you've received are neat. Such as a text lights up green or a Facebook notification lights up blue. The camera works just fine for me, I think the quality is good. I don't see why everyone is complaining about it.The phone size is good and fits perfectly in my hand (almost).I haven't tried the built in apps like the GPS or anything, but I hear they work pretty well, and I definitely need a GPS because I'm always lost.Honestly, if this is your first smart phone, I think you'll enjoy it.
