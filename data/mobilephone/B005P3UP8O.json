You will only get a GT-i9100G, which is not the same but a substandard version of GT-i9100. I know that it is hard to find a GT-i9100 and I was excited to find it here on amazon, everything matched a GT-i9100 including the technical details of having \"Mali-400MP\" GPU, which is the only reason I bought this. Then I was stuck with a GT-i9100G. Seller confirmed that they only have the G Version and not the GT-i9100. This is cheating, do not buy from them unless you are looking for the \"G\" version.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "very very bad", "Author": "yaznel montoya", "ReviewID": "R1KUMOLUJ6DHZI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "phone charger arrived in poor condition, the phone can not be locked. restarts and off constantly, no matter which operating system is installed.

The Nexus only had 8GB (I call it an Android iPhone - and I do not like iPhones!) I was not able to download near enough apps and other files as I would have liked (took about 5 days to run out of storage space) ....BUT my Galaxy S II is WONDIFEROUS!!! I was able to add my 32GB SD card to it and will not be able to fill it up (at least not for a looong time!), and it has awesome colors, and everything I need in a \"palmtop\"!!! I am sooo glad I was able to return the Nexus and get this phone!
