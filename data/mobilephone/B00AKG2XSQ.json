{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost Perfect for Under $100 Just got Patched to Jelly Bean!", "Author": "SirStinky", "ReviewID": "RUGTRWP4EH7G3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Last week, T-Mobile sent a patch to Android 4.1 Jellybean! I really like the subtle changes with 4.1, and the handset actually runs better with some apps. If you are on T-Mobile, be watching for it.I have been living with the Optimus L9 for about 3 weeks, and so far I like it a lot. I have been a Samsung faithful for the last 3 handsets I've owned, so I was reluctant to give them up. I got the L9 sort of by accident (or at least unintentionally) when I was looking for a way to save money on my phone, and for when my contract was eligible for a new phone upgrade. I really wanted the Nexus 4, or Galaxy S2 or S3, but after I had gone through the different plan options and found the one that saved me the most money (you can't get a better deal for a wireless service than through T-Mobile), I found that those phones were more expensive than I could afford because I was on a Value Plan that you pay a down payment for a phone, then make payments on each bill. The rep suggested the L9 and said it was a really good phone, and I could get it basically for free with my plan, so I went for it, and now I'm glad I did.The Optimus L9 is the upgrade to the Europe and Asia market L7 and the counterpart to the European and Asian L9 P760, which has a larger screen. The American-market L9 is the P769 only available on T-Mobile. The L9 is in a class by itself, a lot like the Exhibit 4G made by Samsung, which was also a budget mid-range device (I owned it and it's great). You could call the L9 the Optimus G's little cousin, but it has a ton of features that really don't belong on a sub-$100 phone. There are some impressive hardware specs here. Not the fastest or most cutting-edge, but good enough, and you can tell where LG cut corners to get the price down. There's no 8 megapixel camera, AMOLED high-res HD screen, quad-core processors, or exotic materials. What you get is in my opinion, the best budget phone out there. Period.I like how it looks. It doesn't look like it's cheap. This is made by LG, and every LG handset I have owned has been top-notch in terms of build quality and ascetics. It is made entirely of plastic, but it's high quality with no creaks or gaps, looks really nice and feels very solid in the hand. The back is pretty bendy, but feels very sturdy and snaps back into place securely with no gaps. It isn't a small device, about 5\" tall, 3\" wide, but only .36\" thick, not as thin as the GS3, but still impressively slim. It weighs under 5 ounces with the battery. It has a soft-touch battery cover with a texturing on it to make it easy to hold, and it has a chrome strip around the perimeter. The front is covered in Gorilla Glass 2 and is completely flush to the phone's frame. There are only 3 physical hardware buttons: the lock/unlock/power button, volume rocker/camera zoom, and home key, which is mounted flush with the glass. All the buttons feel very solid and don't require a lot of pressure to work, but enough so you don't accidentally push them. The large button functions as a \"home\" or task manager button with 2 capacitive soft keys for menus and return functions.The software and hardware set of the L9 is impressive! It runs Android Ice Cream Sandwich v. 4.04 mixed with LG's UI and some add on's from T-Mobile, (which I didn't like). Everything is customizable and able to be personalized, menus, the lock screen, wallpapers, widgets, and home screens are all customizable, and all the menus and controls were easy to master. There will be a learning curve if you're coming from something like iOS or Android 2.2 or 2.3.6, but it's not hard to get the hang of it. The T-Mobile bloatware is extremely annoying. I was greeted by the Lookout app after every reboot and every app I downloaded. You can disable them, but you can't uninstall them. I really don't need things like T-Mobile TV, MediaHub, CMAS, Backup utilities, SmartShare, T-Mobile or LG's (I can't tell with) Smart Setup Wizard, T-Mobile Name ID (an optional paid subscription), Caller Tunes, Amazon, Bonus Apps, Chrome, Face Unlock, Contact Manager, GameBase, Google Play Music, Books, TV & Movies, Magazines, and Music, Google+, Lookout Security, More For Me, MobileLife, Social+, and Zynga. It really drove me a little crazy knowing I can't uninstall them without rooting the phone (and voiding the warranty). Messaging was a mixed bag. I am used to my Swipe keyboard and I fell in love with it, but was very disappointed with LG's version. It misspells words, grabs the wrong word, and often can't decide which word form to use, opting for a contraction other than a whole word. Very annoying when I need to text fast. Now I am back to mostly hunting-and-pecking like on my older Samsung phones.The screen is a very nice capacitive 4.5\" IPS LCD with qHD resolution of 960x540, 16 million colors, and 236 pixels per inch. Certainly not as good as the GS3, One S, or Note II, but for under $100 you won't get any better. The screen is responsive to my touches, very bright, and I was impressed with the viewing angles and how well it performed in sunlight. It is easily one of the brightest screens I've seen in a smartphone. The ppi might be a little low, but the fonts and pictures and icons looked great, nice and crisp. You could see pixels if you looked really close, but otherwise you couldn't. Inside there's a dual-core processor. It's a TI (yes, Texas Instruments) OMAP 4430 1 GHz with the ARM Cortex-A9 GPU. They are paired with 4 GB of internal memory, over half of which is preoccupied with the OS and preinstalled bloatware, so you actually get to use 1.8 GB of it for apps and things. On the plus, there's a MicroSD slot that will take a 32 GB card for expansion. The phone takes a micro-SIM card, and both the SIM and memory card are underneath the battery cover. I was really glad to see that the SD card is hot swappable (thanks T-Mobile).For the camera you get a 5 megapixel unit with LED flash, plus a 1.3 MP front-facing camera. It records full HD 1080p video as well, not bad for a sub-$100 device! I am kind of picky about my handset cameras, and I found the camera to take pretty decent pictures overall. If you are switching from a basement 3.2 MP camera, you'll tell an immediate difference. You can definitely print these photos, and you'll be really happy with the results, but they aren't as refined as a comparable 5 MP Samsung camera on the Galaxy S line. Low light shots are very noisy and lack fine details that are present in shots in brighter conditions. The flash is a strobe-type LED that's decently bright and helps out indoor pictures, but outdoor shots in low light were still underexposed if your subject is more than 6 feet away. There is a decent assortment of photo tools and shooting modes to adjust to get the pictures how you want it, but not nearly as many as the Samsung or higher-end LG handset cameras. You can adjust things like white balance, ISO, exposure, color, image size (1, 3, 5 megapixels), image effects, shooting modes like portrait, sunset, panorama, and burst mode. There is also geo-tagging, smile shot, face detection, and a cool feature that snaps the picture when you say \"cheese.\"The camera has continuous auto focus, so it focuses when you pause on an object. The shooting performance is really good. From focus to preview takes about half a second. The camera definitely doesn't reflect it's price though and most everyone I know who has seen the pictures was really impressed. Video recording is also good. LG says 1080p at 24-30 FPS, and I concur that. The videos look pretty nice, way better than 720 or D1 found on cheaper handsets. You do get continuous autofocus, adjustable video resolution from VGA to full HD, and most of the same functions of the still camera like color effects, white balance, exposure, scene modes, and video effects called \"live effects\" like funny faces, and different backgrounds that were pretty neat. You can use the flash as a video light as well.The battery is a 2150 MAh li-ion cell that you can remove and replace. I found to give pretty decent battery life. I got 2 days worth of using the web and calls before it was down to 10%.Functionally, I was very impressed with the phone's performance. Even though it's \"older\" technology in the TI OMAP 4430 CPU and ARM Cortex-A9, it's definitely not low-end or slow. Even at 1 GHz, it's easily as fast as the 1.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 CPU in the Galaxy S2. I never had a problem with lagging, freezing, crashing, or choppiness when viewing web pages with Flash content, and scrolling as very smooth. I like to use my phone with mobile Bible apps like Logos, Faithlife, and YouVersion, which put stress on the phone when viewing pages full screen on a large screen, but I never experienced any issues. Google Maps and the Navigation used to really stall and trip my Exhibit up (even causing crashes), but not the L9! Web browsing with Dolphin was excellent, one of the best web experiences I've had with a phone. I was nothing short of impressed with the snappiness of this handset! The back did get warm under heavy CPU use though, but not enough to be alarming.Call quality was excellent. Voices came in loud and clear and I never heard any complaints from callers. The audio performance was a little rough though as the speakerphone was very tinny and sharp sounding at high volume, which I will say is really loud. The same translated to movies and music as well, which hurt audio quality. Reception was also great on T-Mobile. I got good reception everywhere I went, even in dead-spots for other phones. For data connectivity, the L9 runs on T-Mobile's HSPA+ 4G network. However, you don't get access to the full 42 MBPS data rates you get with the Galaxy S, S2, HTC One S, and Galaxy S3. This phone runs on the \"slower\" 21 MBPS modem, but that's not a huge deal as I would get about 5-7 MBPS up and 1-4 MBPS down. Not blazing fast, but good enough for most every need I had. Not really a huge concern to me because I don't have a ton of apps, but because this has ICS, you can't move or save apps to the external memory. For some, the internal storage would get filled quickly and make installing new apps impossible. A patch to Jelly Bean would rectify this, but I can't see that happening any time soon, if ever.So that's the L9. It's about as good as you can get for the price, something no other carrier can claim. The L9 was designed to fill an extremely important spot in T-Mobile's handset hierarchy, the space between the low-end, budget phones and the high-end flagship handsets. Their first venture into the gap was the Exhibit 4G, which I thought was pretty good. All of the flagship devices will set you back a pretty penny even with a 2-year subsidized contract, and are stupid-expensive when purchased off-contract ($600 and up). The L9 can be had for $80 on contract, $369 off, and is even more manageable when on a Value Plan. I pay less than $20 for both handsets on my monthly plan, and I will be able to upgrade in 20 months. I have no reservations saying the L9 will keep me happy for a couple years!Pros:Android ICS with un-intrusive LG UIDual core CPUHot swappable expandable MicroSD storageRemovable battery1 GB RAM, 4 GB internal storage5 MP camera with flash1080p video recordingNice 4.5\" qHD IPS screenGorilla Glass 2 frontVery high quality materialsExcellent build qualityGreat call qualityCons:Over 2 GB of internal storage occupied by the OS and bloatwareLots of annoying bloatware that can't be removedCan't save or move apps to SD cardCamera could be betterBattery life is only averageHorrible LG \"swipe\" keyboardIt's not perfect, and it's obvious that LG had to cut some corners to keep the price low. There's no 8 MP camera with lots of functions, high-end processor, 8 or 16 GB internal storage, or super-high resolution screen. The camera could be better, so could the data speeds, and the loudspeaker needs some work, but for what it is, I can't find a better handset out there. I'm a Samsung faithful and have always had Samsung handsets after a poor experience with my LG Viewty KU990, but I would chose this over the Galaxy S2 on the basis of value. I can confidently say that you won't find a better value for the dollar out there.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Avoid Until an UpdateIs Available", "Author": "Ryan Sondalle", "ReviewID": "R3LA6RBU1YYSRO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'll leave my original review down below but here is my updated change to a 1 star. LG and T-mobile have released Android 4.1.2 jellybean and it has ruined WiFi. By ruined i mean you will not have the option to use WiFi on this phone, it will not function. Neither LG nor T-mobile give a crap about the issue and they refuse to fix the issue, so until they decide to fix it I would not recommend anyone buy this phone. If they do ever fix it my review below explains how it is alright, but without WiFi this is junk! Thanks for nothing T-mobile and LG.----I'm going to start with the negatives because people have an extreme lack of knowledge regarding the negative areas and how they reflect to the phone.Cons:1. Camera, it's pretty crappy quality compared to what's out there today, but people forget that this phone is $200 or less with no contract. The phones they compare it to cost $200 with a contract ($600+ phones without a contract). You can't compare a Hyundai to a BMW folks.2. No apps to SD card. This is annoying, but this is googles fault not LG's. When they developed android 4.0 they stopped letting you move apps. Also this is a budget phone. And 2gb is enough for your basic apps. if you need music you can load that directly to your SD card using your pc, which is really the point behind the SD card.3. Random features it doesn't offer. This is a Miscelleaneous category basically to address the fact that people constantly come up with random stuff this phone can't do. this is a $200 phone, not a $600 phone. don't get mad that the $600 phone has capabilities that this doesnt. You get what you pay for.Pros:1.Battery life. My phone usually runs over 1 full day before charging (with me stopping to charge around 20% of the battery left). My nexus s died after 5 hours of mediocre use.2.Speed.the phone just processes quickly. on basically everything.3.Price. This phone is $200 without a contract. My old phone was $150 with a 2 year contract i then paid $8 a month for insurance, and when it broke after a year and a half of use (completely on its own, it wouldnt turn on) i had to pay $100 claim form. altogether i paid $394 for a phone that's a piece of junk and could never do what this phone does. The only thing the other phone could do better was take pictures.Hands down this is the best phone in its price class. It can keep up to the expensive phones, but obviously is not quite as good. But when you say you can get a $200 phone with no contract that does as good of a job as a $600 phone, that's impressive. The savings in the long run alone make this phone worthwhile.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great deal for the price", "Author": "K.

I paid for 200$ for it and I am not going to expect this phone to have features that 700$ phones have. This is the only phone that is both \"Brand Name\" and has 4.0 OS.Link to Manufacturer site. [...]PROS-Light, Thin, Large dialing buttons, camera flash (could be life saver)CONS-Camera is okay at best. Once you learn to click and tell the camera what you want to focus on, the pictures improve.-Physical (click click) HOME button. It is matter of time before dirt / water gets in there.-LG and Tmobile have loaded it with crap / bloat ware. You can remove some things but not all. The phone is still not slow.DETAILED FEEDBACK BY DATE. I would like to come back and update this as I learn more but no promises.3/1/13 - I purchased this phone directly from tmobile's prepaid phone website for 200$. It meets the intial expecations. Large dialing buttons. 4.0 is stable OS and there is hardly anything missing as compared to 4.1.UPDATE 4/15/13 .. All the initial feedback is still true.Camera results are much improved once I learnt to be a little patient with it. The voice shutter function is not consistent. This could be a user error.Few things I learnt.Press power and home button together to do a quick screen capture.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a good phone", "Author": "V. Verdes \"Vio\"", "ReviewID": "R3V0VU04N5ZF79", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will briefly state the negatives and positives of this phone. In fact there are more positives then negatives.Camera quality is so so. I rarely use it for taking professional photos.Camcorder is ok. Don't expect clear image in low-light environment. Even the small built-in flash doesn't help. Outside in bright light is a different story. Still not the same quality of a dedicated camcorder.Internet is fast. Battery...hmm... I think for a screen this size it is adequate.The proximity sensor is something that I missed on my 2 other smartphones. Even the Galaxy S didn't have it which was very annoying when making phone calls.Did I mention the customizable quick menu bar? This is nice in the new Cream Sandwich.The negatives are:A whole load of bloatware from both LG and T-mobile. Some can be deleted, with rest not so lucky.The HOME button gets very frustrating when I have to press it 2 or 3 times to wake the phone. I don't know if it's a defect or a random glitch. But enough to cause a headache. The thing is, it doesn't always do it. Just random.One other downside is the fact that to answer a call one must perform a sliding movement on the screen instead of just tapping the ANSWER button/icon. With time this can get nerve-breaking. On the Galaxy S and many other phones a simple tap on that icon connects the call.And probably the greatest disadvantage is the sound. I am not saying it's not loud enough, in this regards it's average =ok. But when listening to music the sound feels empty. It does not have the lows and the bass is mediocre.I put my Sony Ericsson next to the LG L9 and started playing various same songs at the same time to hear the difference. The Ericsson had a full deeper and more pleasant sound and properly balanced. The LG was a disappointment. And I really count on a phone's sound for music as I use the music player more than any other application.Truly LG hit the hard bottom with its sound quality. Sony and Samsung surpass it in this field.But going back to my statement. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages so I still love the phone.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glad I finally made the switch!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R10Q1S2ID7YERP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been thinking about jumping ship and switching to a no contract deal for almost a year and when my HTC Evo Shift just bit the dust and refused to turn on ever again, I figured this was the universe's way of saying \"NOW IS THE TIME!\"So I went to a store and checked out all the phones, chose the Optimus L9, ordered it here and the rest is pretty much history. I did go into the store since I didn't see anything about bringing your existing number with you and it took them less than 15 minutes to get me all set up and ready to go. The phone started working with my number within two hours.I haven't loved a phone this much since I got my first Blackberry way back in another millenium. I paid around $800 for it and was amazed at what it could do. This isn't my first Android, touch screen, OR 4G phone, but so far it's my favorite phone for quite awhile.It was simple to set up, easy to find accessories for, easy to use and I'm not having any problems with the service either. I love the wi-fi feature so it just uses the internet whenever I'm home and getting umlimited everything for $50 is awesome.Since it's only been a little while, I know that it's still highly possible that I could end up hating this phone more than Satan himself (or my first REAL ex, you know? hate him a lot too)...but for now, I'm loving it.I'll let you know if that changes.

Ragsdill", "ReviewID": "R1JUBXW01ZD63L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have enjoyed the last few weeks with my LG Optimus 9 very much (once T-MO resolved issues on their side, but that's not the phone's fault).  It seems very responsive, I have never noticed any lag at all.  4G speeds seem decent enough and it flies on wifi.  The screen is a thing a beauty.  Battery life is about a day which is what I expected from these types of smart phones.My wife got a Galaxy S4, and while I can tell it is faster and has more bells and whistles.... is it $500 better?  NOPE.Some things I have noticed that do not detract from my experience, just things I wonder about...Once the phone turned itself off for no reason, and I had to remove and reseat the battery to get it to come back up.  No idea why, had 50% or so of battery left.  Strange.The touch screen doesn't like sweaty hands, I doubt this is a problem exclusive to the L9, just touchscreens in general.  I was outside all day in the Texas summer heat the other day and someone called me.... I couldn't get it to register my finger swipe to answer the call, my finger was too sweaty.  I had to find a dry spot on me to wipe it off (my sock was the only thing I was wearing that wasn't soaked to the bone) then call the person back.  Maybe there is another way to answer a call I don't know about.The screen is really hard to see in direct sunlight, but then again so is my wife's GS4, our previous phones (optimus M and Galaxy S) and just about every cell phone I have owned in the last 10 years that uses an LCD screen.  This is more of a gripe of LCD touchscreens in general, maybe someday they will come up with one you can see outside.The speakerphone at max volume sounds very echo-y if you are holding the phone.  If you put it down on a flat surface it sounds better.  Knocking down the volume a notch or 2 takes care of it.All in all I am very happy with it, and it was $500 cheaper than my wife's GS4.

I was very interested in trying a T Mobile monthly plan, since it was attractively priced and wanted a true \"smartphone\" without the financial commitment of buying an unlocked I Phone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S III (both of which looked like pretty great products).  This phone was an obvious answer after looking at options, using a pretty advanced Android system and having a nice range of features for a novice user.I have not been disappointed.  The phone has been easy to use and budget friendly.  It is NOT truly unlocked, as I could not just slip in a foreign carriers SIM card on a recent trip to Asia. The phone also provides wifi tethering (for a fee) which is useful when I commute and bring along my laptop or I Pad.  The negative comments about the camera and internal speaker are justified, but I still believe a phone camera is an emergency solution and not an alternate for a real camera.

Has nothing to do with the 4.1.2 update).This phone is magnificent. Out of the box there was one thing that made me uncomfortable and was the fact that it's too light for my used-to-carry-a-BBBold 9930 hands. This of course are great news for some people, therefore I'm not considering it to be a reason to take a star off my review. Very light, slim and comfortable build. When I actually bought it, there was a sale event at TMo and I got it for $100. i immediately bought a screen protector and a rubber case, which have made the phone to stay in mint conditions.This phone is Wi-Fi calling enabled, this means that whenever you are connected to a WiFi network, your phone will disconnect from the TMO network and all your communication will go through the internet instead of the antennas. Now TMo has unlimited calls and texts, so this won't represent any savings in those areas, but the high-speed data is not unlimited, and the fact that you get \"unplugged\" from the TMo network assures that not a single little byte will get out of your monthly data plan.If that was it, it'd be enough for most people. There's more. WiFi calling enables you to use your phone outside of the United States AS IF you were in American soil as long as you are connected to a WiFi network. The moment I proved this was possible, I jumped into my.t-mobile.com and bought two more of this phones. See, the core of my family lives outside of the US, and for years I've had to pay for services like Vonage or MagicJack, even Google Voice, and to realize that I could get rid of all those services by adding a line to my TMo plan for just $10 left me speechless.This phone may not have the best features, it may come packed with lots of bloatware (carrier apps, pre-installed and not easily removable), but I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a low-cost solution. It also takes very decent pictures.The reason why this phone is getting 4 starts instead of 5 is the low internal storage. For someone who exchanges a lot of media content with friends or likes to install all sort of games and apps, this phone will get packed up real quick. I've had to clean up my phone multiple times. I'm now left with the essential apps, and I clean up my phone in a regular basis. There are ways of getting around this problem, but it's not easy.In response to Alexander, a review from three days ago, the word \"unlocked\" is not used anywhere in the description of the product. But, if you are a TMo customer, you can request the unlock code and then you'll be free to use it in another network.I respect the opinion of everyone who's leaving bad reviews, but for those who are looking into buying a new phone I can vouch for this one.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay phone but not easy in the hands.", "Author": "80sGuy", "ReviewID": "R1T9LF7PR040HC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone itself is very light, thin and somewhat stylish but I find it a bit difficult to handle while trying to work with one hand (scrolling/selecting name from contact list, dialing, etc.) due to its larger, wider size. But all this comes with the reward of a larger screen and this is ideal for people who are constantly utilizing the phone for internet data instead of the more casual uses such as voice calling and texting. Calls made are crystal clear from both ends, but of course that all depends on the reception. I use T-Mobile's 'Wifi Calling' (a must) since I get ZERO bars inside my home and it helps a great deal! The L9 has a huge 80s-style dial pad which feels good to the touch. You can also set it to touch vibrate along with a sounding tone. In fact the whole device kind of reminisces the 80s with its sharp features and rectangular shaped body except for all the extra high tech internet stuff. There are however a few major drawbacks on this phone; one of which is lacking an ambient sensor for the screen display. This means that you'll have to manually set the screen brightness to 'high' when used outdoors, and lower it back down during evenings -- unless you're okay with extreme brightness glowing in dark environments. The other small nuisance would be the 'Home' button -- where it requires a physical push. It's not a big deal but definitely not something you'd expect after getting used to all the soft touches. Despite some minor negatives, the L9 does come packed with a beefy Li-ion cell rated at 2150mAh and for this; battery life is excellent even with Wifi turned on all day. Here's the breakdown of some of the features I personally find either a plus or minus:Camera (5MP): not the easiest to use and not the greatest.Video Camera: great 1920x1080 HD videos!Speaker: adequate for casual conversation and news videos, but not for music playback.Internal storage: only 2Gb left after bloatware and software installation. I bought a 4GB MicroSD to store photos.Screen: nice and big for videos but hard to view in bright daylight, and lacking ambient sensor control.Battery: plenty at 2150mAh!Bluetooth: slow to recognize device and does not initiate automatically.Overall, the phone isn't bad if you can find a nice place to hold it, in my case it would be in my rear jean pocket (NOT the best place). Like I mentioned, it is quite some work when trying to initiate a call with one hand while driving because the phone does not provide a good 'grip'.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect budget friendly phone", "Author": "beno77", "ReviewID": "R1AEEWQW501T2I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a no contract phone, this is one of the best for the money. For $179 you get a phone that basically has the same features as the $650 phone such as the HTC One or Galaxy S4. Sure, the resolution of the screen isn't as good nor is the camera but from a FUNCTIONAL point of view it's on par. You can play Angry Birds or Candy Crush, tweet or update your facebook status just like any of the big boy phones. The camera is 5 megapixels, which is on par with the iPhone 4, and back in its day, the iPhone 4 had a nice camera. The camera on this phone is more than you need to take pictures of food that you will later post on Instagram, and the front facing camera is good enough to go wild on taking \"selfies\"It has a dual core 1ghz processor, which makes everything very fast. The UI is silky smooth running jellybean. I'm a huge geek with gadgets and I can tell you right now that NOBODY needs a quad core processor. What do you hope to accomplish with that much speed and power? If you want to play xbox quality games, get an xbox. If you want professional camera shots, buy a camera.For prepaid fans, this is hands down the best phone to get.

For people that want AT&T; prepaid services such as H2O Wireless, this phone can be easily unlocked. Call T-Mobile and they give you the unlocking code and instructions. I'm personally running H2O Wireless because AT&T; has better service in my area than T-Mobile and the HSPA+ speed is phenomenal.For people who want to root their phones, they have a very easy method, just google LGPwn.apk.Pros: Very thin, light, and gorgeous screen. Fast UI. Easily unlocked. SD Card slot. Basically all you need in a smartphone unless you want the gimmicky features of the higher end phones for 500 bux more.Cons: External speaker for watching movies or listening to music is very low and tinny. Use headphone. 4GB internal memory is a huge bummer as you can only install apps to that 4GB, the SD Card can only be used for media files such as music and movies. The 4GB is used for the actual apps. There's probably a way through it but I don't know as of right now. Also make sure you turn off background data or you will eat through your data plan just by having the phone turned on. That's an issue with all android phones. This phone also runs very hot from doing anything, but maybe it is because it is very thin and I don't have a cover case like I do on my iphone 4s, which probably gets hot as well. Tons of bloatware from t-mobile is everywhere on this phone. Root it to remove the junk.Overall: Best phone for the money. $179 no contract and it can work on AT&T.; AT&T; no contract phones CAN work on T-Mobile but you will be stuck on EDGE unless your area was refarmed to use 1900mhz but T-Mobile phones will run on AT&T; no problem. It has its problems like all android phones inherently have but the price point is unbeatable.The only other unlocked phone I would consider is the BLU LIFE PLAY sold on amazon as well but it is $229.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Can't Believe it's Just a Mid-Range Phone", "Author": "Richard Brown \"Rich\"", "ReviewID": "R2GE1WG1DDBACW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The L9 is without doubt the best smartphone I've ever owned.

Its internal memory, otherwise known as ROM, is, as you know, only 4GB. That wouldn't be so bad if you could offset that 4GB with a 32GB Sandisk card (for about $32 extra, or less). However, what you don't know, and can't know until/unless you actually have the phone in your hands and you actually log into your Google Play account to download an app, is that you, essentially, can't download any apps, because you have far less than 1 GB, depending on what apps come pre-loaded on your phone (mine has only 600 MB of truly-free available space). They operating system \"says\" you have 1.8GB of usable space, but, that comes pre-loaded with 600MB of what turns out to be non-removeable bload. Note this very clearly, that 600 MB of pre-loaded applications can NOT be deleted. It can't even be moved to the 32-GB micro-sd card. It's there forever (save a jailbreak, which is the only way to make this phone usable). Nobody will tell you this ahead of time, so, mark my words and see for yourself if you already own this phone. You can not move or delete the pre-loaded apps (most of which are useless, and which are listed below). In a very short time, your remaining 600 MB of internal memory will be used up with apps, and, after that, you're stuck. It's a brick at that point. You can't download any new apps directly to the SD card, so, you're stuck.  In summary, all the specs of the phone are for naught if you can't put apps on it. So, it's worthless.

I was worried about the limited 4GB internal memory, of which about 2GB is already taken up with bloatware but I thought, since I'm not a gamer, maybe I wouldn't run out of memory. But I did because I use a lot of productivity and news apps (Evernote, dropbox, skydrive, googledrive, scholarley, google maps / calendar / email /+, NY Times, Circa etc. - it added up). Eventually, apps wouldn't update because they'd run out of space. So I traded with my wife (who is a low-end user) for her Samsung Galaxy S2 which has lots more internal memory and is more expensive. And guess what? It turns out the L9 is NOTICEABLY faster and has a more intuitive user interface than the S2. For example, on the L9, when you get a text message, it shows you who it's from and shows the beginning of the message right in the notifications. So, let's say it's a spam message from T-Mobile, you know right away it's not an urgent message from your wife and can wait or be ignored. On the galaxy, it just shows a non-descript envelope icon and you have to go into the message to see whether it's T-Mobile or your wife. Similarly, on the L9, from within a text message, you can click directly to call the person back. On the galaxy, you have to go back into the contacts to do that. And also, the L9 is much sleeker - again, noticeably so. The profile of the L9 in your hand and in your pocket (if you don't use a case, which you don't need to because it's so light that even if it falls there's no weight to damage it) is almost non-existent. The only advantage of the galaxy is the fancy OLED screen which is definitely more vibrant - but I didn't care much about that.Yes I am a productivity nut and these differences may not matter that much to everyone :-) But the point is, if you can live with 1.8GB of memory, this is actually a great phone.

As an existing customer I simply headed down to a T-Mo store and moved my number from the old mini SIM to this one at no cost.HARDWARE. You'll definitely want to get a case for this phone if you're paranoid about dropping it as it feels delicate. 1 GB of RAM should be enough for most; I'm a pretty hard user and I hardly ever run out of memory. You get a 5 MP rear camera which gets the job done. I would avoid shooting 1080p as the recording hiccups on occasion. 720p works well. The front-facing camera sucks; don't expect anything special from it.SOFTWARE. This is a mixed bag for me. You get v. 4.1.2 of Jelly Bean which is fine if you don't care for the newer minor updates. The phone ships with a gripload of bloatware; expect to disable quite a number of things. The interface is mostly responsive but can lag after a while. One thing to note: I've never had to do a battery pull. Yet.There are a few nice touches brought over from the world of dumbphones. For instance, you can set speed dials for your contacts. This saves me from a few extra taps over to the Favorites tab in the Contacts app or from having to create shortcuts on one of the home screens. You can also display a custom banner on the lock screen.GPS locks can be frustrating with this phone and is most noticeable using navigation apps such as Waze. Sometimes the phone will lose GPS at random times for seemingly no reason, even with a clear view of the sky.I have still yet to figure out if this is an issue with T-Mo or the phone, but when I drop to 2G (EDGE) I can't get ANY data whatsoever. I didn't have this problem when I was using an unlocked phone with a T-Mo SIM.T-Mobile's Wi-Fi calling is baked into the ROM and I would consider this a killer feature. If you can get Wi-Fi, you can call out similar to the way Republic Wireless works.STORAGE SPACE. You're limited to just 1.8 GB of internal space. But here's what really gets under my skin: The internal space is considered the \"SD card.\" Many apps are hard-coded to assume that the path to your SD card is at /mnt/sdcard and will dump all of their data files there. Those data files can really add up. If you do get a microSD card, you're pretty much limited to storing photos, video, and music (and of course, whatever else you put on there from your PC).BATTERY LIFE. I get about 10 hours with moderate usage.CALL QUALITY. Decent, depending on your signal. Then again, you have Wi-Fi calling at your disposal. ;)BOTTOM LINE. This is a great smartphone for the price and I would recommend it for those who want T-Mo's Wi-Fi calling baked in and don't mind a bit of carrier branding.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "amazing value", "Author": "Romeo Stevens", "ReviewID": "R22FUH6ZKGR25P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't know why LG isn't more popular.  80% of the performance and features of flagship phones from other companies for 30% of the price.

Here are the CONS: Comes with bloat ware installed, the battery doesn't seem to last very long (but it could be the apps I'm running), MP3 player has just so-so sound quality, the \"answer call\" swipe thingy can be stubborn when the phone is locked and I've actually missed calls while trying to swipe \"answer call\" over and over, the dialpad will frequently go black when on a call so that I can't input numbers, the power button is very small and I have to press it very hard to get it to engage. The worst thing about this phone for me is that it is so full of preloaded apps, hardly any new ones can be downloaded. There just isn't enough memory.

I traded quad core and better gpu for the average because of external storage.The bad: ICS, limited storage for apps 1.8GB, not the easiest phone to root, some may find 1GB of ram limiting. My phone runs everything i need, no problems. After upgrading to JB 4.1 ram management is much better. No hardware USB/OTG support, no exfat/ntfs support. Sometimes i use recording apps both audio and video and need to have files larger than 4GB. 4.1 offers better support for ntfs but i still need to use a third party app to mount ntfs sd card. The screen is usable in bright sunlight but i wish it was brighter for better visibility or whatever works better in the sun.

If you currently have the regular sized sim card, you can bring it to any tmobile and they will cut it for you (for free), so no worries there.It's size is a little bigger than I thought because I was transitioning from a smaller phone. The graphics and colors are pretty good, but I'm no techie, so I guess I can't really vouch for it being spectacular.DISLIKES:-The camera quality is OKAY. Just like any other phone, it works best in outdoor lighting. The front camera kinda sucks though.I was hoping that the quality would be a little better, but it's only mediocre.-I would definitely get a case for this phone because the back of the phone is cheaply made. It's a thin plastic that I feel like I could crack just from bending it too far. The sides of the phone are also thinly lined with some sort of thin metal. I dropped my phone when I took off the case and now the metal part is dented.--also, there aren't many nice cases for this phone. Many designs will not fit the tmobile version because the camera is centered in the back instead of slightly to the side as in the international version.-NOT ENOUGH MEMORY space. Although you can extend the memory capacity with an SD card, that is only for media files. Apps and other things will not be directed to the SD card so the number of apps you can have on the phone is minimal. Also, there are some apps in the phone that can not be deleted because they are preset in there. :(LIKES:-Charges pretty quickly and usually lasts the whole day with minimum-average usages (texting, instagram, fb, etc.)WARNING~ if you are super active on those social networking sites and using apps, your battery will die within hours (it has happened to me.)The good thing is that the charger is small and a USB kind of charger so I can charge on the go or when I'm at school.-Easy (almost no) setup is needed.-Lots of options to customize-Easy to use.

The headphone jack on that phone was broken, and so I was looking for a replacement that was less expensive than the Nexus and Galaxy models, but that still performed well.The LG Optimus L9 certainly filled that requirement. Its $100 cheaper from this seller than in the T-Mobile store but the product was indistinguishable. It arrived on time (next day shipping was only $4) and I took it into the store where an assistant moved my plan from my mini sim card to my new micro sum card for the Optimus. Literally took 5 minutes and I had a signal, 4G, the works.The phone looks and feels nice. It doesn't have that cheap feeling that a lot of low end Android phones have. Biggest problem that I ran into was the crappy LG keyboard, which was easily replaced by downloading the  ICS Keyboard from the market.Battery life was one of the reasons I bought this phone, and I was thoroughly impressed. After a full days use, including an hour replying to email and surfing the web, playing an hour or music or so, and miscellaneous useage here and there, the battery life was 25% in the evening, and 10% when I plugged it back in as I went to bed.Many reviews say that it doesn't perform like high end phones. They are probably right --  I can't say as I've never used a Galaxy S 3 or similar phones. But from a practical stand point I cant see needing any more computing power in a phone.In short: Phone is great. Price is great.

If you root, this becomes a 5-star device.PROS:Jelly Bean! Much better than ICS and not a bad implementation at all.Good CPU+GPU for the price range. Runs GTA3, GTAVC, Max Payne, etc.LG launcher is pretty good, using Nova Prime now thoughStable, only ever found three bugs which were all fixed by OTAGreat camera, shoots smooth 1080P video and takes good picturesGreat call qualityCONS:Battery life (especially out of the box)BloatwareHandicapped method of handling SD cards, probably meant to upsell power users to phones that cost 3-4x as muchNo native tethering like older LG Android phones, they are drinking the carrier Kool-Aid nowWHY YOU NEED ROOT:Poor internal storage with SD-Card mounted under restrictions. This means that if you want to install GTA3, Max Payne, Vice City, etc (all of which the phone will run well enough to play) you NEED root with FolderMount / Link2SD. Link2SD is also helpful for linking smaller apps to SD to reduce space usage and removing useless crap like T-Mobile TV for more space but beware this will cause OTA updates to fail.You will want to delete several system apps and re-install them as normal apps in order to let Greenify work on them. The stock ROM wastes a TON of battery running Maps and T-Mobile My Account in the background. Uninstall both and re-install as user apps and then Greenify them to save battery. Increased mine almost 20% just by this alone. Re-installing system apps like Maps also lets you use Link2SD on them, saving you space even after the apps are re-installed.On battery, the CPU settings are also incorrect. You need SetCPU with a profile that sets minimum CPU speed whole the screen is off. This will improve battery life by ~30-40% with no adverse effects.Root will also let you install WiFi Tether, which is free and open source, uses less power, and doesn't show up on your bill like the official method. A data connection is a data connection, and if you want to share it with your other devices after you've paid for it that is your business and not the carrier's. Can confirm that WiFi Tether (requires root, remember) works on this device. Have not tested transmission power reduction yet.All in all, a great mid-range phone for a great price, but it seems like LG and T-Mobile have intentionally handicapped it in order to promote flagship sales. Using Root you can remove or work around these handicaps.

This phone works with the old plan; you just have to transfer your SIM card. If you have a micro-SIM, just put it into the new phone. If you have a regular SIM, you can change the account to the (included) micro SIM at T-Mobile's website.I have used it to watch videos on YouTube, Skype, take and post pictures on Facebook, navigate, deposit a check with the Chase bank app, text, and surf the internet. It even makes phone calls!The phone is quick and the screen looks great. The plastic backing feels nice, but I will probably get a protective case for it soon anyway. The battery lasted about 20 hours with Wi-Fi and GPS turned on with heavy usage. I imagine that light users would get 24+ hours of battery life easily.This phone is the best for users who want a quality unit without paying a lot of money. Most people probably already have Wi-Fi at home, work, and school, so you probably don't have to buy a data plan. If you truly need to peruse LOLCats at the grocery store, T-Mobile does of course have data plans available, but I can't comment on them. I only use shared minutes, unlimited texting, and Wi-Fi, and it works out quite well. The Google Navigation will even work for short trips as long as you input the address while you are still in Wi-Fi range.To summarize: you can buy a great phone for under $200 and use it with your existing T-Mobile plan, even if you don't currently have a data connection.

I really love how fast it is all around and how nice it fits and feels in my hand, which is one thing I found difficult with other phones because of my fairly large hands there just weren't alot of phones out there I could buy without it costing me an arm and a leg.So the rating I gave it basically came down to 4 stars because it lacked one major essential which I will get to in a min.- The Size and quality of the screen is great.- It's light weight and is well put together.- I love the big screen and how well all my apps look on it, the speed of the phone is definitely were it shines especially in it's price range.- Fairly long battery life, lasted me a whole day on one charge with using my phone for games, music and searching the web.- Though the camera is only 5 megapixels, it's Full HD 1080p video capture is terrific not to mention the pictures.  Though I recommend taking them in well lit areas as indoor shots tend to not look the clearest.Now to get to why It's only 4 stars....  The phone out of the box comes with 2 gb of space but with most of the bloatware, you really only see about 1.3-1.5 gbs.  I got this phone with the intentions of using my 32gb sd card that I had apps from my previous phone and to also expand on top of the little space the phone comes with... But sadly this is where i found the biggest upset... This device is not manufactured to accept the transfer or even download of apps on to an external sd card, so it renders my sd card useless as that is what I intended to do.  Why they decided to do this idk but It would have been great if It was shown somewhere in the product description that you can't download apps to your sd card..

At first I was pleased with the speed and cost, but over time I realized the phone has many shortcomings.First, the L9 (LG-P769) is near impossible to root.  Out of all the android devices I've had I had this is the only one I've chosen to not root because the method looks too difficult.  Two, the Jelly Bean update has been pulled by T-Mobile with little hope it'll ever come back.  LG has a terrible reputation of supporting their devices and since I can't get the phone rooted a custom ROM is no longer an option.  Three, it only has a 21Mbit/s radio.  This didn't seem like a big deal at first but the difference between it and the 42Mbit/s radio I had in my old S3 is huge.  The L9 only sees about 2.5Mbit/s down when the S3 saw closer to 10Mbit/s.  The latency is the same but it feels much slower because of the throughput.  Last, the device doesn't have a light sensor or an LED notification light.  I knew the LG didn't have these but I didn't realize giving these up would be such a big deal.

Buyers are valuable in writing about user and personal experience.  I excerpted Consumer Rport's review of the phone.  I bought the L9 under T-Mobile's new plan model where the plan (no contract) is priced according, $50/month for voice/data/ message and you pay the retail price for the phone.  TM priced the L9 at $241 plus tax (04/12/2013).  If you \"bring your own phone\" you buy the SIM card for $10.I had a MyTouch 4G (by HTC) which was highly rated, but my experience was just \"OK\".  My wife has the same phone but in White, and it is mostly useful in our house; however, HER data & message service is mostly unavailable while my handset was sensitive enough. I can't explain why 2 exact phones (except color) would perform so differently.The LG L9 seems to be worse than my MyTouch 4G in signal sensitivity -- the L9 has 4 bars, and typically only 1 bar would show (I haven't compared the db readings), and data service is very spotty in my brick house (data calls would time out 50% of the time).  I am considering returning it to T-Mobile and eating the re-stocking charge (maybe it's waived in 14 days, I have to read the sales contract); the poor reception is very aggravating.It is, however, the least expensive 4G data, Android 4.0 phone; the Samsung's are now price like iPhone's and they don't seem to have more functionality than other 4G data & 4.0 phones.The menu steps are significantly different from my previous Android 2.0 phone.  One dialing feature I REALLY miss is that I could type in the first 1-3 letters of my contact list, and my HTC phone would show in a speed list.  The LG Phone doesn't have this function which is a major inconvenience.The LG has \"touch\" buttons (instead of mechanical) for Back & Menu; looks neat ?  but it isn't.  The buttons are not lit, and I rather have \"hard\" buttons than hidden \"soft\" buttons.(The back is plastic which keeps the weight low; it's textured so it's doesn't feel cheap as it is cheap manufacturing.)______________________________________________CR's TakeThe LG Optimus L9 offers an impressive blend of intriguing features and apps in a thin and lightweight package.Highs* 4.5-inch high-resolution display with excellent quality* Top-notch ease of use, messaging, and Web browsing* Quick Memo lets you use your finger to scribble notes on anything you see on the phone's screen* Allows you to launch apps such as a camera, messages, or phone directly from a locked screen* Supports fast 4G data networks* Can snap a still image while recording a video* Front-facing camera facilitates video chats and self-portraits* Uses versatile Android operating system, with access to many apps and services<Lows* Video recording is mediocre * Lacks a physical button for quick phone access, and its virtual keypad makes it hard to enter a number without looking* Lacks Flash video * Memory card is hard to accessDetailed test resultsThe LG Optimus L9 has an excellent-quality 4.5-inch, high-resolution, touch-screen display packed in a relatively thin and lightweight case. It includes Quick Memo, a pull-down menu option app that lets you use your finger to scribble notes on anything you see on the phone's screen, from photos, e-mails, and calendar appointments to the home screen itself. The finished \"memo\" actually becomes a picture that you can easily e-mail or text to other, as well as share on social networks. The Optimus L9 provides easy access to all main functions via a highly responsive touch screen that supports five home screens of apps, programmable shortcuts, as well as a home button flanked by menu and back keys. The Optimus L9 also provides a straightforward way to add apps, widgets, or change wallpaper. You simply press and hold a blank spot on the screen to summon a Lazy Susan-style buffet of home screens, apps, widgets and other customization options. Pressing and holding the home key launches a stack of screen shots of your most recently used apps. Tap any one of them, and you can jump to that app. You can also launch the phone, messaging, e-mail, or camera app directly from a locked screen without the need to first unlock the screen. You do this by swiping upward on any one of app icons that are visible on the locked screen. But this phone lacks the search key found on many Android phones.The Optimus L9 lets you perform Google searches by voice command, and lets you download applications, services, and games, and more from the Google Play Store. Its multi-touch screen lets you zoom in and out of photos or Web pages using two fingers (for instance, your thumb and index finger). It also has a handy on-screen drop-down status bar that alerts you to and takes you to new messages, upcoming appointments, and other items that need your attention, even when your screen is locked. Its Android OS offers better text editing tools and controls for managing data usage, and enhanced voice-activated navigation and dictation. High-speed \"4G\" wireless broadband data capability provides faster Web browsing and file downloads. The faster network also facilitates better Web browsing experiences. The Wi-Fi connection provides another way to access the Web, e-mail, and other Internet-based content, without using your data plan allowance. But this model lacks Flash video.MESSAGING: The virtual keyboard was very easy to use. This phone comes with common preset text messages, and also allows you to create custom preset text messages for your individual special situations or frequent use. Excellent e-mail readability and attachment capabilities. This phone allows you to edit Word documents and Excel spreadsheets out of the box, which can come in handy when working on the go. The Optimus L9 also supports Microsoft Exchange and Outlook for work e-mail. When connected to Windows or Macintosh computers, this phone can appear on the computer as another drive. You can then transfer data to and from your phone as you could on a regular drive.PHONE: We tested this phone under a variety of conditions to simulate environments ranging from the quiet indoors to noisy roadsides. It had very good voice quality when talking, good when listening. Talk time was an ample 7.5 hours. This phone has a very good mixture of controls and features for making and taking calls. Excellent keypad readability under most lighting conditions, even in bright light. Its voice command allows you to conveniently dial numbers from your phone book by speaking the name, without the usual training. You can also dial numbers by pronouncing the digits. It has Bluetooth for wireless hands-free voice communication. This model can simultaneously be on a phone call and an Internet-based connection over the cellular network. Can be used internationally. But this model lacks a physical button for quick phone access, and its virtual keypad makes dialing difficult without looking. Auto answer doesn't work with headset.MULTIMEDIA: The 5-megapixel camera has a short shutter lag, and produced good pictures at ISO settings up to 400. Camera has a flash, autofocus, manual ISO settings, smile detection, and can record HD video. Its touch focus feature lets you override the autofocus by tapping on any subject on the screen. You can even take a picture by just saying \"cheese\". The camera's flash and ISO-setting controls help improve your chances of taking better pictures under low-light conditions. Its face detection comes in handy when you're snapping pics of babies, toddlers, or other fussy subjects. You can also snap a still picture at any moment while shooting a video. The front-facing VGA camera allows easy self-portraits, and can support video chats. But the camera took only fair 1080p video, OK only for the most casual uses.The music player has the capabilities and controls of a typical stand-alone MP3 player, including an equalizer, music shuffle and repeat controls and options for sorting music by album, artist, etc. This model also supports Bluetooth stereo headsets, and can download music over the phone network. Its Bluetooth data support enables the phone to wirelessly share pictures, contacts, and other files with compatible printers, computers, and mobile devices.GPS navigation capability provides spoken turn-by-turn directions and automatic re-routing. The Optimus L9 supports the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) standard via its SmartShare application. This lets the phone connect via Wi-Fi to share content with other compatible certified devices such as a TV, printer, and computer. The Optimus L9 can act as a mobile hotspot for up to eight Wi-Fi-enabled devices. It also supports Wi-Fi calling. It has 4GB of built-in memory, and supports memory cards of up to 32GB. Its memory capacity is beneficial for storing music, videos, pictures, and other types of files. But the memory card is hard to access.About - LG Optimus L9The LG Optimus L9 is a smart phone designed for use on the T-Mobile network, including its HSPA+ \"4G\" network.

Single processor, Android 2.3. Waterproof, Gorilla Glass, solid reception, even in buildings.I picked up the LG Optimus L9, T-Mobile version, because of the Gorilla Glass, dual processors, processor speed, call quality reviews, external SD memory, removable battery, and the planned update to Jellybean. For me, this is a business tool, to make money. I need a solid, dependable, fast internet connection, great call quality, and the device has to play nice with my bluetooth headsets, and be able to run basic business apps.Well, the phone call quality is normally pretty good, as long as T-Mobile's reception holds up. It does drop calls occasionally, even when signal strength is full.The internet is noticeably slower than on my old 3G phone. That is a huge shock.As other reviewers have noted, sometimes the screen is unresponsive, and I have to zoom and/or reposition the screen image. Usually, I just have to tap the screen several times, but it happens frequently, and is annoying.Often, there are problems when I try to do manual edits onscreen; the touches don't register correctly, and the editor function doesn't work properly at all.I don't game, don't have a ton of apps.  The thing came with some bloatware installed, some LG, some T-Mobile. I disabled as much of it as possible, but it can't be uninstalled or moved to the SD card, and wastes a lot of memory space.Some odd glitches pop up regularly. For one, even though I've disabled location services, and keep the GPS off, a couple times/week, I find the GPS running, and have to manually shut it down, and reset the default. I used to think it was a lock screen issue - random inputs while in pocket, but that's not the case.I lose internet connectivity fairly often, and T-Mobile customer service has been very good about it, but there's a pattern of system settings changing intermittently, without any help from me.T-Mobile has advised me to re-boot the phone once a day, to keep it from losing internet connections. I do this, but still lose my internet connection daily. Sometimes I have to re-boot the phone, sometimes I just have to wait 10 or 15 minutes. When the problem persists, I call T-Mobile, and they trace down the settings, or reset the data connection remotely, and have me re-boot the phone, to complete the process.The Jellybean update apparently damaged phones, so it was halted, and I have yet to see it available, since I purchased my L9. Looks like Jellybean isn't coming to the L9. The phone's memory is far less than the 32GB memory card I purchased, and I'm not pleased about that. The Jellybean update was to allow the L9 to move apps to the card, among other improvements.The battery life seems less than middle-of-the-road to me, which really kind of sucks, for a product like this, released in late 2012.Don't get me wrong, these disappointments don't mean spending $ 400.00 to $ 1000.00 on such a device makes any more sense, it doesn't. There's a fool born every minute, and unfortunately, the cell phone makers are able to charge obscene prices, because well, we don't demand better.Yeah, it's a $ 200.00 phone.

At first glance it appeared, before I knew anything about it at all, like it was going to be overwhelming to use but it's o.k.I love all the cool features it has over and above the typical basic stuff like the wi-fi. With a new phone number app you can use the fully functional telephone free, providing you have internet hi-speed wi-fi. you simply engage the wi-fi on the phone then get your new free phone number configured through the signal and walla you got free phone service, as long as you're within range of your signal or any wi-signal..So I give the lg optimus l9 a thumbs up for that one. I like the option to get all the apps that you can use for traveling. This phone is like a mini PC to me! I can pretty much do anything with it that I can use my pc for and in some instances faster! Like social networking, bookmarking and also adding or watching direct video streaming. I can actually make a tweet or post a comment or even add a movie to my net flix account from anywhere and do it at a couple of clicks from the l9.I love all the features but i also have some peeves about the lg optimus l9. This review will include some of the things I don't like as well like the button locations. While i'm not exactly sure where else the developers designers  could have put the on/off button but right where it is isn't working for me. The volume button is in a bad place as well as the operation of the movie camera. I found that trying to make a video was a bit of a challenge by myself and where the buttons were located.The lg optimus l9 has a speaker deficiency problem. For me the sound quality on the external speaker isn't nearly what it needs to be. You can set the phone next to something to kind of reverberate, there is a docking/charging station available for this, that's supposed to enhance the sound and make it better sound quality but even that is only so good.n I didn't think that it enhanced the sound quality that much.The only other thing that I didn't like and am going to add to my lg optimus review is I am constantly searching for it because I have a tendency to set it down all the time as opposed to putting it in my pocket like I did previously owned Flip phones. I even dropped it a few times already because of the weight of it. i had to get use to grabbing it more securely when I pick it up, lucky for me I had purchased the special rubberized case that envelopes it quite securely and does a nice job of protecting it I must say.All and all though I still like my lg optimus phone. It's like I said like having a mini PC with you, GPS all in one!ThanksSalamei", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG-Great Choice", "Author": "Guy Brochu", "ReviewID": "R1LJAOIZW1LJNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Reliable cell phone.

I break them I sell them and LG L9 is what I keep as mybackup.These days it's my first phone after I am finally done with all the 4.7\"+ android crap and currently have no idea what to buy next (Z1 compact was promising but turned out to be pure crap. The same for moto x).L9 fits your hand just right - it's actually very slim and not so wide for an 4.5\" screen. The rubberized plastic cover makes the grip perfect - whenever I take this phone I feel this is the right one. The phone also has the stellar battery life. I get almost 4 days out of it, with Juice Defender periodic polling. The LCD is just great - no fancy HD crap that consumes battery and offers nothing - this one is brighter than any crap from Samsung yet it offers the same sharpens (in fact I prefer IPS over Amoled - I don't need fancy and fake punchy colors but nicely readable text - this is better than HD Amoled on any Samsung I tried. Moto x had amoled screen which is even worse).The bad thing about this phone is it's low level specs. This just can't be a pro phone. It doesn't have enough memory and the CPU is slow. You just need more. After two years I am still looking for a phone that will add very little changes to L9: some 512MB of RAM more, any CPU but this OMAP and a bit brighter LCD. We are talking about a 200$ phone that sadly doesn't exist. Moto G is too crappy and bulky, HTC one mini with its battery cant be a pro phone, Z1 compact - that's sony - never-ending gimmicks that don't work. Iphone - well I need proper notifications and proper data toggling like juice defender does, otherwise that's not a phone I can depend (battery wise and critical notifications wise - no perioidic audio notification or blinking led or blinking lcd.

Additional minutes are only ten cents per, however, so if you're not a heavy talker or can get by using VOIP service such as Skype or Google Voice (or whatever they call it currently), you can get by nicely.)My few gripes, which are pretty standard, are:1. it comes loaded with a ton of bloatware, which cannot be deleted.

Walker", "ReviewID": "R2ZZ3CFFECRNNE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mostly good things to say.  Two complaints at the end of this review.This is in some ways the best computer I've ever owned.  It's my first smart phone, so I have nothing to compare it with, except my other computers.  I do more with this around the house than I anticipated, using it for quick web searches on my wifi connection, reading articles on the web, etc.In rare cases I've run into some little quirk that I think would qualify as a bug, but this happens less often than when I'm using a brand new laptop or desktop computer.As an OS, I'd say Android (ice cream sandwich) is well thought out and intuitive.It seems to have plenty of processing power.  Rarely any noticeable latency in anything I do.It's also the best music player I've owned -- better than my old iPod, for sure, and also better than my Sansa Fuze (which I like).  I don't know if the ear buds are better, or what the determining factor is, but the sound is somehow better than in the dedicated music players I've used, and the interface is certainly better.When reading reviews, there are some complaints about the camera.  I'm not that discerning, but it seems fine to me.  Picture quality is indistinguishable from my 6MP camera, but I haven't taken pictures in a lot of different situations.  Just a few pictures around the house.The display is outstanding.  Better than expected.  Though, like I say, I've never had another smart phone so I have no basis of comparison.I was worried I'd be bothered by the weight of a smart phone, but it's plenty light enough.I'll offer two complaints:  (1)  No tagging in the stock gallery app.  I ended up downloading the F-stop app so I could have tagging, but that should not have been necessary.  I'd love to see an update that adds tagging to the gallery app, so I can delete F-stop. (2) The volume doesn't go down low enough.  I sometimes want to turn the volume down lower than the lowest level.  There is probably an app that will help with this, but the first couple apps I tried didn't work.  It's not a major issue, but for some music tracks I'd like to go even quieter than the minimum volume provided by this phone.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wife's Phone", "Author": "Buddy", "ReviewID": "R1RK4NJS9CTX0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my wife.

My initial reception for this phone was great.  It is got a big, bright and colorful screen, great picture and video qualities, responsive processors, and despite being loaded with junk apps, I was still impressed with all the features in Android 4.1.  It was until last week when the phone started to turn itself off when during standby mode several times.  I first thought this was caused by rouge apps so I did several factory resets, but the issue continues.  Now virtually when the phone is on standby, it turns off itself and the only way to turn it back on is to remove and re-insert the battery.  Even then the phone becomes very hot and the battery drains quickly despite being off.  I took the phone back to Target for an exchange but the return period had expired.  I am now counting on Customer Support from LG to provide me with a solution to my situation.Today is Nov. 24 2013.  I had since returned this phone to LG for repair.  When I received the phone back from LG last week I thought all the issues with the phone were fixed.  They told me on a note that they have replace the flash memory on my phone with no other comments, but when I turned to phone on it quickly turned itself off again, then it got really hot and eventually all power was drained from the battery within minutes.  I have contacted LG customer support again and this time they offered me free shipping for repair.  I hope they will get it right this time.Today is Dec. 14 2013.  I just received my phone back from LG.  This time they told me the board has been replaced.  I was hoping the phone would work smooth from then on boy was I wrong.  Just after 5 minutes of use the phone turned itself off again, I then inserted a different battery and sim card but it changed nothing.  The phone behaved just like before; it froze, hanged, and kept turning itself off on standby.  I immediately called LG support again and they were quite courteous and offered me free return and repair for the third time.  At the moment I am not holding a lot of hope for this phone, but I still hope they can repair it.  I will keep you updated when further information comes along.Today is Jan. 5 2014.  I got my phone back from LG after for its third repair yesterday and it didn't work but it has been working fine since today after it has been fully charged.  They told me they have replaced the proximity sensor and the flash memory(the second time).  It seems they really fix the phone this time but all those repair works has caused such deformity to my phone that the back cover no longer fits completely, but since I have a case for the phone, I could easily ignore such minor inconvenience.  I am just glad it works, well at least for now.  I am not sure if I need to update my experience with this phone anymore since it is no longer on the market.  I don't have too much to say for this phone and its build quality, but I really can commend LG customer support service.  They are quick, decisive and always courteous.  If only LG had held the same quality on manufacturing same as to their customer service, I would not have written such a long review.

There is a noticeable lag whenever one downgrades to a slower phone, but whenever I remember that I saved $300, I stop complaining. The phone itself is very light and looks slim and sexy. The features and everything is pretty standard for any android phone. It's battery life reminded me of the iphone 5. It wouldn't last long whenever during intensive activities, but when I charged it, it would be full in maybe 30 minutes which is very quick. It wasn't a big problem for me because the chargers for androids are so cheap here on Amazon that I could have one everywhere I go.One thing that I like is that the screen is big and the resolution is great. It works terrifically for youtube and Netflix. The resolution for the camera is also quite nice with some great features like speak to take a photo.Cons: I have really big hands, but I was still unable to traverse the entire screen with my thumb, while holding the phone in only one hand. Although I think this screen size is perfect for browsing and watching videos, so I guess this problem is inevitable and just a cost of the screen size that I would gladly pay.Another thing quite noticeable is the slight lag whenever doing pretty much anything, from unlocking the phone, opening a program, pressing a text box to start typing, etc. I didn't expect it to be lighting quick for a phone in this budget category so it's really not that bad.Despite some small problems that are inherent when buying a phone for this cheap, you really can't beat the value for your dollar.

However, the phone did not perform when I needed it most - when trying to use the dial pad to navigate an automated phone system. When you are on a call and need to answer an incoming call or enter options in an automated menu, the dialpad just flickers away every time you try to touch the screen.  This renders the phone useless, for example, when trying to use phone banking or filling a prescription. Rebooting the phone does not solve the issue. I have never regretted a purchase as much as this one and I advise anyone who reads this not to waste their money on this piece of junk. The phone is simply not reliable.

In the briefcase?) 2) unlock the screen 3) find the icon on the screen and tap it 4) speak instructions into the app and 5) double-check the screen to make sure it heard you correctly. Please note that voice-dialing is not just some feature I have not figured out how to use: both my carrier and LG confirm that it's not available on this phone. Incredible.

There is internal storage (a hard drive like on your PC) there is electronic memory like the memory in your computer, and there is processing power (like the Intel or AMD chip in yoru PC)They take advantage of people that do not understand how computers work and for those who do, they just change the names of the parts and how they work and start there bull all over againexample: \"The cloud\" is nothing more then network storage, its nothing new been around seance the beginning of computers!With this phone and with many Android phones its internal storage is small this one (to spite it being advertised as havaing 4gigbytes) it really only has 2 giga bytes of internal storage!  Barely enough to handle all the bloatware, spyware and all the stupid updates to crap on it I will never use, leaving little room for good games and apps that I choose to use, yes the phone has a processor that can play good games and apps but no room to store the games and apps I want!The phone was advertised as having 4 giga bytes, by both the seller and T Mobile, and Google has been toting the ability to \"root\" there phones so you can get rid of the bloat ware, and store games on SD cards. this way if your phone only has 2 giga bytes on internal storage you can root it and put the extra games on teh SD card.NOT WITH THIS PIECE OF CRAP!CANT ROOT THIS PHONE ANDROID 4.2 puts a stop to that!First T mobile forced a android OS update the minute I turned it on, that update does nothing new or better then android 4.0 but it sure as hell prevents rooting!Next all the bloatware updated sucking all but 500 megs of internal storage! WOW barely enough to store Angry Birds on!I upgraded to this phone because it has a dual core CPU to play the better games, I did not expect to get into such a mess, 3 weeks spent trying to root the dam thing, and I am a A+ certified computer repair tech!I see the government is pushing companies to unlock there phones for people whose contracts have ran out I hope the go after them for pulling this crap!Its seem all the companies involved in selling you your phone only care about forcing there spyware, and bloatware advertising on you and not realizing you did not pay $130 and a $30 a month phone bill to put up with there crap and not enjoy the games and apps!I blame all involved, from LG for designing multiple versions of this phone and not being specific as to witch one does what and why, I blame T Mobile for forcing there bloatware on it, I Blame Google Android for making android 4.2 that makes it impossible to root the phone and also why they just don't allow games to be stored on the SD card in the first place, (I mean that's all most people want to do anyway!)But I blame the seller the most, who had the phone in there possession long enough to know what I had to learn the hard way and advertising it had 4 gigs when they had to have known it only had 2 gigs of storage!", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "product failed to funtion the way it was described", "Author": "Bingeti", "ReviewID": "R1J08559VVZJSX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone has no camera function and freezes abnormally so i will have to mail it back tomorrow because i can't do with that kind of a product", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Michael L Dow", "ReviewID": "RDRRWCPTOUBKG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All man I had high hopes but now I am left with a 200.00 dud phone.
