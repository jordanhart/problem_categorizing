{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Technical/Hardware Masterpiece", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R56Q72JTVOZWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year I owned the Galaxy Note 2. I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are getting very very interesting....Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. There are a handful of improvements:  * The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.  * You will also find out that it is a bit brighter. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(when auto brightness is turned on).  * Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. However, it is still not as good as the HTC One's screen. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). As a whole however, and because of its Pentile pixel system, it comes just a bit short of the HTC One's Super LCD 3. It is really nitpicking though, so you won't ever regret this.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content!3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all, I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS:There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. With rumors of a new Galaxy line, this may be changed very soon though. Also, the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative. This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and awesome battery life.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "TMO Galaxy Note 3 Review", "Author": "zero1000100", "ReviewID": "R348PVKP1XRXQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not often that I come across a piece of technology that completely changes my day to day routine. That changes the way that I interact and utilize the tool that's in my pocket. More so, a piece of tech that breathes life back into my passion for technology and the modern smartphone landscape.The Galaxy Note 3 is one such device. For a bit of background I've used every major OS that is on the market now as well as some casualties of the Smartphone War. I've bounced back and forth between the current giants of the land but I've at times ventured away towards the outcasts. My last experiment was with a Nokia N9 running MeeGo which overall wasn't a bad experience but the dated hardware made me forfeit that journey early on.Enter the greatest smartphone in the World! The Galaxy Note 3! Sorry, I don't mean to sound so dramatic but at the same time...I do. That's just how enjoyable this experience has been overall.Everything about this device has me wanting to tell every person that I see to go and buy one. I try and show them cool features or just how beastly this device is and even with my impeccable sales skills my praises fall on deaf ears. Not because what I'm saying isn't a good enough example of the Note 3's superiority to every other device on the market currently. The issue is that all the features that make this N3 amazing are things that you have to experience first hand. The first time that you're on a call and take an Action Memo or your first Scrap Book creation or your first Sketch Book sketch. These are all things that need to happen naturally while using the device for you to sit back and think, \" Wow...this phone is awesome!\".That's really the point to all this is that these are all things that you have to experience for yourself . I don't find it a coincidence that within Best Buy stores are Samsung Experience Shops. It's all about user experience and how their products differ and how it makes you feel. That in my opinion is the most important aspect of Apples business model that they copied or modeled themselves after. It's all about user experience in day to day operation and \"almost\" nothing else. I say \"almost\" because I've used enough Android devices to know specs matter on an Android powered smartphone.I could drone on and on about the industry leading specs of the Note 3 but I'm not. Maybe they don't lead in every single category but as a whole its the Champion. It's actually the first Android smartphone that has my iFriends saying \"Dude, I would use that Android phone over my iPhone in a heartbeat!\". That little satisfying confession has zero to do with specs and everything to do with user experience in THIER eyes. Realistically, it's actually the insane spec sheet that is making this Note 3 so amazing to use as a daily driver. I'm sure they have no idea what the specs of their iPhone are nor do they care. Simply because that's not what Apple pushes. They push experience and status. Samsung has started on the same campaign as of late. If I knew just how awesome the Note line was I would've picked one up a long time ago. Though I fully believe that it's the Note 3 specifically that has reignited my passion for mobile tech and expanded my perception of the usefulness of electronic gadgets.Clearly I'm more than satisfied with my purchase of the Note 3 . More than that though, I'm excited again to pick up my phone and use it. Heck, I find any reason to pick it up to use it for whatever or nothing sometimes simply to look at that gorgeous display. It also makes me excited to see what's on the horizon. Just to add a little more perspective, I'm someone who used to make fun of the entire Note line and all phablets for that matter. The reason for this was my ignorance of the Note line.Bottom line : Each and every time that I pick up my Note 3 there's a smile on my face. I look forward to a reason to pick it up and I find myself pulling out the S Pen to do anything every time I use the N3. I highly recommend all smartphone lovers to at least give it an honest test drive. I guarantee that you won't come away disappointed. It may not be the device for you but I don't think you will be able to deny it's appeal and usefulness.Best/favorite Android device to dateP.S. This was all written using the S Pen within the Google Keep app.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "My perfect phone", "Author": "Ashton P. Johnson \"Zepaw\"", "ReviewID": "REJADZ7UZKLXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and Samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones. I remember when I had the 4.5in screened Samsung Infuse and it was considered large. I've had a Note and Note 2 and loved both. Note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked, improving where needed, and adding features I wouldn't have even thought to ask. So many of the little annoyances I had with my Note 2 have been addressed.  Its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed.When I first held the phone I fell in love. The form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up. That's saying something when the Note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution. I don't feel the need to have this one in a case. The slippery back of the Note 2 required a case as I dropped it a couple times when holding it bare.Rather than go on feature by feature I'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement. S-pen, camera, screen, on and on its the phone I loved before but better in every way I could have asked for. I've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years. The Note 2 was the first one I actually held onto for a year. I easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer (depending on when they bring out a 4th ;) ).I highly recommend this phone.*Update a week in. I'm still just as impressed with this phone if not more so. The biggest thing I've found since my review is how much battery this phone offers. The battery size is insignificantly larger than the Note 2 which means they really improved the performance greatly to have increased battery efficiency this much. With the Note 2 most days of average us (lots of music streaming but not much else) I'd be about out of battery by end of work 5pm-ish. Now I'm at around 50%. I can make it through a full day without charge using the phone a good amount throughout. I did a test a couple days ago purposefully trying to drain it as fast as possible. Screen on high brightness near continuously while downloading several GB of data over 4G (I still have unlimited) and it lasted over 6 hours! I remain extremely happy I got this phone.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I strongly recommend Galaxy Note 3", "Author": "Ashok M Thakkar", "ReviewID": "RC809LV5N373I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently migrated from iPhone 4S to Galaxy Note 3. On the whole, I feel that Galaxy Note 3 is a superior phone compared to the iPhone. Larger screen is not the only benefit. I felt that Apple had made the syncing too restrictive (only thru iTunes). Note 3 allows much more flexible interface thru Windows PC. I am sure it is true for the Mac environment. I just don't have any experience with Mac.However, the greatest drawback of Note 3 is that it is too cumbersome to sync contacts from Outlook and importing pictures is also quite cumbersome. In case of the iPhone, iCloud is an amazing tool. Every single contact you modify or every single picture you add or delete, it gets sync'd instantaneously. In case of Note 3, it is not that simple.Take contacts for example. I have 560 contacts (between business and social). First I am required to upload these into my Google account and then my Note 3 syncs with my Google contacts. No problem so far. Now I add or modify let's say 7 contacts. Google does not allow me to import just seven contacts. I have to import all 567 contacts. However, before I import, I have to delete all Google contacts from my Google account. Or else, I will end up with all duplicate contacts. Google only allows me to delete 250 contacts at a time. So It takes three attempts to delete existing contacts and one more attempt to import new contacts. After this, Note 3 syncs fine (over WiFi). Now you can see what I mean by being \"cumbersome\".Similar problem exists with importing pictures. The only difference being, I have to physically connect the device to my laptop and import pictures manually (same as saving them on an external HD).In spite of these issues, I would strongly recommend this phone over iPhone any day of the week and twice on Sundays.My objective is to bring these problems to the attention of the powers that be - so Samsung and Google can solve these problems. They have come a long way in creating a superior phone. But these improvements will make the phone nearly perfect.And by the way, this phone is susceptible to virus attacks - which iPhone is NOT. So I suggest you subscribe to some virus protection service. I purchased a 2-year warranty from SAMS Club (thru SquareTrade). This two-year warranty cost me $ 100 and it includes a subscription to McAfee Premium service (for two years). This is just for comparison.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Switched over from iPhone after 4 years", "Author": "Sean P", "ReviewID": "R1YJLFEGI75QQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little background on my cell phone history:I used to be a huge believer that Apple made the best cell phones hands down. I got my first iPhone in 2009 or so, it was an iPhone 3GS. I loved it. After a year, I decided to move to Sprint and get an EVO 4g because Sprints plans were cheaper than AT&T;'s and the EVO totally crushed the iPhone 3GS and soon to be released 4 on paper. I lasted one week on Sprint because I thought the EVO 4G was one of the worst phones I had ever used. I immediately went back to AT&T; and got the iPhone 4 when it launched.I kept that iPhone for over 2 years, I didn't feel the 4s warranted an upgrade as I was very happy with my 4. When the 5 came out, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. A bigger screen is something I had hoped Apple would give us, and they finally did. I was very happy with my iPhone 5 at first, then I started to tire of it as I saw my friends with bigger and bigger screens on their phones. 4 inches felt so tiny. Then I had to get my first iPhone replacement because my flash suddenly stopped working in February. I debated for months to switch back to Android and after playing with the Note 3 at my local Best Buy, I decided to go for it.Note 3 Review:So as I said, I was coming over to Android being a heavy Apple user and supporter. I decided on the Note 3 because I have rather large hands and I really loved the giant screen. I also thought the S-Pen was kind of cool also.Pros:Screen: Love it. Images look crisp, videos look amazing, no pixels noticeable in text.Texting: Coming from an iPhone for over 4 years, it was nice to be able to Swype a text out if I wanted to. Also the auto-correct is so much better and I type much faster on this phone already and I haven't had it that long! This has greatly improved my texting experience.Camera: Tons of options for shooting photos and videos. Gives you control the iPhone does not. Picture quality is nicer than iPhone 5 and also images are much more fun to look at with that amazing screen!Battery: This battery lasts around 2.5 times longer than my iPhone would under the same usage. I know, this has a bigger battery in it, but it also has a much bigger screen and more powerful components to power. I am a heavy user and this battery gets me through a day easily.Apps: Sure, back in the day Apple had Android crushed with apps. Now, every app I used on my iPhone, I was able to get on Android. Then there was some other great apps Android had that I don't recall seeing an equivalent on Apple. MightyText is one such app. It allows you to send texts from your browser. I feel Android has more intriguing app choices than Apple these days.Choices: If I want to download a new keyboard, I can. If I want to make Chrome my browser of choice, I can. Apple restricts nearly every sort of customization you can do on your phone, Android does not.Cons:Looks: I really liked the iPhone 5 design. It looked nice. I felt bad taking it out of the case for fear I would scratch it. I know this has gotten praise from some reviewers for its looks, but it comes down to personal preference I guess. I think this thing is big and ugly. But who cares, I buy a phone for its performance and what it can do - not how it looks. Besides, I will slap an Otterbox on this when they come out.Reception: I got MUCH stronger and more reliable service with my iPhone 5. Both the Note 3 and iPhone 5 have AT&T; LTE support. In my room I used to get around 8mbs down and 4 mbs up on my iPhone. With my Note 3 I am only getting 3mbs down and 1 mbs up.  I have also had an issue downloading an attachment and sending a picture message already. Not sure what the issue could be, but time will tell if this persists.Power Button: The power button is so flush against the side, it makes it very hard to press. I literally need to focus and turn the phone in a certain way to lock it. Hopefully when I add a case it helps, but its a bit annoying at the moment. I may try to see if I can lock it with a double tap of the home screen or something. Also of note, the home button is crooked. This is widely documented and I did indeed notice my device is also afflicted with it.Verdict:I would definitely recommend a Note 3 to anyone and if you have an iPhone and are considering the switch - I say go for it. I don't see myself ever going back to Apple and their tiny 4 inch screens any time soon! I do miss universal search and I kinda do miss Siri - but that's about it.Overall I give the Note 3 a 9/10.UPDATE 11/30/2013Well I have been using this phone over a month now and I still love it! Just to update a few things...I had a defective unit which had an issue with the lock button. After getting an exchange from AT&T; my new unit has no issues with the side button.I don't use the stylus very much at all, I really thought I would use this feature a lot more than I have.Still have an issue receiving mms messages and group messages. Sometimes restarting the phone corrects it immediately, but it gets a bit old having to restart that often.Battery life is AMAZING. I was very concerned being a heavy user and having a giant 1080p screen would mean horrible battery life, but it is quite the opposite. I never have any trouble making it the whole day on a single charge and usually have 10-20 percent left by the end of the night.Overall I am still very happy I upgraded and would not consider going back to Apple until they make a significantly larger display on their devices. Until then I will happily stick with my Note 3!", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the best cell phone on the plenet and here's proof", "Author": "FALCON", "ReviewID": "R2QXVCRPJICYI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Forget those silly complaints about region lock.  They do not affect USA carriers, or even 99.9% of other users. They do not apply to this US version. The region locked N9000 is not LTE and uses a different CPU; it is the European/ international version.  It does have problems with switching SIMM cards between countries so no one should get it. (Bad move Samsung). US users need to get the phone for their respective carrier which changes the last digit of the number.  It's that simple. Amazon makes many versions available.[I teach overseas yearly.  I keep my phone in airplane mode and use Wi-Fi or get a cheap phone card.]First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews with the poster  just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today.  As for those phones that only show an app screen.  I call them cave phones.1.  The beautiful  5.7\" Super Amoled HD display has a \"Wow!\"  factor.  Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI.  Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.  This phone is a joy to use.2.  The CPU (For US versions) is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time.  It will perform well for years to come.  A few other phones have it.  No lag on this baby.  Just try to do things to outpace it.  It moves data faster than you can see.  Partially because of #3.3.  The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it.  Graphics are amazing.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!  It also does 1080P video at 60 FPS which is great.6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware CPU and GPU  improvements, as well as Android 4.3 make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.EDIT:  It is there, but for some reason AT&T; does not allow access this secure environment. Guess they want their competitors to get all those deserting Blackberry customers.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds.16.  I have been using the original Galaxy Note, which is actually wider,  wearing suit pants to jeans.  Both phones  fit fine in your pocket.  Don't worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans.17.  The TouchWiz UI is fine, and super fast now, but I prefer a 3rd party launcher - Go Launcher EX from the play store.  Over a million users.  So, the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any Android manufacturer.  Neither is S-voice, which is still seriously lacking.  Just use Google voice and DL a different sound from the app store if you want. There are a few things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong. I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user.  However, there should be a better one with more bass.  It is Ok, and plenty loud, just not great like the rest of the phone.  This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES. All that said, I'm very, very happy, with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in most cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.Recommendation - get a case for any phone, one that raises a bevel on the front glass, and try to find a good screen protector.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone once it is debloated", "Author": "Jon Hudson", "ReviewID": "R1B7TLC7KP7D7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Switching from the original AT&T; Samsung Galaxy Note i717 this upgrade was much better than expected.

While it is not a true RGB display, it is still absolutely gorgeous. The viewing angles are superb and the colors are close to natural (assuming you use the Movie Mode).Size: I bought this phone knowing it will be the largest phone I have ever used before. It's actually smaller than what I thought it would be. It is pretty much the same size as the Galaxy Note 2, but also a little lighter. I can use most of the features with one hand, no problem, but I have pretty large hands (piano hands). Thin bezels just add to the beauty of the phone!Look and feel: I very much love the aesthetics of the phone! It's a real eye catcher.  I love the textured back , it feels solid and it definitely won't be slipping out of my hand. I prefer the more squarish design of the Note 3 more than the round, \"natural\" design of the Note 2. It looks more futuristic. The volume buttons and home button are rock solid and provide the right amount of physical feedback when using them. Although, I find myself accidentally hitting the home key a lot.Camera: The camera has been wonderful so far. I am by no means a photographer but it does the job superbly when I do want to catch that rare photo. The video on this thing is AMAZING compared to what I have had before. The 1080p 60 FPS is SO SMOOTH I LOVE IT. It's a little scary, actually.Call Quality: Everyone has said that I have been coming through loud and clear, no issues. Everything is clear on my end, as well.Sound/Speakers: This phone is capable of high quality sound through headphones but I never use headphones. The loud speaker is somewhat disappointing. It all sounds like it's coming out of a tin can. I don't use the loud speaker all that much though so it isn't a deal breaker by any means.Software: I love the S-Pen, I find myself using it a lot more than I thought I would. I use the ScrapBook option a lot as I use StumbleUpon daily. Good place to keep recipes, especially since I can tag things then search for them later. I love writing out notes as well and then sending them to people. I hate S-Voice. It sucks and pales in comparison to Siri or Google Now. I had the option to say \"Hi Galaxy\" when the screen is off turned on and it turns on randomly! It did it once in the movie theatres! So embarrassing. I froze that app asap.Battery Life: WOW. 5 hours screen-on time with mostly auto-brightness, but I generally watch an hour worth of videos a day on full brightness. It lasts all day and then some. It also charges in roughly 2.5 hours as well. I am VERY pleased with the battery life.There really isn't anything wrong with this phone.. I love every aspect of it. It never lags, it handles everything beautifully.. the only thing I didn't like was S-Voice, but I also knew that when buying the phone. Nothing has let me down so far.If you are on the fence about buying this phone, just buy it. You'll love it!Actually, there is ONE thing I don't like. Because of the type of display, white colors drain the battery more quickly than darker colors. On the international variant, the Dialer, Messages and Contacts have a black background whereas the AT&T; version has white backgrounds. This is dumb and needs to be fixed.But seriously though, buy this phone.Have a good day!", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone with a few drawbacks", "Author": "Woodsman", "ReviewID": "R2P1KIH5HNFUTP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE 2-6-2014:  Dropping rating from 4 to 3 stars. There is a GPS issue with this phone. See Gadget Guy's comment and his link to the related AT&T; thread. There are over 10 pages of complaints from AT&T; customers. You can also Google \"samsung note 3 gps issue\". My own personal experience is my Note 3 drops the GPS signal much too frequently. I've ran tests in which I've used my son's Nexus 4 and my Note 3 simultaneously while navigating, and the Note 3 constantly drops the GPS signal whereas as the Nexus 4 does not. I currently live in the central Washington state area. As of this update there doesn't seem to be any official response from Samsung or AT&T.;--- ORIGINAL POST ---My previous smartphone was a Nexus 4. I've wanted a large screen phone (5.5 inch screen and up) for a while now, so I took the plunge and the got the Note 3 on AT&T;'s network. I've been using it for two weeks now and below is what I think.<< PROCESSING POWER:  5/5 >>Along with the large screen, this is my favorite aspect of the Note 3. This is hands-down the fastest smartphone I've ever owned. Among other things, it opens up web pages almost as fast as my laptop. It is equipped with the powerful Snapdragon 800, so it's packing some of the latest hardware. Plus 3GB of RAM helps enable its overall noticeable pep.<< STORAGE:  5/5 >>A generous 32GB is provided by default, and the phone supports the use of a microSD card if you want more storage.<< PHYSICAL DESIGN:  4.5/5 >>- PRO:  Large 5.7 inch screen...of course this is a pro for me. I'm 5'8 and don't have large hands, and the screen size doesn't bother me at all. I think the large screen is great, and enhances three key uses for the phone (reading, texting, and navigation).- PRO:  Artificial leather backing. Plastic leather might seem like it would be tacky, but Samsung pulled this one off nicely. It looks and almost feels like genuine leather...it's cool, definitely unique.- NEUTRAL:  The S-Pen. Hard to say how I feel about this. I don't see myself using it much, because if I want to write something I'd rather bang it out quickly using my thumbs and the virtual keyboard. Maybe some business dude would rather scribble out a note. One cool thing is at least having the S-Pen gives you the option to choose, and if you want draw a diagram or something it could obviously be useful.- CON:  The physical home button on the bottom center of the screen. As other users have noted, some of the Note 3's have extra play in this button so this button can be slightly askew at times. This can allow extra grime to creep in around the edges. Plus, after using the Nexus 4's virtual buttons (Back, Home, Windows) for about a year now...I prefer them over the physical Home button on the Note 3. Physical buttons can allow grime to creep in. The only physical buttons I currently want are my power and volume buttons.- CON:  The area around the micro-USB port on the bottom edge of the phone is flimsy. Over a year of use I could see it flexing and possibly cracking without a decent case on the phone.<< SOFTWARE INTERFACE & UTILITIES:  3/5 >>Unfortunately for me this is where the Note 3 falters.- PRO:  Samsung does add some nifty features to the device. Rather than go through them all here, just search for \"25 hidden galaxy note 3 features\" and read the article. These features are cool, but not ground breaking. I do think the multi-window feature is nifty.- CON:  Samsung's TouchWiz interface. After using the pure Android interface on my Nexus 4 for about a year, I found Samsung's TouchWiz to be clunky in comparison. After about a week of using TouchWiz I downloaded Nova Launcher from the Play Store, played with the settings for a bit, and finally got my Note 3 to have a mostly buttery smooth interface like my Nexus 4.- CON:  Bloatware. Both Samsung and AT&T; throw their applications into the Android experience, which is okay. What is not okay is not giving a user the freedom to remove the cruddy apps if I don't want them. I understand some pre-installed apps have to be maintained to support the unique features of the Note 3 (e.g. the S-pen). But how about that Samsung Music app I don't want? And that Samsung S Health I don't want? Not to mention the crud AT&T; throws on here. I like the modular approach taken by Google for pure Android. In pure Android, excluding core apps (e.g. dialer, email, calendar, text messaging, etc.), a user just installs the apps they want, customizing their experience as they go.- CON:  The amount of inconsistency in the user interface between the Note 3 and pure Android. Pure Android offers interface consistency from one Android device to the next, so that when I went from using my Nexus 4 to my Nexus 7 the transition was seamless. Samsung (and to some extent AT&T;) tweaked the default Android interface a surprising amount...and the result was a little messy, muddying the Android interface more than helping it.- CON:  Because of the custom Android installed on this Note 3 (again, expected due to some of the unique features of the Note 3), expect newer flavors of Android to be released for this phone at a lot slower pace than for the pure Android devices. For example, the Note 2 has been on the Android 4.1 release since Sep--Dec of last year. Android 4.2 rolled out around that same time last year. Android 4.3 was released over the summer and the Note 2 it appears is finally about to get it. So basically the Note 2 went almost a whole year (Dec '12--Oct '13) without getting an Android refresh.<< OVERALL 4/5 >>I definitely like the phone. The large screen and processing power are great! However the few drawbacks I've listed above prevent me from giving it a full 5 stars. What I'd really like is to have a phone with this screen size, this processing power, but running pure Android. I don't need the S-Pen. The S-pen and other unique features of the Note 3 aren't major selling points for me.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Visually Just Right", "Author": "gobirds2", "ReviewID": "RK24TPQ1LG67G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This just felt good the moment I grasped it ad held it in my hand. The screen size and the resolution are impressive and that is something I have been waiting for. The Galaxy Note 3 has a wider 5.7 inch Full HD 1080p. The image is really incredible. The S Pen feature really works. I am old school and being able to use the S Pen to handwrite notes and turn them into text is something I really like. I like the idea of having great visuals on a phone and to integrate them into 2-way communication functions is perfect for me.

It comes with power-saving CPU throttling on. Turn that off and it's just insanely fast. Either way it's fast enough to do accurate voice and handwriting recognition (in many languages) with no lag. It's like having a quad core PC in your pocket. It's loaded with 4.3 Android OS. It runs all the Android software out there like a jet. I loved it. No, there were no ear-buds with it.I put a slim case on it and was in new toy heaven. Until I discovered the face glass has a hairline crack across the lower right corner. I believe the glass was defective, but it's really thin for its surface area, it's bounded by a thin metal frame, no plastic bezel, so stress on the edge is stress on the glass. E.g. when removing the S-Pen you tend to press on the glass while pulling and lifting the pen, right where mine's cracked. One way or another, this glass is just too fragile. I suspect the competition's slightly heavier phablets use a better glass. Samsung could add a replaceable protector layer for pennies.This phone hasn't done well in the face-down drop tests. In case of impact the glass is right \"there\" up front, and shatters very easily. The construction is super-light, yet the weight of the battery will drive it down pretty hard. Case or no case, the bigger the surface, the higher the odds of the face hitting something. In my case there was no drop, no impact, it was babied. Yet it's cracked. Warranty? Forget it. I'd had it well under a week. The AT&T; techs confirmed no sign of impact or abuse. But pls digest this essential factoid: AT&T; says Samsung says the entire warranty is completely void if the screen is involved. HellO? THE most important and vulnerable part? One AT&T; rep showed my son her own Samsung - with a cracked screen, and said \"I can't afford to keep replacing it\". Mandatory: a very defensive case and (especially) the newest screen protectors.Other reviewers have documented its many positives. Agreed. But is a broken $750 phone with zilch warranty really worth more than 1 star to me? Go look at one. Look at YouTube clips of Note 2 repairs. Ask yourself if the Note 3 can survive two years of YOUR normal mobile use with the occasional drop. Can you live with warranties that are just as thin? The phablet is a great concept, but this is not the only one, and many more are coming.

Reinsch", "ReviewID": "R2ERTAAFEV2W79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's keep this simple.  My wife and I have been Iphone 4S users for two years.  My kids have Ipod 5s.  We were an \"Apple\" house.  After two years of struggling against the intentional design limitations of the Apple products, I decided we had to consider an alternative.  So last summer I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and spent some time sorting out the differences between iOS and Android.  The tablet is great, and we slowly got used to the differences in operating system.  In late November I bought my wife the Galaxy Note 3, and it is fantastic.  It impressed us so much that I bought another one for me and a third for my sister-in-law a week later.  It is fast.  It is crystal clear.  It is light.  It has great battery life.  It has great connectivity with our home PC through WiFi or USB.  It plays excellent HD video to our TV.  It does everything the Apple products do, but better, faster, cleaner and with less hassle and frustration.  Oh, and it does something Apple won't do.  I also added a cheap 64G memory card to each phone, and we are swimming in available memory.I can even offer some advice on size and cases.  My wife has the Otterbox Commuter (no holster).  I have the Otterbox Defender (black w/holster).  My sister-in-law has a simple plastic shell case with her favorite team on it.  The phone is perfectly sized for my wife (who uses it mostly at home) and my sister-in-law (who uses it mostly at work).  I worried that it would be too big to fit on my belt (like the old Iphone did - also with an Otterbox).  Worry not.  It is thinner and lighter than the iPhone, and Otterbox has made the new case more efficiently.  I hardly even notice that the phone is bigger on my belt.  It rides just right.  The Galaxy Note 3 is the perfect compromise between a larger screen and still keeping it a handset.  If my kids were old enough, I would be getting them Note 3s also.  Who needs a computer anymore?Ignore the bad reviews about the \"cheap plastic\" back cover.  The back cover is nice looking and perfectly form-fits with the guts behind it.  The result is a very professional-looking and solid-feeling design.  I much prefer it to the old iPhone feel.We don't even use the stylus, but it is kind-of cool.  If you don't need the stylus, just leave it stowed.

I ran quadrant and antutu right out of the box and had gotten 23,099 and 35,668 respectively. (For those unfamiliar with these benchmarking programs, these scores absolutely demolish all the other phones out there.)(It's embarassing to say that this phone is actually more powerful than my 3 year old laptop by .2 GHz.) I was a little worried I might have gotten the Exynos version because I want the best of the best. I purchased it on amazon for 200 bucks in november. (only to find out it dropped even more to 150 during december for ATT, which is ridiculousy low. I don't know why it dropped that low but it's back up over 200 now.) I think I got a pretty good deal considering it retails for 300.but I digress.I have used iphones since the 3GS in '10, 1 3GS and 2 4s. I lost the first 2 and the last was.. let's just say it was my 21st birthday and there was a lot alcohol involved. imagine water damage but not water. yea it was pretty gross. Great birthday present for me right?well if it wasnt for that, I wouldn't have gotten this awesome phone.I got used to it SUPER fast. I fell in love with it. With samsung there's just a sheer amount of little things to fiddle with. There's a HUGE amount customization possible. The one thing I loved was that a pro version of  SketchBook made specifically for the note 3 was already preinstalled. that's a 5 dollar app.As an actual phone, voice quality is great. Ypu can use the first 20 seconds of MP3s as a ringtone but you can't choose a specific part of a song. (You can get around that by making a snippet and putting it on your phone). Texting can be cumbersome at first with such a large keyboard but you can also swype to text and there is a voice record option I find myself using often that writes what you say. It's huge but not bulky in the pocket. A case might make it bulky but as a regular guy with regular jeans, it's fine. (sorry, ladies.)PROS:-Ridiculous battery life: Average usage with average use is always 10-14 hours.-Swappable batteries make battery life irrelevant-There exists a 10,000 MaH battery for the Note 3 by zerolemon and that's crazy.-Expandable micro sd card-Can run just about anything in the app store.-Stylus, I actually use it for sketchbook and drawing in snapchat. and also for action memos lol.-13 megapixel camera-4K recording. 4K.. recording.CONS:-It comes in an ugly orange ATT box. Not the cool wood-like cardboard that I wanted. :/-Can only use multi window with certain apps.

The resolution is second to none and the battery life is the best i've ever had on a smart phone.  Additionally the touch interface is very responsive, more so than the previous Note 2.  Moreover, it is also quicker than the Note 2 when bringing up apps and running apps.  But, there are a few things that the Note 3 lacks in that the Note 2 had.  One is that although the camera for the Note 3 is 13 megapixels and the Note 2, 8 mega pixels, the Note 2 seems to take better quality pictures.  Further, the Note 2 had better low light visibility in the pictures as well.  And, the camera view point seems to be more zoomed in at the furthest level from zoom on the Note 3 making me have to take a few steps extra backward to take a picture that I wouldn't have to do with the Note 2.  Secondly, the video quality in low light lacks adjustment that the Note 2 had.  In the Note 2, one could take a video without the flash and still decipher whats in the video pretty well.  But in the Note 3 even in a slightly dim room you cannot see what is going on in the video which makes talking videos from the phone quite frustrating.  I don't know why Samsung took a step back on the camera on the Note 3 by taking away lowlight settings and replacing it with a auto adjust feature on the camera that is supposed to adjust to the different light conditions on its own.  Which, it does not do very well might I add.  But with that being said the camera is not horrible, its rather on the better side of smart phone cameras.  Another thing is the speaker phone isn't as loud as the Note 2's.  That was something that I really enjoyed on the Note 2. Overall though, the phone is probably the best phone I've ever had and I've had the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5 along with the Note 2.  The visual aspect of the phone is awesome and the default storage is 32 gigs with additional 64 gigs addable storage potential.  And, I appreciate the fact that one can take the back off and replace a battery or get extra batteries to charge on the side and replace when needed.

Every model that came out was always a striking revelation and improvement of the previous. Now I just upgraded to Note 3 (AT & T) and I couldn't ask for more. It's capabilities and functions are just mind blowing. And with its huge size, it's a 2 into 1 deal you can get, a smartphone and mini-tablet in rolled into one. I don't need to carry with me now either my ipad or tab alongside with my smartphone. I can always drive and travel light with it.

I have a Macbook pro, I use an iMac and iPads at work, and so on, so I have a grasp of Apple's OSx. I was afraid that the switch and learning a new program would be difficult but that wasn't the case at all. There are some things that Apple does better and vica versa but I am standing with my decision. Not because I am bound a 2yr contract now but because I have tried them both and this fits me better.I was afraid that this might be one of those \"too\" good to be true thing since the product goes for $179 (+ data plan and taxes) w/a 2yr contract on Amazon and nearly twice as much (+ data plan and taxes) at the stores. But seeing that the sellers are Amazon, I took the chance. If this was a \"knock-off\" then they have done a very good job :).FYI I believe that Staples is selling the Note 3 for 1 cent w/a 2yr agreement. But the catch is that you have to have never had a phone contract before, etc. Check their requirements for more info.Packing:Very generic, almost careless. When I received my box the item inside wasn't held in securely, so the product and things included rattled around. When I opened my box the phone itself almost flung out. Also it is labeled as brand new but the seal says \"QC Approved\".Phone:If you are an artist and/or business person then you are going to love the S Pen. I hardly use mine though except for typing, yes typing. i love the Android software, it's very easy to use and customizable. There are some features that I do miss from Apple products but I don't mind discovering new things on Android. The phone itself I am very satisfied with. It is a little slippery at times and feels tight in your pants when sitting if you wear fitted pants. I went to the movies with it in my pockets and I thought that the pressure from my fitted jeans had warped my screen a little. Whether it did or not it is hardly noticeable.As of right now I am typing from a Macbook pro. only because I have to charge my phone. The battery life is okay maybe it's do to the fact that i kept playing with it.

IT'S A BEAST!!!It runs flawlessly no matter what you have running, no lag, it can handle any hardcore multitasking of multiple apps! It's nothing for me to have youtube playing and running other apps at the same time right underneath it and texting over the top of both using chompSMS. Simply put, there IS NOT a better device on the market right now, period.I have been a loyal Apple iPhone user for the last 6 years and finally being fed up with three things I switched to this phone and couldn't be happier. I was sick of how small the iPhones are compared to all the other devices on the market right now. I was sick of how slow the iPhone is compared to the Galaxy S4's and Note 3's. And lastly I was sick of waiting YEARS AND YEARS for simple options, features, and settings that Apple was holding back from it's customers who paid damn high prices for their iPhones. Oh and one more, I was sick of having to jailbreak just to try and get some of the optional settings Apple should have included years before. The last straw was when I stopped at best buy and starting playing with one of these. I was blown away by how fast and smooth it is, and HUGE AND BEAUTIFUL too!If you're just a casual phone user who talks and texts and maybe uses facebook but that's about it, yeah stick to your iPhone, you'll never have a problem with it, they are solid phones with super clean easy to use operating systems. But if you're like me and you use every setting and app on your phone, spend hours a day on your phone, use it for work, play, and entertainment, this is the device for you right here!!! Simply put, this phone will do EVERYTHING an iPhone will do and WAY MORE! Duh, it has a quad core processor and 3 FREAKIN GIGS OF RAM!!! So obviously it's going to smoke anything on the market in speed. The huge beautiful display obviously smokes any other phone on the market and it's the only device with the S pen and all it's cool features. Originally I thought the S pen would be silly and I wouldn't use it much, I was wrong, it's awesome! I don't use it all the time, probably about 30% of the time, but I must say when I'm using it, I'm loving it. There's times where it's fun to use and other times where you're going to want to put it away and just use your fingers. For facebook I use the S pen. If I'm having long texting conversations I just use my finger and the swipe texting feature.It's a no-brainer, if you are drawn to this phone and think you might like it, I promise you'll love it! If you're a die hard iPhone user who doesn't want to deal with such a huge device go with your gut because that's what this is all about, getting what you want. I want features, usability, options, processing power, speed (RAM), and a huge screen. I get all that on the note 3 and basically none of that on an iPhone.Good luck to ya in your purchase!

Do not buy this phone if you are looking for something that is small and easy to slip into your pocket as that is not the case with the Note 3. If you want a phone with an amazingly beautiful screen and many new functions that I myself find very handy then this is the phone for you. To pick on just one of the new features I like the scrapbooking as they call it is the most handiest of them all to have. No matter what you are doing whether it be in a video or on the web, you can start this tool and litterally circle what ever it is you want to save for later and it does it. Recipes for me with this is a snap now. No more wondering if they website I found with a really good looking recipe is compatible with the app I have. Just circle the recipe and your done. There is one unconfirmed rumor I heard that Samsung is struggling right now so not sure if this is something to consider when buying this phone or not but to me it doesn't matter. All in all when it comes to any smart phone they are all fragile and need to be protected. Obviously some are stronger than others and can take more punishment but at the end of day when your talking about a $500-$800 phone investing in a phone case to protect it is a must have. I know they are bulky but get over it and DO IT.

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density).

It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertise or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III.

I expected to have GPS dropping problems because of the many reviews and blogs I had seen mentioning it, so I mentioned that problem in my review. But to be fair, after weeks of testing, the GPS and online navigation works very well and I see no need to use the workarounds mentioned in those forums and blogs.Either they have fixed the problem with the newer phones software, or the trigger for the problem which seems to have to do with switching from one type of data connection to another while on the move (i.e. LTE to 4g or different towers or w/e)does not occur in my area. I have ATT and live in San Diego County and I drive for a living. I used the GPS to navigate to about 20 addresses a few days ago over an 8 hour period of time. Not only did it get me there and never drop signal, but the battery lasted me all day (I did turn the screen off when I it wasn't needed and listened to audio instructions so the screen was only on 50% of the time). It saved my but when my normal navigator, a garmin, had nowhere to plug into in the vehicle I checked out that day.So basically this phone is spectacular and the only potential flaw I heard about doesn't affect my phone or my area.

After years of suffering with an iPhone Five and Apples failing operating system, I have found the Galaxy Note Three to be a breath of fresh air. The greatest aspect of this phone has got to be the battery life. The battery, which is as large as some smart phones, allows a full day of calling, texting, gaming, internet browsing, and movie watching, without the need of a recharge. For someone who had to recharge their phone twice a day with their old phone, the long lasting battery life is reason enough to make the switch to Samsung. Another feature that sets the Galaxy Note Three apart from the competition is it\u2019s larger sized high definition screen.  The screens images are so crystal clear that they rival the picture quality of high definition computer monitors and televisions. The Galaxy Note Three\u2019s larger screen size has also proved to be a major convenience. With the larger dimensions, one can easily show video and photographs to a group of friends without having to pass your phone around from person to person. This eliminates the concern of damage caused if  your phone is dropped. With all the large benefits that set the Galaxy Note Three apart from other phones on the market, Samsung also added in several small features that separate this phone from all others. When you are texting, the phone vibrates every time you touch a key. These small vibrations causes the touchscreen to feel like an actual keypad, rather than a piece of glass. Another small feature of the Galaxy Note Three is the ability to change from song to song on the MP3 player by passing an open hand over the touchscreen. This feature may not have world changing value, but feeling like a Jedi Knight, even if only for a moment, can never be underestimated.  With all the positive points of the Galaxy Note Three, there are also a few drawbacks. The phone comes with several apps that serve the same function which makes the interface somewhat confusing. The settings menu is nearly impossible to navigate because of TouchWiz, which is so broken they had to add a search bar so that users could type in what they are looking for. There are also a few concerns about the construction of the phone.  The sheer size of the phones screen makes it fragile to the point that a drop will most probably end in the screen shattering. This problem is compounded by the plastic exterior of the phone which provides little rigidity or protection. With a price of two hundred dollars to replace a damaged screen, the fragility of the Galaxy Note Three is by far the greatest concern to an otherwise stellar product. If you are a person that loves the most advanced technology, and are willing to spend the money on a good phone case, I would recommend the Galaxy Note Three as your next phone.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone.

They were small, simple, and while we did not particular care for Apple restricting your ability to do anything to it, it suited our needs.When we traded up for the Samsung Note III, we were of course in awe of the shiny new toy. It had a great screen, did all sorts of neat things (drawing on your screen, voice texting, ect) that made us go \"Oooooo.\" The battery life is amazing. I fiddle with some games when I'm bored, watch youtube videos every now and then, surf the web, respond to e-mails, text - and after a full day of being uncharged (14 hours later) , I still have 47% battery life. I once let it go uncharged for 2 days and it was still at 19% and kicking. The low battery alarm doesn't start going off until 11%.A few cons though...1) Don't get a case. Atleast not the small thin wallet type by ULAK that I got. I love the case. Don't get me wrong. Its perfect for making sure I don't scratch my phone while it is tossed and thrown around in my purse of mysteries. The phone certainly is big enough to find in a stack. However - it makes for taking actual phone calls to your ear rather difficult, as its a big phone, and the case only adds to it. I use speakerphone alot - which works great by the way. I can talk from across the room from where the phone is and am still heard clearly (I'm not a yeller).2) Don't bother with the gorilla glass/whatever screen protector they try to sell you at the AT&T; store for the phone. It's $30 something dollars. Both both got one thinking itd be a neat way to protect our phones. Its only been a month, and my husbands is already peeling up at the corners and mine collects 'dirt' at the edges when I'm never around anything dirty and then gets under the sticky so I can't get it out. To me - its not worth the money if its already wearing down so fast from light everyday use. It is pretty clear though for the screen - like its not there!3) The auto-correct is the bane of my existing. I consider myself a very skilled phone typer. On my iphone, I could type out paragraphs without ever looking at my screen half the time and it typed out perfectly. Autocorrected to just the right word each time. The Note III makes up words for me I never input, or have never heard of. I am CONSTANTLY correcting the auto-correct. Whether I use the stylus or my fingers on the keyboard. No matter how slow I take it or fast I go, it never puts exactly what I want. I guess this is why they push the voice-text feature so much on this phone, and didn't put as much development into the old T9 methods of auto correct. This is my biggest frustration. The phone is supposed to 'learn' how you type, but apparently isn't as smart as the iphone who can keep up with my typing skills.

That may be because it surfs the mobile web sites.  Anyway, to get to the point this phone is a speed demon.  It has so many customizable features you can personalize it almost any way you like.  Wallpapers, passkeys, lock screen tags, app arrangement, voice recognition, it's all here and then some.  If the screen size bothers you, simply enable \"one handed operation\" mode (be sure to check every box under the menu so it functions across all apps and screens), do a quick swipe of your finger from right to left and back to right, and the screen shrinks down to a customizable box that can be operated much like a smaller cell phone!  It can even recognize when you're looking at the screen or not and shut itself off or pause vids accordingly.  The battery is huge and has lasted me all day.  It's very thin and light.  4g LTE service is the fastest i've seen on a phone.  I switched to At&t; from Sprint specifically so I can get the most out of this device.  Sprint never had 4g in the 3 years that I owned my previous phone, the Epic 4G, even though I paid for \"premium data\".  In my area, (Central Louisiana), At&t; delivers.  Sucks that data is not unlimited and my monthly plan costs more, though.  I have only tapped the surface of what this phone can do.  The camera is amazing.  Video is amazingly sharp and it picks up sound very well.  I saw posts that image stabilization for video was not included but I'm pretty sure it actually is on this model.  There is a tab that says smart stabilization when I recorded vids for the first time and I enabled it and seemed to notice a difference.  I haven't even tried the 4k resolution yet and I am blown away.  Coming from a first generation Galaxy phone to this is truly a worthwhile upgrade.  Basically, it's like carrying a very capable desktop computer in your pocket.  The phone is quite large, but I got used to it in a couple of days.  The swype function is better than ever and even more responsive.  It fulfills the main things I planned to use it for...watching youtube and netflix and recording sharp video.  As time goes on it can evolve to meet any other needs i may have of it.  It's good for business use or fun.  It's like I got a great camera, video camera, web browser, phone, computer and gaming machine all in one!  I plan to get the Smart Trade 2 year warranty from amazon to cover this baby.  As of now I am protecting it with a Bodyguardz screen cover (highly recommended and sold on amazon as well) and an Incipio phone case.  If you're gonna spend the dough for this thing you may as well get some decent protection and coverage.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it, but it does have some problems.", "Author": "Wtran", "ReviewID": "R10Q7HZP542DYT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a total techie. I love new gadgets and gizmos, and I WILL read the manual before I tinker with it. I'm the type of person that would want to maximize the experience and total functionality of a product, because why else would anyone buy a $708 phone (from ATT)?Despite my love for the phone, there are some problems. Let me start off with the innumerable PROS.The screen resolution is absolutely breathtaking. Clear crisp colors combined with unbeatable brightness. I was actually able to see what I was working on while I was walking outside on a really sunny day (on auto-brightness), which is really saying something. None of my other phones were able to adjust so well.The sound quality and loudness were a definite plus for me. It is not boom box/stereo loud, but for the phone that it is, it does pack quite a punch.Call quality has definitely been clear and crisp, which is surprising because I've been in areas where the signal hasn't been perfect.  I haven't experienced any static or issues at all.The S Pen experience itself, is worth the Note 3 purchase. The feedback from interaction between the screen and pen is really nice. Smooth writing with a 'real' like quality writing. Note-taking or jotting is a joy especially on such a big screen like the Note 3. The S Pen also has a button that when clicked, would pop up a menu option for other things the pen can do (scrapbooking, taking notes, etc).  It is really nice and convenient. I have used my Adonit Jot Pro stylus on my iPad to play candy crush, and even that was nothing compared to playing candy crush with the S Pen. The feedback is great!I love the widgets they have available, it makes all of my planning and day-to-day life easier. With an iCloud calendar sync app, the calendar widget makes planning my day/week/month much easier now that it's so big on the home screen. It is really customizable and the amount of widgets now available (compared to what I had on the S2) is mind-boggling.I love how Samsung was able to actually improve and grow. They have now added an assistive light widget (so we don't have to go to third party apps for a flashlight), and they have a notification settings where you can customize the main settings you have access to (8), while still being able to access them all. Features like: power saving, NFC, S Beam, Multi-tasking, Air plane mode, Bluetooth, are all great, it's nice to be able to choose what you want.The phone itself is fast and this is substantiated by the fact that you can multi-task now. I was able to google/email and netflix all at the same time. Now if that isn't fast and smooth, I don't know what is.The lock screen is much more customizable now, and that's great because I can include my email (for if I were to lose/misplace my phone) while showing my individual flair.I like visual voicemail a lot as well. It saves a lot of time and hassle sitting impatiently as you listen to the message and try to figure out who left it. With visual voicemail, you can play it, manually fast forward or rewind, see how long the message is, who left it, and even a button to call them back. No more need to sit there and wait a whole minute to hear \"press seven to delete...press blah blah to hear more options.\"Now, there's still room for improvement. I have a lot of Apple products simply because of its convenience and ease of use. They have their fair share of problems. In comparison to Siri, S Voice is not as smooth in operation. Despite my best attempts to loudly articulate my wishes and desires, it often times repeats back the most ridiculous things. I do appreciate the fact that you can open apps with S Voice (this has long been established, but still appreciated).  S Voice is nice, but there's still room for improvement.Camera. I keep having to remind myself that this phone is not an iPhone (they invest solely on their camera). The Note 3's camera is not as great as the iPhone's, I must admit. But it is relatively good and intuitive. I think the closest thing you can get to iPhone quality is the 'Rich Tone (HDR)' option which boosts the colors. I took several pictures and videos to test run the quality and I wasn't that impressed. The camera auto focuses while you record so you can actually see process of focusing while you're recording, which is distracting. As a result, only one area of focus can targeted at a time. I haven't taken portraits or group shots, so I don't know how this will work out, but I guess I'll have to wait and see. Besides the camera quality, I'm really giddy about the modes they have offered. Sports shots, panorama, 360 shots, best shots, they're all nice and I'm excited for a chance to try them out!Now, the meh. Despite the phone being almost absolutely amazing, I started running into some problems that I found out other people were experiencing as well. Email. My email kept lagging/freezing and logged itself out. It would not authenticate. It worked after several tries, only to have the same issue again. I somehow fixed it only to run into the error 'Email not responding,' forcing the app to close.  This is annoying because it seems to occur almost every time I received an incoming email. People across the internet have suggested unmounting the microSD card and using a new one, but despite doing this and even removing the card completely, the problem is still occurring. As a result, other apps have been 'glitchy' as well. The transitions between apps haven't been as flawlessly impeccable as I've seen. I'm going to tinker with it some more before I do a hard reset.I definitely recommend this phone. I saved up the whole sum to purchase this phone straight from the get go and don't regret it.

But the phone has already frozen up two times, requiring me to hold the button on the right side for several seconds until a restart. No, I did not install any new apps, the phone froze up when I was trying to read email.  And then the phone often freezes for a few seconds while doing simple navigation, but then continues.  (No, I was not watching a movie or listening to music.) Maybe it's a hardware defect? Also, there's so much bloat/crap-wear that's difficult to remove, or can't be removed, and some can't be disabled completely (like My Magazine) - and those consume data bandwidth. And I thought with all the processing power that this device claims to have, the UI would be snappier. Instead it's only very slightly faster that my previous iPhone 4s with IOS-7.  And with IOS-6 this Note 3 is slower.  I've seen older Android phone and they are sooo slow, compared to iPhones - I think those who say this phone is fast are just comparing it to older Androids. But the screen is a nice size, and without a case and protector it feels cheaply made, unlike iPhones which seem more solid. (But I'm sure others have dropped and broken their iPhones.)

Within about six weeks the complaints from my clients and family were coming in several times a day. Another bum phone!! All AT&T; wants to do is send me a refurbished phone under the warranty. I've tried and tried to get them to understand that I paid for a new phone THAT WORKED and I've never gotten that. They really don't care. All they do is read their scripts, tell me they understand, and often hang up on me even though I have been polite (although firm) about my expectations.Fun tablet, terrible phone!!!!", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Price Cut vs The Hassle.... i dont think its worth it", "Author": "Robert R.", "ReviewID": "RAOSUPTNNQ0Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DONT EVER BUY A NEW PHONE FROM AMAZON WITH ANY WIRELESS CARRIER. Why? You might seem to be getting the phone at a smaller price but you cant forget about the $100 deposit if your a new customer. And if your uprgading it they will add more money to the price and im not talking the uprgrade fee. THATS NOT EVEN THE BIG PROBLEM. The biggest problem is, them sending me supposedly TWO FAULTY SIM CARDS with the device, then lying to me and sayin that the store could give me another one but they cant. On top of that my NUMBER DIDNT FULLY PORT THROUGH, PHONE DIDNT ACTIVATE (cause Amazon activation instructions dont work and it showed, my SIM wasnt faulty they just dont know how to activate a SIM and AT&T; did thankfully) and to top it all off AT&T; DIDNT GET THE $100 DEPOSIT from Amazon! So they charging me (again). Did i mention the S-Scroll, Smart Pause, and Air gesture dont work on phone? (Although i think a handful of people have that problem too, might be a Samsung thing) THIS IS WHAT YOU DEAL WITH WHEN YOU DONT GET YOUR PHONE DIRECTLY FROM THE WIRELESS CARRIER. Just Amazon and AT&T; customer service pointing fingers at each other sending you in circles for a week to finally get phone activated.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "L.

When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it.I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on \"Automatic\") and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this.So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time... I mean, why have a long life battery, quad core cpu, and 3 gb RAM, if you can't fully utilize them? So, this phone does this to prevent overheating. Why would a $700 phone have a problem with overheating!?!STAY AWAY FROM THE GALAXY NOTE 3!", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone did not come unlocked", "Author": "santos b. lainez", "ReviewID": "R2GTR7AM7KF59A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i received the phone when i tried to add my sim card it did not come unlocked and was told to enter a unlock pin", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be aware... region lock from Samsung...", "Author": "Hoteler", "ReviewID": "R3OI9ZZYPHC57B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Samsung put a region lock on it.
