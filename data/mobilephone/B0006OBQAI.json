It is perfect for someone who's looking for something easy to work with, it has a simple and in detail user's guide, the battery has a long life span, and it has a good size screen.I read many negative reviews on this phone on various webpages but I still decided to buy it. I have no regrets. A lot of people said this phone has a bad camera quaility. From the pictures I've taken I see no worse quality in this camera phone than any other. A lot of other flip phones have a longer display screen inside which tends to strech the picture. This phone is a perfect screen size that keeps the picture to the right dementions.The caller ID is simple and shows on the outside of the phone when someone is calling. You can set your option to show a picture and where you have to open the phone to answer it.The speaker phone is another good feature on this phone. It is very loud and clear and is perfect for when you are driving or need your hands free.I've already dropped this phone and acidentally smashed it underneathe my chair. There are no sratches on it and its still in perfectly good working condition. A lot of people said this phone was like a toy as was fragile. I don't understand how it can be fragile if I can put a metal chair on top of it; unless the person that said that was throwing this at the wall repeatly or beating it with a baseball bat I see no problems with it.Over all I give this phone a 5 star rating. I've had no problems with it and it is well worth the money you are paying for.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "I had this phone for over 2 years", "Author": "Craig Detter", "ReviewID": "R1MOSFTASVGHTK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for over 2 years, the phone worked great until it died recently. However, I used a belt holster and although it did get dropped a few times, it wasn't very often. I thought the camera worked great, the address book had over 500 numbers in it when I last backed it up. I couldn't ask that it did much more. I presume the others that rated it poorly had more rugged use of the phone, but I used it every day for business. The talk time was very long compared to most of the newer phones. I would talk on average 2-3 hours per day on the phone, and I only charged it every other day or so.

I charged the phone overnight and it showed completely charged, but the power reading recessed from full to only one on the upper right corner indicator that same evening.  I have only talked mostly about 20 minutes that day.  The reception is the poorest I have ever had among other cell phones, including an older motorola model which I used to have.My purchase was for a 'New' cell phone but the product does not appear like a new one. The package came in very poor condition.  The back cover of the phone was open and the body of the phone was not in a plastic bag like some of its accessaries.  There was a carrying case which was made of very cheap plastic and was broken beyond use. Do not be fooled by the statements: \"Ships in Original Packaging: This item ships separately and in the original manufacturer's packaging.\"Last thing I want to mention is that the charger in the first shipment was an european type (round teeth) and one of them was broken.  I called the \"Hasslefreecell\" company and left a message. Someone called back the next day or two, promised to send me a new one under the condition that I would write a good review for the product.  I received the charger (wrapped around by a rubber band), but it would not plug in the cell phone. I had to call them again for a new one.  The new one came in a few days later.  Now I got this new one which charges but the power only lasts for about ONE day.I ordered this 'unlocked' multi-frequency cellphone for possible use outside of the U.S. I have so far no chance to try it yet I really doubt about that it will work giving so many other problems I have encountered so far.  As a matter of fact, I am planning to return the product and dispute the payment with American Express.BTW, the package came in with the printing of 'All sales are final'. This is controdictory from its ad placed with Amazon.I strongly suggest that Amazon looks into this company and its advertisement and correct any inadequate behavior there.  I like Amazon and don't want to be scarred away by this \"Hasslefreecell\" company.Buttom line.

I've had this phone for about 10 months now and here is what I've gotten.- Often I will be speaking with someone and they will complain about a \"buzzing\" or something that I would not hear. I usually thought it was a radio or computer interfering with the signal, but looking at some reviews I can say that it was probably the phone itself.- The pictures taken with it aren't to die for. It's something but not the greatest.- While in my pocket, my keys or other things will push the buttons on the sides of my phone, causing it to chirp in the middle of class or maybe stop my phone from ringing when someone calls, making me miss the call.- The phonebook isn't that great but if you have the patience it's not that big of a deal. Everytime I put a e-mail, cell number and house number, I would get a seperate entry for it with the same name, making it confusing. Also, you cannot type in the entire name. You must type in the first letter then scroll through all the names with that first letter. Big pain if you have a lot of contacts.- The sound was good. Usually I could hear the phone ringing. One thing I think happens way too often is, when it is in my pocket it may rest on some paper, cutting down on the vibration when on that setting, making me not notice it.-Recently it has been saying that the battery is dying right in the middle of the day after I fully charged it, and if you don't notice at first you hear that annoying beep (which can be awkward when you're trying to be quiet).- Also, it has been having a delay when I open it between when the screen comes on and when I had actually flipped it open. This is actually why I may be getting a new phone, if I can't get it fixed. The screen has gone completely black except for the backlight. I can make calls, recieve calls and all that good stuff but can't see a dang thing.Overall, it's a okay phone. Nothing outstanding. You can probably find something better for about the same price so I suggest you shop around before you make your decision.", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Screen died after six months", "Author": "Q.
