And since the company doesn't answer email questions (though they say they do)the customer is left flailing in cyberspace. They do not facilitate trouble shooting and with no \"Help\" phone number I am left high and dry with a phone that doesn't work. The manual is totally insufficient if you can't get the phone to work out of the gate. If there are only specific sims cards supported I think they should have been listed in the ad.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": "2-inch TFT LCD display\nVGA Camera with video recording; Analog TV; SMS; MMS; BLU Mail; FM radio; MP3 player; MP4 Player; Bluetooth; Organizer; MP3 ringtones and MicroSD slot upgradeable up to 8GB.\nGames; Browser WAP 2.0/xHTML; 256K colors; Internal Memory 128 MB ROM, 64 MB RAM; GPRS Class 10 (4+1/3+2 slots), 32 - 48 kbps and Micro USB Port.\nTalk time up to 8hrs - Stand-by up to 288 hrs.\nThis unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
