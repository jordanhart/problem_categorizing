{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos", "Author": "Russ in Elk Grove", "ReviewID": "RUKYZ7HM2U3GK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the dual SIM version of this phone.  When you get the dual SIM, you give up the flash on the camera, and you get a slightly larger case that no known snap-on cover fits.  Also be advised that if you leave two SIMs in it, you are running two radios, so it will use battery faster.  We use two SIMS only when we travel, but it is nice to have that option.PROsScreen is bright and crisp, and it works well with my fingers.  I have large fingers that apparently are not capacitive because for some reason, my fingers do not work well with most capacitive screens.  This screen works perfectly for me, which made it instantly my favorite smartphone.  Reception is good.  Sound quality both ways is good, though not excellent.  Camera is good, but not as good as an iPhone.CONSIt is noticeably slower than my work android phone, but that phone cost a lot more and has to be charged at least once a day.  We charge this every day, but I have never seen it below 85% charge with bluetooth and WiFi both turned on, so it would apparently run several days on a charge if we needed it to.  We are not running any serious programs, so I would rather have battery time than CPU speed.ADDENDUMFound a beautiful snap-on cover in a cell phone shop in Madrid.  Red translucent jell on the back with a harder, clearer, red translucent edge around the screen.  Fits perfectly, adds little bulk, and looks beautiful on this white phone.  Just 3 Euros ($4).  Sorry I tossed the packaging so I don't know the brand.Bad news:  Like most cell phones, this one does not like water.  My wife dumped a glass of water over this phone.  We dismantled it and dried it out overnight and it works now, though not very well.  Looks like we will be buying another.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelente muy bueno", "Author": "Jonnathan Duarte", "ReviewID": "R2Q02YPPRO3L3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good product is what I needed met my expectations. thanks for apoyo.espero in future keep buying good as the one I bid produtos", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Kendal Boyde", "ReviewID": "R32V4IWBBAYOE3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must say the phone works well and am enjoying it, I will recommend this phone for those who loves diversity...............", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well.", "Author": "CARLOS ALBERTO MILANO QUINTERO", "ReviewID": "R27D7ZQJZMF6BW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The right equipment, the only thing that occasionally hangs up I, I talk about two minutes and drops the call. otherwise excellent team.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R3NYA6CV2VTL8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "llego en muy buenas condiciones me fascina. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009LX2140"}}
