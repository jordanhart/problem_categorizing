Went from a Motorola RAZR to LG CU500 to this in a very short time and can easily say this phone beats those in a hearbeat in terms of ease of use and looks!If you find its short cuts - which after a week of use you will - you'll see it's extrememly customizable and easy to use.  CNET rated it excellent after their extensive review system and said the only fault they found in it was the 'slippery' keypad - which I have not had any problems with coming from the flat keys of the RAZR.To the person that called this phone upgly, couldn't be more wrong.  Unless you're looking at $600 phones out in the Asia and Europe market right now, there isn't a better looking phone out there!p.s. the white is much more attractive but more feminine.", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Never Buy a Ringtone Again...", "Author": "J. Evans", "ReviewID": "R3CVI13OYMG9XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a little over a week and I am in love with it. It's so fashionable and functional at the same time. And with bluetooth and iTunes, you can make your own ringtones from any song in your library and then bluetooth it to your phone in the blink of an eye! So cool!! I can't find anything bad to say about the phone --- the MP3 player is awesome with a sweet display --- i bought the extra SD memory card and I have so much room now --- the camera is incredible quality for a phone. 1.3 megapixels turns out to be a 11 x 17  inch photo at 72 dpi. I printed one out and was amazed! My friends are so jealous of this phone and all the stuff it can do. I love the colors on the displays, especially the rainbow color of the numbers! I'm very happy I bought it and you will be too!", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone...just a few annoying features!", "Author": "S. Knapek", "ReviewID": "R1SBL0ZG742V84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone truly is amazing. I researched phones a ton before actually receiving this phone, and let me tell you that no review does it justice. It's a beautifully designed phone. The camera is okay for a phone and the buttons are a bit slippery, but you can customize almost everything on this phone (sounds, fonts, colors, etc.) It's small and I don't see any problem with the earpiece volume. My last phone was a Sony Ericsson K790A and the call volume was worse, although if you're used to a loud volume you may be disappointed.The most annoying part of this phone is that the phone makes an annoying beeping sound with every single button you push (menus, text messages, dialing - literally every single button). You can turn it off, but you have to turn off ALL keypad sounds in order to do it. Not a big deal, but I really liked the dialing voice that actually pronounced the number you were dialing while you were dialing, but alas, it has to be off to avoid the headache-giving beeping noise.Overall I would recommed this phone to anyone. It isn't the most feature-rich phone on the planet, but if you like customization and having a very cool-looking phone, this is the one!You will get a lot of compliments with this phone, and in my opinion the white is such an improvement over the black. It looks extremely clean and it's different than any phone out there. I wish I knew how many compliments I've gotten in the week I've had it.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Great phone", "Author": "E.

I upgraded from my Razr and the difference is night and day.PROS:1. Lightweigh but still durable enough not to break easily2. Color scheme is perfect3. Camera is better than many other of today's phones4. Can make a call with the slide down5. Easy to navigate menu6. Long battery life7. Great reception8. Volume is sufficient9. Doesn't get dirty easily10. Easy to see iconsCONS:1. Only comes with phone and charger (thought maybe small memory card)2. When first starting out, performing simple tasks may seem difficult. IE. transfering music, photos, videos etc.There are so many good things with this phone that they outweigh the bad. I highly recommend this phone to children who want the music aspect of the phone, and to adults who want a quality phone for a reasonible price.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "So Awesome!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2XOTOHYQYMZXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loveeee loveeee this phone! The white is much much cooler looking than the black, and it has everything on it! It has a camera, recorder, video, and mp3 player. you can even get a microSD chip and put your own pics,movies, and songs on it! it is sooo cool. the ONLY annoying thing is that if you don't have the ring volume on vibrate or silent, every button you push makes the phone beep. but i like it soooo much otherwise. none of my friends have white, or slider phones. you should deffinitely get it because it is GREAT! =D", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3VI5M9AFCP36C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this new phone for christmas and I love it so much. It is so pretty and I get so many compliments on it. The screen is big and bright, and the sound is great. The buttons are easy to use and not too small and it is easy to text. Cool MP3 player and it records audio great, nice, clear speakerphone. The only annoying things is that everytime you press and button it beeps but you can turn it off. The one bad thing that you can't fix is you can't use audio that you've recorded for a ringtone. But other than that this is a GREAT phone.

This phone has everything i need like:- Big Screen < Games are easy to see, and better game play compared to other phopnes with small screens. This phone displays big text wich is way easier to see and can be customizable. >- 1.3 Mega Pixel camera < Pictures are very good for a phone, but not that good to print out. In the other hand 1.3MP is better than VGA >- MP3 Player < Very Good MP3 player ! Speaker is CLEAR and LOUD, but it would have been beter if it was a bit louder. I haven't tried hearing music through the samsund headphones yet.>- Expandable Memory < This phone comes with 18mb of internal memory, wich is more than enough, for games, graphics, ringtones, pictures, and any other data you save on the phone. But, if you plan to have more than 4 full songs on this phone, you will need a Micro SD card. Be aware ! this phone supports up to a 1 GB. I went out to get a 2GB, when i slide the 2GB card on my phone, it showed 998,687K of free memory ( 1,000,000K = 1GB ), and not 2GB, wich is about 1,998,000K. I went to return the 2GB for a 1GB and my phone showed the same amount of free space. >This phone has very good reception, and good call quality. The speaker is a tad low, sometimes it is hard to hear the person you are talking to. Sometimes i have to enable the speaker to hear in loud enviroments, and even that the speaker isn't very loud. The download time for a song from my computer to the phone is about 25 seconds. I have problems trying to transfer songs to my phone because somtimes it doesn't let me. When a song is tranfering, it will stop at 20% and then displays a window wich says: FAILED TO TRANSFER FILE. I have to keep trying this for about 5 times, until it is able to transfer the file, after that i will be able to transfer about 15+ songs until it fails to transfer another song.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Super little phone", "Author": "Debbie Michel", "ReviewID": "R2TGGXAQJAJ24U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced my Razor which had a broken hinge with this phone.  At first I gave it only three stars because I had a lot of trouble getting the phone set up.  It doesn't seem to be near as intuitive as the Razr.  I've got most everything figured out now and I LOVE this phone.  I still think the instruction book is poorly written and there a few things I don't like.  Don't use the mp3 player.  It's just a phone for me.  Don't like that I can't program it not to go the web all the time.  That button is just to easy to push.  Text messaging is great and the phone feels great in your hand.  Love the voice dialing.  I think this phone is a great value as a phone.  And the battery goes on forever.  I used it all day and didn't charge it that night.  I used it for most of the next day until I had a 3 hr phone conversation with a friend.  After the conversation it finally needed a charge.  My razr never had that kind of battery life.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "E. Perelez-Melendez", "ReviewID": "R3LOTMRYP5CR0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello,  This is a very well designed phone, inside and out. First of all, the call quality is very good, although i wish the volume could be a bit louder. Hopefully, this will be addressed with a future firmware update. The voice dialing feature on this phone is amazing. The MP3 player and 1.3 MP camera quality are good, although i prefer to still use my standalone player and camera. The 262k color screen is beautiful, and playing games and surfing the web on it is very enjoyable. I do recommend downloading the free Opera Mini browser so that you will be able to get to more web pages. It works great with this phone.  I have had the black and white version of this phone. The white version has a very nice polished look and feel to it. I have gotten so many compliments on it from co-workers and friends. The black version has a flat finish to it and is pretty sexy too. I found the backlighting on the white version to be a bit brighter than the black version, and for whatever reason, i am getting better reception from the white version. I know the hardware and software are the same on both, so i do not really understand why this is happening.  I gave this phone 4 stars for a few reasons. First, it would have been nice to have gotten a data cable, or memory card, or headphones, or anything extra with this phone. Alot of its competitors include some/all of these accessories with their phone, and i really cannot see myself spending extra money for these things when i already have standalone units. Next, although the issue of the volume \"may\" be addressed in the future, there is no doubt that right now the volume of calls is a bit too low. The quality is great, but the volume is not. Finally, the amount of accessories available for this phone is pretty low. Where is the love for the D-807?", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "my samsung d807:", "Author": "Vera M.

Peet", "ReviewID": "R3AYD7U2XP8BPS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace a stolen LG CU500, and after 6 months of use I chose to buy a used one to replace this Samsung. It's a good quality phone and I got tons of compliments on how nice looking it is, but I found it to be WAY too irritating in more ways than one. The keypad is very slippery and required my hand to be at an awkward angle, which made text messaging a chore. I also had issues with the reciever volume not being loud enough. In order to hear while I was driving I had to have my window up, the radio off, and no vents on. In 90 degree heat, this sucks. The camera is nice but I prefered the rotating lense of the LG CU500. I used my LG CU500 to listen to music and for photos frequently but never did on the Samsung because I found the features difficult to use. The browser was also better on the LG. I was unable to access several pages on the Samsung that I was able to on the LG CU 500's 3G network.

I own the white version and it looks super!  The voiceCommand feature really understands what you're saying.  It allows you to access nearly any of the features of the phone using only voice commands!  The feature understands any user, which means anyone can use the feature.  The one hangup I have is that according to Samsung (I called their help line), the phone CANNOT USE SAVED MP3S AS RINGTONES!!  The only way to use them is if you PURCHASE the ringtone from online.  Despite the useful expandable memory card slot, you can't use your already saved audio files as ringtones.  Aside from that, I'm very happy with it.
