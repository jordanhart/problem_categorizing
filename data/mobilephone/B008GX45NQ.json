After using the phone minimally for two months, my son came home very upset about a black bar covering the left 1/8 of the screen. A couple days later, after being reminded to take extra care with the phone (that he rarely uses and keeps in his bookbag during school or on his desk at home), the screen showed further damage and is virtually unreadable. Though he's a responsible kid and says he didn't misuse, drop or spill anything on the phone, I can't verify the screen damage wasn't due to user abuse. The screen's vulnerability is still worth noting. The phone and features still work (as far as we can tell), but without the ability to view the screen, it's now really only good for incoming calls. My original review follows.**Bought for our son for emergency contact and basic communications. It sends and receives texts and calls without issue. Haven't used the dual-sim feature, Bluetooth, or any data/browsing features. The micro-SD card slot doesn't hold the card in place, so if the back of the phone and battery is removed, it falls out. Photos are poor quality, as is expected with this model. The customizable profile features are helpful, so he can set his phone to silent during school, vibrate at church, and normal at home. As a parent, I really like the auto ON/OFF feature that we set to turn off at 9:30pm, then back on at 6:30am. He loves the radio feature. We are very happy with the reliability of this phone for basic use by a first time cell owner. Purchased for $31 through rcamobile with standard shipping and was received on time.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for money spent", "Author": "J.Stanley", "ReviewID": "R26OOLM6M86Q6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the fanciest phone that would support my $10 web2go data plan.

Keyboard doesn't always seem to work, sometimes pushing directional keypad left will go right and vice versa.  Company told me mine might be defective and offered to send me out a new one free of charge but never did. If you're looking for a cheap phone, you can find nicer ones on ebay for lower prices.
