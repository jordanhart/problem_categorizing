{"Reviews": [{"Title": "NICE MP3 PLAY/CELL PHONE COMBO", "Author": "RICH", "ReviewID": "R1HCCQQ9FZPJFK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this MP3 Player/Cell Phone for over a year now...  I am 90% happy with it...  The one negative is that it has a habit of locking up sometimes...  I need to pull the battery out and let it reboot...  This usually works...  The last time it didn't work so I took it back to T-Mobile...  NO HELP THERE...  They don't even carry the Nokia EpressMusic Phone anymore...  The lock up may be because I have installed an 8MB Mini Storage Chip for music...  Not sure...  I would like to install a 16MB Mini Storage Chip but T-Mobile told me it could not handle the 16MB Chip...  It comes with a 2MB Chip...  Which will hold a fair amount of music...  I have about 125 albums with about 2500 songs on this 8MB Chip...  Lots of music...  It comes with a cord for connecting to you computer and you can easily transfer from your Windows Music Player to the Cell Phone...  You can also transfer photos both ways...  No longer do you need to send a photo you took on the phone VIA Email...  Just plug into your computer...  It will bring up a Windows Screen just like when you go into \"My Computer.\"  Open up \"My Computer\" and you can click and drag between the two...  Either way...  All in all...  I am happy...  I am thinking of getting a second one just to have a back up...  I know this one cannot last forever...  It can make a nice gift for someone too...  Anyway...  I am Happy...  PS...  It works well in the car too...  You just plug it into your AUX plug and you have your music on your car speakers...  And when you get an incoming call it stops the music and rings the phone...  All you have to do is touch the center button and set the phone back down...  You hear the caller over your speakers and he hears you through your phone mic...  Again...  Very Happy...  You could be too...  Just wish it would not lock up from time to time...", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003E8ELIW"}}
