She absolutely loves it. She is very pleased with it. She loves the touch screen.  she wishes that it had a better variety of ringtones but this doesn't interfere with the function of the phone. The only down fall is it didn't come with a instruction booklet or an earpiece, because she like to talk and put the phone in her pocket so she doesn't have to hold it and this is why the earpiece would be very handy.

It is half decent for texting since it has a QWERTY keyboard, but the keys are very small so it takes caution to not embarrass myself.  The camera works well, but here's the beginning of the problem.  The phone is horribly difficult to figure out and use.  I am still trying to get pictures off the thing.  The touch screen response is terrible.  Often times it doesn't respond at all.  The screen layout must have been done while sleeping.  Who puts the scroll button 2 millimeters from the delete?  Someone once told me that some phones are better for texting, others for making calls.  That is definitely true for this phone.  Try to make a call with this thing in an emergency and you're dead for sure.  Too many hoops to jump through just to dial a number or worse yet respond to number prompts.  It has one nice texting feature in that it can group conversations together.  So if you're like me and have multiple texting conversations going at once or need to quickly review the history of a conversation you can do that well.  Over all however this phone is barely useable as a phone.I love my iPod Touch and would likely love the iPhone, but I guess you get what you pay for.

I bought it through Amazon for $80 with a $50 prepaid credit, so I guess I really got $30 worth of phone.Let's see - the positives: The device is attractive and easy to use, nice and small so it fits well in the pocket (watch out for key scratches on the screen!). The menu that drops down from the top of the main screen is very useful, it has a decent amount of ring tones, and surfs the web pretty well (though the fonts are typically too small).The negatives: The first phone I bought had issues from the get go. It would drop calls and go into a \"dead\" state after a while where incoming calls got my voice mail and outgoing calls would look like they were going through, but then the 5 network bars would drop to zero and the call would just sit there and not connect. Very frustrating, especially for my family trying to reach me. It seemed that this state was reached after one successful call, then while looking like it was still functional (looked on, 4-5 bars network, etc) it was just dead and I would finally find out it wasn't working when I tried to use it. Anyway, this is consistent with other reviews I have read since. So - I sent it to warranty (after dealing with very rude customer no-service personnel) and a replacement was sent. It has been working fine for around 10 months (and my opinion about the phone was changing) until early this week when the touch screen stopped working. Buttons still work but touch screen is dead, and it's been over a year since the original purchase, so I'm out of warranty. Fortunately for me, I'm out only $30, but the frustrations definitely weren't worth it.I would not recommend this phone for anyone, at all.I am putting this at the end of the review b/c I don't know if this is due to AT&T; or the phone, but there are entirely too many dead spots in the network and it just seems the network signal strength should have been better at certain times. Could be an insufficient antenna in the phone, or just bad AT&T; coverage.And, to try to balance that out for AT&T;, their 10 cents/minute prepaid plan is awesome, so I am staying with them.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a waist of money", "Author": "cranky", "ReviewID": "RA0QAJFINUN2Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone two weeks ago because I thought it a good phone, what a disapointment!

Yes it was EXTREMELY hard to figure out but once you do it is a nice little phone to have. Some people say it is hard to make a call but It is just like any other phone you dial a number and press call, The Voice call feature where you say the name or number and it calls the person works about half the time but if your in a quite place and talk clearly it usually works. I like that it has a micro SD slot so you can add pictures music and video(though the screen is way too small to watch a movie on). The internet on the phone is next to useless meaning that you can't watch videos on it. The touch screen texting really sucks. I have had the phone for such a long time and I still mess up texting.

Two of the phones were fried because silly me tried to use a 16gb micro sd card (as recommended by LG) and tried to sync music while the sd card was in the phone (as recommended, because music files have to be converted to AT&T;'s specifications) ..

Holds a charge for a long time and is simple to figure out.  This is actually my second order of this phone.  The first one lasted for years and had been through everything.  Canoeing, the bar scene, multiple states and more.  Meaning it's been dropped, gotten wet, the whole gamut and it lived to tell.  After 5 years the touch screen calibration started to fail and so I just ordered my 2nd one.  It's not huge like the phones are now but it's cute and doesn't look old school.  I prefer not being in a contract because I just can't justify $60 or more/month when I simply don't use it that much.  I pay $20 every month for texting and when I want more or any talk time I choose what to pay.  I'd recommend this phone for a teenager who isn't allowed in the family plan yet or someone like me who doesn't need web access via phone.
