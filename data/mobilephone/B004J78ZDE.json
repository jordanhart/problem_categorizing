Prushinski \"AZ Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R2GYYIZ2DDA9IN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I purchased the phone I thought I was purchasing a \"new\" phone.  When I received it, it looked like it had been opened and had been used.  I could tell because the plastic on everything was torn and retaped.  There wasn't any paper work with the phone.  The manual that came with it had NOTHING to do with the phone, it wasn't anywhere close.  I couldn't turn the phone on until I found the RIGHT manual on line.Could not get it activated because it had already been activated and the phone was useless.  I'm sorry I purchased from this seller.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not at all as good as my last phone", "Author": "Deanna Ocampo", "ReviewID": "RMMCYASH60OP6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone straight from verizonwireless. I thought that this phone would be better than my last smart phone. But after having it for a year I'm ready to get rid of it. Screen does not always recognize its being touched. Can't get it to answer when someone is calling. Or it will freeze for a minute and it won't do anything. Sometimes can't get games to load or they load but slowly. Not meant to have alot of games or apps downloaded on it, seems to slow the function of the phone down even more. Would not recommend at all to anyone. Spend a little more and get a better phone. Always liked Motorola in the past, not this phone, its a waste of money.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone.", "Author": "pamela", "ReviewID": "R2A6Y5J8RX60L6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone we have two and looking to buy a third.
