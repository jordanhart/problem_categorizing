{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My first Smart Phone - inexpensive and easy to use", "Author": "Timothy G. Holtz", "ReviewID": "R1DRMCKV0PYJWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone.  It\u2019s replacing my eight year old Motorola V195s, (which weighs a bit more than this phone, and is somewhat more clunky) as my primary phone, with the Motorola becoming my \u201cbackup phone\u201d.  The Motorola still works fine, but the battery charge now only holds a couple days.  I don\u2019t subscribe to wireless internet from my provider (PureTalk USA), so I\u2019m relying on wi-fi for internet connectivity.  I mostly wanted a smart phone for the convenience of having an FM Radio, MP3 player and phone in a single compact package.  However I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find plenty of use apps, and having a basic camera in the package doesn\u2019t hurt either.  I needed a phone with a Bluetooth connection, and I also wanted a four band \u201cworld phone\u201d.If you\u2019re interested in this product, you may as well download the manual NOW (Google \u201cS5360 manual site:samsung.com\u201d) as the manual doesn\u2019t come with the phone.  And, if you plan to use the camera or MP3 player, you\u2019ll need a micro SD card, so maybe order that when you order the phone.The box arrived with Spanish writing on it, so I wasn\u2019t terribly surprised to find that when I booted the phone, the prompts weren\u2019t in English.  Now, while there are both English and Spanish \u201cquick start\u201d guides provided with the product, the guide doesn\u2019t explain the initial screen that comes up when the product is first powered on.  So, I had to go online on my computer to and translate to verify that the button labeled \u201ccambia el idioma\u201d was the correct button to select to change to English - because if I selected the wrong button, god knows what would happen.I\u2019m pretty sure that the phone is unlocked.  I had no problem connecting to the AT&T; network that my provider uses.I had no trouble connecting to my home wi-fi, and I had no trouble connecting the Bluetooth to either my Garmin navigator or my Cell2Tel Bluetooth Gateway.  I also had no trouble accessing my Verizon email account.  The FM radio provides flawless reception \u2013 it\u2019s better than the one in my MP3 player, which I considered excellent.  The touch screen is easy to use.  There doesn\u2019t seem to be any built-in missed call or waiting voicemail reminder \u2013 it seems you need to install an app for that.  I installed a free app called Missed Call Reminder.  You can set it to give a periodic audio reminder.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Grrreatttttttt!!!!!!! liketony the tiger says,lol!!!!!", "Author": "Ingermar Nixon", "ReviewID": "R3430HRTGHEV5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a great phone for the price i paid,my friend saidhe loves his new samsung galaxy y, he says nnow no one laughs at him when he's on line,when he uses the wifi ability of the phone", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better for SMALL hands...", "Author": "B. Murray", "ReviewID": "R142GDEXLE6H8C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for something that was more modern than my flip phone and what the most of everyone else is using nowadays. Here's some observations; The phone is actually called a \"YOUTH\" - this is where the \"Y\" comes from, something I missed when purchasing. The phone seems to be geared more towards younger users with its size and lack of extra features. The camera is low resolution but does take \"ok\" pictures. Seeing as I am 6'3\" and 220 lbs, my fingers can't seem to hit just 1 letter at a time as they are soooo close together - a frustrating feature to say the least. The display is nice and it did come with several different case colors to change the phone from grey to orange, or black. Pink and white are also included. Overall I would say this would be good for a teenager but not an adult who relies heavily on their phone. I don't, so I will be keeping as I simply use it as just a phone and occasional text.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Michael Rojas Pereira", "ReviewID": "R2TH6N3OUUZH5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good price, brand new phone; includes charger, USB cable and headsets which is perfect; and performance is really good for the kind of phone.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "good smartphone", "Author": "Gil Lessard", "ReviewID": "RZ86JH3O1P4KI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone have  fm radiohave everything  I want and morecompact phonevery good soundvery satisfied at this time", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": ".Great product!!!!", "Author": "Junella F.

Which meant that a lot of the actions on the phone were not as efficient as they could be. A lot of limitations with the apps. I did the research and was looking for a simple smart phone that was not too big or too small. It was a little too small. The keyboard option was way too small for an adult hand. And, I don't have big hands. Thank goodness for the swype function, or I would never have typed anything on it. I would have given up texting completely.The camera works well, but the size is small on the upload. The FM radio feature was nice to have, I'll say that. This was certainly a plus.I found that the phone was small, sleek, and clunky to use in it's functionability. I was really unhappy with the phone overall. It was not an intuitive phone. I'd say it was a \"dumb\" smart phone. Not simple to use, although I think it was made to be. Probably a good phone for youth, but not a teenager. Hence the \"Y\" model.This phone is not compatible with the T-Mobile data network frequency. Do your homework ahead of time and know the frequency that your phone carrier uses.It did the job. But, I would not recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "JUAN CARLOS VILLARROEL", "ReviewID": "R33CBF8C8Z4UR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ha sido de mucha utilidad y era lo que esperaba de eses art\u00edculo. lo recomiendo mucho.
