Around 3 months after I got the phone it began pressing buttons on itself (never been dropped, wet, i just tolerated it as there was nothing I could really do then one day my screen goes all black and it is still like that to this day. If you turn it on, it lights up but nothing shows up on the display. Overall, the phone was a good-looking piece of hardware and I liked the slide-out QWERTY keyboard but i hated the unresponsive touchscreen and the durability. Google it, this phone runs into the same problems for many people, it's a shame as there was definitively some potential here. And now, for the new price of $160, it's not a terrible phone, but there are better options out there. I recently bought a Star Note i9220 N9000 (Samsung Galaxy Note clone) for $180 and its awesome.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awsome!!!", "Author": "Erick", "ReviewID": "R1R2GMWP1VNY0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cell phone is excellent, i know this does not have android, however symbiam works really good, i have no complain at all", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "refurbished celphone", "Author": "angry bird", "ReviewID": "R2Z70UWIELXTB1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "when I received the cellphone it was already open and there was an old screen protector on it.

I want to send it back but I do not have time because I need an unlocked cellphone going back to overseas on Tuesday. I have not used the phone yet, it is still recharging until now, I received the phone yesterday only, but the seller is completely dissapointing. I will settle this thing when I came back overseas...

In the first place I chose it because compared to similar phones like HTC Mozart or others it is really cheap. But I was wrong, the phone is really great.It's very robust (it fell down once already because of me) and the keyboard is assembled accurately, it does not seem like it would break soon. The battery lasts for two whole days with average use (80 messages per day/ 1 hour of talking) and I only  need to plug it in every other evening. The touchscreen does work great, although it is not as accurate as the iPhone's touchscreen.There are no free apps for this phone, but that does not bother me because I wouldn't download them anyways. But if you want a lot of apps, you chould check out Android phones.All in all I recommend this phone without restrictions.

Kelly", "ReviewID": "R2KMCTOJTTDSVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is generally very good, works fast, sound quality in music playback is good, Resistive touchscreen is good.It also comes with Flash installed, so it has that advantage over a lot of phones.The keyboard is solid, and a good feel, and generally I have very few complaints about the phone.I can sum it up in 4 complaints, in terms of severity.1. It occasionally decides to perform random things in my pocket (phoning people, opening programs, etc.)2. The media player doesn't like large files. So trying to watch a movie on it is difficult, unless you break the movie down into smaller files.3. If you have too many programs open at once, the phone's performance degrades shockingly. I'm surprised there isn't actually a stack overflow exception after a while.4. The phone doesn't get much support. SE are focusing more on their Xperia range of phones, so don't expect a lot of firmware updates, etc.However, apart from these the phone is really simple to use, even if you aren't tech-savvy in any way. Everything is clearly laid out, and I would definitely recommend this phone for general use. Then again, I dislike iPhones due to their immense cost, so maybe my opinion isn't the best.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ok phone.....", "Author": "Luis Suarez", "ReviewID": "R2WE2B2ESGRZI7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The reason for my three stars is simple. Phone a bit too small for a touchscreen phone. Also, even though it run the Symbian OS(same as the nokia N8 and C7) the touchscreen it TFT not capacitive, so you have to really press with your finger or use your nail. Also, the keyboard felt a little looose on the keys. If you are planning to buy this phone, please do some research on other phones or look up its review on youtube. I ended up gettign the nokia n8, but thats just cuz im a nokia fan. Hope this was helpful.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "lik it", "Author": "J.
