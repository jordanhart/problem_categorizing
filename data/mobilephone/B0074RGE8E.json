The phone I received was NOT a Verizon phone.  I am very disappointed.  I called Verizon to attempt to activate it and could not ... no SIM card.  I was advised to take it to a corporate store for assistance.  I did.  They sales person and manager tried to assist me.  They determined the phone would not work because it was not a Verizon phone.  Then, just in case they were not being truthful to me, I called Apple and gave them the numbers on the phone and they told me it was NOT a Verizon phone.Although I didn't get what I wanted, I did get my money back.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product!", "Author": "Salvador Medrano", "ReviewID": "RGAGA4LJWRHMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is exactly what I wanted!  This phone is exactly what was advertised.  No frills ordering from amazon warehouse.  I activated through Verizon tech support via alternate phone line.  I was able to keep my 4gb data plan and activate this new phone without disruption of current contract.  Warning: Don't waste your time getting this activated in person at the Verizon store... That was a mistake.  They told me that in order to switch phones, I would lose my 4gb for $30 promo that I've had for a while on my phone line.  After the frustrating in-person conversation at the Verizon store employees, I returned home and called directly to customer service and they switched the phone without question and didn't hassle or worry me with false information.  Please call tech support and save yourself a headache.As for the product, it works flawless!

I went through 10 warranty replacement HTC phones until I received a marginally functioning HTC Rhyme. It stopped functioning after I dropped it in a pool. Ooops! Being 10 months in to a 2-year contract, I needed to purchase the phone outright. I have been carryong around 2 phones - one for calls, and the iPhone with no service for the apps.Siri is hysterical and tad bit stalker-creepy. When I asked her if she understood sarcasm, she promptly gave me directions to Albuquerque.iTunes has many quality apps. While their selection is considerably more limited than Android's appstore, what good really is a ton of crappy apps? iTunes has had all of the video games, apps and music that I have searched for. If I start feeling nostalgic for a crap app, I still have my Kindle Fire..The only negatives for this phone, in my eyes, is the poor battery life. It does charge fairly quick, so I just make sure I carry around a charger with me at all times.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't trust phones online", "Author": "Shannon McClure", "ReviewID": "R1QQZAX0V9CHOP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone was in perfect shape no scratches or damage is was delivered on time my only problem is the battery life .

It works great and is easy to use however the one problem both my husband and myself have had with this phone is the power button.  After months of use, the power button on both of our phones has quit working all of the time.  It did finally quit working altogether on my husband's phone and he had to have it replaced by Apple.  I have had my phone for about 8 months and the power button has started giving me problems on mine.  I am not sure if this is a common problem known to iphones but it has happend to both of ours now.  I do prefer the interface on the apple when compared to droid though.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone, thank you.", "Author": "Dianna W Black", "ReviewID": "R38A9PFEIJSRSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was refurbished by Asurion, though, rather than \"NEW\" as listed.

I recieved my Phone in a timely fashion, and it worked for about a month or so. It started rejecting chargers and then not charging at all. I took it to apple and they said it will be a $200 fix. I decided to take it to one of the fix it shops, and was SHOCKED at what i found out. I paid for a 4s but the packing was of a 4. The phone had been previously opened and fixed. There was previous water damage and most of the inside parts had been switched out. I was sold a phone that had been broken before???? AND then i was told there is no refund after 30 days??? I spent over $400 for a piece of crap that wont even stay on anymore. NEVER will i EVER buy a phone off of amazon anymore nor from this seller in specifics. I wish i would have known this before i got the phone or atleast in the first 30days.
