Schmitz \"schmi1\"", "ReviewID": "R1FQMLOR82WV5Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Droid 2 is a fantastic phone when it isn't mal-functioning, which is often.  I received one two years ago with a Verizon contract.  Since then, it has been replaced 4 times.  My son has one.  It has been replaced 3 times.  Friends that have one tell me of the same problems.  Automatically reboots, or locks up, or rotates pages all on its own, or starts up on its own (not a great feature on an airplane), or dials phone numbers on its own, the list goes on and on.  At first Verizon claimed that it was a battery problem, then new firmware, then they began replacing units, but each one has problems.  I believe that it is a heat and/or humidity sensitivity.  If you keep the phone in your pocket, this is not the phone for you.  Place it in a cool dry room, it works great.  When it works, it is wonderful.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "first time customer dissatisfied", "Author": "james tignor", "ReviewID": "R29XYSE2U5YQ0E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One of the phones i purchased is not working.

My only real complaint is that once in a while it likes to reboot it's self, but that could be do to rooting it and the custom rom.

My previous phone (which is a note 3) cease to function and I decided to buy a Droid 2 Global due to the physical keyboard. I've got to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with this phone for the price I paid. This phone supports both GSM/CDMA bandwidths so it's an ideal choice for someone if you're on a wireless carrier, but Verizon blocked GSM carriers. With a little bit of tweaking, you can get the Droid 2 Global to work on a US carrier, it requires an unlock code and radio band mod. As in regards to software wise, the phone can't compete with current phones due to specifications, but if you're a light smartphone user, this issue won't plague you. The only complaint I have is the battery life, the droid 2 global is notorious for having abysmal battery life. But I can't complain due to the price I purchased the Droid 2 Global. Overall, this phone is an aged device, but it's a excellent choice if you're browsing for a cheap phone.P.S. The seller Chubbie's Tech should be well praised, my package came to my house one day before the estimated shipping date by Amazon. The description on the condition of the phone was also completely accurate, like new condition. They also did an excellent job of packaging. Thanks again, Chubbie's Tech, you made my day.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "laura dalton", "ReviewID": "RSJO43763A6KE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a couple problems with device then battery, everything was fixed.

I was unable to activate this phone on my Verizon account, Verizon explained that they use to authorize use of this model, but that they no longer do.However after trying to activate it from the phone itself, it did work, a very frustrating day, I don't believe that this is reflective of the device itself, mainly Verizon customer service and how confusing and difficult they are being. So far the device seems ok, not the best not the worst. The screen is temperamental and shuts down quick during a call when not being touched. This is a problem if you are trying to use an automated service and need the touch dial keys to key in your entries.Easy to navigate.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "This phone is pretty decent...", "Author": "Anthony Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R28IAHDT4E3ZMW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I loved the phone. It's good for an average person. It's also good for gaming and browsing the web. The only thing that I don't like about the phone is that if the memory is more that 50% full, the phone starts to slow down and lags. But, if that happens, the phone has expandable storage! That means that you can go to a store, buy a Micro SD Card, and put it in the phone to add memory!", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't get it !", "Author": "Brianna Holley", "ReviewID": "R2NFBMOQAHYX7O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone sucked !
