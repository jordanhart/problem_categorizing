But I always ordered another one, so this is the best one I've had so far, I like this cause its a small smart phone, and this one actually has WiFi, Video Recorder and a slot for memory card so I use it to listen to a lot of music as I work out to keep stress away and dont break this one too! :)  So its quite multifunctional and you can still use WiFi without an active SIM card, and plus it's unlocked.So yeah I recommend it, cause I just like this blackberry, the color white is very stylish, and soft to the touch, great fit in your hands, its not wide and big like the curve or iphone, and well I just love 'em!", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
