{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simply a beauty", "Author": "s", "ReviewID": "R3NOGXQ7W1C8SP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Xperia P is one of the very few elegantly designed phones in the market. The best I like is the design including its aluminum unibody, which distinguishes itself from plastic bodies of the vast majority of cell phones, including Sony Xperia S. The transperent bar across the lower part is particularly interesting. Just don't know why Sony abandoned this really good looking thing in its Ion (which looks boring and too big). 4\" screen (960x540) of this phone is simply the best (who really use 720p in cell phone?). The three touch buttons in the transparent bar are very responsive, as contrast to those in Sony Ion. Although I don't care others like Android 2.3 (updating soon, but why?), less fast CPU, no-microSD, fixed battery, etc, it runs perfectly smoothy and responsive. Preinstalled gallery/wall paper are of super quality. Stronly recommend.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good and bad", "Author": "Derek Yien \"Mr. D\"", "ReviewID": "R3BDATFNC31QHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is as excepted after my hours of researching. This phone shipped with a much unexpected foreign wall charger. Not good. Included headphones and USB cable. But now I have to order a new charger.EDIT:There was a adapter for the foreign charger in the packaging. I didn't find it until 12 hours later. I change the star rating from 3 to 5 now. No complaints.Edit again:Someone stole my Xperia P. I now have a iPhone 4s. I would rather have my Xperia P back. The screen on the Xperia is superior to the iPhone 4s. Also, I like the different design of Xperia P, iPhone is common and boring.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!!", "Author": "Rodson desauguste", "ReviewID": "R26L2IMV44T57P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great product.
