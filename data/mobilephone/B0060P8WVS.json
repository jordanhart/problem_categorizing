It functions nicely and I love the full html browser. The features are very nice as well, including the 3MP camera which even zooms in and out. The only downside is using the stylus BUT it just makes you more aware of spelling and grammer as you text. I'd recommend this phone because its great and I love mine.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Huawei M735", "Author": "Lizzy83", "ReviewID": "R8S7O5R6I1DGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the Phone!One thing Why don't you guys List the Color..I don't think all Females Like Blue.I thought it was Silver or like a Chrome Color Just add the Color to the Description of the Phone Please.Other then that Phone Works Excellent!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cannot activate was reported as stolen!", "Author": "Sally M.", "ReviewID": "R1BNF4HVK8458J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is useless, I cannot activate ite it or use it in any way.

Used mostly for business.  I have dropped this phone off the roofs of houses I worked on, dropped it on a concrete driveway and watched it slide down the hill face down, run over the corner of it, dropped it in a mud puddle and in various water puddles and it still works fine. I've even tossed it when it froze up one day while I was having to send multiple texts and saw it bounce off a concrete splash block but in putting it back together, it still works.  You can hardly tell its been through all that wear and tear except for a few dimples in the case.I like all the easily accessible features - calender, email, vmail, SMS, MMS for getting my work done.  Simple to use.  Now that its getting older you have to use the stylus more often.  The camera stinks although its good enough for my work - I have to take several shots and then pick from a photo editor.  It freezes every once in a while but reboots quickly.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disapointed", "Author": "Ruth", "ReviewID": "R22GXCVY56FPXX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this phone is okay but can be cumbersome to use. It also has no apps that are free. You have to pay for everything even the simple games that come along with every other phone I have had before even the cheap ones. I'm actually pretty disappointed with it. I overpaid for it and found out that I could have gotten the android of this brand for a lot cheaper and it is a better phone.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "cesar", "ReviewID": "R1Y3WOU07WYYWT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i but this phone  on civer Monday 5 days later they didn't send yet the phone what happen with this people", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for kids.", "Author": "Mandy K", "ReviewID": "R1NOFVWMXYTYS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "User friendly.

I am pleased to say that I do not regret this. occasionally when texting its easy to accidentally hit the key below that which I was aiming for because the touch screen key board is not the largest. At the same time it works, the internet is faster than that which I was using before.
