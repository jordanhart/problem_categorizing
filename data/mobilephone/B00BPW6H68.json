{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price and capability, why not go Force?", "Author": "A. Ghilardi", "ReviewID": "R1IL7Z5DZ8C99N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using Boost mobile for over a year now and I wanted to get a new 4G capable phone. Went to Target, Best Buy and other places to find the HTC but they were out. At Target, there was one ZTE Force left and the saleswoman tried to steer me away from this phone. After her getting on her own phone and checking out details about this phone, she quickly realized this phone was bang for your buck. If you don't want to spend a ton of money on a phone and on a plan, this phone is actually quite nice. The saleslady also told me that I will need a larger SD card than I already had. I am currently using my old one and it is still working perfectly. I have downloaded tons of apps and games and still lots of space. The camera takes great photos outside but inside - not the best. Overall, this is much faster and better than a 3G-only phone and I am satisfied with it. So far, no real glitches (when there is an incoming email and I am already doing something on the browser, sometimes the screen will freeze but I just have to go back Home and reopen the app)and no real complaints. The battery lasts a long time - no need to charge again in the day. If you want to get a 4G phone but don't want to shell out the money for a larger brand, this one will definitely do.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 4G Phone So Far", "Author": "A.

Figured If I'm upgrading, I'd try to get a 4g phone. This phone was very good price on Amazon, plus I had some Amazon credit, so an even better deal.I'll just say WOW!. Moving from an Android 2.3 phone to this is a night and day difference. Nice screen, decent cameras for a phone. Still learning some of the features of this phone. Very loud volume, easy to hear, even on speakerphone. Can have multiple browser windows open and doesn't bog down. Really nice when I am in a 4G area. So far, GREAT! Very good battery life.I was already a Boost customer, and due to on time payment s for 18 months, had my payment down to $35 a month for unlimited everything, from the starting point of $50 a month. I asked before switching what would happen to my rate, since the unlimited plans now start at $55. They said I would not restart at the $55, I was only moved to the $40 level, the lowest under their new set up.My only complaint so far, I wish the charging jack was on the bottom of the phone and not the side.

Battery life not bad either. Camera ok at best. takes clear pics at regular settings but the zoom on this is a waste as pictures are terrible. Same for front facing camera. I was lured into this phone because it had 4g. It was cheaper then some other models that only had 3g at the time. The speaker sounds tinny with some pops and hiss at max volume. Otherwise speaker works for conversation and watching stuff from crackle, listening to Pandora, Youtube, etc. The download speed isnt bad when using 4g or wi-fi. The main problem with this phone is the microphone. People are constantly having trouble hearing me and I have a pretty loud voice and I speak clearly. I have to repeat myself constantly and find myself getting the most frustrated over this issue. If you plan to use this phone nearly exclusively with a bluetooth headset or car link/home link and you can find this phone cheap then I think you'll be happy.

The first one I bought was the ZTE Warp Sequent and it was a great phone the best I have ever owned. I had my Sequent for two years and it only died because I accidentally dropped it in a parking lot. I bought this phone because the previous ZTE was so great and I am sure this one will be great too. I went from a Samsung Galaxy SII to this phone because the ZTE is way way better. Every Samsung phone I have owned has been a big mistake purchasing it and I am so glad their is another company to choose from now. My Galaxy SII crashed all the time, was very slow, and had a horrible screen response when using it. It was so frustrating it was not worth 5 dollars in my opinion. That is the last Samsung I will ever own. I have owned about 8 or 9 Samsung phones and they are great for the first week after you buy them and then they all the sudden get slow, the screen does not respond right, and they just cause a major headache. The ZTE does not give me 1/4 the hassle I have had from the Samsung phones. The only thing that I will say about the ZTE Force is when listening to music they could have put just a little bit louder amplifier in it; however, I will not complain because I probably should not be listening to music that loud anywhere. ZTE you have a life long customer with me.

The phone's browser would not allow more than one letter to be typed in so that I could only search on \"g\" verses Green Lantern for example.  Sending text is very slow for some reason.  Another problem is that the phone only shows up on my Mac laptop as a software install disk.  So it cannot be backedup and sync'd.  ZTE tech support is less than abysmal!  I went thru 3 \"techs\" all of whom knew nothing, and one of whom said she could not help me because I COULD NOT TELL HER THE PROBLEM!  Unbelievable.  I told her over and over.  The phone does not show up on my Mac.  Yes, I did install the Mac Software several times.  Boost tech support was slightly more helpful once I was able to wade thru their labyrinthine voice menu, designed to keep customers far away from a live person.  In the end, I sent the phone back and ordered a Samsung Epic II.  I'm hoping for better tech support from the more massive company.
