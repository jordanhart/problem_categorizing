I cant say it any other way. It literally dies every 4 hours and whats the point of having a phone if you cant even use it? You might as well implant a usb port into your arm because you will be taking the recharge chord EVERY WHERE. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I loved the double keyboard and screen is big. But thats where it ends. This phone is just plain useless, I would make 4 (5min) calls when I had this phone with perhaps 7 min of surfing and it still would die on me in less than 6 hours. I regret spending so much money on this piece of garbage phone. Not to mention the 4G on Metropcs is non existent 94% of the time.I was with metro for 6 years and Im glad I moved to boost mobile. Not only was there internet faster and more reliable, I stuck with the tried and true blackberry and cant be any happier. Its a curve so it doesnt have touch screen, but if I had to sacrifice communication for 3 hrs of touch screen then CLEARLY its not worth it.

I have had this phone for two months. Now, it's likely I have a faulty phone when it comes to my data connection issues, but there are numerous other problems as well and I have very little good to say about this phone.First, my data problems. I live in a maximum coverage location yet I only ever have 2 out of 4 bars on my call signal, and my data signal jumps around between 1x, 3g and 4g every 20 seconds or so, often with long breaks of no signal inbetween. I often have to restart my phone and/or pull the battery out to get my signal back. Toggling airplane mode sometimes helps. Even when I have 4g signal displayed, pages load slowww even on my Opera Mini browser. I have made numerous calls to MetroPCS and have had several things attempted, including a magical and mysterious \"trouble ticket\" issued, which was \"resolved\" without helping the problem and I am unable to get details on what, if anything was done. finally they are telling me to go to a Metro corporate store, and the only one in my area doesn't have an accessible phone number and is not even listed as a metropcs store at the address on google maps. Shady.other than that, the battery life is horrendous. i am charging my phone 2-3 times a day because it dies every couple of hours with light to moderate use and it seems it takes longer for the battery to charge than it does for it to drain.the keyboard keys are flush, so typing isn't very comfortable or easy because you can't really feel the buttons.as of this review, metropcs charges a minimum of $50/month plan for android phones although they advertise for $40/month, which apparently does not apply to their smartphones.the only good thing about this phone is the call quality, which is probably the best ive heard in the couple of phones ive owned. the camera is okay as well, a 3.2 megapixel which seems to be standard on smartphones.to sum it all up, i am leaving the ugly memory of metropcs behind, and getting an LG Optimus Slider on virgin mobile, whose 3g in my experience is faster and more reliable than metro's 4g and it also doesnt drain battery as quickly.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "$199 at Metropcs..", "Author": "Andree", "ReviewID": "RDW63M68YWVGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is cheaper on Metropcs and you will be getting a brand new phone.

I agree with all of the other users about the battery life, but that's an issue with most smartphones that I can overlook with a battery app or extended battery. The main issues I had with this phone are issues you cannot solve without just buying another phone.1. GPS. Or should I say...no GPS. Ever. The times I did get GPS, my location was incorrect by at least 500 feet. I never could get turn by turn navigation. I always had to just type the from and to addresses into Maps because it would never be worth the wait for it to find my location...my location being \"temporarily unavailable\" pretty much always.2. Signal. I also live in a big city with supposedly great coverage (according to Metro's coverage map). It would say I had full bars and then act like I had none...going on the Internet, the Market, even using simple Internet-based apps like Daily Horoscope... I could only manage to access these things about 30% of the time. Because of the horrible signal.3. Signal cont... I have a friend that lives in one of the \"text/data-only\" zones on Metro's coverage map. This was a main reason I switched to Metro from T-Mobile. I thought I would have at least one bar and/or texting ability when I went to visit her. Incorrect. Absolutely no data in a supposedly data-supported area. I'm switching carriers again (a Verizon phone through Straight Talk) because Metro is just not worth it.4. The touchscreen. It worked fine for about the first month or two. Then it started acting weird, not responding to my touch. Not showing the call screen as a call was coming in and forcing me to miss multiple calls as I swiped and swiped the screen with no response from it. Every other time I use it, I have to touch the same spot on the screen about 3 times before it recognizes that I'm telling it do something.I thought I could fix these things by factory resetting it. No good. I thought about calling in the warranty but after reading online about a lot of similar issues other customers have had...I seriously think this is just a poorly designed smart phone and that's why cheap MetroPCS could afford to sell it. Switch carriers.

It looks nice but functionality is poor. The complaints about the horrible battery life are true, although this is a problem with android phones in general its much worse with this phone than it is with others I have used. The phone can also be slow to respond at times, Sometimes you'll be touching the buttons on the touch screen repeatedly and nothing happens. At other times it will just freeze up completely and you have to reboot it to get it to start working again. This happens far too often, and since other people have experienced it then it must be a design flaw. The thing I dislike most about it though is the horrible service reception. Some of this I'm sure has to do with MetroPCS...lots of dropped calls, and lots of connectivity issues when you're trying to use the GPS and internet...very annoying.

I had the LG Esteem but it was out of stock and they offered me this one so I said sure. That was around late September/early October. The back of this phone is super sensitive, I dropped it on carpet a couple times when I got it and it got a huge dent. The Camera's OK, No zoom option. A lot of the time I press the home button from whatever app I'm using and it lags then when it gets there it doesn't show the apps right away and you press the Applications icon and none of the apps are being shown just the loading icon. Often if it dies or you just turn it off and you try to turn it back on it will stay on the Samsung Logo for a really long time. I've had to take the battery out and retry 5-8 times until it eventually Reboots. Also it will often show the 4G icon, showing that it had 4G Data and when you try to use the internet it will just tell you you have no data connection. When I try to make a call, it'll often just not do anything. You press the Call button once or twice and it won't do anything, 2-3 minutes later it will make the call.

At the time I was with Verizon paying way too much monthly for my bill. I had a monthly bill of $80 without any internet and whatnot. I ended up buying this \"sweet deal\" because I thought 4g for $60 flat rate a month. So I bought this phone mainly because I was in awe of the touchscreen, keyboard, and many applications that Android offers on this phone. This phone has a couple of drawbacks when you get past the glitz and glamour of a 4g phone.The main drawback to this phone is the battery life. This is my main complaint and has frustrated me beyond belief. When you buy this phone just make sure you have 3 different chargers, one for your house, one for your car, and one for your workplace because this phone will NOT last a normal 8 hour workday. I cannot believe how short this battery life is. I tried now downloading a app that was supposed to help save energy. This program was supposed to adjust the screen brightness, the 4g, and the all the other options that take battery juice. This program does not work; I still have to plug my phone in every 5 hours depending on usage. This is the main drawback of the phone, soif you're buying this just know this is what you will get.The other drawback is what you pay for the phone with Metro PCS. You will think you're getting the best phone from Metro but in fact after paying the big chunk of change for the phone, you will want this to be protected. After having this phone for a year I was paying $5 a month for insurance, and now I am wondering what I paid for. I finally cracked my screen after dropping it a hundred times and was bitter to find out what I was paying for. For this model the deductible for this phone is $129 just to get a new one. This is on top of the $5 a month to get that deductible deal which I think is a joke. I know this is how Metro works so just know that if you break the phone, you will plan on spending half of what you paid to get it.Overall this phone has treated me well with internet and 4g usage, but beyond the fact the battery will not last you more the 5 hours this phone is frustrating. It's hard to be happy about a phone with great features when you cannot use it because the battery is always dead.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "crappy phone", "Author": "caitlyn", "ReviewID": "R274IRJGH6PPUS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "so i had this phone for at least a year. and i hate it. it always FREEZES plus it dies really fast. the 4G is what kills it the most.
