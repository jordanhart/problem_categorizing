When it arrived I put my sim card in and wanted to start setting it up only to find out it was defective. The language was not English, even tough it was set to EnglishIt typed on its own double letters instead of single once .It must have been set by some foreign factory and it was not changeableI was seriously aggravated that seller  ABE 123could send such a device as I needed to take the phone on my trip.As I went on a business trip the next day and needed to return the device before I left , I called Amazon and told them I contacted the seller for the return and he hadn't answer yet and I needed to send it back immediately. Amazon  customer service gave me the whole thing about having to wait for the seller to answer about the return, it could take several days so I had to ask for  a supervisor  who said I could send it back nowI wasted certainly enough time on the phone aggravated as the initial customer service person was not helpfulSeller ABE 123 was professional enough to refund the entire device however it took 3 weeks. At least he stood by its products it send to customers", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "best seller ever on AMAZON", "Author": "Bobby Esco \"BE\"", "ReviewID": "R3R90T1CNZDTYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS:1. best seller ever come across on amazon2. fast email response and quick shipping3. phone worked right out of the box thanks to seller4. came with original package plus a screen protector5. phone is very fast compared to my old bold 97006. love the new design of the blackberry chargerCONS:1. still has battery problems even though this is a usual blackberry and smartphone problem2. should have bought this phone a long time ago when i had the chance3. would have loved it in white (wink)", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stay away", "Author": "Kevin Koski", "ReviewID": "R1GZRM1DMGT06L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worked fine for six months then did not turn on.
