I absolutely love it.  It is a basic phone with basic features that I use in my every day life.  The fact that there is no contract is wonderful and they have a variety of plans to suit your phone usage.  I like the fact that this is a larger phone and has larger numbers.  This is a superb product in my estimation.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "a simple phone for seniors", "Author": "Robert P. Dorais \"TuneHistory\"", "ReviewID": "R2V3GY8EE4W91O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this for my Mom, who is 75.  She had trouble with the regular cell phones.  They were too complicated.  For $15 per month, she now has a \"phone\" with a dial tone and an operator.  She gets 50 minutes per month, which is plenty, and they send her a bill each month, which pleases my Dad, who still likes to write checks to pay for things!If you want a cheap phone with more minutes, and texting, this is not the phone for you.  Get a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go phone instead.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simplicity/Bliss", "Author": "G. Wells", "ReviewID": "R1ZMFEPWA03NNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a techie in my 30s and after many years of uber-fancy cellphones I found myself wanting to simplify when it came to my phone.This thing is fantastic and frustration-free. All it does is phone calls and text messages, and unlike other phones, there's no learning curve, there's no hassles or confusion. It just works.My giant hands and fingers love it's size and curve and the huge dime-sized buttons.The interface is pretty basic -- you have to scroll through each individual contact, and everything is a binary YES/NO system (there's never, say, three options -- it's always YES or NO -- which mean an extra button click sometimes).So you'll need to strip down your hundreds of contacts to a top 10 or top 20 to make finding names quick, but that was OK for me.It's also slightly more expensive than my former T-Mobile Pay-As-You-Go plan ($100 every three or four months, versus $29/mo + $7 in taxes and fees for Jitterbug's Verizon service).But the simplicity and ease-of-use is absolutely worth it.If you have any questions, ask; they'll be emailed to me via amazon, and i'll try to answer promptly (i live on the computer pretty much).", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK phone, hard to cancel", "Author": "NoraEliza", "ReviewID": "R3KX1LTSP3SAGO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone for my 96 year old, hard-of-hearing father and it seemed OK, although he hardly every used it. Jitterbug advertises convenient, friendly service especially for seniors, but this is not true. When he decided he no longer wanted it, I tried to cancel effective at the end of the month that he had already paid for. I was told this was not possible - I had to call back on the day I wanted to cancel. When I did this, the representative said only he, not I, could cancel (even though I originally placed the order using my name and address and then later told them he is the owner). I live in another town so it is going to take a 3rd call when I next visit to cancel.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "JITTERBUG J CELLPHONE", "Author": "Warren E.

The cell phone has always been in my purse or on the dresser in my bedroom and I keep it on and charged at all times.  This morning when I looked at the phone to check for voice mail messages, I received a \"critical battery\" message.  The phone had beens fully charged but it was suddenly as dead as a door nail.  I called Jitterbug Customer Service immediately to discuss the problem,I was told there was moisture in the phone and  to go through a procedure of turning the phone off, removing the battery and letting it \"dry\" out.  When I told the service rep that the phone had never been anywhere to collect moisture, she told me if the procedure she recommended did not solve the problem I would have to send the phone in to their tech service department.I have also had problems with the calendar and phone book applications.Jitterbug could be a useful tool for older people if all the problems were ironed out and if the Customer Service people were more knowledgeable about the product.In the meantime, I would not recommend this product.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful phone", "Author": "Judith Fogie \"quilling judie\"", "ReviewID": "R1U4Z1NG5YZYCB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The only problem is that Great Call will not activate this model any longer, and I want a second phone!

It says \"911 Access Free\"  but ALL CELL PHONES have to provide this by law.  It says \"Long Distance Call no additional charge\" but this is true of ALL cell phones.  From other reviews, I gather that even the \"nationwide coverage\" isn't true.  All phones with voice dial don't charge for it....please, the only thing this phone has going for it is big numbers and operator assistance (see other reviews for this issue).
