I got this iPhone and it is 10x better than my 4S.  Not only that, but the person who sold this to me was EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL. I was so happy for his service that I promised myself I would write him a review because it was well deserved.  I plan on taking this phone to another company (not sprint), and this phone will set me free.  AppleTech Trader was quick, efficient, professional and I would definitely recommend working with them.

I checked the phones and saw that, as I thought, data roaming was not turned on. I called Sprint and was told that although data roaming on iPhones may be turned off, it still uses data roaming and that you have to turn ALL roaming off. Seriously?! We live in the woods and I need my phone. The problem isn't with too much voice roaming, just data, but I can't use voice, either?! Nonsense! This is a problem between Sprint and Apple, not me. Sprint sold me the phones, Sprint sold the plan at this address, and now Sprint is mad because we're using the phones.Screw them, they can go ahead and drop me, I'll go to one of their competitors who are doing a better job than they are, in terms of coverage, anyway.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Carl Lands", "ReviewID": "R16DYL4FO1NDZK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off the phone was is worse condition than described.

Phone arrived quickly, in perfect new condition, and with all promised accessories. The qualification, and the reason the overall experience was 4/5, is that there was no SIM card. Buying an after market Sprint SIM card proved extremely difficult. Apple, Best Buy, Radio Shack, Sprint retail store, and Sprint repair shop all said that they only have Sprint SIMs available for repairs, not for direct sale. When I finally found somewhere that sold one, 2 of the 3 staff thought they didn't sell it (they too thought it was just for repairs) so I got quite a runaround.

But the accessories it came with, not so much. The charger cord wouldn't charge my phone and kept giving me error messages when I would plug it into my computer. I had to go purchase a new one at the Apple store. I guess with the new ios7 update on the iphone 5, this has been happening to a few people who have non-certified Apple products.
