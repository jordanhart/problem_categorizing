WiFi, GPS, Mobile Data, Bluetooth, Camera, Sync and FM Radio all work fine.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "The charger was damage", "Author": "Jaime Acosta", "ReviewID": "RFKJ09NTEKFQL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Buy two phones, one of them had the charger damaged, hence all good, arrived on time ..
