{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice! Great choice for international travel.", "Author": "oldtechdude", "ReviewID": "R3FY94B8L5JQM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 was a GREAT choice and I am very happy with it.I needed a Dual SIM Phone for my daughter while she is traveling across multiple continents, so I can stay in contact with her, and she can use a local pre-paid SIM card.  I only had the phone a few days before sending it out again, so this review is limited to that.  She had a GT-S7562 and was happy with it until it was stolen out of her hand in India (Travelers Beware!)Helpful info:Came with Android 4.2, the phone updated to 4.2.2 as soon as I connected it to the internet.This phone has slots for two of the larger SIM cards \u2013 not the mini-SIM.My US carrier's SIM card (AT&T;) plugged in and worked fine for both Voice and Data.  Phone calls and voice quality worked fine.  I did not test the data speed on AT&T; but it seemed fine.  Google Maps worked great using GPS and AT&T; data.This is the same size as the Galaxy Mini phones \u2013 it just has dual SIM slots.This phone came in a small, factory sealed, Samsung box with: the Phone, plastic back, battery (1500mAh), USB-A to Mini-USB cable (18 inch?), \u201cIn ear\u201d style earphones with microphone, and an EU plug wall charger.Pros:Unlocked from Samsung, designed for international use \u2013 so it should work with most any WMA/SIM carrier in the world.Great size for travel.  Big enough for the Android experience - slightly larger screen than an iPhone but not nearly the size of the more expensive 5 inch phones.Great screen, very easy to read and worked well even in sunlight.Phone worked great. Very responsive. First power up screen asked for the language with a LOT of choices.  WiFi connected first time. AT&T; SIM card worked first time.Price \u2013 paid 158USD with free overnight shipping from Prime.Cons:Battery life - Though I did not get much of a chance to test this phone, all Android phones (smart phones in general??) seem to lose their charge in less than a day.  Plan for it.Only 4GB internal Flash.Minor: Wall Charger is an EU Plug. But I have many US Chargers and it is an international phone...I suggest ordering/having the following for this phone:1) Case \u2013 I got the 7USD Amzer AMZ95155 TPU case and it works fine for basic protection.2) Micro-SD card \u2013 the phone had over 1.5GB available, but for travel (taking pictures, storing music/video) I got the SanDisk SDSDQU-016G-AFFP-A 16GB Micro-SD card for 13USD.3) Additional Battery or portable USB charger.4) International AC Adapter, or Micro-USB power source for charging.Over all I highly recommend this phone and I would buy another one if needed.One last note: This order was fulfilled by Amazon Prime and the seller was \u201caSavings\u201d \u2013 Kudos to Amazon and aSavings for a perfect transaction.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love my cellphone", "Author": "Kelly Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R26PSGOYF586HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this cellphone to people who likes advanced technology devices.I enjoy each of the apps that it has predownloaded and I was able to dowload other apps which I really like to customize my phone.It is the best phone I have ever had; and the price was very nice.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "shipped and received... using currently", "Author": "kirsten", "ReviewID": "R2ZD44RG2H4XSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone for the cost, have been using it for about a month and no problems so far.

There have been some downsides, however, starting with not being able to download Samsung's Smart Switch app from the Play store in order to transfer all my device contents from my old Samsung Galaxy SII to this device. It's not even listed as a viable app for the phone  (is it not recognized as a Galaxy?).  This is very annoying. Secondly, there are no accessories available for this phone on the internet or in U.S. stores, so I was unable to find a case or screen protectors before leaving the country, nor was I able to use any of my existing Galaxy cases due to the big difference in size. Finally, I had problems when I put in the second SIM card when out of the U.S. and found I could not rely on the local Samsung authorized dealer to assist with the problem. In the U.S., my experience has been that such stores are staffed by tech savvy individuals who have been trained on each of the phones they're selling, but this was not my experience outside of the country even though the phone IS sold in the country where I sought support. I didn't have a working phone and no internet connectivity, so I could not call tech support, and was therefore left to my own devices to figure out the issue. I finally got the reluctant SIM card provider to give me another card to try although they also thought it was the phone's hardware. This resolved the issue, thankfully, but it was a very rocky start to using my new phone.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good phone,very fast shipping.", "Author": "MAX", "ReviewID": "R2VMPGPZUA6SCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son and he likes it,graphics is good ,we will recommend this to anyone trying to buy this phone.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Sonia Baute", "ReviewID": "REJ304DR40ART", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its Good and Awesome SmartPhone...
