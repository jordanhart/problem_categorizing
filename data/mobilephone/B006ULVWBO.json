It is simple to use and the keyboard responds to fast typing.  It has all the features you need and internet access is no problem.  The navigation feature saved me from being horribly lost on an unlit road out of state.The camera is less than perfect and, without a micro card, the memory is a bit limited.  I still have pictures I cherish in it anyway.  Simple to upload data to my computer.Games, texting, calling, navigation, sturdy and easy to use.  Hey, \"if it ain't broke....\" keep the phone you like.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great deal", "Author": "Lacy Swartzfager", "ReviewID": "R3PBUNP06A9LJ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone after mine died before I could upgrade and I love it its simple and easy to use not alot of bells and whistles but its a great phone for the price and if your a texter you will love this phone", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006ULVWBO"}}
