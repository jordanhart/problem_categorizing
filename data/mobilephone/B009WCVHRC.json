I needed to replace my old LG flip phone from Tracfone purchased several years ago due to battery issues. I wanted a smart phone and this seemed to fit the bill. I love the thing. So far, it has performed admirably. It is all that I need in a smart phone. You can download a myriad of apps for it both free and for a few dollars. I now have a lot of info available to me at the touch of a button.As other reviewers have noted, it is indeed considerably cheaper from Wal-Mart. $99.99 vs $129.99. Hey, 30 bucks is 30 bucks. That\u2019s enough left over for a decent case. If you\u2019re looking for a good, inexpensive smart phone, I would recommend the Huawei 866c from Smart Talk.Oh, yes, my girlfriend likes this phone too and will likely be replacing her somewhat dated Samsung with a Huawei 866c very soon.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone.", "Author": "Colin P. Collins", "ReviewID": "R1FBP2L0MTIQS3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price point ($99.99 @ Walmart), this phone delivers nicely. MY one gripe about it is the fact that it is SUPPOSED to be hotspot capable, but so far I have not been able to get there. The Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, and 3G perform nicely, and it responds reasonable quick. It doesn't have a lot of space storage wise, so you have to pick and choose what you want on it, it does however, have expandable SD Storage so you can put music and videos and such on it. Overall I give it 4 out of 5.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I HATE this phone!", "Author": "Elizabeth B.", "ReviewID": "R2SZYBD3SVTLJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone from Wal-Mart and have had problems with it ever since. I have had to get two replacements already and I have had it for less than a year! Every thing I try to use on it force closes and it has horrible memory. Right now I have 3 apps 90 pictures and 50 messages on my phone and it says my memory is full and wont let me view my texts. That is ridiculous! I would recommend getting the more expensive phones for straight talk because this phone is useless.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems", "Author": "diane", "ReviewID": "R310YXL88221ND", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone was not as advertised online.
