She was mainly interested in the pink color - little else mattered to her.  I will say the pictures don't do it justice - it is a very attractive phone.  Like all Nokia's I've used, it is well built, has excellent voice quality and it has a long battery life.  She can text on it as well as any other phone she has had, and the wi-fi is a really great feature for this price-range phone.  I thought I wanted 3G capability, but frankly in practial day-to-day use not having it has not been a negative in any way.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone & Customer service..WOW", "Author": "shellz", "ReviewID": "RTKUVJ1X97CZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I saw this phone I knew it was the phone for me..pink my fav. color. The tracking info stated that I would get it by 2/8/1, however it came 3 days before that date. When I opened the box and saw the actual phone the picture doesn't do the phone justice. For the girls that love, love pink this is the phone, needless to say something lady like.As I began to use the phone I ran into a few snags, I couldn't get the internet, so because I have AT&T; I called them for some assistance. Boy, I have to tell you that experience was so frustrating I can't begin to tell explain what I was feeling!!!!!!! So in there explanation AT&T; advised me to contact Nokia, my goodness it felt just like I was speaking with AT&T;, let me tell you this went on for 6 hours with me trying to get some help, by then I was almost ready to pull my hair out.I felt just like a tennis ball getting hit back and forth between AT&T; & Nokia putting the blame on each other.  So I had a light bulb moment something said call the company where I purchased the phone from to see if they could help. I called and explained my frustration and the staff person actually listened, he really listened! OK, I began to feel like I was batting a thousand .The gentleman stated that he would have 1 of his tech call me back to assist me about 1 hour went by and I got a call from the gentleman stating that they were having some pc issues and that he wanted to let me know that he didnt forget about me. Which was sooooo nice.So the next day I called it took all of 15 minutes  to fix a small issue that the large companies couldn't fix in 6 hours. Now that's what I call great and outstanding customer service, needless to say that I'm still in love with my cell phone.  This is a great company to purchase items from I have spread the word. Great phone and outstanding customer service..WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!.  :0)", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "PLeased", "Author": "Sunshine", "ReviewID": "RLGKQTY83CZ1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initially I was a bit skeptical about how well this would work on my network, but it has not let me down at all!!!!!!!!

Once a Nokia user can use almost every Nokia. I got this for my mom- I wanted her to something fun and simple- this seemed to be right. First of all- obviously the color is fantastic :)Pros - camera was better than I expected from this phone.Shipped VERY fast (fastest shipment I ever got from amazon)Every other pro Nokia hasCons- I expected better from the batteryIt has a weird system of navigation that makes it unnecessarily complicatedDoesn't come with a usb cord. Really Nokia? They are not that expensive to make- what is it- 20 cents to you? However for the consumer, it is SOMETIMES expensive AND a complete unnecessary hassle especially if your phone uses usb connection to be able to download music, sync, etc.After all, I love unlocked phones- and this is a great color which is MORE THAN ENOUGH for my mom- but not enough for me.I'd never get this phone for myself.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, but AT&T; users", "Author": "Giuliana", "ReviewID": "R3PMY1GA2CB4YI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little phone -- even has wifi, but beware AT&T; users.

I guess I just like solving puzzles and taking things apart.Initially, I was mainly looking for a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard, not a touchscreen keyboard, which I hate, that could do Wifi without requiring a data plan with my cellphone carrier (AT&T;).  So many of the full keyboard cellphones nowadays have Wifi, but will not allow you to do Wifi without also having a data subscription.The C3-00 fulfills these requirements.  The biggest downside to this phone is that Nokia has pretty much abandoned all further support for this phone and its old Symbian operating system.  That means no easy way to get the apps you need to do simple things like blocking certain incoming phone numbers.However, because this is a simple, basic, and slightly smart phone (think of it as a C-minus level smartphone), that has been out for some time, the phone is relatively cheap to buy and use, and numerous tweaks are out there posted on the internet that allow you to tweak it.  If you do want a data plan through AT&T; for example, this costs only $10 a month, as the phone uses the older slower GPRS/EDGE  data network.The phone also takes up to a 16Gb micro-SDHC chip to play your music  and store your photos for the 2MB camera (you need the latest firmware, earlier firmware versions only supported 8GB).  It will play MP4s by the way (my son figured this part out).Having said all that, the next thing that has to be said is:  BUYER BEWARE!  There are several DIFFERENT versions of this phone!  I have purchased around 10 of these phones now (one has failed).  Here are the versions I have encountered and what can or needs to  be done to fix them:1.  Regular American/Western standard English QWERTY keyboard.  May come locked or unlocked.  Found on Ebay, AliExpress, etc.  Firmware level highly variable from the  6.-- series on up to 8.70.  RM614  8.71 is the last Nokia firmware update, but there is no American or European version.  The closest you get is the English language Australian/New Zealand/Singapore English QWERTY firmware which works fine.  If you are lucky, you will get one of these with this 8.71 firmware.  Depending on the firmware  level, this type of phone is the closest you can get to having a ready-to-go phone that needs minimal programming/hacking to work properly.2. English QWERTY keyboard with (usually) 8.71 international firmware of unknown type with  non-English characters (Cyrillic?)  for certain of the uppercase keyboard buttons which do NOT correspond to what is on the keyboard.  These phones need to be re-flashed with the English QWERTY 8.71 firmware (see above) to work properly.3. Partial QWERTY keyboard with (usually) 8.71 international firmware of unknown type.  The uppercase keyboard buttons for certain buttons are blank.  These uppercase buttons will generate the same set of non-English characters as type #2.  These phones need re-flashing of the firmware and a replacement full-set English QWERTY keyboard.  As of this writing, these keyboards can be found on Ebay and elsewhere, and there is a Youtube video that shows you how to take your phone apart to replace the keyboard (need a T4 or T5 Torx screwdriver)4. Cyrillic version QWERTY keyboard with same 8.71 international firmware.  Same fixes needed as type #3.5.  AT&T; Go-phone.  These have a dark blue body and silver keyboard.  Comes with 3.63 firmware WITHOUT WIFI!!!  These were sold really cheap for a time by Walmart, and are now often found on Ebay and elsewhere.  Re-flashing the firmware to 8.70, 8.71, whatever, will place a Wifi soft key on this phone, and allow it to seek out and identify nearby Wifi hotspots.  This indicates that these phones do indeed still have the Wifi chip in them.  However, the MAC addresses of these Go-phones have been wiped out and set to ZERO, meaning that the cellphone WILL NOT CONNECT EVER TO ANY WIFI SOURCES!!!  So far, I have not discovered any hacked software out there that will allow you to reflash a MAC address onto the Wifi chip on this cellphone.  So these AT&T; Go-phones have very effectively had their Wifi permanently castrated by Nokia, most likely at the behest of AT&T;, to force users to use an AT&T; data plan.In regards to re-flashing the firmware:1.  Get the cracked Phoenix Software.  Need a good quality micro USB cable to connect to your PC computer.  See Commentary section below for websites where you can download this software and instructions for how to use it.  The original genuine version required a dongle, so you need the cracked version(s).  Phoenix WILL NOT WORK on 64-bit Windows 7!!  It will work on 32-bit Windows XP and Windows 7.  For those of you righteous legal purists, know that Phoenix Software is a now defunct software no longer being sold or supported, and so the cracked version is not defrauding anybody of their rightful profits.2.  Some sites still tell you to download the Navifirm software to get the latest firmware from Nokia.  Well, Nokia shut down their website for the Navifirm software in early-mid 2013, so forget about using Navifirm.  See Commentary section below for best websites currently to get the last firmware version 8.71.Other reviews have already discussed how to get the phone set up properly to send MMS Multimedia text messages.  Go to the Commentary section below for a full update on the details.  One KEY FACT not mentioned by other reviewers so far is that you need to ALSO change the IMEI number with your cellphone carrier in order to get the Multimedia text messaging to work.Also in the Commentary section is a website description of how to get the Wifi to work.Onwards, to the Commentary section ...", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "B S company", "Author": "carlos perla", "ReviewID": "R1GDLREB676T6B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One of the big mistake a never have , the phone is not working back home, the charger is not working, now I try to sender back and this dude want to keep the phone and my money also,  I was two blocks away, and he told me send it by mail,  funny ..........", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought it for a friend", "Author": "Tilamamma", "ReviewID": "R1NWY1FBGASLES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for a friend who lives in Costa Rica, my only complaint is that there are only 3 languages to chooses from and Spanish is not one of them.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE !!!!!", "Author": "fabienne olivares", "ReviewID": "R2QT6F6Z2DVTSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BUEN TELEFONO ERA PARA UN REGALO DE UNA AMIGA Y LA NI\u00d1A ESTA FASCINADA LO RECOMIENDO MUY BUENO BUEN VENDEDOR", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great guy honest .", "Author": "hagar \"Dongobe\"", "ReviewID": "R306UWNG2U24JX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the way you handle business , I love  it  and I will fully recommend every one to buy anything that is for sale on your website .

It was a good weight and the keyboard buttons were adequate for my small fingers.  The display was GORGEOUS.  What I couldn't live with was the navigation, it's more complex than it needs to be.  My LG dumbphone is easier to get around than this!  A huge problem was the inability to touch a key and see what time it is.  This large message comes up telling you how to unlock the phone?!  I just wanted to know what time it was, not unlock the phone!  Plus, the phone I received had not been factory reset.  I had no patience for that when I discovered I couldn't set my own security p/w.  I wasn't going to an authorized Nokia dealer to get it done and by the time the seller offered to help factory restore, I was too disenchanted to keep it.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rating for two Nokia C3 Cellphones from \"Everything Wireless\"", "Author": "Dr. O'Neale", "ReviewID": "RW46CQ6KNE97J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The two cellphones were delivered with instruction guides in Spanish or Portugese therefore, the use of the two phones are limited.Also the two chargers and two adapters sent are defective and cannot charge the phones.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "en espera de productos", "Author": "jose rivas", "ReviewID": "R3NQ4P1R9K6X2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "buenas tardes estoy en la espera de estos productos en venezuela y no tengo respuesta por favor solicitud su ayuda mi correo es josri4@hotmail.com", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "REVIEW OF NOKIA C3 CELLPHONE", "Author": "Randolph V.
