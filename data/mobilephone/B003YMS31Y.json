I bought this phone brand new only January and it's only April and the phone is giving alot of trouble. It has alot of fancy features i agree but don't be fooled the key feature in any phone is to actually receive a phone call. This phone the signal drops and the SOS lights up red sometimes you would be having a conversation then suddenly a LOUD static noise would be coming from phone and the call will drop. At first i thought it was the network but it's not i tried another network with the phone and ireceived the same problem also i did a review and someone was having the same problem.

I hated it and was in the hurry to change it. and about technology it is awful the options takes you no where and its sucks for applications. most sim card carrier don't  even give u internet because it's a blackberry or makes you pay extra, and even with that my internet never worked on THAT phone. i was very patient so time have come for a huge change. this time im going for an IPhone or Sam-sum. never say never, but i say NEVER a Blackberry ever again!!!If it was 6 starts i would give it a 3 cause it last 3 years, as it 5 im giving it a 2. i payed 600 dollars for this phone and i feel it was not worth it if it wont last for at least 6 years.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone...", "Author": "Abdalkarem Al Abawi", "ReviewID": "R32LC47YZ3IB4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it like 2 years a go as a gift for my sister, it is still live & kicking...
