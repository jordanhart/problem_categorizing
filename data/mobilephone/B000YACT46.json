My last phone was monochrome and had no camera.  Then I was told I qualified for an upgrade that included the Q.It has been an incredible investment and well worth the money.  I use it for everything.  I search the Internet, check e-mail, listen to music and watch movies.  It is infinitely customizable.  While my friends download stupid ring-tones, I downloaded some mobile software that allowed me to use Microsoft Office files on it.  I word process, fill out spreadsheets and craft presentations. It is a great mobile tool that augments my computer.  That is really what it has become, a mobile computer.I wish it offered Wi-Fi, as well as some other functions, but mine is the first generation.  For someone who still doesn't understand the depth of possibilities a mobile device like the Q offers, this is a great starting platform.  It has revolutionized the way I do business.  When it comes time to upgrade my phone again, I will be looking for that device that reaches the next level in smartphone technology with a price that doesn't break my budget.  It will be hard to top my Q.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "O K", "Author": "xox", "ReviewID": "R14DQM9J3K3S07", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this item was good and worked well, now the service provider stop the service so i cannot used same. have same for re sail if i can do so", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A GREAT CELL PHONE IN THE STATES BUT HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES???", "Author": "LAWRENCE B.
