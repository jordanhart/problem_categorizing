{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone for Price But has downfalls", "Author": "Benjamin", "ReviewID": "R34BJT9BY4VB7U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok. So I will start off by saying, for the price, This is a good little beginner phone.  I would say it is a low/mid range android device.First, The form factor. I do love that it has a unique 4\" screen with a 4:3 screen ratio.It provides great space for reading, typing is bliss on this device, keyboard is very spacious, and has a great screen space for app content. The screen is very responsive.It has a very nice plastic/rubber feel to it. It almost feels as if you don't need a case for it. It has a nice small lip that curves up over the side of the screen to protect if it is dropped face down. It is also suppose to be made of crack and chip proof materials. It has 4 physical android buttons on the bottom.It has I believe a 600x800 Pixel resolution screen, which for this price is pretty good. Text is sharp and clear. Shows details very well. The screen is glass, not plastic but it isn't Gorilla Glass. So it will scratch.Most devices at this price will only fit a 320x480 resolution which provides a bit of a grainy look.The color saturation could be better. Colors are bright and Colorful, but appear a bit washed out compared to other devices in price range.Its not feather light, but not heavy either. It has a nice weight feel to it.The battery is amazing. I can squeeze about 6 hours out of it, which made not seem a lot, but I have a very heavy texter/internet user. With light usage lasting well to 12 hours if not more. Most phones in the past had trouble lasting me 4 hours. Calls are very clear and I've never experienced a drop call yet.It does come with HSPDA+ \"4G\" which is rated at I believe 14.2Mbps. Data is very fast and very enjoyable. It has great signal, I constantly keeps about 3-5 bars even with me living in the country. Far better than any phone I have had which seems to be a Pantech thing. Their phones have great reception so far.But the phone does have a few downfalls and their big to me.It does indeed have a 1GHZ processor, but it feels more like it's running a 600-800MHZ processor. It can run very laggy. I found the Default Pantech Home Launcher to be horrid at performance. Go Launcher works amazing though. And the more apps you have running, the more severe it will perform. I have to constantly keep a task killer running because once you get about 5-7 apps running, it will lock up and have to perform a battery pull to reboot it.I have owned phones with 1GHZ processors and I've never had these problems before. I'm not exactly sure where Pantech  went wrong with this phone in optimizing it.It has 512MB of ram, which seems sufficient for the normal user, and probably is, but I find that it peaks down to about 20-50MB free ram alot which will start causing lock ups and freezing. I suggest removing the stock AT&T; apps if you won't use them, they constantly open and run in the background all the time.If you are a casual user, maybe a few apps here or there, you won't have any problems with this phone, but if you are a more hardcore user, I would suggest looking into another phone.Next, Storage. It says it has 1GB internal storage, but out of the box, it said it only has about 300-400MB free. After downloading about 20 apps, I was down to less than 100MB left and would run into a insufficient storage warnings while trying to install apps which while having all my apps moved to my SD card to free up internal storage space.If you use a lot of apps or like to download them, this will be a big problem for you.Now, the camera. It has a 5MP camera with auto focus but no flash. The cameras photos are decent, but they don't appear to be very good for a 5MP photo, which Cameras seems to be Pantech's downfall in the phone department. Their camera performances seems to suffer in many of their phones. They are a bit washed out in color.The auto focus is a nightmare. It has at least a 3-4 second lag to focus and the slightest movement will cause the photo to come out blurry and their is no way to turn it off or adjust it. So this will not be good for your primary camera by all means. Low light performance is not good either especially with no flash.Speaker is loud and clear. Phone calls while on speaker phone are very nice and loud. The speaker is on the back so if placed down, it will be muffled.It has all the normal screen senors. Auto Rotate, Proximity but doesn't have a auto light sensor so you are stuck to a basic back light adjuster which won't adjust according to room brightness which can be a pain to constantly change it from interior lighting to exterior.Wifi and Bluetooth work great. I use my Bluetooth to sync with my cars stereo for music and calls.It runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread with no update to Ice Cream Sandwich.Overall, it is a good phone for the price, for a beginner or first time user who likes to text and be a social butterfly but it won't please the more avid users.I would say for an extra $50, buy the Pantech Burst. It has a 4\" Super AMOLED screen. Dual core 1.5GHZ processor. 16GB internal storage. Better camera with flash and front facing camera along with updated to Ice Cream Sandwich and also comes with True 4G LTE. The burst is a pleasant to use and has yet to fail me yet.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "A nice budget phone that does more than I expected", "Author": "Lauren Glenn", "ReviewID": "R3E5407A2NPTY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a low priced phone and didn't have high hopes for this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Some of the reviews say that the four buttons on the bottom can't be removed (the ones you see on the screenshot) but I was able to install Go Ex Launcher and it works just fine.Spotify, Google Play, and BeyondPod all install with no problems.  The email client is quite good for Exchange Mail (both of my Exchange accounts are set up).But what surprised me was that the width of the phone made typing on the phone so much better.  The 4x3 display made quite a difference and it was a decent experience.All of my podcasts play fine and Spotify works great too.  I don't have an /sdcard/external_sd directory (the /sdcard/ directory handles the microSD card which should work fine for most things.NOTE:For those who complained about the phone locking up or the phone going into constant resets, I experienced this too.  What you need to do is to download a program from the Play store called RAM Booster.  Set it to automatically free up memory every 5 minutes.  The freezes occur because RAM is getting filled since the phone only has about 512MB of RAM.  When you do that, you'll notice that it tends to not freeze up nearly as much (if at all).For constant resets, the system gets issues when the battery gets very low.  I had this issue with the battery when I first got it where the phone said it had 90% free battery and would constantly die.  Since it was a new phone, I figured that I needed to condition the battery (full charge, full discharge, repeat 2x or 3x until the system learns the limits of the battery).  This is a normal thing phones do when they get exposed to heat or hot conditions where the battery loses its ability to determine what's full or not.  Many rechargeable batteries have this issue although I wish the phone handled it better..... still, if you have a full charge and conditioned the battery once, it should learn it and keep everything running fine.Cons:It's not that fast.  But it's not too slow either.  Using BeyondPod, I played HD videos on the screen with absolutely no problems or slowdown.  BSPlayer didn't play with the correct aspect ratio so that's disappointing but the built-in player does the trick fine.The OS is 2.3 so some of the apps won't install (the TIVO app is one that didn't), but SPOTIFY did with the new version.  It took my 64GB MicroSD card and formatted it then the system used it with no problem.  The internal storage isn't much but with the SD card, I have all I need for now.Summary:  BUY!For about $50, you get a decent Android phone with a surprisingly good screen that makes things readable even with small text.  The 4x3 screen is great for typing on the touch display and you get OTG storage (according to the phone's folders).  I used TabletTalk to dial my phone from my tablet and it worked fine.  It let me control the phone and switch from Bluetooth to Speakerphone from the tablet.Spotify playback didn't stutter unless it was bogged down with a lot of other tasks but that was to be expected.Still, for $50 off contract, I'm definitely glad I bought it.  I was going to spend $70 on a prepaid phone to get a replacement phone but this is a much better buy.  It's not state-of-the-art processor and speed but for emails, some web browsing (can't use Chrome though.... Firefox works fine though), and music/video playing, you can't do much worse for the price.Bluetooth is also present as are most other Android functions.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good the 2nd time", "Author": "Jacob Wyatt", "ReviewID": "R314CMZ882JHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I ordered this \"new\" phone and it was certainly used when i got it, scratched screen and scuffed bottom. I can't remember the seller, as the the seller for which Amazon is filling orders has changed a couple times. I obtained an rma the day I got it...But I liked the phone and wanted to give it another try, so I ordered another hoping that it would indeed be new, and it was. The microsd card was taken out, which was a little annoying, but it forced me to buy an 8 gig.  I really like the form factor of the phone, very nice build and screen, but as mentioned by others, Pantech did cheap out a little. Onboard storage and ram are very low, which causes issues with apps and I believe most of the problems people have with calls and screen lock up. I don't have a lot of apps, and keep them \"killed\" so I haven't had any issues so far, and call quality is great.So, if your looking for a top of the line android, with top of the line specs, the Pocket probably isn't for you.  But if you want a nice large screen, and aren't app heavy, with added 4g via HSPA+, then i'd recommend it.Another note, I use this with Straight Talk, and after changing the ANPs, very easy with Android, it works great.So, a 4\" screen, interesting form factor, 4g for $100 and $45 a month, a good deal in my opinion.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent phone", "Author": "Eddie Nevarez", "ReviewID": "R23H71UMGL2ARL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Pantech Pocket P9060 is a good phone with flaws that can be annoying, but rarely frustrating. It seems that the phone has a problem with having a lot of apps on at the same time, which is not always the users fault because there are some apps in the phone that run in the background. The keyboard is really bad, so one app you will need to get is a keyboard app. Then texting and typing become better, but no one should have to do that. Then there are times when the phone automatically turns off then restarts by itself. It happens often enough for me to call it a problem, and I have never dropped my phone or subjected it to anything that can actually cause malfunctions in a phone. Overall, the pros of the phone outweigh the cons if you are not crazy about phones. If you want a really good phone, get something else.

Reese", "ReviewID": "R1ZMPTB5W5HBCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone 2 days ago for my parents who are not tech savy at all. I love this phone because from out of the box into my hand I could immediately operate it without any directions. My parents always had 2 basic flip phones which I could never figure how to work. The phone is light but not so light as to feel cheaply made. It has just enough weight to it to not be too heavy or too light. Like the rubber feel of the casing and all the apps included. It operates pretty fast. The con for me & my parent is those little rectangular buttons at the very bottom, because they are black on a black screen they blend making them hard to see especially for an older person. If those buttons had been white it would have been easier to differeniate. But I guess once she gets use to it all will be fine. The phone is also a little wide for holding in hand if you are older or pettite but all in all I think this is a great little phone for a beginner smart phone user, not to much tech nor to little and very easy to use straight from the box. My parents got rid of their 2 basic phones for this & its costing them $10.00 less on their plan. I told them its better to have 1 smart phone then 2 stupid phones. I would highly recommend this phone for anyone wanting to upgrade from a basic phone to your 1st smart phone because of the ease of use and the cost.

I attempted to sell the Pocket, but only low ballers (HATE THOSE GUYS) were contacting me.  The Burst was shipped with ICS pre installed and I just didn't like it.  I found a way to restore Gingerbread on it and at the same time I rooted it.  Since I still had the Pocket I decided to root it as well.  After rooting, I've decided to keep both phones.  I discovered I prefer the Pocket without a case since it's so nice just by itself.  After rooting I deleted all the AT&T; bloatware and freed up a bunch of memory.  I use one phone each month.  So far, the Pockets issues have disappeared.  If only it was sold without all the boatware slowing it down.  It still will lag occasionally when playing games like fruit ninja, but so far I'm really liking the Pocket again.

I've learned over time how to avoid this problem, but the lack of on-board memory cannot be fixed.
