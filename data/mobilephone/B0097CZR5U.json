My contract was up, so I changed providers, traded my old phone in (they gave me $200.00 for the trade in) and got this one for $100.00 bucks. That's the way to do it if you are going to buy this phone. Never ever pay the full retail price for this!! That's insane!!For $100.00 this phone if fabulous!!! However, if I actually had to pay $800.00 for it, I don't know if my opinion would be different.The reason I went up to the 32gb is because I download alot of music and the 16gb was not enough storage/memory. There were alot of glitches with my 4s, but so far this one seems great. Suri seems better and can actually understand what you are saying moreso than with the 4s. I like that the screen is bigger and the phone is more lightweight. I literally do everything with my phone. It's basically a mini-computer.The only thing I am not happy about is how they changed to the lightening port. I had to buy a couple of adapters to be able to use my old iphone chargers and docking station adapters all have to be changed etc. So that pretty much stinks. I also had to buy new car chargers as well. It's still not enough to lower my review and give it anything less than 5 stars though. I am really pleased with this phone and all of it's features. I personally prefer Apple products over any other product for sure :) Once you are an apple user, you will understand.

I had a Samsung Intensity 2.. worst phone ever. I wanted a iPhone for a while so I saved my money and bought one. I am glad I did! I have had 2 iPod touches prier (Generation 2,4) so It was no surprise how similar the iPod and iPhone were. There is plenty of room on the Phone for my games, music, and Videos as I travel a lot. I do recommend a case as the phone is thin and kinda slippery. Also if you are in a cold climate, the phone gets cold and a case would make it stay warm.The data portion of the phone is was I was worried about. I have 2gb of data for my plan. My friend who has the iPhone 4s and on Verizon Keeps her Data on All the time. I can't because My goes through Data really fast if I leave it on. Even if I have it on 3g not 4. I think it might be because of all the apps that use Data. It is okay Luckily I can turn Data off or On. :)The phone is really fast! The games update,download, and open fast compare to my iPods. The games always download and never crash. (knock on wood) Some games do not fit the screen for the iPhone 5 yet so some games might be hard to play.I love the visual voice mail! it is so easy to find voice mails and listen to them.One thing I don't understand is that I can not send or receive pictures or listen to a new voice mail unless I have my data on. I could send and receive pictures and listen to a new voicemail on my Samsung Intensity 2 with no Data plan. And since I don't leave my data on all the time I receive Pictures late or Voice mails. The display is great! the HD kinda hurts at first! I wish they had moving backgrounds for the iPhone but maybe later? I am please with the iPhone and I recommend it for sure! :) I hope to get a Macbook Pro in the future.UPDATE: After I downloaded the new IOS 7 Some of my Apps are crashing but It is still ok. When Apple came out with the 2 new phones, They just dropped this phone completely. They have now 4s, 5s, and 5c now at the Apple Store. I don't understand why.

But here's my story and my feelings on it.First off, I had an Android phone for 2 years before it. It got regular updates, so I got to experience Google Now and all those excellent Google features. However, I like trying new things and actually decided it was time to upgrade my phone and tried a Windows Phone. I got bored of it the night I got it and returned it the next day for an iPhone 5. One of the better decisions I made this year.Why?Because it does a lot of things very well, and I didn't realize how much I may have been missing on Android.First: quality of apps. Even though the core of Google produced apps on Android are top notch (and even surpass some of the things iOS does) the majority of apps on Android pale in comparison. Many of the apps that I expected to be buggy (the Roku app, Plex, etc.) were terrific. The only one I had some issues with was the Amazon Kindle app, but a reinstall seems to have resolved those issues. Speaking of quality apps, I have found that the majority of things I needed from from Google (especially Google Voice) have very competent apps available for iOS.Second: Amazing camera and great music/audio features. The camera is astounding. Its not a DSLR, but with Camera+ (a $1 app) it is an excellent point and shoot. The standard camera takes good pictures, but the app gives you more control plus post processing tweaks. It also opens quickly and autofocuses reasonably fast. The front camera is quite good as well for chats on Google Hangout, and takes good \"self-shots\" if you're into that.I listen to a lot of music and podcasts, so the audio player functions are key for me. In android I would have multiple media player widgets taking up home screen space. On the iPhone, whenever you double tap the home button and swipe right you get the \"master\" audio controls that will play and pause whatever audio is playing. The media controls on the lock screen also ALWAYS work (unlike various apps I had trouble with on Android). Doesn't matter if its Spotify, Audible, the Podcast app, they always respond.It has a great battery, if you don't have the screen going all day (like I did when I first got it) you can easily get through most of the day and still be around 50% by the time you head home from work. Your usage will differ, using navigation and LTE at the same time is a good way to kill your battery on just about any phone. BTW, LTE coverage with AT&T; has been quite good and the speeds have been excellent. The speeds when I tethered my laptop were so good, I had no problem loading sites quickly while listening to Spotify at the same time.The biggest con, and I was aware of this going in, is that you can't share data between apps as easily. Android users are used to hitting the \"Share\" button in an app and getting a veritable laundry list of apps (that they have installed) that you can quickly pass info between. With iOS you're limited to email, facebook, twitter and \"open in Safari\" on most things. Now, fortunately most services (like evernote) have individual email addresses or other workarounds (and you can also simply copy and paste into another app) but that's a lot slower. Also, you can't change the default apps so if you want to navigate using Waze, you have to open Waze and then input your destination (using Siri to navigate will only bring up Apple Maps). I knew that going in, and its certainly livable.Finally, this is easily one of the best looking phones I've ever seen. Nokia has some serious design chops but this thing just looks good and feels awesome in the hand. Bigger screens are nice, but its also nice to have something that slides into a pocket and doesn't feel like its going to rip through your pants. Also, the longer screen makes landscape text typing a breeze.Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fine phone", "Author": "Lily Xie", "ReviewID": "R1JDV4J29NJKYD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product was described as brand new, so I expected it to be like just bought from an Apple store.

I have had ever version of the iphone starting with the 3.  I also have an Imac, Ipad, MacBook Air and Nano.  Up to this point I have been using a Iphone 4s and switched to the Iphone 5.  The first issue I had that upon shaking my handset I could clearly hear a loose clicking sound near the top of the handset.  After researching I found that this to be the norm.  I feel when I pay this much for a phone there should be no loose components.I run a non-jailbroken Iphone and all my apps are from Itunes.  I recently used the voice memo program for the first time.  A program that comes factory installed on the phone.  I was unable to transfer the file from my Iphone to my Imac.  I tried all kind of things based on my research on the net.  I gave in and called the support line and they basically spent 80 minutes and the Apple support team was unable to come to a resolution.  Resulted in me wasting a massive amount of time and having to reconfigure my phone after doing a factory reset.  In the end they told me that it was my sound file that was corrupt and that it could be any one of the many Itunes approved applications that I had installed on my phone that was causing the conflict.  I was under the impression that all apps have to be approved by Apple.  They however, refuse to accept responsibility for this issue.  The lesson learned is that the software running on the system is not stable and you cannot rely on the Apple support team.  Best thing is to google the issue and try to resolve it on your own.  If you cannot resolve it do a factory reset and pray for the best.I have come to expect a certain level of quality from Apple and of late I have not been receiving it.

The phone is a quality product with great battery life and stability, all the things I was missing on my Android phones.I started off with the HTC Incredible. Initially I like the phone, however as time went on I would get frustrated with the battery life. I do use my phone for data pretty heavily throughout the day. This includes surfing, music, tethering and applications. That means the screen is on a lot. It got to the point that if I wasn't using my phone, I would be looking for a place to plug it in. I found that unacceptable. Also, I have a lot of apps on my phone and somewhere along the line I would get an app/apps that would make the phone unstable, requiring frequent reboots. I never had much luck finding the culprit apps.When 4G started coming out I upgraded to the Samsung Charge. The phone had a nice feel and a large screen. The first phone I got would begin to overheat, getting hot enough sitting in my pocket that I would have to take it out and turn it off. I returned it for a replacement thinking it was a defective phone. My next Charge began doing the same thing over time. I got a replacement for that one as well. All the problems that I was having with my Incredible were happening on my Charge, as well as the overheating. The battery was lasting an average of 6 hours. I carried 3 batteries around just in case. That is the main reason I didn't want an iPhone, because I couldn't carry a spare battery with me.Well, the Charge frustrated me so much that I decided to take the plunge and go to the iPhone 5. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade, so I paid full price. It is priced too high however, I do believe I got what I paid for. All the shortcomings I experienced on my Android phones have been solved with my iPhone 5. I got the 32GB model so I haven't had issue with not having the space I need. I also like the fact that Apple frequently has software and firmware updates that improve on the phone. I felt like Samsung gave up on support of the Charge less than a year after I bought their phone.
