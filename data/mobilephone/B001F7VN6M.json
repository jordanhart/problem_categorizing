The handset says AT&T.; The only way to make a call is to manually type in the number (so you can't click on stored contacts, click on numbers in emails, etc).I've just read other reviews from OEM Shop BB Bold \"new\" purchases with AT&T; logo with similar problems (the phones appear to either be used/refurbished or cheaply manufactured to a standard to lower than other BB).----I also wanted to clarify this phone was purchased with a full warranty for 1 year however OEM will not honor this. I have gotten two responses from OEM customer service: the first asked me for the IMEI number from the back of the phone. I sent all the numbers on the back of the phone; they didn't recognize any of them and then asked instead for the Amazon order number. After I emailed the order number I never heard back, despite follow up emails.I recommend not purchasing an unlocked BB through Amazon and avoid purchases from OEM. I've read about numerous unlocked BB problems and thought that buying from OEM which had good reviews and offered a warranty, would minimize the chance of being ripped off. I was wrong!

I do agree with buyers who got screwed with the brand new phones. I bought this phone brand new from a 3rd party seller that had the phone sealed and it came sealed with all authentic parts. So I suggest you think about buying from a third party. I do not buy refurbished phones from Amazon because most the time they will have a generic battery on the phone, a returned phone from a customer who ordered through their wireless services which gives you the chance you will get an AT&T; Phone but these phones are unlocked and supposed to be.I suggest you buy from 3rd party sellers that has established positive feedback (I buy from companies that has feedback rating of over 98% and is fulfilled by Amazon). I ordered this phone from Amazon warehouse deals and overall it was well worth the purchase for what I paid for. It cost me 80 bucks for this typical phone which is still popular.

She has been using it for about three weeks, now. The phone came nicely packed. It was unlocked as advertised, and came with cables, charger and a screen-shield sheet. I could see no scratches on the cover, which fit just fine onto the back of the phone. The phone works pretty fine with Vivo, Oi and Claro carriers in Brazil. Therefore, I induce that it shall work as fine with other GSM carriers around the World. Regarding additional functionalities, wifi works great. Rear camera is only 2 MP but is still good enough to take some pictures (Not a 'Brastemp' camera, though, as they used to say in Brazil. [Note: In Brazil, a 'Brastemp' product or functionality of a product is a regional expression indicating either a product or a functionality of a product that does its job nicely and smooth, and even exceeds expectations). There is no front camera. Web browser is awesome and trackball superb. It comes with several pre-installed applications, and yet one can download another bunch of them. The keyboard is Ok, but as you know, one still needs to get used of it, as keys are small and tightly close each other, and one may miss a key or two while typing faster. Anyway, keypad in resistant. Neither my daughter nor I myself have tried either GPS or bluetooth, so far. You can also add a micro Sd card, which could make a difference if large storage amount is needed.Well, overall, a very good device and it have exactly met my daughter's expectations.

I've contacted amazon about it, hopefully they can fix the listing/hardware issues.The handsets (I've gone through two - an exchange to see if I'd get anything different) are O2 UK branded. They are indeed unlocked, but they're not the unbranded international version that was expected. They have O2 branding on the body and an O2-branded UI (boot splash, browser, etc.)The phone works fine, gets great reception, and the Bold 9000 itself is the last in a line of excellent phones from RIM, definitely worth the purchase if you know what to expect.The box contains a card from a now-defunct cellular company \"PDA Giant\" - they appear to be some halfway fishy operation out of Florida, probably why they're now-defunct.The phone was dusty, I didn't find any odd pictures on it like other buyers have said, but given the originating source of these, I'm really not surprised this happened. It looks like these have been in a warehouse for a while thoughMy box contained:* BlackBerry Bold 9000 handset, O2 UK branded and a battery door* a COUNTERFEIT battery. These are generally DANGEROUS and are the most frequent type of battery to explode on users. I'd recommend not using the battery, I purchased a BlackBerry M-S1 battery from Amazon [...] that appears to be legit, it has all the standard RIM markings on it. The counterfeit battery doesn't hold as much of a charge as the OEM battery either. I wouldn't get a day's use out of the phone with the counterfeit battery, on the OEM battery I get over 2 days.* What appears to be an OEM wall charger* RIM support CD* None of the usual product documentation or manuals* No headset or other accessoriesKnowing all this, it really is a pretty competitive price for this handset, better than most of the other cell vendors online, even with the added cost of buying a legitimate battery.I'd recommend the handset for purchase, but use caution, and be prepared to exchange it a few times. I give 3 stars for the inaccurate listing, package conditions and a dangerous counterfeit battery.Update: I purchased a third figuring I knew what to expect. The third one:* Came in a different box from the last 2* Came with a charger that was already opened* Came with a leather pouch the other two didn't come with* Had a Motorola-branded USB cable with it* Was an unbranded BlackBerry but appeared to have a T-mobile phone numbers sticker on the screen* Still came with a used counterfeit battery* Had goop on the inside and the display looks like it's been serviced (improperly)* Was running an AT&T-branded; OS (which means the AT&T; logo bezel was probably removed and replaced during service)* TrackBall doesn't work* There was a picture on it of the cell phone warehouse where these phones were modified.

It functions perfectly as a phone and is quick in delivery of text messages and blackberry messages. The web and e-mails are easily accessed and viewed.  In addition, the Blackberry is small and can easily fit into your pocket.  The Bold's keypads lock upon your command so you don't have to worry about \"pocket calling\" people.Within seconds the Blackberry browser connects you to the Internet where you can search for free and it doesn't drain the battery. While on the web, you can download hundreds of applications to your Blackberry Bold such as googlemaps, facebook, skype, etc. Even more convenient, you don't need a digital camera if you have a Blackberry Bold because it contains a digital camera and a video camera. The Blackberry Bold is fantastic because you can use it to send pictures/videos via email, texts, Blackberry messenger, or even upload them to facebook and tag your friends within seconds. Lastly, the Bold won't let you forget a friend's birthday or an important meeting for work. The Blackberry Bold has an onscreen calendar that connects to the alarm and will always remind you of important events.In summation, the Bold does everything required in a phone and more. Right in your pocket, at the touch of your fingers, you can have everything needed to communicate with those around you.

She needed a Blackberry under a certain amount of money and the Bold 9000 was the only thing other than the older Curve and Tour models available.It's difficult to leave a practical review for a phone released in 2008. It feels its age, really dated. We've come strides and I own a Nexus 4. That being said, I will try to be as objective as possible.Personally, I truly believe that she would have been wholly better off with a cheap Android or Windows phone vs. this device. It is pretty much stuck as it is. There is no update possible. 4.6 is the last OS version unless \"modding\" is involved (by that I mean there's no official update). The phone has ~45MB of free space, but at least there's an SD Card.It works well and it is \"quick\", so to speak. I haven't really seen any lagging so far and calls are crisp and clear. It has a 2MP camera and is 3G capable. It is a quad band phone so it works with most GSM carriers.This is focussed at the seller.One thing that I didn't like is that the phone is advertised by BLUTEKUSA as new but is reconditioned. I've owned cell phones for 15+ years and by now can definitely tell between a brand new unboxing vs. opening up something that is refurbished. Also, and this is the kicker - I've opened up brand new bold 9000s before, as well as other BB devices. There's even a scuff mark on the battery and side of the phone. It didn't come with a manual or those booklets you always throw out because they're useless anyway, earphones, usb cable, etc. I got the phone, battery and charger cable - that's it. I'm considering returning it because I could just buy a phone advertised as refurbished for 1/2 the price from other vendors on Amazon. It's pretty dishonest. Amazon needs to change their policies in terms of how vendors advertise items as new vs. refurbished.Update: BLUTEKUSA contacted me asking me to remove my 3 star feedback (not this review) that I gave them to which I politely declined. It wasn't even negative, per se. I just put the facts. As I said in my response to them, sometimes you only get one chance to make a customer happy. This is one of those cases, there is no opportunity for a do-over. I was to send the phone to a relative abroad through a visiting family member. I had no chance to even source an alternative or replacement elsewhere much less from Blutekusa, so I have to stand by my feedback and I will now remove 1 star from my review here because the last thing you should do as a store is ask a customer to remove negative feedback.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "Patrice Fethiere", "ReviewID": "R28YQYRO8GK0S6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not even a week after I bought I already had to change the battery.

The phone came in AT&T; box which was what the person who helped us to unlock it exactly wanted (he recommended buying AT&T; or t-mobile phone because they are more compatible with international phones). So anyway, the phone arrived in excellent condition (although it seems like this was a factory refurbished phone, but it still looked like new). I saw a little scratch on the screen when I unwrapped it, but it turns out the scratch was only on the plastic cover and didn't affect the phone. The only negative was that the back cover (where you put the battry and the sim card) was a little shaky, so I bought one of those protective covers which not only made it more study but also made the phone look more beautiful like new.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "importante", "Author": "Vicente Mijares", "ReviewID": "R1RDWXBJS5BP6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelente articulo y la tienda que promociona 100% recomendado , y es un equipo con sus carasteristicas fuciona muy bien gracias.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "buena compra", "Author": "leonel ulichny", "ReviewID": "R3GCACQ3AJ5M4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "buen equipo llego a tiempo tal como lo dice el anuncio se ve como nuevo y funcional equipo se ve nuevo sin problemas", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "z.v.", "ReviewID": "RBJQMG3ZMTDHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nice phone it`s early to speak about quality of phone yet but first opinion  is good.

The battery drained quickly, but other than that, everything was fine.  That was before I tried to get a data plan (when I was just using the phone for talking and texting).  I've spent six hours at the T-mobile store over the past two weeks trying to trouble-shoot this thing, and the techies there say they've never seen anything like it.  The phone cannot access the data plan I have.  At first we thought it was due to corrupted software, so we replaced it. But even with the software overhaul, the phone doesn't allow you to switch from \"Hotspot Browser\" (wifi) to \"Internet Browser\" (to be used with any carrier's data plan).  It's really strange.  But it defeats the point of having a SmartPhone if you can only access the internet and email when you can get wifi. Thank God I bought a warranty to go with it.

Great OS.* Good enough web browser -- once you get used to it.* Wi-Fi performs well.  Less hassle than some other phones.* Fast camera shutter.  Unless your phone is clocking (see below), there is never a lag for photos.* Faux leather back is kinda cool.CONS:* Heavy.  Technology has advanced in the past couple of years, making this phone heavier than necessary.* Expensive.  Seriously, why pay this much for a phone that will be obsolete soon?* Bluetooth is a disappointment.  I want more than stereo headset and hands-free; I want to transfer files.* Phone locks up very often -- at least 3x per day!  It will start clocking for no reason, and sometimes requires a battery pull.  There is no good reason anyone should tolerate this.* As with owning any Blackberry, you are subject to the availability of the Blackberry network.  An outage in Canada will prevent you from using your e-mail in New Mexico.MY RECOMMENDATION:  I bought my phone a year and a half ago, and I'm generally happy with it.  But these days, there are other compelling options.  If you have to own a Blackberry (such as for work), this is your best bet.  However if you are free to purchase something else, consider one of the many exciting Android phones out there.Because, realistically, I don't think Blackberry will be around for more than another couple of years.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Audio Hardware Configuration is Ridiculous...

The security issue is not that big a concern on the iPhone.  The replaceable battery and the multitasking are big issues for me, so it looks as if I'll stick with BB a while longer and see what transpires with the iPhone 4G when/if it appears.
