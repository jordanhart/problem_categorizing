Excellent coverage nationwide - no dropouts for any major city or Interstate.  One-touch int'l calling does work at the same rate for local calls - you just need to register the numbers online and add the 800 redirect numbers to your phonebook.  Phone features are basic but intuitive, and the audio is first rate.  If your cell use is modest or you need a phone for the road without roaming charges or coverage issues, this one's a good bet.  Can't comment on customer service since I never needed it and hopefully never will.", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Happy with Tracfone", "Author": "K. Meyer", "ReviewID": "R2N4967NH0I7O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the only two reviews available, I had to comment. I have used Tracfone for years and I think it is great. I've only had to replace the phone twice, the service is just as good as anybody else, it doesn't trash my small budget, and the service is not complicated. My usage is moderate, but I can't imagine using any other company even if my usage increases. They even have programs for automatically adding minutes, so I don't have to chase after a card at the last minute.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Outdated by today's standards.. even for Tracfone", "Author": "John L. Guest \"Honest John\"", "ReviewID": "RUQR8OL7J38VE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have used this phone for over three years. Even when I bought it, it was outdated. By today's standards, it is only barely functional. My old one lasted those three years without problems until it started giving an \"invalid battery\" message every time I tried to recharge it.. Of course this pretty much made the phone useless. When I bought it I would have rated it 3-star, now it is barely 1-star IMOWhen I bought the phone it was $10 and included service time. I would not even spend that much for it today.The phone was servicable, but it has major drawbacks:*It \"pants dials\" random numbers if you put it in your pocket, purse etc since the keyboard is wide open.*Its display was ok in its day, but it is inadequate for anything but the most minimal usage*It has no camera.. of any kind*Reception on it is pretty marginal. If I didn't talk by the window in my apartment I could not keep a connection*It has no bluetooth function to allow pc communication (which will save YOU money) and cannot be used for handsfree phonesets..much safer*With just normal use the battery only lasts a day or two.. even on standbye it will not last 5 days without a recharge.. and if the charge is low, you'll be lucky to even get 5 minutes of talk time before you have to plug in*The talk volume is just adequate.. if noisey around you won't understand the caller or they won't understand youI note also that they are being sold used. If you plan to use it on Tracfone, be SURE to call Tracfone IN ADVANCE and be sure you can use it.. especially if you plan on using SIM info from your phone. Generally it cannot be done.Parents.. please! Don't stick your kids with this phone.. they'll be the butt of their friends jokes... even if you want the minimum at least spring for the LG 420G Pre-Paid Cell Phone for TracFone with Bluetooth - Black Unlimited double minutes!. No matter which phone you pick, the per minute cost is the same.. so let 'em have at least a smidge of status! :DIf it matters I have the all-black one, not the red one", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "pink phone", "Author": "twinkie", "ReviewID": "R2L2K6PLQRWQQN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great little phone for my grandaughter, the only thing is that it needs to be charged everyday.

It can call and text not much more. Pictures messages are shown as a string of numbers. But I loved it. Its battery lasts for a week when within service. It is on a go phone plan from AT&T; so it only cost $100 a year to roll over a balance.

It would not hold a charge for more than 2 days even if turned completely off.  Got a new phone from one of the many Amazon suppliers and it looked just fine.  But when I called Tracfone to activate it they said I had purchased it from an unauthorized reseller who admitted to me in an private email that they bought the C139 four years ago from Walmart.  So what did I do wrong?  Fortunately, Amazon has returned my purchase price and I am sending the C139 back to the reseller at his expense.  Where did I make my mistake?  BTW the reason for replacing the old phone with the same model is that it took a long time for an old fogie like me to learn how to use the C139 and I did not want to start all over again.  I am a technophobe meaning it took me many years to even get my first cellphone:-)", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the trouble at any price.", "Author": "Gregory H. Webb", "ReviewID": "R1DG6TRTFC36JX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My tracfone worked great for about 3 weeks. Then one morning I received an \"unregisterd SIM\" message. I called customer service and I think that they said that it was a temporary problem in my area that would be fixed soon. I could barely understand the customer service representative so I'm not 100% sure. Anyway, my parent's have a tracfone and they live in the same area and theirs works. So I suspect customer service was just feeding me a line. I googled the problem and found that it is a common problem and that it is not worth the trouble to get it fixed, if you ever can. I'm trashing the phone and just considering it a lesson learned.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Tracphone Rocks", "Author": "Jesse J.

(Unlike other companies 611 customer service calls are not charged as actual phone units.)Took forever to get to customer service, which is not properly trained and cannot understand plain English (some do some don't).Charged me for calls not connected etc...Really disappointed.. I lost close to 60 not so cheap units in a customer service call and they did not take care of the issue. I could not make international calls like advertised in their website. Really sad.
