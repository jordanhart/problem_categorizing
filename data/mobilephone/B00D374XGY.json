{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone @ great price", "Author": "Dean", "ReviewID": "R2FB6QUQSZ1TPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although this is the first smart phone I have owned, I am very happy. Has big screen for viewing. Very clear screen resolution. Nice rear/front view camera (wish it had flash). Makes great videos. Easy to use. Tons of apps. Battery lasts a long time. 3G internet. Not great signal where I live (straight talk carrier) but still pretty fast. When I am in town, works much better. Wifi and Bluetooth capable. Very durable (I've dropped it a few times with no case. LOL).", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just ok", "Author": "Luke B. Townsley", "ReviewID": "R1ZWAKFW1ABYTZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Decent screen, reasonably durable, and fast enough, but the speaker is really bad.Its almost unusable on speakerphone, and not easy to hear even on regular talk mode up to your ear. Given I use mine mainly as a work phone on home service calls, it's almost a dealbreaker. I've seriously considered replacing it.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Performance Hindered by Low Memory and Low Storage", "Author": "Joshua T", "ReviewID": "R1U4085FG9DU70", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone, and I have learned to appreciate its strengths at a bargain price while acknowledging its weakness.The screen is a reasonably large 4 inches, with clear presentation of text, photos and video, and surprisingly good video and sound. The touch is pretty accurate, and the screen is reasonably responsive.. The GPS is extremely impressive, although it sucks the battery at a rapid rate. The photos are pretty clear, although sometimes slightly off in color accuracy. The phone itself sounds clear and able to pick up weak signals, which is its base function.The weakness is a very low amount of storage and a rapidly draining battery. Sort of like having an expensive sports car with a go-kart gas tank. This means that I must spend most evenings charging the phone, unless I have been charging it in my car during the day. It means that I cannot keep the Tunein radio app on my phone because it will not store on my 32 gig storage chip, and I need the space to update the Chrome browser and Swiftkey keyboard.This is a great starter phone, with reasonable cost and  $50 a month cost on Net10 for unlimited data (no tethering allowed). I recommend it. If you need the best and have $400 or $500 to blow, or don't mind a two-year contract, look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing for a phone at this price", "Author": "Mariah", "ReviewID": "R1K5QV7H3G2I6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The screen looks great, it's fast, it sounds great, and it's a great deal.
