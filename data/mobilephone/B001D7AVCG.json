I have had one for years. I wanted an upgrade and selected the RAZR V3. The first phone delivered did not live up to RAZR standards. I contacted the company and worked with Erin, their rep.  I exchanged the phone at no cost to me. The new phone has excellent reception, I do not have to use the speaker for people to hear me (this was my main problem with the old phone). I also had a phone book problem which was corrected by the exchange.My suggestion to anyone who wants an inexpensive phone is to try this one. If it does not work out for you, call the company and give them a chance to fix the problem. If you would rather return the phone you will be offered a full refund.

Speaking of boat this doesn't pick up interference, or cause it like my last mobile phone did.I like the size as well, fits great in a purse and there's lots of accessories for it as well, if you need to keep it in a pocket it's slim enough not to cause discomfort.Lastly the hinges for the flip are a decent size, they're not likely to break like some phones I've had, and not being \"techie\" it's simplicity is a big bonus - thinking of a phone for gran, it might be ideal!I'm quite pleased with purchase, you might be too.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far not so great!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Q0FPAS31UUQK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "THIS IS A REVISION FROM A 5 STAR RATING TO A 2 STAR RATING.  11/24/12  My wife had a Razr V3 from TMobile.
