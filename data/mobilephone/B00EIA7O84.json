{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding camera on an Android phone, but maybe not for everyone", "Author": "jsegural01", "ReviewID": "R1V2AESUDPD9RM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Short one: I love it and got used to its size within a day. Works perfectly (at least for me).Long one: I read a lot of reviews online before finally buying this 'thing'. Some were neutral, some were not, so I'll try to make this review as useful as possible for those that are still not sure about the S4 Zoom:  -CAMERA: my advice is 'think about priorities'. If taking pictures/videos is your #1 or #2 priority on a cellphone, the s4 Zoom is for you, as you'll get 16MP, optical image stabilization, 10x optical zoom (forget about Nokia's 41MP; that is 'cropping a large image', and no matter how much they try to convince you, it's not the same). You'll love the camera; guaranteed.  -SIZE/SHAPE: I carry it on my (pant) pocket without a problem. It does not look weirder on your pocket than a Galaxy Note. But it is bulky, really bulky when compared to a cellphone (even if compared with a cheap camera). This is the main reason this phone is available only in a few sites and stores. People love thin sleek phones...and hate bricks.  -PROCESSOR/MEM: if pictures/video are not your priority, then you'll not afford spending +$400 on a dual-core device. But let's not get confused: with 1.5 RAM and dual-core, the S4 Zoom handles most activities very well without any lags. However, the S4 Mini will give you the same power, with the same screen size, but without the 'bulk'. Some will rather add some dollars and get an S4.  -FEATURES: it does not have air view, but it does have an IR blast that allows you to control all your old and new TV's, DVD players, Home Theaters, and A/C! it's a great feature, works from 7 meters away, and does not require to enter codes or anything; just select the brand and go!MY ADVICE: if you like taking pictures/recording video and dual-core is fine for you (or you don't know/care about cores), go to a real store and have a look and feel of the S4 Zoom on your own hands. Tell the salesperson you'll not run away, then put it on your pocket: if you find it too uncomfortable, think twice. If you find it just a little uncomfortable, go ahead and buy one on Amazon!", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth", "Author": "xesus", "ReviewID": "R3TT794JRUKP4E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the price - total garbage. Thick, small screen, touchwiz samsung UI, HEAVY. I was ready to accept these if camera was good, but it is NOT!!! I compared it to galaxy S4 and they were very very comparable, nexus 5 actually did much better job in low light, even though zoom has OIS. Just get nokia 808 or 1020 for camera or even better DSLR. This is a brick not worth carrying in your pocket.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it, useful function and picture quality", "Author": "DIT Group 2014", "ReviewID": "RKF8H6ZZ0K0DG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good social camera , but Heavy thick phoneNot every one will like it, because of the size, I will buy  nokia 1020 if it is androisd", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$405.00", "Features": "GENERAL\t2G Network\tGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 - all versions 3G Network\tHSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 - all versions\nDISPLAY\tType\tSuper AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors Size\t540 x 960 pixels, 4.3 inches (~256 ppi pixel density) Multitouch\tYes Protection\tCorning Gorilla Glass 3\nWLAN\tWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct, DLNA, Wi-Fi hotspot Bluetooth\tYes, v4.0 with A2DP, LE NFC\tYes Infrared port\tYes USB\tYes, microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB On-the-go\nCAMERA\tPrimary\t16 MP, autofocus, Xenon flash, check quality Features\t1/2.33'' sensor size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face and smile detection, 10x optical zoom (24-240mm), optical image stabilization, HDR, panorama Video\tYes, 1080p@30fps, check quality Secondary\tYes, 1.9 MP\nFEATURES\tOS\tAndroid OS, v4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) Chipset\tPega-Dual +XMM6262 CPU\tDual-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU\tMali-400", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom C101, Factory Unlocked Android SmartPhone - International Version, No Warranty (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41isZXfzvDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EIA7O84"}}
