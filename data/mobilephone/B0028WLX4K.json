Good user interface.Its fast and easy2. Supports Wifi and 3G3. Has touch key pad (not physical) in both landscape and potrait mode.4. Supports java applications/games5. Good camera6. For that price ,you wont find a lot of phones giving these features.7. Good sound capabilityCon :1. LG has a app store, but this phone is conisdered as a non us phone. So people who buy it in US will not be able to make use of online LG app store. (This phone works perfectly fine whether you are US or not- its just the online site which we cant take advantage of)2. Camera tough impressive in day light ,not really good for dim light, inspite of 8 MP and flash.3. GPS is assisted GPS ,so you need wifi or 3g to use its GPS properly.Its a good phone if you dont want to spent a lot of money on iphone.All we need basically is available in this phone like Internet,music,photo etc etc.It a good valu for money and happy with this. one more thing its sleek and cool from style perspective.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst phone I have ever had", "Author": "Mr. R.

The phone functionality is working fine, from previous phones, this viewty is quite nice, intelligent and the touch screen features makes and made my life a lot easier.  I am disappointed with LG's User Guide, still missing instructions in how to do things, but the worst part is that I called LG to get more details on the usage and did not receive any support because this LG GC900 is an international phone.  LG convenience with limited commitment to the customer is to sell this phone in the U.S., receives US dollars, but as far as support you are on your own.  LG really sucks.My second disappointment was with the reseller N1 Wireless, at first the price was excellent and unbeatable, 2 days after ordering my phone, the price was reduced by $25.00.  I called to receive the discounted price based on their price guarantee policy, but I was told that I would not  received the $25.00, but only $5.00 discount.  No reasons, even after I read their own price guarantee policy.  My phone had not left their warehouse, but it didn't matter.  So the bottom line is a nice phone, no support from LG and a reseller who does not guarantee their own price policy.  This reseller was recommended by Amazon.com", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "GOOD CAMERA, REGULAR SMARTPHONE", "Author": "Humberto", "ReviewID": "R13TPPJ0UZT7TA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I expected more of this product.
