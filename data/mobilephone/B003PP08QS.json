It worked ok for a few days, but then the buttons would become very slow (about 3 seconds between button pressed and screen feedback). The only fix was to remove the battery to reboot it. Then this \"lock up\" started occurring every few hours. A hard reset did not fix it.An google search showed that this was a common problem. The Palm site didn't have any useful info. The phone was running the latest Verizon software (1.05a). I ended up returning it.Stay away from this phone.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "These phones are beat up!", "Author": "jen gallier", "ReviewID": "R2MBJOSHZ9CEJZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WARNINGPalm Treo 650 CDMA Camera PDA Smart phone Cell I ordered 2 of these they said they were mint in fact both were all beat up.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Value/Good Service", "Author": "nance", "ReviewID": "R1DFQE69LS3V9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item comes w/power wall charger only.

For the average person, who needs internet on their phone!! what a waste of money...Another fleecing of America by these large multi million or billion dollar companies..If you have a data account the phone looked great, I dont know how it works, but I would be willing to try it if I had data on my verizon plan. I returned the phone. The service on receiving this phone and returning it was great the overall experience with amazon and recelluartoo was exceptional. ps any users out there buying contracts with any cell phone companies it is a waste of money.  Just buy a new or used phone out right and you can decide how you want your account and if times get hard you can cancel without any fees.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "BAD BUISNESS", "Author": "prophettess", "ReviewID": "R3GQUK3FW62NIE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO RECEIVE MY PDA TREO EVER SINCE JUNE 16 THEY MAILED IT OFF.

I FEEL LIKE IF THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL COMPANY THAT SALES USED REFURBISHED PHONES, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST MAKE SURE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ON POINT BY SHIPPING THE PACKAGE FEDEX OR UPS. THATS JUST BEING CHEAP. I WAS EXPECTING IT TO COME TO MY DOOR ANYWAY. I PAID SHIPPING A ND HANDLING. I HATE THAT AMAZON HAS THIS COMPANY RECELLULAR LISTED ON THEIR LIST, I SHOULD  HAVE WENT THROUGH AMAZON DIRECTLY, BUT I ALSO ACCIDENTALLY ORDERED A PHONE AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WAS A PHONE AND IT WAS A ACCESORY KEYBOARD.
