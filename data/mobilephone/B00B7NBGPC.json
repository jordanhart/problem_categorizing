{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A fine phone for the price.", "Author": "Yehuda", "ReviewID": "R3H1CKEL9RHXE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Listen, you are looking at this because you want an unlocked, unblocked, carrierless, pentaband phone with decent specs that looks respectable. This phone is fast, screen is decent, and Blu gives it the old college try in terms of trying to present a professional package. The battery life is ok and the cam is about what you would expect, ie just so so.Now it does have its quirks, the occasional awkward translations, tinny ear piece, flimsy back cover and the occasional bug- like no predictive dictionary with the android keyboard (switch to swype and all is good). GPS also took me a long time to find a lock. Perhaps that was just for the first time. In general, though, it runs extremely smooth. If you don't like the BLU theme you can easily change it to stock ICS theme. It has a T9 dialer and tethers out of the box.You can always spend just another $100 and get something better (ie Nexus 4). If you are on a budget however, especially if spending another $100 GETS you to this price point, this phone is a fine pick (never mind that its the only pick as of now). Keep in mind that there are no cases or skins for this phone yet. Blu does give you a complimentary screen protector made for the phone.On a side note, its very annoying to research a phone and see low scores because of a problem with the seller, ie someone didnt get the screen protector, or it was opened. While that's important to know, we all come here for reviews of the product.UPDATE: It seems that Blu re-badges China phones, which is good to know if looking for accessories, roms, etc. In this case the Quattro 4.5 is otherwise know as the \"K-Touch v9\" I was able to order a case and screen protector from a seller on the web. As always google is your friend.UPDATE 2: This phone shipped with a bug that will eventually cause it to run low on storage no matter how many programs you install or remove. Please see Anthony Asher's great site \"BLU Products Development Team\" in the guides section. Scroll towards almost the bottom and look for \"GPS PATCH/MEMORY HOG FIX:\" You will need root.Also: By now, BLU has been exposed for what they really are. A non company, with zero support and integrity (in terms of their promises). They basically just re-badge China phones, put together a package that looks nice, and talk the good PR talk. It looks like you are getting a phone from a real phone company that has a tech and support staff, but its all vapor. No one to talk to, no promised 4.1 update, no bug fixes, no communication. They just go onto the next model and don't look back. There is a place for cheapo China phones- just realize what you are getting into. Imagine that there is no such company as BLU and that you are buying an import phone with no support, relying on (hopefully) a community to help out, and you're good to go. As for this model, it served it's purpose, but now there are better, cheaper alternatives.

Pro Tip: switch your keyboard to swype and turn off spell check in your language settings.-If you're like me and have rooted everything you can get your grubby paws on you will be in for a little work with this phone. there is little to no community support for this phone so custom roms and recoverys are nowhere to be found. rooting is still possible so you can still get rid of bloatware and tweak more core settings if you are so inclined, but i haven't gotten that far.-there are no cases for this phone that i have found as of yet, so if you are a dropper keep that in mind.-if you record a lot of video keep it on 720p. there is a 1080p option but it is fairly useless until the aforementioned update (hopefully) fixes that.-in full disclosure, this is the third handset i've been sent since the first two did not work properly. First one would not recognize the battery, the second had a \"dead spot\" in the digitizer that spanned the width of the screen. fortunately third time is the charm and amazon has been amazing through the whole issue. so if you don't want to deal with chance of a minute hassle...Pros:-cheap-works on all gsm service providers data networks-solid performanceCons:-limited comunity and company suport-no protective cases available-1080p does not work well enough to be listed as a feature.hope this helps.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable in the price range!", "Author": "j21blackjack", "ReviewID": "R1FT5RAW443TJT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, I'm coming from a MyTouch 4G that is 2 years old, and is still one of the best phones on the market today. That being said, the Quattro 4.5 is an amazing phone for $229. This thing is blazing fast and has a big vibrant screen. It comes with a screen protector custom cut for it, but it has a slightly sticky surface to it that some may not like. I'd say the phone is just slightlyi faster than my MT4G, but the MT4G is overclocked to 1.5GHz, and the Quattro is stock. I can't stand when phones are pre-loaded with crap, so luckily this phone is very easy to root. I used bin4ry root mentioned in another review. The newest version (v25) will NOT work. It will send your phone into continuous boot looping. I ended up using an old version (v15) simply because it was easy to find a download for it. When your phone asks for an encryption password, just type something into the top box and leave the bottom one blank. After rooting you can use Titanium Backup from the market to uninstall any of the pre-installed junk you want. Keep in mind, bin4ry will reboot your phone a few times before it's done. I strongly encourage anyone attempting to root this phone to read over the bin4ry thread on the xda-developers forum and fully understand what you are doing first.One other thing, if you find yourself in a bootloop, it's ok. You just need to do a factory reset, and the Quattro has a built in recovery. Just hold volume up and power at the same time. As soon as the screen turns green and the first line appears at the top, release the power button. Keep holding the volume up button until you reach the recovery screen. It may take a couple of tries since the timing of the power button matters, but it's easy enough once you figure out how to do it.So far everything is great with this phone and I'm already planning on buying a second one for my wife. I do believe this is the only Blu phone that will work on Tmobile's 3G network since it's the only one that has 1700 MHz and 2100 MHz support for WDCMA mode. I'll update in a few months.EDIT:I discovered today that the phone uses a small 2GB partition to store data that is normally kept on an external sd card. In setting/storage there is an option to switch storage to an external sd card. The phone will automatically move everything over for you. I highly recommend this if you take a lot of pictures and video.Final edit:Sent the phone back, terrible echo issues that could not be fixed. I found many people online with the same issue. It seems to be hit or miss, but not worth the hassle in my opinion to get a good one. There are perfectly working phones out there for less money with more support and better performance.

I wanted an unlock smart phone (android) and this is the cheapest I found. The Nvidia tegra 3 cought my eye because I like Nvidia video cards.I went to T-Mobile and activation was a breeze.The phone could really use better instructions though. I wanted to put the battery in it so I looked at the manual and it just said \"install battery\". It took me a few minutes to figure that I just had to pop the back cover off.The \"Luncher\" already crashed once and now that I have it activated I dial my voice mail number and the screen keeps going black. I can hear the sound but it says to press 1 for this and 2 for that and for the life of me I can't get the silly screen back on. I ended up pressing the power button for like 15 seconds and it seems to turn off then on. This happened like three times. Hopefully it will be something I'm doing wrong...I'm new at this.Amazon had to send me another phone because the seals were broken on the first. The seal on the box clearly says: Do not accept if seal is broken. The second had one seal broken the other was good. It looked hard that one could open the box with one seal broken so I didn't say anything. The three star in the review have nothing to do with this. That reflect the product only.As long as I can make phone calls and the screen stays on I'll be ok. I'll update here if I have to send it back. I have no idea how good/bad BLU tech support is yet because I have not had any dealings with them.I can get online through Wi-Fi. Setup was really easy. I downloaded Pandora and it plays fine. These smart phone are really cool toys. I can see why people are so glued to them. The picture camera is fine. The video recording at 720 is very nice as well. You can record at 1080 but move really slow or you'll see the frames skip. It also takes panorama pictures. BTW you can also record at 480. You can also reduce the size of the picture camera file size.There is no hardware FM radio on it like it is reported on some web sites.Take care.UPDATE 5/21/2013: Well, I'm getting a replacement because the screen going black was not something that can be fixed with a setting. Blue tech support replied to me with an RMA. It is not actually BLU but a distributor in Miami. I rather return it to Amazon, which I'm doing. I hope this one comes with the seals intact and works because I'm getting tired of doing this. I'm not changing the star rating I gave the product because I don't know if the product was damage during shipping (there was no padding in the box) or it was actually defective.UPDATE 5/23/2013: I got the new phone and it works fine so far. I wanted to mention that before I sent the other one back I did a \"Factory reset\". I thought it would just erase data and settings. I got a nice surprise when the screen wallpaper changed to a nice view of a beach. That was not the wallpaper that it had when I first got it. So, I reset the new one before I used it to get the nice beach wallpaper and it did. I hope I didn't loose anything major. I probably won't know since I'm new to this anyway :-).Take care.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone with a great price tag", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R2DA7SVJTNOL5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Rather than regurgitate what others have said as far as good and bad about this phone, I thought I would write a review about my actual experience with this phone during the first few days I've owned it, and support or rebuff what others have said.  Here's what I've found for myself using this phone:The setup is easy.  Yes, the directions leave a lot to be desired, but if you're familiar with Android phones, this one operates pretty much the same as any phone running ICS.  It arrived undamaged and un-tampered with, so I can't speak to those saying theirs arrived opened, used, etc.  I slid my AT&T; sim card in, turned it on, and immediately began texting, calling, and using the web.  No problems whatsoever in that regard.  I did switch it back to the ICS theme, as the BLU theme was a bit spartan.  It does not speak English very well when it comes to spell checking your texts.  I downloaded a supplemental English dictionary through the phone itself, not hard, turned off spell check, and switched it to Swype.  I hate Swype, but you can still type normally without having to use the Swype feature, and the auto insert of the words is so far flawless.  Not much inconvenience based on the price paid for it.The screen and performance are more than I expected for the price.  The AnTuTu score puts it up there with the Galaxy SII, but that's the phone I had that this one replaced.  This phone is faster and performs better than my SII at every turn.  The quad core processor is a beast, and is extremely fast.  It is a bit of a battery hog, but I don't have any problem getting all day use out of the phone.  Let's face it, we all charge our cell phones every night.  Why should this one be any different?  The screen looks great.  Not quite the definition of an AMOLED display, but it still looks great, and the price is right.  I have no complaints.  This has kind of a widescreen look when in landscape mode, and Netflix movies play great.Some reviewers have mentioned an echoing issue when talking on this phone.  I have made several calls, and this issue has not manifested itself.  Also, the bluetooth seems to work well, and music plays fine over my F150 stereo, unlike what another reviewer has said.  It's nice and clear and plays loudly enough.  Also, I have Sync on my Ford, and the software recognizes the phone, no problem.  Works well with this feature of my vehicle.All in all, I think this phone is fantastic for what it costs, and it outperforms my SII.  The build quality feels solid, and I don't really see any issues with shoddy workmanship.  Seems like a quality product.  I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a fast, unlocked, strong performer that fits the bill for most use.  A-ok product in my book.****UPDATE 06/09/2013****I have found one chink in the armor for this phone.  I use AT&T; as my carrier for this phone.  Not a prepaid or anything like that.  Just a standard contract plan.  I tried sending picture messages over the weekend, and was unable to do so.  I could receive them just fine.  I just couldn't send them, no matter what I tried.  I called AT&T;, and they walked me through the APN settings, and even after all of that, I still couldn't send them.  We found that there was a problem with the MMS software in the phone, and there was no fix for it other than contacting the manufacturer.  I am the kind of person who won't take \"no\" for an answer, so I researched this, and downloaded a different SMS/MMS app called GoSMSPro.  Installed this, and set my messaging to use this app by default.  Voila! Success!  Now everything works like its supposed to.  So, if you have this problem with the phone, simply download a different SMS/MMS app than what the phone comes with by default, and you will have no more problems.

I was weary of them due to the fact that both came with the box seals broken. Upon inspection, I can't find any reason not to keep them.It has 4GB of storage but BLU divided it into two partitions. The phone partition (internal) is .98GB and the USB partition is 1.63GB. The rest must be reserved for the system files? I haven't found how to move the installed apps to the SD card like I could on my old phone. By default, you can only move it from the phone to the USB storage. When you connect the phone into the computer, it gives you access to the USB partition (as a Removable Disk) and your SD card.The box comes with the phone, two screen protectors, USB cord, charger, cleaning cloth, earphones, and instructions (which are sparse).

I'm going to see if I can find one that I can modify to fit this phone and will post an update if I find one.Two quick notes: 1. The SIM card has a slide out tray. You have to slide it towards the bottom to open it. It took me awhile to figure it out. There is no locking mechanism on it. It's just hard to slide. 2. There is a film cover on the camera lens on the back.

It was great to see that the return was painless after all those months, and now I have a different phone. Major problems: running out of space with GPS on, inconsistent GPS signal. Another issue was that Blu is not transparent that it is a cheap Chinese phone of some generic brand, with Blue having no resources to address issues with the phone.

The first indication things were not quite OK was that the \"don't accept if seals are broken\" seals on the box were, indeed, broken.

Looks like the fluid from the screen is leaking inside the glass.  Just happened when I was playing a game.  Not sure what's going on but I have to return the phone again :( :(I had to return the first phone I received due to a terrible echo issue.  When I would talk to someone on the phone they would hear an echo of everything they were saying.  Most likely this wasa faulty second microphone (which is located right by the earpiece).  I ordered a new one and returned the old one with no issues.  When the new one arrived I made some test calls and there is no echo present as of yet. So all is possibly fixed :)Phone ReviewI'm currently using the phone with Straight Talk.  Therefore, I am using T-Mobile's Network.  I can get 3G and 4G with the phone and download and upload speed is pretty darn fast but it isn't the 21 mbps that I believe it says it should get, but it does the trick.  The phone is mighty powerful.  I have had no issues with not being able to run games, apps, etc.  I do game programming and I have a game I'm working on that I haven't optimized yet which stresses the phone with object creation. This phone does not even hint that it is struggling. It is fast, no lag, no nothing :)  I was having another issue with the other one I returned of not wanting to charge unless I turned the phone off and then back on.  This one doesn't seem to have that issue.Annoying things about the phoneI'm not sure if its just the OS but there is no Restart option, you have to turn the phone off then back on.  The SIM card slot and SD card are under the battery so its annoying to get to them and the SIM card slot tray is a terrible design.  Power and volume buttons are sketchy, when you hook the phone up to external speakers it does not project sound very loudly.ConclusionFast, cheap, pretty much compatible with any carrier.

I really want my money back; should have just got the Nexus 4 in the first place.I have had this phone for a few months now. Long enough for the \"NEW SHINY\" fascination to wear off.In all honesty, its a mixed bag. I purchased this phone because of the 5band 3g ability. To be able to use T-Mobile system in their service areas, and still have 3g capability overseas, or in Alaska as well. (T-Mobile has a unique set of frequencies for their 3G service.)LOVE, the processor and speed...haven't found anything it lags on.Like a lot, the screen. The display is crisp, and clear; however, it is angle sensitive when viewed in landscape mode, like for watching movies.Call quality seems to be good, although,the reception seems to get \"weird\" anytime its below an indicated 50% battery. I have run this with no power control apps, and with power saver apps...it doesn't seem to make a difference. I am guessing that it is going into a internal power saving mode...but, it is inconsistent in this.Packaged headphones where actually a nice surprise. Don't expect top of the line, but your most likely wont need to run out and get something to replace them the same day either....The GPS system works good, seems pretty accurate, but is very slow to acquire a lock. Once it gets the lock, all is good however.For those techno geeks out there...its a good platform to play with, as it has developer friendly options, and is rooted already.Little things that a bit annoying, but easily remedied: Keyboard does not have a built in dictionary/spell checker. Download one from Google Play.The brightness on of the screen, in my opinion, does not have enough range.This does appear to be a pretty TOUGH phone. It goes with me everywhere, and, I admit, I have dropped it a few times. The back cover does not pop off, and no major scratches or bangs seem to show up.My other gripe, and this is probably do to BLU being a new, pretty much unknown company so far: The technical support seems to be lacking. They seem to be so busy rolling out new products, that they forget some of the slightly older ones. They dont seem to know if they are going to do an update to JellyBean (Android 4.1+)Last thing, the Camera, takes decent pictures, although, not great...and the built in software zoom, is not up to the job, so I would recommend trying a different camera app.Update: After some back and forth with BLU customer service, I am going to DOWNGRADE to 3 Star rating. This is primarily based on when I asked them about updates, and accessories for the the phone, I got the politician shuffle. I was told that they have no plans to update, or make available an update to 4.1+ Jellybean, as it would detract from the experience (???). And when asked about accessories, \"As far as accessories go, we are currently working on acquiring a reseller for cases, screen protectors, and other accessories.\" Really, this phone is coming up on a year in the market now...and still no accessories. As someone else noted, this phone is AKA K-Touch v9.As for the memory, and storage issue, they did address this...although, this procedure is not shown in ANY of the literature I received, nor on their website (WORTHLESS). TO make the installed SD card the primary storage area, do this...Menu> Settings> Storage> Storage Location> Select Storage Location> Select \"External Storage Card\"> Switch To External Card.I would recommend doing this FIRST, before installing any new apps or whatever.Again, the Phone itself seems just fine, just dont expect any kind a support for it, like you get from the big makers.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "good value phone", "Author": "Joseph m.", "ReviewID": "R2CAKBS7MP4OVD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good phone, should be updateable to jelly bean but blu in no hurry to do it aparentally.

No issues as far as data and general apps-On the T-Mobile prepaid plan its doing 10mbps down/3mbps up consistently, just what you expect from hspa+ 3G/3.5G/4G whatever you want to call it.Big issue for me though is Battery drains way too fast for my liking and is not compatible with Google Play Movies Out of the box. all other basic google apps work fine-but apparently this phone is non google certified which leads to some DRM issue on Google PLay Movies.  Only way to fix it is by rooting-I think that is ridiculous for a basic app part of the google suite.The Screen is fairly nice qHD, but seems somewhat bright AND washed out at the same time. the phone is quite thin and light-maybe a little TOO much for my liking.

However, it had too many flaws.First and foremost, mine suffered from that terrible echoing many others have complained about.  On my end, it sounded fine.  The problem is with the person your calling.  THEY hear themselves echoing.  I had to deal with many frustrated friends and family members the short time I tried this phone out.Signal quality was terrible too.  Now I am using a new plan so I can't directly compare with my previous phone, but I will say I frequently see the phone drop from 3G to H+ or lower with lots of fluctuation.  While the call quality was usually pretty good, I noticed the past few days seem to be getting progressively worse.  The audio is much more muffled and calls are cutting out or dropping completely.Battery life was the last and final straw.  This phone struggles lasting a day with moderate use.  I pull it off the charger when I leave for work around 3:00am, use it off and on throughout the day (chatting, surfing, a few phone calls) and I'm lucky if it's above 15% when I arrive home at 2:00am.  I have not gamed on it and I have kept a close eye on battery usage, closing any programs/processes that weren't being used or were drawing a substantial amount of battery power.Quirks aside, the screen is very nice as well as the primary camera.

A similar unit will cost twice as much if it displayed a familiar brand.  This unit worked right out of box.  The housing for the SIM and the MSDCard very nicely done, although frequent replacement of either one is not all that easy. The phone portion works fine even in low-signal areas.  The sound is very good for the sender and the receiver.  The sound of music player is also very good - for a small unit.  The screen is very responsive to the touch, and the unit responds to the command swiftly, thanks to the generous processing power.  The unit handles all normal operations, such as downloading and processing, very quickly; although it is probably no more than 30% faster than a single-core unit.The camera is very good, although the settings are very basic. For example, it does not have a save-to-disk feature.  The generous memory, and the very powerful processor, breeze through videos and animated-graphic content very nicely.  Video-gaming is probably the place that the processor really shines.The gyro component of this unit is a bit slow, and so when the unit is rotated, there is a one-second pause before the screen contents rotate.  A major negative of this unit is that the screen is a bit too dim, and has low-sharpness and low-contrast.  Maps, and other high-density screens, appear washed-out, and lack detail.  For this reason, I will have to send the phone back, although I give it three stars for its positive aspects.

Another problem with not being able to root it is that I can't put Google Music's storage on the SD card, which means I'm stuck with internal storage.  Pushing the power button to wake up the phone is slow enough to be annoying and sometimes it seems like I've pushed it but it doesn't respond.After using this for a month I've discovered one solution, thanks to Yehuda's comment, and some more problems. Switching to the SD card from internal storage does make Google Music use the SD card for storage. However, after that switch I cannot play music from the SD card via my car's USB port. Playing via Bluetooth works poorly. The audio drop out often enough to be very annoying. I've only used my phone for directions twice since I've had it, but one of those times I almost missed turns due to it cutting out while giving the voice directions.I've also noticed that compared to my iPhone 4S and Nokia N8 it drains the battery much more quickly when the cell signal is weak and has worse reception.

The camera has horrible lag time between hitting the shutter button and taking the picture. Possibly the worst of all is the mic, there is a LOUD pop when it first starts recording audio either thru the audio recording app or when recording video but thats not all folks If the ear dum shattering pop was not enough there is a loud whine to acompany the entirety of what ever you record that makes up abou 65% of the ambient sound.
