Because I do a lot of texting, the keyboard was a must for me. However, this phone lasted me 2 months at the most before it went haywire on me. It started by turning on and off on its own. I called LG about the issue, and they had me send the phone back. I was without my Verizon service for at least a week and got the phone back. Looking at what they did, the sheet said they replaced the chipset in the phone. After starting to use the phone again, it started its shutdown and startup process again automatically. I called LG AGAIN and they wanted me to send it back AGAIN! What a joke! If they can't fix it the first time around, I'm certainly not sending it back for the second time to be without service for another week (or more).I DO NOT recommend this phone!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall, great!", "Author": "KJ \"KJ\"", "ReviewID": "RQHH0STEZP6KI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only thing I am finding has to do with the buttons on the 'keyboard'--they are slick--hard to keep my fingers on.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!!", "Author": "Read For Life \"Kim\"", "ReviewID": "R3R9W1TTVPSLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm visiually impaired and this phone is awesome 4 me.  I esp like it bc it has alot of settings u can change.  SOME r: font size, font style, clock format, brightness and theme, and backlight time (to name a few).  It is compact and I love the keyboard--for texting.  Plus, they sell many covers (for protection) for it on Amazon for $2 to $5 (very reasonable).  I hope they make a newer model 4 this phone in a year or so bc I will certainly buy it.

I was trying to replace a smart phone bill $45 A MONTH with Verizon with a regular phone $9.99 to avoid the $300 penalty for early cancellation.  This phone was not acceptable for Verizon and I still had to purchase a phone at full price from Verizon, anyway. I feel I was snookered by Verizon, not the Amazon vendor.  Now, I am deeper into this expensive money saving scheme.My service wth Amazon was wonderful, everything was fine with the vendor.  I am rating them high because it was not their fault that I am so ignorant.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wireless LG Cosmos Prepaid", "Author": "Meriread Bookmad", "ReviewID": "R1NX72UKT3M7G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am still learning about it, but it does well what I wanted it for.
