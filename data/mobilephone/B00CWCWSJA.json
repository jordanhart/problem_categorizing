Then I also purchased iOcean X7. I was surprised to learn that many Chinese smartphones have GPS problems, including iOcean X7. It took me a whole week to try to fix X7's GPS issues (tweaking AGPS, EPO, gps.conf, adding an external GPS antenna etc.) but to no avail. Then I learned that I have taken Zopo C2's high quality for granted. This smartphone's GPS worked right out of the box. I returned my iOcean X7 and bought another Zopo C2 (1.5GHz, 2GB RAM, 32GB ROM). To my pleasant surprise, this newer version of C2 is even better than my old Zopo C2. The video/picture qualities have improved significantly (beautiful vivid pictures even in low light) and the GPS worked even better (took less than 30s to fix right out of the box) than the previous C2 versions.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT! BEAUTIFUL! but... HATE LAGGY TRANSITIONS!", "Author": "gabriela gonzalez", "ReviewID": "RO71QOEIYAEII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "l love the phone.. beautiful screen, nice feel, great 13mp camera. for the price is a great deal. i bought mine used.. and it came with a broken camera flash.. but you know. used will never be like a brand new phone.the screen is very responsive.. no ghost touches or any weird stuff. beautiful and crystal clear images at the right color. the screen it's not overcharged with colors like AMOLED.Construction. feels very nice. the back cover it's dificult to snap in sometimes, but it gives a strong feel. volume and power buttons are OK. sometimes i feel like power button is going to get stuck,, just doesnt click nicely but you'll get used to it. the silver line across the phone makes it look nice, it IS plastic and the silver paint comes off easly with use, specially in the volume and power buttons. they'll turn black with time. the menu, home and back buttons are very responsive. but they don't light up as much as other phones.i really like the led light that has at the left of the front camera... it turns red, blue and green.user experience:feels pretty good. BUT! Here's the huge con (for me). the stock 4.1.2 zopo ROM that came with. SUUUUUUCKSSSSSS.plagued of lags and wierd unuseful stuff. developer options are incomplete in ALL ROMs,. you'll have to download a third party app. i'll explain why later.then updated to 4.2.2 zopo ROM.. SUUUUUUCKS Again. less than 4.1.2 but sucks.the best ROM i've found out for this phone is Marsapa V15.the thing i REALLY HATE. of this phone.TRANSITIONS!.@#$%^&*(). it runs smooth apps. but when it comes to IN-APP. APP-TO-APP. transitions. or any kind. it turns laggy as hell. and with 1 gb of ram that shouldn't be happen that often. And you don't want to open the app switcher (multitasking). get's so damn laggy. IN ALL ROMS It pisses me off. so i had to download a third party app called developer tools on google play because developer settings had a bunch of missing options. like disabling app transitions!.so i disabeled app transitions. it turn better.. but i had to kill those cool transitions :cBUT, the app switcher stills very laggy. no way to fix it.. i surrender..this phone for gaming? So so.. doesn't have low FPS on dead trigger 2. a new game that requieres a lot of processing.of course.. i can't play it in high settings because of the ram. and if you minimize the game for like 10 seconds. it'll close the app due to ram.so.. for heavy graphics demanding games. is not recomended.. but for casual games like where's my water, angry birds and that wierd stuff.. perftect!web browsing. Perfect!youtubing perfect!CAMERA!beautiful shots. but in indoors condition looses all the quality. the auto effects turn it laggy. that happens with all cellphones.. al depends of the lightning conditions.FRONT CAMERA! The same as the back one. 5mp front camera is perfect for snapchat!. you can even focus the front camera like the back one.. at least in snapchat.woot. forgot something. with some AC chargers. as soon as you plug em' the phone drops the signal! but only AC chargers,. if you connect usb to Ac adapter doesnt happen., don't know why.the root.. is as simple as one click  after you have the drivers intalled. for those who like to change roms every week! or every few days, there's just a few roms there out there.. we need a cyanogenmod that fix us transitions -_-the rear speaker. for hearing music. sucks. but it is very loud for incoming calls!the front speaker (for calls) sounds pretty good.fm radio is pretty cool! lol.i really love the phone, the design, the camera, that screen! but.... HATE THOSE TRANSITIONS! -_-*i see that the price rised 40 usd.. when i wanted to buy it was at 239.99 usd.. and bought it used for 185.. the camera came broken so got 25 back. (really loved the phone didn't wanted to send it back) so 160 usd? for quadcore 1080p phone?? AWSOME DEAL!!
