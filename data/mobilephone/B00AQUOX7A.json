{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Product", "Author": "KJ Steve", "ReviewID": "R33WJHCMMCB4ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third cellphone/watch. I have rated this at a five star, something I find hard to do with any product. The watch is constructed very well and has weight to it. It functions exceed my expectations, Now lets look at some negatives. The watch band is very well constructed and comes at a very large size. I am a 198lb man and I needed to remove two links and still have a bit of a loose fit. The manual for the watch is in English and yes the directions as well although all Chinese to the person trying to understand it. Unless you have experience with other digital watches you will need help and patience to get set up and going. When you do finally get going you will find this product to be all it says it is. Overall this is certainly a product worthy of five stars. We use this on the ARRP Consumer Cellular service provider for retired people and the Tmobile service provider with no problems.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite Watch-Phone yet", "Author": "Jon \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R1YIWA5442TLX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased several models of watch phones over the past two years or so.  The OS on the TW810 is familiar if you've owned a SVP G13 watch.  However, this model has a much improved display.  The camera is facing you (not away from you) on this watch, I personally prefer that the camera would be outward facing.  Although, that is my only complaint.  Adjusting the watch band is a little difficult but not bad (plenty of youtube videos that can show you how if needed).  I've been using it for 2 months now and love all the functionality.  The bluetooth range is outstanding compares to other watches I've had.  I have some external BT speakers that could be heard from about 40 ft. away (outside) with the TW810 as the audio source.  Great watch all around.  Face the camera forward in a future model and I'll upgrade to that version, otherwise I'll stick with the TW810.  Looks great, fantastic functionality and best all-around phone watch for the money.  Everyone I show it to wants one.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "TW810 Watch Phone camera GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz.", "Author": "Legba", "ReviewID": "R1XCEJW6KK6V4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TW810 watch, camera and cell phone is well-built. I bought it because the seller claims the watch is waterproof but I never verify its impermeability. Thus, I cannot rate its impermeability.The TW810 watch's band is somewhat loose because it is designed to allow rapid maneuver of the watch in case you need to answer or place a call etc. The watch band is not interchangeable or compatible with standard watchbands in the market. Despite of this minor inconvenience, I  give a 5 stars to this camera work\u2642\u2640ship.The TW810 watch is relatively pricey like most novelties. It has many features, some of the features I never bother to use like most people do. Since those features are programmed, It would save the end users some monies if they were able to pick the features wanted a la carte. The TW810 battery has relatively a short life. I suspect that it has too many features or programs that are running simultaneously. For battery life I will give a 3 stars.The company advertise the TW810 as Intelligent All-steel Waterproof Ultra-Thin Watch Phone, High sensitivity, GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz. This watch is at least 15 millimeter thick with the battery on it. The word ultra-thin is a misrepresentation of the fact.The TW810 sensitivity in terms of receiving signals +/- 8 feet below ground is quasi inoperative. My last watch telephone MQ998 cost almost half the amount I paid for the TW810, but the MQ998 http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=mq998 pickup more signals underground than the TW810. In terms of ability to receive signal underground I give 1 star to TW810 watch.In the TW810 some of the menus are not too intuitive or explicit in terms of how to turn off the device after you completed a call. Last but not the least, most of the watch-telephones exhibit poor audio reception because the receiving loudspeaker is tiny but they have good microphone that is why your interlocutor is able to hear you well if \u2642\u2640 is using a standard telephone. Audio reception for TW810 deserves 2 Stars.Overall evaluation: The TW810 is a good solid watch and supposed to be waterproof but I don't know if the company means by that water resistant. The TW810 might outlast most the other watches-telephones because of its robust construction but it needs improvement for its loudspeaker, menu instructions and its battery life. In final analysis I give the TW810  3 1/2 stars.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great service", "Author": "Ryan Cummings", "ReviewID": "R3V08ZNZ9ND8IA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because I did not like product because of my own preference the customer service was excellent I received a refund with no hassle they also paid for shipping both ways these people are a great example how a company should treat there customers ....it's a cool watch just to small of a screen \ufffd", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "terrible product", "Author": "melissa wardlaw \"Audible books help pass the ...", "ReviewID": "R3SNRWUAB24NUY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product is terrible don't waste time or money. Its not water proof and it is very cheaply made. Only worth about 25 bucks. I returned it as soon as I got it. This watch is a good gift for a 12 year old kid in school. U will regret buying this item. Only good thing was the next day shipping. I would leave better review if the product was water proof and made decent. But oh well.
