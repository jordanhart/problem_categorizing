Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. Lumia 900 has been succeeded by Nokia Lumia 920.  For someone interested in a first smartphone which doesn't break the purse, Lumia 900 is an excellent choice. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Lumia 900 has 4.3\" (109 mm) 800x480 resolution 217 ppi 16m compared to the Lumia 920 which has a 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 16 GB storage and 512 MB RAM compared to Lumia 920 which has 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  Lumia 900 has 8 MP camera and 720 p video compared to Lumia 920 which has a 8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.4 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor compared to Lumia 920 which has a 1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass  compared to Lumia 920 which has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.As you can see Lumia 920 has, what I would say incremental upgrades over 900 but nothing earth shattering. Lumia 900  as well as 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 1830 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 900 as well as 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.  Lumia 900 has Bluetooth 2.1, whereas  Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Lumia 900 has the diagnostic tool. It can be obtained by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.On this diagnostic tool one can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It's also possible to perform all the tests in one run. This is really cool to have this power at the user's hand!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 900 is certainly the best and cheapest Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market, it was really the best in 2012, but if you don't mind the budget get the 920 or 820 (for microSD card slot).", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "codest", "ReviewID": "R3VO8NQN005B0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone in great condition.

It has everything, the Nokia apps are really great and much more useful than the Microsoft ones.What really disappoints me is what Microsoft has done trying to copy the iOS from iPhone, the WP7 has so much limitations that makes me sad, can't use MP3 files as ringtones (actually you can, but they need to be shorter than 1MB and the album named as \"ringtone\"), you can't use any sound file as message,mail,alert etc except for the original ones. I've always recorded my own ringtones (other basic app that the WP7 DOESN'T have, sound recorder. You need to download some 3rd party recorder app).Not to mention the RIDICULOUS crap that apple did and Microsoft made even worse: You NEED to sync your phone with an specific software to add songs, pictures or videos to it (and that crappy ZUNE software is something that makes you really love to use iTunes). You can't access your phone memory by any means using windows desktop, that means you CAN'T add/copy/remove ANY file from it without using the (crappy) ZUNE software.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful phone, but if you've been a symbian user be ready to wrestle with it ...", "Author": "Texas Butterfly \"NanoCat\"", "ReviewID": "R31R7J8EZS42L8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying, I have been using Nokia Symbian-based phones since they first came on the market, and I was very upset when Nokia dropped Symbian OS for Windows when it offered the Lumia line - WHY, Nokia, WHY????Melodrama aside, even though I was unhappy, I wasn't ready to move to another brand, so grumbling and snarling, I decided to take the plunge and buy a Nokia Lumia 900 when my old E71x started gasping. I'm reviewing the Lumia after having had it for only 48 hours: I got it one evening and almost sent it back the next morning - I was that frustrated - but it has so much potential that I couldn't do it. To some degree I have mixed feelings: it has some cons that try their best to offset its many, many pros, so I've given it a rating of 4 stars.--Pros:I've found that, overall this is a really sweet phone, in spite of its operating system. I say that last, because I have had serious issues migrating from the old Nokia (like, you CAN'T. NOT.AT.ALL.NEVER.). Ah, for the days when one could back up the old Nokia phone and restore to the new one ...If you're used to Windows Mobile or Blackberry OS you'll love this phone out of the box, although it involves a learning curve no matter what. It beats out the iPhone with no problem, in my opinion: it offers a lot more for a lot less money. I had an iPhone for a while, and was, shall we say, 'underwhelmed'.That's not the case for this phone, it can do anything an iPhone can do, and more; and I think it does it much, much better, more reliably. It has some heft - its neither light nor tiny - but it has a metal chassis. Otherwise, it's smooth, sleek, feels good in you hands, and the touch functions have to be experienced to be believed. It is really simple to operate, too.The Lumia 900 has three buttons on the right - okay, four: the volume keys, the on/off button in the middle, and the camera key near the bottom. The home icon also acts as 'back' and 'close'. Get into something you don't like? Hit the Windows 'home' icon. Locking and unlocking the phone originates with the on/off button, and a sliding screen.The high resolution screen produces colors and objects that pop - they are just that crisp and bright. 'Zoom up/Zoom down' are performed using two fingers on the touch screen, and you can view your screen in landscape or portrait orientation. To silence a call, just flip the screen over - flip silence, I think it's called.It has high-end camera optics, and Nokia provides a free app that gives you the ability to take panorama and NICE zoom shots - the camera is almost SLR quality.Nokia provides a free navigational app that's been available on all of its phones the last few years: anywhere you want to go, they can get you there. Mapquest is available as a paid app, and google maps is accessible from the web. My phone can talk to my car (go figure?), so I'm loving Nokia Maps. I need it, because I get lost, a lot.Call quality is consistently clear, sound is free of noise. I don't drop calls, and I live on the Texas coast where cell signal is sometimes non-existent. I wish the volume of the music player was a bit better for use without headphones or speakers, that's the only complaint I have about that.That all said, here are some of the cons:I am not one of those folks puts contacts, etc. online, syncs everything with Outlook, Google, Facebook, and the like, so it was very difficult to even move my contacts. I was able to move them using bluetooth, finally, but even that was a pain. You must download an app to do it, because the lumia won't talk to its Symbian relatives through bluetooth (or anything else) at all without the app. Unfortunately, the app is designed to only move contacts and there are no others.In my experience, this is the first time I've run into a phone that a Symbian OS phone can't communicate with, and that it's from the same manufacturer, is a real shame. I did try to pair them; the Symbian phone thought it was paired, but the Lumia paired, then responded, 'not supported', and closed the connection. A family member has a newer Symbian OS phone than mine, and the Lumia won't talk to that one by bluetooth either.As if this wasn't enough, I found moving my library of .mobi, Kindle, Audible, PDF, Office, and other documents was not fun - I'm still doing it, in fact. That exercise has involved 2- and 3-stage transfers. I've been bluetoothing from the old phone to my PC, then from my PC to my Lumia, then moving them around to where I'd like to have them rather than where Windows wants them.  And forget about migrating EMAILS, text and mms  - the support pages tell you to back it all up on your PC and use the 'appropriate software' to work with them on it. They will never exist on your phone again, gentle Symbian user.I couldn't send texts or messages either for a couple of days: this phone does not have the AT&T; internet settings in it. Normally that isn't a problem: lots of phones ship without the AT&T; access point name (APN) settings, but send text and picture messages with no problems. The Lumia is not one of them, unfortunately. We (AT&T; & I) have gotten it to work, so that's fine now. So, if you get it and need the APN settings, call AT&T; or search 'AT&T; APN settings'.In conclusion, even with the frustrations, I can still say the Nokia Lumia 900 packs a lot of punch for the price. I liked Symbian OS so much that I was sorry to make the switch, but this is a REALLY REALLY NICE consolation prize.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful phone", "Author": "Fairan Barnett", "ReviewID": "R1OT6YZRGC2QU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Call quality, ease of use, screen clarity, responsiveness, syncing: this phone does it all well.

I was excited about the unlocked European Galaxy Note as I love WACOM screens.  My problem is that the Android operating systems on both the Note and the HTC Inspire seems awkward and buggy compared the iOS.  So here I am, 4 months in advance of my subsidized upgrade with AT&T;, trying to determine whether I'll bite on the iPhone 5 or something else.  I read about  Windows Phone with interest, as prior to my first iPhone, I had several different Windows phones with the earlier operating systems. I figured I'd try Windows Phone 7.5 in the no-contract Nokia.PositivesThe phone works very well as a phone - great reception and volume, virtually no dropped callsWindows Phone OS is easy to useSyncs well with our exchange serverScreen is greatOffice appsKindle works wellNokia Drive is very useful, specially the latest version that allows downloaded state mapsMy first LTE phone, and web connectivity is FASTNegativesApps - if by the time my upgrade is available (February), the Starbucks and Sugarsync apps are not available in either 7.5 or 8, it will be a deal-breaker for me.  Those are  \"must-haves\"The voice-command cannot be disabled (at least I haven't found a way to do it).  If windows phone 8 does not have the ability to disable voice command, it will be another deal-breaker. I hate the fact that Apple will not allow you to disable the iPod app, and consequently I cannot have any music on my phone, as it will begin to blare music in meetings and movie theaters, even  when on silent.  At least Apple allows you to disable voice dialing.  I cannot use a blue-tooth headset without a simple physical on-off switch.  It is arrogant of Apple and Microsoft to not allow the disabling of these features.The viability of Nokia.  I hope they are able to survive as they make great phones.Not the fault of the phone, but it was advertised s \"New\", and it arrived with the seal on the box broken.  It looked unused and it has worked flawlessly, but still ..Bottom line for me will be the features and apps available in Windows 8.  From what I've read, apps that are available for Windows 8 on the PC will be easy for developers to port to Windows phone.  If that is the case, I'm optimistic that my must-have apps will be available.
