This one was for my sister and while tested it thoroughly for her this is what I observedThis will get 5 stars all the way for the following reasons:1. Set up was a breeze. I inserted  an AT&T; unlocked simcard and within a few seconds it registered with the network with an H+(HSPDA+)  which is equivalent to 4G.I recommend using with AT&T; for best results.2. The processor speed is fast and browsing and navigation is fun.3. Wifi sets up almost instantly.4. Downloading apps is as easy as in any Samsung high end phone.5. The price tag is unbelievable for a phone of this quality.6. The cover it comes with is very useful and I prefer it over any case. Samsung cases do not fit because the buttons are slightly different and do not align. I tested with some texting and a lot of apps and games without any difficulty.7. MMS is absolutely quick and perfect.8. What it does do is work. It works fine as a phone. Works fine as a text device. Works fine playing apps.9. YouTube works fine, so does facebook etc. The camera works good in well lit situations.10. The GPS works fine.11. The screen display works fine. Video playback is smooth and works well. The clarity is good. I haven't had any screen issues.12. The main camera is fairly good quality and takes fine picture.The front camera is low quality but that is expected.13. Will update again in 30 days if there are any negatives14. Overall a great phone .Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "R1L7EJYMKRE0YQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to buy a Samsung Galaxy Mega but did not want to spend almost $500 for a phone.  I'm glad I found this one instead! I just received this phone today.  The phone is everything and has everything as in the description.  I have MetroPCS and I could not just insert the sim and be good to go.  I had to call Metro and give them the imei# of this phone.  I was able to call and text immediately.  I  couldn't send or receive mms, check my email, or get on internet though.  I called Metro back and they said it would  take a few hours for the phone to be fully functional.  I waited and everything is working now.  Also, it is a dual sim phone.  If you have to call your carrier to activate it, make sure you give the correct imei.  There are two imei #s.  It will depend on what size sim you have.  You can see your imei # by going to settings, then about phone, and imei information.  The camera is not the best but it will do.  This phone is 3g and it can be slow.  I just turn on my wifi to use.  When I had a question about this phone, I emailed Lightahead and got a fast response.  There is a video on YouTube for this phone, search for \"N9000 demo 1\".  So far everything is good and working well.  This is a good phone at a very good price!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone without paying a fortune", "Author": "Odell Glenn", "ReviewID": "R1D48FDD045CMW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I needed a larger phone without paying a house payment for it. This phone had a great price and is close to the note II in size. The down side to the phone is that its 3G in a 4G world. It is a little slow service wise and won't work on 4G systems. The phone though works good for everyday use. I'm happy with it though it is no HTC. Camera is decent in light but does not take good pics in dark areas even with the flash. Texting with its virtual keys is a chore because the 'v' key keeps activating when you touch the space bar. Other wise I'm going to keep it and enjoy low cost phone fun.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "good phone for a good price!", "Author": "Holly", "ReviewID": "R3D7RI0SRFC806", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the phone its plenty big enough and really easy to use. I was skeptical to buy another phone from LightHead because the first one I ordered was garbage it was a pink one! But I really needed a new phone so I spent hours looking forbade new one and reading the feedback on each one. I came across this one and thought I would try one more time to order from this company and I'm glad I did there is a few issues I had with the phone and that is when I make and receive calls I have to turn the volume up which is not a big deal just wish I didn't have to do it and another thing I use this with straight talk and everything works but my multimedia messaging which is a big deal because I have relatives that live out of town and that's how they see pics of my kids so if anybody has had this same problem and got it fixed please email me at hollyturner172@yahoo.com and help me.other than that its a great phone with many different things you can do.and comes with 2 batteries charger earphones and a very nice case.

WIFI HAS GREAT RANGE! BATTERY GOOD!I LOVE THIS PHONE, CAMERA IS \"OFF\" AND MUST BE IN WELL LIT AREAAfter hours of research i chose to go with the LA900 and i must say i am pleased (we purchased the s4 clone from lightahead and in my opinion the LA900 is far better just for the larger screen and hearty feel to it.my wife an i were sick of our current cell plan and being overcharged. (we are now with family t-mobile) and happy with overall reception and call quality. there are a few pros and cons below. i recommended to anyone who is on a budget and looking for a decent smartphone.pros:while connected to wifi internet flows and streams quicklyjust like any android you can customize / widgets and apps / wallpapersvivid bright large screen with rich vibrant colorsbattery life is excellent +2 batteriessolid feel and nice weight to phonestylus pencases available --fit gt-7100 note 11android 4.2voice calls are clear / texts send receive wellcons:3g can be slow ..cameras could be better and functions better in well lit areas and outside daylight(this is only 140.00 phone though, pay 300-400 if you want a nice camera)no LED notification light ei: missed calls new email/texts)these are small gripes an in my opinion. but could cmon a small led would have been great on front side so i know when i have a text or missed call when phone is on silent.this is not a Samsung Note 11 so while this is a great value in my opinion remember what you are paying for it.thanks and i hope this helps anyone looking into this phone.oh one more thing if you happen to drop and break it or lose it ...or simply want to upgrade in a year you didnt spend 3-400 on itUPDATE! 5-12PHONE STILL WORKS AND FUNCTIONS WELL!

After entering my router's password, BINGO! I can surf the internet! just like my 7\" and 10\" Samsung galaxy tablets (one os my wife's by the way), now this LA900 has a very brightscreen, because it is an Android 4.2.2 (not 4.1 as advertised) it is more advanced than my tablet's Android 4.0 version but more or less the touch/feel is similar if not better, not much learning experience here.The cameras' functions are not as good as I expected but it is good enough for me, since I can download nice pictures to theadditional microSD card taken from my Nikon 24MG lens, this is not a problem, however, I will use the smart phone cameras mainly for emergency purpose, such as during a car accident?It is also very nice you can syn you contact list with your email account so no typing.The playstore is just like any Android based tablet, you can download all free apps.By the way, this newer Android system allows you to change the screen wallpaper with your own photos!Voice call quality and txt message quality are average comparing with my land line (by the way, I use OOMA.com, free for life :)LA900 comes with a 4 GB microSD card, it says it can take upto 32 GB.No manual though, it took me a few days to fulfill my basic needs of the phone, if you are not the type of person who has time and patience then you should choose a different phone with manual.I placed another order of LA900 this morning for my wife, it actually costs $9 less than the one I paid last week!5.3\" screen is nice, not too big, not too small, you can read, play games or view photos just right.Now, my wife and I are over 60 yrs old, just want to keep up paces with all your youngsters who are tech savvy like my kids, cannot imagine 20 years from now what the phone would become but I should be over 80 then, no desire anymore :)Good phone for people with my kind of background who consider him or her a non-sucker type personality, I only paid$40 for my PTEL voice time since last July, I would pay $350 for the same period to the Verizonwireless, the saving is more than enough for me to purchase this LA900, don't you agree?No regret (so far :)", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Hector N.", "ReviewID": "R3J3YHEPBVSZT1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very satisfies on this phone purchase. Got it for my girlfriend's birthday and she loves it! Shipping was fast and received the package faster than expected (they ship form LA) I was debating on the diff phones Lightahead has to offer and went with this one because of the previous reviews and they were right! Very impressive phone. If you are wondering about the size it is big it compares to Galaxy Note II. So try it for size if your not sure about it. The phone comes with a beautiful back cover that's like a charcoal grey (pics coming) and additional one with a \"flap\" that covers the screen. Both work well and look good. It also comes with 2 batteries, house charger thats approx 3 ft cable, earphones with a mic integrated, and a clear screen protector! She has AT&T; and all we did is insert the SIM card and it connected instantly to 3G. It is not micro sim just the regular one. Anyway She has the non flap cover with an Otterbox Defender for galaxy II and it fits, all buttons match and port holes match. All apps on device work fine Maps, YouTube Fb etc. I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a smartphone without the big price tag. She's had the phone a few weeks now and no complaints only the stylus wasn't responding and I emailed the seller and I had a replacement the very next day!  Outstanding customer service!

I am familiar with both Galaxy and iPhone products. I ordered the phone 3/27/14, received on 4/2/14, decided I want to return it 4/4/14 after trying it out at least for a day.- Arrived on time- I thought I'd be happier with a bigger screen, little bigger than an S4, obviously much bigger than a iPhone 5, which is what I went back to after I switched the service. For someone who is 6'5\" and already have big hands, this phone I thought was just too big.- The quality of the screen is ok.- I had already previously purchased a Straight Talk micro sim card (it does use the regular and micro), so I was ready to go.- After swapping over service, doing this via the Straight Talk website, it took a few hours, which is the longest I've had to wait for service to swap over when I've switch phones before.- Service in my area, at least where I leave (not where I work, need to add that note). I live it Ocean Springs, MS, working normally in Mobile, AL and generally work in New Orleans, LA as well. Well the service signal sucked where I live, (AT&T; micro sim card), which previous my iPhone 4 I was only was great on AT&T; service. It does me no good getting little to no service in the area in which I live. I am setting this phone up mind up around 10-12 at night, so I'm trying to give it a chance. The next day I go work in New Orleans, as am driving on the interstate the signal picks up greatly and stays that way all day, 3-4 bars with H+ data speed, but once I got back home to Ocean Springs, it was back to crap.- Data was, in my area I got a big fat \"E\" and nothing more, outside of my area, like I said as I was driving to New Orleans, which is 2 hours west and about 120 miles, about 20 minutes into the drive data speed got much better, H to H+ and that was consistent.- The phone speaker isn't great whatsoever, I had to press my ear up against the phone to hear or use the speakerphone, which wasn't that bad.- Camera quality was subpar, but I expected that and didn't bother me, I knew I was buying a cheaper phone- The phone is considerably heavy, didn't care too much for that.- Battery usage goes pretty quickly, it came with a USB cable that can be plugged into a regular wall adapter, the charge was very very slow, I let it charge at least for 2-3 hours at work and maybe only gained 20 percent (from 40% to 60%). Got home charged the phone with a regular wall cable (not USB) and I'd say it charged pretty quickly.- It did come with a 4GB SD card, I ordered a 16GB SD card with my purchase and swapped them out.- WiFi connectivity was pretty good as well- GPS signal I tested out while I was getting H+ speeds picked up relatively quick and had no issues with it.Overall I was not happy with this phone, it does look nice and runs fairly decently on Jelly Bean 4.2.2, it was too bulky for my, too heavy and signal reception was crappy from where I needed it to be, don't want to go outside every time I need to talk to someone.I am returning this phone as I've already printed out the return shipping label  and will cost be about $9.00 from my refund. And yes I knew what I was getting a cheap phone, but just didn't work out for me. I've been looking at these type phones for the last year and figured Id finally try one out.3 reasons why I am returning the phone:1 - Little to no signal where I live, more specifically in my house, in a place where AT&T; signals are great. I know this as my iPhone I used was a micro SIM Straight Talk card. Basically it does me no good if I cant talk in my own house.2 - Too big and heavy3 - Overall just not happy with the phone!!Any questions, shoot me an email I'd be happy to answer them masta_p1975@yahoo.com", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lightahead makes good product", "Author": "Cal Woodridge", "ReviewID": "R3SAQACGS8HG2Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works well so far.

The sound quality during calls might be a bit tin sounding but works, camera is ok, but was expecting that.  The problem for me came with the messaging feature.  I can text about 1/3 of my contacts normally without issues. the other 2/3  of my contacts in the texting window show up without the area code therefore you texts that are sent wont be recieved!!!
