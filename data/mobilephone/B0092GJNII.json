At first glance the phone seem wonderful until I noticed adhesive glue sticki sticking out of the screen where it had been replaced. Then at the bottom the frame was bend showing the charging connection through the bend and the screen... I immediately messaged them about this... as I see up the phone and turned it on the keyboard went completely crazy. There's a picture in the back ground of my screen that shows off a yellow tint and I can read it as it says in big letters media hub hd and the bottom says gaming in really big letters. Only part of the screentthat's normal is a strip down the right side :( very frustrating at this point I go online using the phone to email them again and it keeps sending me to time format ugh.. then goes back to home screen no matter what I push.. if that isn't bad then it keeps showing bright colors as I glitches as if it is completely water damaged... I'm truly sad as I had my hopes up so high as to replace this phone I love this brand so dearly. And I'm not sure what this means but the phone keeps telling me that a format has been downloaded and updated but there's an error in the format process.. what is that!? Still waiting to hear back from them and hoping I can get a good phone or a refund so that I can get a decent one. :( just hoped they would have tested the product out before sending it off.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE MY SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE i717!", "Author": "Khetasi", "ReviewID": "R19BNYEYXCD079", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Samsung Galaxy Note arrived on time as promised.

Great speed and versatility. Played any and all games, apps, etc. I never had any problems with thus phone whatsoever.I decided one day I wanted more control over the phone, so I rooted it. One thing led to another, now this phone has more glitches than the first android phones.This is aa awesome phone. My only suggestion is that if you are thinking about getting this phone and rooting it, don't. If you are not looking for that, or don't even know what \"root\" is and are looking for a really good phone, this one will be amazing.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Neat phone", "Author": "Quarterpounder", "ReviewID": "R6EPMJO3X4QI6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is just what the wife was looking for.
