{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Basic Phone", "Author": "JuanCholo", "ReviewID": "R19G8KSZBP87BF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This ia a basic cell phone. I only use my phone to make a few calls.  I don't have a data plan and just have a basic prepaid plan. The phone was very easy to use, I charged it for the recommended 24 hours, inserted my sim, mirco sd card and and powered up the phone, was able to make a call with no problems.The user interface which others have complained about is very similar to every other phone I have had in the past uses,it was just a matter of exploring the menu to find the different features, it is pretty much intuitive.  I have had a few people complain about the call quality although I have been able to hear them without any problem, so I assume it is a problem with the microphone on my end.All in all, I am very pleased with the phone and the price.  The over all quality of materials is cheap, but then it is a cheap phone.If you are looking for a high quality phone then buy a higher priced phone.  I did not want to buy a used phone and have to worry about unlocking or passwords and I did not want to be stuck with one provider.  This phone allows me to switch to any GSM provider with out having to buy a new phone and it cost me less than most locked phones would have.The FM radio has been a pleasant surprise and connection to my pc was very easy just plug it in with the supplied USB cable and the driver were loaded automatically.  You can transfer music over to the phone this was as well as picturesBasically if you just need a phone with no frills, this is a good phone for you", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does Its Job. Good for the Price Paid", "Author": "Red Sun", "ReviewID": "R16U5HDGUOAHZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new phone is cheaper than the popular T172 and 174. I think this phone may be better than the older ones.No question that this is a basis phone, for the $22 price tag. Do not expect the Android or iOS here. The phone works just fine. Just get used to it.The phone is very small, light and the battery lasts for a long time. The FM radio performs very well, a surprise to the person carrying the phone. MP3 players works fine too.Then the cons: default language in Spanish (for Mexican market). Had to figure out how to set to the right language. But the biggest complaint I have is the SD card slot. It is right near the core of the phone. There is no way that you can install the SD card into its slot. But I had to squeeze the SD card in anyway. So the metal bracket actually popped out. Now the SD card sits right into its slot, but the metal cover is loose. Surprised to see the SD card just works fine. All is good.This is a basis phone for some simple people and simple tasks. Good for school, overseas travel and seniors.... Also good for anyone who needs to carry a second phone, one for work and one for family.Good buy.Added on 12/10/2013:One observation is that, not everyone needs a smartphone. For the kids in school, I would not give them a smartphone. I can just add $10 to the phone and I do not mind if the phone gets bumped or even lost.....", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simplest to use", "Author": "bhageerath", "ReviewID": "R2YAKYA0PTAPJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is what you choose and what you get. I put in my TMobile and AT&T;, and international SIMs. Works great and is great because I can use two SIM cards at once.

H2O is the best price service out there.  I can have a cell phone for $3.33/month.  I bought an 8GB microSD that gives me an mp3 player and it sounds great with my headphones.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware specs let down by buggy UI and menus that make using the phone an exercise in frustration", "Author": "brh1976", "ReviewID": "R1IRV99OK70H5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Despite the low price and generous feature list, there are some fundamental problems with this phone. The biggest problem is that the UI is terrible and the menus are poorly designed. The manual is virtually non-existent and doesn't explain most functions, even ones that are quite basic. The input button in the middle of the directional keypad doesn't seem to work in most contexts, and the softkeys have to be used (sometimes the button does work, however, which makes using the phone hugely frustrating and an exercise in trial and error). Attempting to input text in the auto-capitalization mode results in all-caps. Reading a text message requires multiple button presses as you navigate the menu. It isn't clear which of the two SIMs text messages are associated with. The phone can only store 50 text messages. Attempting to use the key-guard feature to prevent butt-dialing results in the message \"Press Unlock and then * key\": the phone does not have an \"Unlock\" button, however, and no key combination can be used to unlock it, so you must reboot. Attempting to use the password feature to lock your phone will only protect your phone if you turn it off: the password prompt only appears when you reboot, and not when you wake it from standby.Pros:- both SIM cards and both networks can be active at the same time (this seems to be a problem with some other phones)- has a camera, however basic- MP3 player- FM radio- Bluetooth- standard micro-USB charging- cheapCons:- UI is horrendous: my 2003-era Nokia was better thought out and worked better- no physical volume buttons- no apparent way to change the volume during a call- despite Blu's claimed 24MB of internal memory, only 6kb is accessible: if you actually want to take any pictures at all, play any music, or save a ringtone you will need a micro-SD card- the 6kb of internal memory means that you will not be able to store many messages or phone contacts.UPDATE- It is possible to unlock the keypad. You have to press the middle of the directional keypad, followed by the * button. The problem is that it's fairly difficult to press this button, and there's no manual to tell you this is the required unlock key... and even when you do know it's difficult to press.- The key-lock feature only seems to work when the phone is at the home level. If you put the phone down while in any menu or feature, the phone will sleep but the keypad will not be locked.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "Brenda Gbolie", "ReviewID": "R23UL87387S0AI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone for my trip to Sierra Leone, because I had a bad experience last year when I took my Samsung smartphone and spent a lot of money topping up the credit almost every single day, just because of the data running in the background.  Even after turning that feature off, it was still a problem. So this time, I decided to get a simple phone, and was pleasantly surprised at the superb performance of the BLU Zoey phone. I was also quite surprised that the flashlight on the phone was really bright, such that I did not need to carry a big flashlight in my bag like I usually do when I travel.  The battery life is amazing.  I used the phone a lot, but the battery never died on me, and it lasted for days without charging. I would most definitely recommend this phone to anyone travelling to places where there's frequent power outage and an unreliable Internet connection.  The only mistake I made was purchasing the white phone -- it gets dirty quite easily, so I recommend buying a different color.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great alarm clock, too!", "Author": "harlingford", "ReviewID": "R2M19LUN9T7POO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like cheap phones. I was using the BLU Jenny for the last year, and it worked fine. The Zoey is pretty much the same but has an earphone jack, which the Jenny does not.Both are Dual SIM and quad band, which makes them perfect for use when traveling - just get a cheap local SIM and you're good to go. And if you lose it or it gets stolen, you aren't out very much.  This is a basic phone for voice calls and texting, not internet use. A feature I really like is an alarm clock that works even when the phone is turned off (and even has a snooze feature). This means there is extremely little battery drain. On the Zoey, you have to go into the Organizer Menu to find the Alarm clock menu, but once there it works fine. As others have said, the manual that comes with the phone is pathetic. You have to be willing to play around and experiment to figure out things like the alarm clock and flashlight. But it is all reasonably logical. Another thing I like about the phone is it is very small and light, easy to carry in front jeans pocket. If it matters to you, be aware it LOOKS cheap, like a toy.  In the US, the cheapest pay-as-you-go plan I have found for voice and texting is lycamobile...what is nice is that the balance never expires. I bought $10 a year ago and am still working on it. Uses T-mobile network.  The flashlight is useful. Just hold the center control button to turn on and off.  The mp3 player function (which requires an SD card) works fine but is very basic. There is no obvious way to organize mp3s into folders or playlists...just one long alphabetical list. Transfer from a computer is simple but excruciatingly slow.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone that delivers for the price", "Author": "Gregorio Ramos", "ReviewID": "R18UJPN3X0D3I2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, the phone is amazing.That said, I only took a star off because I could never get the Social network part to work, even after an email to BLU customer service and T mobile. The phone says it works with 2g data. Maybe i am missing something?A few Cons: Like I said, the Social networking(it is advertised that you can access facebook) does not work, or is really hard to set up, I gave up on trying to set up the APN on it after calls to BLU and T mobile.Also, as others have mentioned, the UI could be a tad better, maybe more like a Nokia basic phone. But we are talking about a ~$20 phone.It has dual sim slot, which i only tested one at a time and it worked, I cant attest to 2 simultaneous sim's.SD card slot, which as other commentators said, you need one to save anything on this phone. I personally put in an old 64mb micro SD i found in my electronics bin. Worked great. Played MP3's, saves photos. ETC.Bluetooth works great for file transferring. It has FM radio, and a flashlight!! By the way calls and text messages work as they should. Very clear calling, I was impressed, and the battery life is awesome. I got the phone, it had about half the battery, I used it for 2 days, made about 8 calls and plugged it in still in the green.I hate to say this, as it may sound bad, but it is a great throwaway phone, or a phone that you would not mind loosing or dropping etc. as opposed to a $300+ smartphone.This is an excellent secondary phone, or a great main phone if you don't need any of the Internet capabilities of a smartphone. If this sounds like your needs, don't doubt in getting it.PS: Now if I could just get that data to work... If anyone has gotten the T mobile USA data to work on this phone please let me know.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for overseas use", "Author": "matt harper", "ReviewID": "RETKDXAS4GHBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can use this unlocked phone overseas such as Puerto Rico or the Carribean, Aruba or Curacao and just buy an inexpensive SIM card from a local carrier,do not have to pay excessve and outrageous roaming fees from ATT InternationalGreat as a second phone has all features for receiving text or calls, any questions about using the phone just calledcustomer service, excellent customer service answered all questions and did not have to wait on the phone for a live representativeto respond.The price, quality and service are excellent", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does what it's supposed to.", "Author": "Johnny the Fox \"Yeah, it's THAT good being me!\"", "ReviewID": "R10GSIRYIHDLJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this directly from Amazon for a 2 month trip to Europe.

No adjustments or tinkering was required.  In each country I used the phone, over 20 including Spain, Italy, Greece, France etc it locked onto a local provider and worked great.The phone is in no way fancy but does have good sound quality, a reasonably loud ringer and insanely good battery life.It will now go back in a drawer until my next international trip.If you want a phone for a similar purpose you will be pleased.

I've had it for just a few days.As a simple voice phone, this is great. It's inexpensive, small, light, and great for travel. As a \"feature\" phone,it's got some rough spots.First, a few frequently asked questions:- It takes 1 or 2 full-sized (normal) SIMs- It takes a microSD card up to 32 GB- It comes with an international (100-220 V, 50/60 Hz) USB charger (detachable standard-to-microUSB cable)- It has a removable/replaceable battery (brick type)- Mine came with the option of Spanish, Portugese, or English, defaulting to Spanish- It has a microUSB port and a standard (3.5 mm) headphone port.- It has a keyboard, but no other external controls, including no volume control buttons.(In-call volume control is  the keyboard up/down control)Quirks:- The user manual is virtually useless (4 1/2 pages of 4-point type largely listing the menus), and the menus  are awkward. Finding things can be a challenge. The status icons at the top of the screen are completely  unexplained. There's still one that is a complete mystery to me.- First challenge was figuring out how to change it to English:  Menu (left top button)  Settings (gear and tool icon)  Phone settings (3rd in the list)  Language (second in the list)- I have a T-Mobile (US) SIM, and it connected fine. However, with only 1 SIM card, it will display \"Insert SIM\"  on the main screen at all times.- The voicemail and SMS numbers appear to have been set up correctly automatically when I inserted the SIM,  and I am able to access voicemail and receive SMS messages. I am UNable to send SMS messages, and I  have been unsuccessful as yet in contacting either the seller or BLU. There is nothing useful on either website.- MMS may or may not work (if I could send any message at all), but even if you have the correct values for  your carrier, the menus on the phone for entering this information bear no resemblance to the way the  information is typically specified.- The music player works - if you're happy with only a giant list of individual tracks and have no interest in seeing  your library organized by albums, artists, etc., or playing music that way.- Setting the date format for the phone does not appear to have any effect on the date display on the main screen.FM radio seems to work fine (once you find it).I have not yet tried the Bluetooth or \"Social networking\" functions, but really have no interest in the latter anyway.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "not bad so far", "Author": "Kiamil Abdoullaev", "ReviewID": "R407AQOZ3KOWO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my father, who can barely use the regular functions on a flip-phone.
