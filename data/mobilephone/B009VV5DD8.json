Turner \"Bert\"", "ReviewID": "RK2VQ21BRTPR8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is quite small. The Blu Tank is a little thicker and has longer battery life. The \"instructions,\" in addition to being little more than a summary of the phone's menus, is written with many grammar, stylistic, and usage problems. Easier to search online for a Blu Jenny manual. Same lack of information, but with larger type. If you are technologically feeble or logically impaired, or simply desire detailed instructions, avoid Blu bar phones.First omission: How do you get into the thing to install the battery? At the bottom edge, there is a tiny groove into which you can stick a strong fingernail to pop the back of the case off. If the color of the stripe around the edges of the phone is black, this is hard to spot. While it is open, you can see where the SIM cards go. Just position one or both and slide them or it in. The tiny SD card is also easy to install if you know the top secret that is not included in the instructions. Facing the exposed innards of the phone with the camera lens at the top, there is a little square frame at the bottom left that will hold the SD card. Position that strong fingernail into the vertical slot in the frame, and slide the frame to the right about 1/16 of an inch. Use the same tool to raise the frame on its hinges. Install the cardlet and close the frame, sliding the the top back to the left. Adding the card will enable many of the features of the phone. You can set the camera resolution higher, load the card with MP3 files in a folder called \"MY MUSIC\" and load additional MP3 ringtones.I am amazed at the good quality of the FM radio.I bought the phone to use in Costa Rica. It is easy to purchase a SIM there to use in this unlocked Quad-Band phone. I can't tell how it works as a phone yet, since I am still in the US.I regret the absence of a headphone plug, but we will be traveling with other devices to meet that need.The absence of a manual is not all that bad. I just spent about 30 minutes exploring the Menu and found most everything needed. You can even find out how to lock the keypad: Press the center of the big square button, followed immediately by pressing the asterisk. Unlock it by the same procedure. The operating system has one nasty quirk. When you change a setting in one of the menus, sometimes you are given an option to \"save\", or a \"done\", or an \"OK\". There is no consistency. Just make sure you do something to save your change, or it will be lost.When I get a Kolbi/ICE SIM into this little red wonder, I will update.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "My mom LOVES it!", "Author": "Lacy", "ReviewID": "R15XW2CG8QNKG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my mom.

It is small and light and convenient to carry in a shirt pocket. The overall quality of the phone seems fine. You can get a Lycamobile SIM card for free in many tabacs (though one tabac tried to charge me 5 euros). I went online and set up an account with 5 euros of credit, and all works perfectly. Texting on the BLU Jenny is not great as it is an old-school numeric keyboard. As others have said, the manual has almost no information, so you have to go into the phone menu and use trial and error. But it is all fairly intuitive. I do not know whether you can change the ring tone and have not tried, nor have I used the voice mail (Lycamobile has a free voice mail service). The phone has an FM radio and mp3 player, but no earphone jack, so those are not so useful. (It does have a useful and simple alarm clock feature - with a snooze function - that works great.) For a very inexpensive phone, I find this very impressive so far. It seems to hold a battery charge very well...many days on standby. Lycamobile is a cheap pay-as-you go plan that is 0.10/minute euro to landlines or 0.15/min to mobiles within France. If you travel to France with a group, getting a few of these BLU Jenny phones plus Lycamobile SIM cards would be an extremely inexpensive way to have a few mobiles to communicate within the group. If you somehow lost the phone, you'd be out a grand total of $30 plus 5 euros. The dual SIM capability is also a big plus if you travel to more than one country.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "my review of this adequate phone", "Author": "Steven Miller", "ReviewID": "R380UT3IA0A5RB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "out of the box first impression, nice small size, somewhat cheap feel to it.Sim(s) easy to insert - memory card ( we will rant about that later) much more difficultHas a radio and Mp3 player - why? there is no headset connectorCamera is ok - dont take any wedding pics with itSO WHATS THE POINT OF THE MEMORY CARD?Its a perfect cheap travel phone for europe and usa if you want to either buy a worldwide sim card or if you want to insert  two country specific pay as you go sim cardsfor thirty bucks - its ok you get what you pay for", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect low-cost solution for overseas connectivity", "Author": "Tim Stevens", "ReviewID": "RVCN13TQFWHX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had low expectations for this phone given its price.

We bought an Orange sim card when we got to Paris for communicating with the places in other cities we were going to in France.  With help from the Orange store salesperson, we were able to get an unlimited with-in France plan (with texting, too) for 10euros for the 2 weeks we were there.  After the first day, we decided to get another phone and add the same plan so that we could separate (he isn't that fond of shoe shopping and would rather sit at cafe and enjoy a beer) and still stay in touch to determine where and when to meet back up.  The Orange phone we bought in Paris was a fair price but way more than this twenty-three dollar phone and I wish I would've been smart enough to have bought 2 off of Amazon.Note: we didn't find it difficult to change the language to English and once we did, it was pretty simple to operate.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Kevin D.

I wanted a phone that I could use while vacationing in France that would simply require insertion of a local SIM card to work.  It worked as I had expected it to.  However, you do have to explore the various features in order to figure out how each one works (it does not have an intuitive menu).  I never did figure out how to enter names and phone numbers into the contact list.  I gave up after a few attempts because there weren't that many numbers I needed to dial while in Paris.One potentially useful feature of this phone is that it's dual-SIM which means that you could insert two SIM cards, have two separate numbers and use each one for a different purpose, e.g., you could provide one number to family and one to local contacts or use one for business and one for personal.  When one number rings, you would know right away who might be calling.Helpful hint:  If you're in France, the least expensive charge per call is with a Lebara SIM.  It's sold through some \"Tabacs\" and bookstores.  You can buy one for as little as 10 euros ($13.50).  Activation will be 5 euros but the remaining 5 euros will last for a hile because each call is only 15 cents.  I never did use up my 5 euros worth of talk time.  They expire in 90 days unless I \"top it off\" (recharge the card).

The screen and keys are quite legible. Takes a little tinkering to figure out the menus, but overall a breeze to set up and operate. I love the one-button operation to switch between normal and silent modes. I've already dropped it a few times and it seems pretty durable.

However there were too many negatives for me to keep it. The worst was the terrible voice quality. It sounded like a childrens 'tin-can phone' - tinny and squeeky ear-piercing sound quality. Also the display had very tiny indicators for signal and it was difficult to make out whether there was enough signal. And the display showed only the local network provider name so I couldn't tell whether I was on the right SIM card (my other phones show both the SIM card provider and the local one - ie like ATT and Vodafone.GR  when I'm in the US). And, as others have said, the instructions were pretty useless. I think I'll stick to single SIM card phones  and just swap SIM's when I change countries.  And as for the FM radio - Yikes!

This may be an issue with ATT prepaid sims and some phones, although the ATT prepaid website says customers can move their sim. I did read, on the ATT forum, of another ATT customer having this problem with a new ATT-branded Z431, but it does not seem to happen to most phone changers or there would be a lot more complaints. At a minimum ATT prepaid users need to be aware of this issue.Second biggest problem is the retainer/socket for the microSD card is very poorly made, and mine will not hold a microSD card in place (it locks into place just fine without a microSD card.) Too bad it was not made like the sim sockets.Third, not only is the BLU 172i (which has a camera) unable to send or receive pictures (it lacks mms support) it also can not reply to text messages sent as email (to phonenumber@txt.att.net) although the text of the message comes through fine. The sender's email address shows as a string of digits. Replying to the message gets error messages (and my sim stops working).An online manual would also be very welcome. Hopefully it would do a better job of indicating the limits of this phone.I do hope that BLU fixes these issues in some future model, since this phone is almost good enough to meet my needs.As it is now I do not recommend this phone for anyone.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lasted only 3 weeks", "Author": "Ceci", "ReviewID": "R3DXFIEVMGOJS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't.
