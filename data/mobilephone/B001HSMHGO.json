{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fully-loaded, functional and sleek, yet over-hyped, and certainly over-priced", "Author": "D. Emerson", "ReviewID": "R1OITIUENL05A4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll just list out the aspects of the phone.  More convenient that way.-Touchscreen: Not as responsive nor as user-friendly and intuitive as the iPhone, but definitely usable, stylus (which is provided), and finger-wise. Sharp, bright colors, with an auto-adjust function that works amazingly well, even in bright sunlight. Slightly recessed, so it does collect dust and other debris (which I found surprisingly annoying, since even lint easily picks up from my pocket), but overall, very attractive and usable.-Windows Mobile 6.1: Though there are still some bugs, a marked improvement over the last version.  The one really annoying aspect of the system is still the slow loading time, and the main nagging thing I noted is that there's a HUGE lag after text messaging, after the message informing you that the text was sent.  The system freezes for a good 5-10 seconds, and won't let you do anything during that time frame.  Mostly just annoying, though certainly not a detractor, especially if you don't text a whole lot.-The keyboard: Spacious, despite the compactness, and slightly curved, with an assisted spring mechanism that feel very, very solid.  The one qualm I have is that they keys are nearly flush with the tray, and the top row can be difficult to press, since it's nearly flush beneath the screen.  Other than that, with some use, it's easy to get used to, and doesn't add bulk or awkward feeling to the phone, like some full QWERTY keyboards. The keys are also backlit, which is a nice touch, especially in shadowed or darkened areas.-The keys: There's plenty of softkeys and shortcuts available, and they're very well-suited for the phone.  There's an optical joystick (passing your finger over the surface allows you to scroll without physically pressing the top/bottom keys, or the screen), which also serves as an \"OK\" key.  I really liked that addition to the phone, since I'm not a big trackball fan, and the sensitivity is customizable, since a too sensitive setting can sometimes lead to wrong commands. There's a dedicated panel key, which is somewhat like a home-screen key, since it takes you to the main panel selection every time. There are also dedicated phone keys, a toggle on the side for volume, and a power/sleep button on the top.  They don't detract from the phone, and the only sticking point is that they're sometimes a bit stiff to press.  Other than that, it's a nice, somewhat comforting feeling to have dedicated keys available, unlike the iPhone.-The panels: These have been touted as, and are, really, the main attraction of the phone. They're are an interesting, very positive feature, since they're customizable (you can even move them around, though this has to be done through choosing a panel and editing it, instead of just dragging it across the screen, which would have been much more intuitive), and varied, and give the Windows system a more personal feel. They can be a bit laggy, but they're fun and functional (the fish panel is just amusing, with the ability of the fish to change color, follow the touch, or swim away if pressed), though I've yet to find a use for the Google page, since it always defaults to Internet Explorer, which I don't utilize.-Internet browsing: Pretty snappy and speedy, even on the Edge network.  The area in which I live doesn't support the 3G bands on this particular phone (I have the overseas Xi, while the U.S. will ship the Xia), though bigger cities with the 1900mHz towers do.  I don't use Internet Explorer, since it's still one of the most useless and dated mobile browsers out there.  The phone is shipped with Opera Mobile 9.5 installed, which works similarly to Safari on the iPhone, though thankfully the cut and paste options are available, unlike the iPhone.  (Trust me, after you've given up that option, and then come back to it, you'll really notice the difference.  Why Apple hasn't picked up on that yet, I'll never know...) There is also the option of downloading Skyfire, which works very well, sometimes faster than Opera.  Both platforms support Flash, and display the full-page layout, like you'd see on your PC.  Either way, pretty enjoyable experience there.-Text/Multimedia Messaging: Windows finally incorporated the threaded conversation for text messaging, much like the iPhone did, creating a more \"IM\" feel to conversations, and making it much easier to keep track of specific conversations.  It lags a bit, as mentioned prior, but a great improvement, without a doubt. It also does Multimedia messaging, and for that alone, in some ways, it is worth more than the iPhone, since Apple still refuses to include that basic function.-Camera/Video/Music: The camera is 3.2 MP, a very decent camera, especially considering the phone size.  It includes a flash, and can be adjusted for various speeds, colors, effects, etc.  There is also a video-camera, which records up to 30fps, though only 24fps, I believe, for the American version.  Why the difference, I couldn't say.  The music player is easy to access (it has it's own panel), and there is also a Sony FM radio included, which is a nice touch, and easy to use, though only with the headphones included, since they act as an antennae, apparently.  Still, very decent media package.-Construction: I have the silver finish, which is really just stunning.  It's very has a very durable, solid feel to it, though can be somewhat slippery, and feels very comfortable in the hand.  The size in my opinion is perfect, compact and sleek, and though this means smaller screen size and somewhat cramped keys, it's really my favorite aspect of the phone.  Has the old, comfortable handset feel of a Nokia candybar phone, actually. Sony really put a lot of thought and effort into it, and it shows.-Other features:  The 3.5mm headphone jack is WONDERFUL.  I had a Sony a few years back, and the one sticking point that kept me from using it as a full-time MP3 player was the fact that I was supposed to use Sony's headphones.  The fact that Sony has branched out, and incorporated the headphone jack, along with the capabilities for a Micro SD card slot (located on the side, when you remove the back cover), really shows that they're creating a platform which is more friendly to users who branch between companies. (Sony usually has their own M2 storage card, which is more pricey than the Micro SD.) Whether it lasts or not depends on their continued association with HTC, I suppose, who designed and helped create the physical phone. I suspect that if they next phone doesn't run Windows Mobile (which has been rumored), those features might disappear. Oh well.  The fact that they're included on the Xperia is really a very nice, convenient touch. The phone also connected with the network very easily, loaded all the information, and formatted the phone, without any heavy programming from me, which was awesome.Overall?  Fantastic phone, with very reliable software, convenient system, sleek and sturdy construction, speedy network connections (even overseas), and plenty of opportunities for personal tweaks and modifications, given the open platform from Windows.  I'd love to give it five stars, instead of the four, but the price was ridiculous, especially considering that it's really just another Windows Mobile smartphone, albeit better-looking and more personal than some others.  Still, it's without a doubt my favorite phone to date, when combining the ease of use and construction appeal.  Well worth buying, if you can burn the money.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "More than a few pros, a few cons", "Author": "Kudah", "ReviewID": "R2FZ309XSIQJ33", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First the disclaimer: I'm an avid Windows Mobile user so am familiar with the Windows Mobile interface.I love the camera. Of course it doesn't compare with a point and shoot of course, but pictures are rather sharp. The shutter runs a little slow, so sometimes you might miss the action, but for quick snaps in bright light it is pretty good. The LED gives a little bit of light in low light situations. Auto focus is a very nice feature too.The panels are an interesting concept. I've actually given up my mp3 player and am using the Sony Ericsson music player with an 8G SD card (a touch heavy for this, but not bad). Also the integrated FM radio panel is nice. I haven't found a use for the fish panel yet!The curve of the sliding keyboard is pretty nice. I like how when you slide the keyboard there is a solid feel to it. Makes me think that Sony Ericsson paid attention to the design here.Very stable. Doesn't crash.I've dropped it a few times...ugh. Hasn't scratched or died (yet)The device is responsive. a touch snappier would be nice, but definitely usable.People definitely notice the phone - not that I pay attention to that anyway ;)Cons:A little heavy - just a little lighter and I'd be happy.The keys on keyboard are a little too flush - sometimes hard to type, but now I've had a bit of experienceThe panels are a little slow.The speakerphone is a little quiet - I wish it were a little louder, but doable.This could be a con if you don't like or haven't used Windows Mobile, but since it is Windows Mobile so it might take some getting used to.Neutral:The screen has a bezel, which flys in the face of recent \"smartphones - iPhone etc. I don't mind it personally.Like most Windows Mobile phones, the battery doesn't last as long as my old Nokia 3510. But hey, I'm using 10 times the features and it always lasts me more than a whole day from sun up to sun down.I personally don't like the touch sensor to scroll - I like clicking through menu entries rather than swiping.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hardcore tech brilliance. Not quite the iPhone killer tho.", "Author": "Sera69", "ReviewID": "R1FZVE9QU8Z1WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't begin to judge fellow reviewers and their knowledge of WinMo phones but will say that you simply cannot judge this or any current multi app piece of hardware by the same standards as other phones.Nor can this be judged on how it performs 'out of the box'. Like a laptop, you can only cast an opinion when you've uploaded your favorite software, got it to run your prefered media player and tweaked the OS to your own personal specs. Judging something this high tech as it is, is like admiring your new plasma TV but not adjusting the contrast or brightness or tuning in any new channels; or to test driving a car on half a tank of petrol and then focusing your complaints only on the fact that it ran out of fuel. You got to fill it up to go the distance!Out of the box, on UK Vodafone, this is as chunky a brick as ever was produced. The keyboard is gorgeous, a tactile joy and a beautiful piece of kit but the rest is slow and unresponsive. The Windows Mobile system (WM6) is cumbersome for a phone OS, the touchscreen is slow with a noticable delay between press and reaction. The panel system, although novel and full of possibilities has been woefully under supported by Sony Ericsson (The X1 is very obviously a test bed for future X-series handsets!)And this isn't my first touchscreen, HTC or Windows Mobile handset, so i'm not comng down hard on the Xperia through inexperience...However...I've had my X1 for a little over a month. The Vodafone ROM has gone. The OS is tweaked and touchscreen responsiveness is immaculate. Screen pop-ups, information messages, unwanted screen closings etc. are gone. IE has been swapped for Opera. WM6 has gone in favor of the touch friendly WM6.5. Youtube works, Synching doesn't need Outlook, video playback is faultless and (the high point for me) the infinitely adaptable customisation that Windows Mobile supports means the handset is tailored exactly how i want it.Yes, i had to do some research; downloading, resetting and repeating on occasion. With previous generation handsets that kind of effort for a mobile could simply have been dismissed as pimping my ride; chintz and bling, but for this kind of device it's more the equivalent of putting enough fuel in the tank and getting your driving position right.You HAVE to put the time in to get the most out of it.This is the best phone i've owned. It's not as innovative as the iPhone and it doesn't yet have the apps support, but Sony Ericsson have created, after a bit of personal tweaks, a wonderfully intuitive, highly adaptable, beautiful piece of kit. It works fine as a phone, an email client and media player tho it is lacking in games. The 3.2MP camera has a great flash and gives excellent results for a mobile camera. And for internet use the X1 is incomparable. Turn it to landscape and the touchscreen coupled with the motion sensitive touch pad make browsing a joy.True, the $600.00+ price tag is steep but you are paying as much for the potential of the hardware as you are for the hardwear itself. Just remember you have to use that potential or what's the point?!? I think it's a bargain and don't see myself changing handsets for at least a couple of years.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Swiss army knife.", "Author": "Murugeyson \"eYn\"", "ReviewID": "R28UCOAOK4NO5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the X1 after extensively using the iPhone (I still have), G1 and the touch pro (both returned)First to clarify, yes this phone would not have 3G data on T-mobile. You can still make calls and use EDGE but that defies the purpose and the price. For that matter G1 would not work with ATT 3G, this is true for most phones. And if you need to blame someone, its T-moble. They have weird freq for their 3G which nobody else use.Next, the Xi (the one sold here) has only 1900 freq but ATT uses both 850 and 1900 for voice so you should be good and most places have both the freq (I have never been to a place where my iPhone has better signal) but theoretically 850 is better.This was one point I was worried, but believe me I don't see a difference. I lived in Atlanta (where 3G is great) and in Denver (where 3G is sketchy at best) and I don't see a difference. In general I drop more calls with my iPhone and I get better signal in places where my wife's phone(which has both 1900/850) doesn't have any.So the choice is simple, if you live in US and don't mind the silver shell (I hate it) then go for X1a. If you even like the black a little better, get the x1i.Now comparing to other phone and OS. I'll get this out of the way. right now, the x1 is the best windows mobile out there. Only the Blackstone (HTC touch HD) is comparable but that has no 3G in US (ATT and T-Mobile). So that leaves the Touch pro and Diamond. Touch pro looks great but the body feels cheap and i felt the phone will be in two pieces by the end of the week. Diamond is good but no GSM carrier. And at full price (to use it with ATT) its not all that cheaper to X1.So I see the iPhone and G1 as its close competitors, G1 is great but the looks will def put people off and the OS feels like its still in beta. the iPhone is amazing (I use it in the weekends because I would want to find restaurants and movie theaters on the go and its so easy to use while driving) but you def don't get the unique feel, as 8 out of 10 people have it. So I take it that unique is what you are looking for if you are even considering buying this for double the price of a iPhone.Ok here are the plus and minus of this phoneGreat:-1. Crystal clear display (480 by 800). The best so far2. The finish (though some have complained about cracked body) is great in mine, I actually returned the first X1 (though it was the fault/inadequacy of the ATT support staff) but both x1 were great.3. Def has a 'exclusive' feel4. Great hardware, has everything in the market. Speed test shows the x1 for most part is faster than the Omnia (o, i hate that phone)Good:-1. I like the keyboard, though not as great as touch pro2. Loads of physical button, though some may find it cramped.3. Amazing forum, you can do virtually anything in the software side. They have already ported TF3D and other goodies from touch HD. But HTC (made and sold) devices like touch pro and HD have a bigger following.4. This is more like 3a. You will def have 6.5 and even 7 ported to this phone (Not officially though)5. Even though the OS is not touch optimized, it still feels like you can do anything with it. I love it (this is my 6th WinMo device)Bad:-1. No Captive touch screen, meaning you still need a stylus most of the time. But the TF3D and Panels make life a little better.2. OS is like a siss army knife, Most would be overwhelmed if this is their 1st smart phone3. Doesn't have accelerometer (the one which turns you screen landscape when you turn your mobile)4. Comparing it with touch pro, touch pro has impressive list of sensors. For example it know when the stylus is in or out. Big deal? yes. For example you can auto launch notepad when in call and you pull the stylus out. You can do million things with these sensors. I had the pro pick my call automatically as i pick the phone from my desk. The x1 has none of these sensors.Bottom line is if you are a vivid WinMo user and like spending hours setting up your phone and then flash it again and start all over. This one is for you.Others try the G1 or the iPhone or wait for WinMo 7PS:- If you do get this phone, the first thing you need to do is flash it with a custom ROM.

First impressions weren't great but they've improved.The hardware is nearly beyond reproach. Slick piece of gear that feels of good quality. I might wish the screen were a bit larger, but the extra resolution is great. Sunlight readability is at least as good as the iPhone I have. After several weeks, it pains me to stare at the iPhone screen again, the resolution is too low.. The keyboard works fine for my fingers and I vastly prefer it to the iPhone virtual keyboard. No complaints about calls really. Touch screen is okay.GPS works and the geo-tagging of the camera is a nice touch (available on the latest ROM's soon or a separate software download already). The camera is nothing to write home about though, but decent enough.My first Windows Mobile device ever. And it's a piece of s**t compared to other cell phone OS. Sony Ericsson has (like other manufacturers) tried to hide it behind their own interface, and it works to some degree. So, to make this a loveable phone, here's my tips:- Use the Sony Xperia panels and CUSTOMIZE it! Put all your most use functions right on this screen. Users have complained about \"lags\" from touches, but I've found that's only when you switch Panels. If you just stick with the one panel, everything works fine. I used the iPhone layout as a guideline.- Download the latest patches, especially the geo-tagging for the camera and other fixes. With this, despite the resistive touch screen, browsing is almost as slick as the iPhone OS.- Download the YouTube panel- Download the Xperia Tweak software to get rid of some WinMo annoyances.It should work nice out of the box. Unfortunately it doesn't, and that's a shame because it's a nice piece of hardware, let down by the crappy OS. It is nice to see that SE is still supporting and upgrading firmware/features. With a bit of tweaking, the phone works just fine.Not sure if it is worth the full MSRP of $799, but if you can pick it up for $500-600, you might have a reasonable deal. This is a good alternative for those who NEED a real keyboard in their \"smartphone\".I didn't pick it up for the full price, and after a few weeks, I am happy enough with my purchase.

But after all that wait, I must say that I am a little disappointed with the final product.  Sony definitely delivered a great looking and solidly built cellphone.  However, the choice of using Windows Mobile on the Xperia X1 is the real failure of this phone.If you have used the iPhone (OS X) or the HTC G1 (Android) and then you used a Windows Mobile phone such as the Xperia X1, you will be blown away by how poor an operating system Windows Mobile is.  It is slow, buggy (even after its been out for ages), prone to crashes and restarts and not designed for finger touch.The panel interface does little to mask the ugliness and user unfriendliness of Windows Mobile.  With the exception of the sbp panel and the Sony designed media player panel, most of the other panels that are available at this writing are nothing to write home about. At the end of the day, the panels are just eye candy and are not enough to improve the user experience significantly.That said, the phone is well appointed with GPS, a beautiful screen (800x480) resolution, nice keyboard, FM radio and a very handsome design.  The screen clarity will impress you.  I was able to watch a Divx encoded movie on the Xperia X1 and I was thoroughly impress with its clarity.In my opinion, this phone would be better served if it ran Android (Google OS) instead of the crappy windows mobile operating system.Pros:1. Great design.2. Very stylish and will grab positive attention.3. Excellent screen. High resolution (800x480) Crystal clear, excellent for movies.4. GPS, WIFI (802.11b/g), bluetooth.5.

I hate it with a passion", "Author": "Peter Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1P6SN9DF33KCG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Here is a review of the Xperia X1. I have owned the X1, HTC Touch Pro2, HTC HD2, Nokia E90, Nokia E72, Nokia N95 and Apple iPhone. Other than the iPhone, I really hate this phone.1) Build Quality - the plastic on this phone peeled off everywhere! The finishing on this phone is very susceptible to friction. The plastic chrome will peel off. The paint on the metal battery cover will scratch or peel off. The internal housing will crack. It's like the device had an earthquake and cracked itself. I didn't even sit on the device or drop it on anything. There is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling. All of this happened within 6 months.The keyboard will also loose sensitivity. Over time, you will have to press on the keys harder and harder when you want to type something. The keyboard will only satisfy you for a year. And on top of that, the keyboard sucks. Don't even think about speed typing on this bad boy.2) Efficiency - the phone is very inefficient. The terrible feedback on the keyboard forces me to use the virtual keyboard on the phone. On top of that, the screen is so small that using the virtual keyboard is a nightmare. This prevents me from being efficient with contact management and note taking. In deterred me from actually using the calendar and responding to text messages and emails. Unlike on the E72, I was not motivated to be organized with the software.The phone is also very, very slow. Even with the latest firmware, it is very slow. This made me abhor using this phone for any reason. Don't even think about installing software that runs in the background, because it will eat your battery and retard your phone. The only way to make the device run at decent speeds is to minimize the software and the ROM.3) Battery - the battery life is terrible. It only lasts 12-15 hours on standby without 3G enabled.4) Camera -  the camera doesn't beat the N95, but it's alright. The camera software is sluggish and is very uncomfortable to use. The camera has bad auto focus and weak flash LED.5) Multimedia - the speakers on the phone is very weak so don't even bother watching movies or listening to music. Since this is a touch screen device, the screen isn't big enough for me to enjoy videos or web-browsing.The sluggishness of this device also applied to it's Wi-Fi. That's why I avoided web-browsing altogether. It was just plain terrible. In fact, I prefer the Nokia E90 or Nokia E72 for web-browsing (they are non touch screen phones).6) Phone - the call quality and loudness was at least better than my Nokia E72. However, the X1 speakerphone can't even compare to the E72 speakerphone. Please recall that phones usually have two separate speakers: the speakerphone/loudspeaker and the normal speaker. Well, the X1 has a very bad speakerphone/loudspeaker.8) Internet - the internet is slow, the screen is small, and the CPU needs an update. This should conclude everything.9) Price - at 800 U.S. dollars, it was an expensive piece of junk. But now that it is sold for 400 dollars brand new, it's a little more forgiving.10) Something to consider - regardless of all of the cons I have provided, I enjoyed using the phone because it was highly customizable. Unfortunately, it lacked everything I expected from what was advertised: an awesome keyboard, perfect build quality, fast processor. I tried to make the best of it by customizing it with software and 'tricks' and that alleviated some of the pain. Also, so many people complemented on the beauty of my X1.11) History on X1: When the X1 first came out, all of the reviewers gave the phone high marks for it's amazing build quality. Within a year, everyone noticed that its cosmetic and physical condition deteriorated greatly. The phone reviewers returned the X1 to the 'lenders' before they got the chance to witness the true nature of this phone.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "beautiful but expensive", "Author": "Yaw Wiafe Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1Y5O3KVO1UM0U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful phone, but it is very over priced. you can find phones with similar feature and far more durable for a cheaper price. some keys on my keyboard does not work no more. my old sony ericsson p1i is even easier to use and have features that you'll need daily than this xperia.Similar Products I Own:sony ericsson p1i", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent phone, but not worth the money", "Author": "CP Terp \"007\"", "ReviewID": "R3MQUZ2E5T1JFY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone just as it came out at a sharp discount, by purchasing it from a UK cell phone dealer at a deeply discounted price (~$650) compared to the $700 to $900 most were paying. The downside was that I received a Euro charger, but I purchased a Blackberry one at Best Buy and it works fine.I'm a Sony fan and I've owned a number of Sony Ericssons in the past, most recently a k790 (which I accidentally bricked) and a C902. First of all in terms of build quality, this is the worst SE phone I've owned. Sony usually has the best craftmanship in the industry, but the X1 is an exception mosltly IMO because it is built by HTC (a Korean smartphone firm). Not to bash on the Koreans but their electronics and automobiles significantly lag behind the Japanese in terms of quality, with a few exceptions such as Samsung or LG. Anyway, my X1 looks like I've had it for 10 years rather than 6 months: the painted metal back is terribly scratched and has never fitted perfectly, the silver on the top right hand button underneath the screen has completel rubbed off, the paint on the speaker has partially chipped off, the \"Xperia\" marking on the back is almost completely gone, and the \"Sony Ericsson\" marking has started to disappear. I decided not to buy a case for the phone, since I never need one, and I really paid dearly. The keyboard itself has really held up fine, and the sliding mechanism still works well also.The phone itself is pretty good, but not stellar. The good thing about WM is that you have access to a lot of very useful apps. such as Adobe Reader, MS Office Suite, plus a whooole lot of free downloadable apps. Now, the bad thing is that it's Windows--it freezes often, and the interface is bad. Opera Mobile is the best app included with the phone, and Internet Explorer is probably the worst; they might as well have not even included IE. One thing that is a real plus is the use of \"panels,\" which can be used to access programs or alternative interfaces, the latter of which makes the phone soooo much easier to use. My favorite is the spb Shell which looks much cleaner than the windows interface and is so much easier to use with your fingers. Apps such as the SE Media Player panel (much better than WMP) and Google Maps really make the phone much better.All in all it's a decent touch screen cell phone (much better than the iPhone), but I would only recommend it for $500 or less, not the regular $700 MSRP. The poor build quality and the Windows Mobile interface (which can't be fully escaped even with the Shell) don't justify a price over $500.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good look, but... windows mobile :(", "Author": "Fabio R.

I picked this one up for slightly below $600. While the build quality on this phone is fantastic compared to the ATT Tilt, in all other respects it is almost identical to the Tilt, albeit with a much better screen.I also have an itouch, and I have to say the itouch multimedia capabilities really blows my Xperia out of the water! I am mentioning the itouch here since I guess that is what the iphone must be like as well.The problem here is the Windows mobile OS which has a terrible touch screen interface. Also, my phone requires rebooting on a daily basis especially if I browse the web.Overall there is nothing wrong with this phone. If you're looking for a great Windows Mobile phone this is probably the best. However, with other smart phone choices such as Blackberry, Nokia and iphone I am not sure the OS here holds up to the competition. This phone like my Tilt has great stats on paper, but the implementation is what really matters and that is where Microsoft has let the product down.Just to be clear, I am not a Sony or MSFT basher.

T-Mobile said flatly that NO PHONE OTHER THAN THEIRS WOULD WORK ON THEIR 3G OUT OF THE BOX, due to the frequency 1700 that no other phone handles.The amazon.com website says UMTS 850, 1900, 2100, that should be OK to use with AT&T;, but the phone comes with UMTS EU1/US2/EU8, that is 900, 1900, 2100. There are only 2 US operators that could use GSM phones, and neither uses the UMTS frequencies this phone has:1. AT&T; 3G needs 850/1900 , so you need Xperia X1a, and not X1i that ships from amazon.com, and2. T-Mobile 3G needs 1700/2100 (both frequencies are needed, one is for upload, the other for download).So, if you plan on using 3G, you'll not be able to use this phone in the US.

Call sound quality and battery life are amazing. I haven't tried all the features, yet. I'm used to the slow performance of the N95.

It may have a lot of nifty functions but it miserably fails with the basics that a phone should have.Here are 2 such examples:1) On your main panel bar on top you can either choose to show the time or the battery bar, but not both, why I don't know.2) The alarm only repeats itself three times so if you are a deep sleeper don't even bother to buy this phone.Customer support for this phone is also lacking so if you buy this phone you are pretty much on your ownupdate on this review:I have had this phone for a while now and everyday I regret ever buying it. It is not a reliable phone in any way and a complete waste of money. The battery dies at the most unexpected times, and you have to always hope and pray that it is charging. The text messaging keypad freezes at least once a week which can be bloody annoying when you are on the run. And sometimes the phone doesn't even alert you of calls. The number of times I have been accused by friends and family that I hung up the phone on them or didn't answer the phone when in fact I didn't receive a call or the stupid battery died, is just ridiculous. It also wastes battery at the stupidest things. I mean if the bloody battery is low why does it insist on vibrating when it switches on or off---it is just bad design.Also the calling interface is a joke, the screen always turns off automatically a few seconds into the phone call, making it a bloody nightmare when you have to press keys when you are on one of those automated call.I mean I can go on and on about what mess this phone is but I think you now get the picture.I leave you with one piece of advice that will save you money and sanity:DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Get an Iphone Instead", "Author": "Mary T.
