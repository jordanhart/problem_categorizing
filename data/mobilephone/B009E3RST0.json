{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best All Around Windows Phone 8 Device.", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "REO58TSD2I30E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After watching the web, seeing the announcement, and drooling over the device in stores, I finally received my very own HTC 8X. The 8X Booted up quickly, got through the setup screens and after popping in a new MicroSIM, the phone was ready to go. Since I already own a Windows Phone, retrieving my contacts was as easy as signing into my Hotmail account on the phone. (Even coming from an android device, just signing into your Gmail account with all your contacts backed up there should be just as easy.)To start, this is a review about the phone and not the OS. Microsoft has created a fantastic OS and even though they have a few questionable changes (Like removing Bing Voice Nav with the Nokia Drive integration nowhere in sight yet) it still is a fantastic and easy OS to use and live with day to day.First thing that pops out at you when you get this phone is the color, shape, and feel of the device. The phone feels very solid and thin without feeling too light in the hand. The shape and texture of the body also is pleasant to hold, easy to work with using a single hand, and doesn't have the feeling like it is going to slip from your hand or, if it does, break when it lands due to the solid and rigid construction. Even the screen is curved at the edges and being Gorilla Glass 2, should withstand bumps, scratches, and hopefully the occasional drop if one should happen.The phone I got was blue and really is pleasing to the eye as well as attractive enough to catch the attention of people around you wondering what phone that is. In todays world of Black or White, it is refreshing to get some other colors from HTC and Nokia that really brings out a bit more personality without looking tacky.Once you are done ogling the exterior of the phone and you power up that screen, you get a face full of that beautiful Super LCD2 display which is bright and vivid with amazing color and view angle. With the mix of the Blue Accented OS next to the Blue sides of the case around the screen, it just looks excellent (especially if you like the color Blue). Not only that, but comparing the 720P screen to any past device with a WVGA screen, will make you never want to go back. The OS looks sharp through and through, HD videos look amazing, and pictures show every bit of detail. Text also looks great and makes browsing the web, checking e-mail, viewing a document, or reading a book a pleasurable experience.Outside of the screen you have the audio component, while the external speaker is capable of a reasonable level of audio, it is what's inside that matters here, and paired with a good pair of headphones, you will get to benefit from the added bonus of the Beats Audio AMP build into the 8X. While on some devices this can be a software only tweak to make the audio sound \"better\" in certain situations or settings, in this case, the AMP actually does boost the quality and volume of the sound going to your headphones to an amazing degree. Just try it for yourself by turning off the Beats Audio in Settings while listening to music, and then with it on. The different is incredible and no device without the AMP has pushed the volume level as high as this could through the headphones I used (Klipsch S4's). You definitely would not want to listen with the volume at full blast if you value your hearing. (Where the same worry is non existent without the AMP enabled).Now what about the camera? Being that it is one of the highest quality shooters HTC has put on a few of their devices, there should be no surprise that the pictures this 8X can take can be incredible. It is not only great at getting normal light and most low light pictures with good clarity and minimum of blur, but even giving this phone to a few relatives that are known for not taking a stable picture to save their life, it was able to take a picture quick enough to still come out great. Many of the pictures this phone has taken have ended up on Facebook for one person or another as their profile pic or even Profile Background. The camera also can capture great up to 1080P video which records smooth, looks good, and does a good job on adjusting to movement or light without tearing. We captured quite a few action shots snowmobiling and it did a great job capturing depth even with the shadows causing major issues for us humans to see in the powder snow.The only downside the phone has is the limited onboard storage. 16GB was ample enough about two years ago, but in todays age of recording video in 1080P, taking 8+MP pictures, downloading thousands of music tracks, and installing more than 10 apps (seriously, Windows Phone games can really eat up the memory for some of the big good ones), 32GB should be the new minimum standard, especially with no expandable storage and this day and age of Limited Data Plans. For most people, this will still not be a problem, but it is a downside that needs to disappear in future devices especially with the price of memory continuing to decrease and shrink in size.Overall the entire phone pans out to be one of the best Windows Phones available. Not only due to the overall features and build quality, but also because it is available or useable on all carriers except Sprint (Curse your Sprint!) which leads more to follow in the success of the Samsung Galaxy SIII which is giving the user the option of getting the same fantastic phone on the Carrier of their choosing. If Nokia had done this with the 920 instead of sticking with just AT&T;, HTC would have a lot more competition on their hands. As it stands the 8X is the perfect device to work with, live with, and enjoy with its ample battery, powerful 1.5Ghz Duel Core Performance, and 1GB Ram memory.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Nicollette", "ReviewID": "R1P0U5J8DFCEKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just switched from the Galaxy S3 to this phone and this phone is much better.

When listening to music using with headphones the volume will randomly increase to full volume.  Without headphones, no issues.  The charge port on the base of the phone will start to be picky about the position of the charger after a while.  Not a big problem most of the time because you will figure it out but every once in a while you will be frustrated because your phone did not charge.

It also supports LTE bands that are not present in the US, which may or may not matter to you - just don't expect that you'll be able to use LTE in the US since it only supports bands that are currently used in Australia and parts of Asia. The included Garmin Navigator software only works on Telstra's network and has maps for the Australian region, the factory ROM doesn't include this anyways - but I thought it was a nice surprise, but it will not work in the US so you can delete it.This is a genuine, new unlocked HTC 8X and arrived in a sealed package in good condition... but the description should specify that it is an Australian variant that has a few gotchas. It's misleading currently.I'm going to see if I can install a generic HTC ROM on it, I may end up returning it if I can't because it was misrepresented to me.Other than that, the 8X is a really beautiful phone and a bargain at this price for an unlocked high end Windows Phone - just be aware of what you're actually getting from this seller.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just Awesome!", "Author": "Sorey Garc\u00eda", "ReviewID": "R285ITHBLM3W0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Windows Phone 7.5, good but with a simple external style.

This was my, let's see, 4th attempt, and options are getting limited.  First the good news--the HTC 8x has possibly the best call quality of any cell phone I have used.  The design is decent--a decent sized screen but a slightly thinner profile than some that, combind with the case's brushed surface and curved shape make it relatively comfortable to hold.  Unlike the Samsung's, it does a good job of logging onto your home wireless network pretty much instantly when turned on.  Reception is average.  The downsides--a camera that is probably below average and, the biggest downfall, the battery is really not adequate and unlikely to make it through a day without recharging unless you are an EXTREMELY light user.  At this point I am thinking I may have to just finally break down and go android or something, as the Windows phone options just don't seem to be there =(.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "8G memory!", "Author": "Olowo E", "ReviewID": "R3BPRLOM0LZQJW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i was extremely happy when i bought this phone. i couldn't wait to start uising it. the first thing i checked when i started using the phone was the internet sharing(hotspot), to my suprise it keeps telling me \"tethering option on this device is not enable, go toat&t; website or call 611\" which is useless for someone in africa!. and to make matter worse this particular phone came with 8G memory!", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE FANCY PHONE", "Author": "william snow", "ReviewID": "R1RN4G8BESPGBX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE SELLER WAS VERY NICE, I LOVE ALL THE COLOURFUL FACE, THE CAMERA TAKES GOOD PICTURES AND WINDOWS 8 WAS FAST, THE ONLY PROBLEM I ENCOUTER WAS I COULDN'T TRANSFER MY PICTURES TO MY LAP TOP.

That means the bloatware is more annoying than usual, as it doesn't work.

When I booted the phone I was curious at the T logo. So I search on the net and I found out that my HTC 8X is from Telstra Australia. Meaning the device is 4G LTE capable.To be honest, I really love android, I love its ecosystem and features. There's nothing about it that I hate. But I am a Windows type of kid. I've learned how to use word processor on windows, my first program runs on windows. So going back to me opting for WP8 as my new phone. I was really amazed how Microsost managed to create such a brilliant mobile o.s. It's just lovable. Very simple yet unique. Thought it might not be customizable compared to android it still has something that makes it stand out from other Mobile o.s.Overall, this is really a great device.

He laughed and said he has heard the same things from multiple people. They took it back, no questions asked. I got my Samsung Galaxy phone in it's place and love it.END EDIT..This phone is aweful. I can't install iHeartRadio because the WVGA screen is incompatible with the app. That means no fm radio programs that I listen to every day. Pandora downloads at 3mb and has zero fm radio options.When you plug in the charger, it vibrates every few seconds and I can find no fix for it online. At work it's constantly vibrating and annoying. While sleeping I have to unplug it so t's not vibrating all night. There is no indication that it is in fact charging while plugged in.When you are charging it, it is impossible to turn it off so it can charge properly. With the window/screen stuck open, it takes longer to charge. It tries to dim down but the charging forces it back open. Also, when you are charging, if you press the power button to close the main screen, it will open up on it's own and will remain open as long as it's charging.If you have an app running, there's no icon to touch to see what apps are currently running in the background that are killing your battery. Pandora is one example. It lets you pause the app but not close it entirely.The Facebook app is very limited and is almost completely text based. The images my friends upload or links they share show up as text messages. You have to click 2-3 pages to see the actual post.I've only had one Android smartphone before and will be returning my Windows phone for a Droid Razor (HD or MAXX HD).I tried going to the Explorer icon and it kept asking me to log onto my microsoft account and I was already logged into it. Also, Xbox/windows live is always logged on. It then forces you to use Bing which is a painfully boring search engine.It only has 16GB of memory and after activation, it says I have about 11GB left? Where did 5GB go?There is no Micro SD card slot so no upgrading the memory or listening to your own music/movies from a SD card.The screen is flashy and the icons nice to look at.

The Windows phone was appealing to me, simply for the ability to utilize Microsoft Office (I work full time and am a full time grad student) so working \"on the move\" was important to me.  The problems started on day 15 (not 14, which would have allowed me to exchange it at that time), with speakerphone not working. (By the way, \"Dre Beats does not work with this device\" is the message I got whenever I tried to listen to music.)  Then the lagging started (Think Microsoft PC.)  Followed by it randomly closing out of applications I was working on.  I exchanged a few email with Verizon, but they eventually quit responding.  Yesterday, the phone randomly shut off.  I assumed the battery was dead, but after I got it home and charged for over an hour, it still wouldn't power on.  Verizon is finally exchanging it for a phone \"of comparable value\" (which also equals me being out $100 extra given the difference in my purchase price.)I did my research, and it's entirely possible it was just a randomly dysfunctional phone.
