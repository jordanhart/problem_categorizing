At the time I received this phone about one month ago, I already gave some unpleasant comments, which mainly were: 1. dirty on the cable and on the film covered on the phone; 2. the battery was \"run out\" at the time I received it.Normally, the battery in a brand new product should NOT be run out!!! But I didn't pay enough attention to that and thought that the battery was just \"run out\", which was not a big deal. (I didn't try to charge the battery. Because I'm using the phone of the same model, I used my own battery instead of the \"run out\" one to switch on the phone.)The vendor called me after my comments posted last time. He was very nice and offered me to exchange the phone. Since I didn't know that the battery was dead, I was being nice too and saying that it was not necessary. Moreover, I was asked to change the comments and I did that because of the nice attitude of the vendor.Last thing to mention, my own Samsung galaxy S2 was a refurbished one bought from AT&T.; Even my refurbished one looked nicer than this one I bought here, at least mine was very clean, and more importantly the battery was good.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awful experience!", "Author": "tram nguyen", "ReviewID": "R3QX1FVSSX1BIL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered it as a gift for my sister.

However, I wanted to point out a few things about this particular model. (Note: in the US, AT&T;, Sprint and T-Mobile all have different models of the SII. They are different in size and several other details. In fact, AT&T; alone has, over time, had 3 different models of the Samsung Galaxy SII built just for them).First of all, there are a number of vendors that offer this phone and model through Amazon. One of them is displayed as the default vendor at any given time, but you can choose others. I found that certain vendors (when asked) indicated that the phone came with a manufacturer's warranty and others said it did not. So choose your vendor carefully. In the end, I bought mine from Tablet Distributors. They cost $5 more than the cheapest vendor, but they had great customers service (i.e. call and speak to a helpful human being who finds the right answers to your questions) and they confirmed that the phone came with a one year manufacturers warranty as well as a 30 day refund period.Secondly, this phone does not work with Tmobile. If you try to use the phone with T-Mobile, it will NOT work on their 4G or 3G bands and you will only get 2G service. This is because T-mobile uses unusual bandwidths for its services (bandwidths are standardized in Europe and other parts of the world but not in the US). This phone does not work on the radio bandwidths used by T-mobile for its 3G and 4G bandwidths.Other than this, the phone is a great value especially at this price.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Krystal Baker", "ReviewID": "R17OXH6VIV6Y5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "They've got a Galaxy S4 now, but I'm so happy with my Galaxy S2.

(This problem never popped up again and I am still not sure what exactly was the reason for not charging in the first place).I personally like the Android OS much better (I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and also have used the S2 for quite a few days) but I still prefer to stick with the iPhone (as far as smartphone).

This is a hardware issue and the only way around is to send it back for repair and hope to get a new replacement without the issue- 8 mp does not even match with 3.2 MP of other phones- phone heats up when using the camera, a litter tap or shake stops the humming noise , but that is a temporary fix.4. There is a single speaker and sound in the highest setting is still pretty low5. The only two button on the phone are power and volume rocker . no hardware button to wake the phone from sleep mode. no camera button. Samsung does not want you to use the 8 mp camera!6.
