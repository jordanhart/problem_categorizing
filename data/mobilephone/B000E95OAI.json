Since my Sony Ericsson S710a didn't work out, and since my wife's V3 has been solid so far, I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.First, the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT. The machined aluminum outer casing, and machined nickel keypad, provide substantial heft (this is good) and tactility. Moto could've used a little better plastic in places, but it's fine otherwise.Second, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.Third, unlike Sony Ericsson, the new Moto's (V3i, SLVR L7, etc.) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port, and use standard memory cards. (I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing.) No more proprietary chargers and cables, nor goofy Sony-only \"Memory Sticks.\"Fourth, the Bluetooth. Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation, and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson's, it is almost unshakable in its stability. (Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend. The T616 had great Bluetooth, the S710a's was unstable. The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable.) Range is excellent, too.Fifth, reception and call quality are both excellent. Volume could be better, but is still adequate. I have to admit, though, that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.Finally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.My only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes, even with the memory card upgrade. However, I'm an iPod owner, so this doesn't concern me too much.Now for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't \"see\" any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better. Caveat emptor!", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Razr V3i", "Author": "W.

I never used a regular v3 so I can't really compare it to that. I don't understand what one of the reviews was talking about saying the phone book is hard all you have to do is start search then you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it'll take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter, but thats neither here nor there.Some things you want to consider before you order this unlocked non North American version of this phone. Not all V3i's come with itunes, only Australia, NZ, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Turkey, South Africa, Rest of Africa, North Africa, Israel, Thailand, and finally Middle East versions of the V3i come with itunes. Is the one amazon is selling from one of those markets I don't know, I got mine off ebay. But even if it doesn't come with itunes you can still listen to mp3s off of it within the motorola mp3 player software which I think is called Digital Audio Player or DAP for short.Alright the phone feels and looks great, and the camera quality is damn good considering the size of this phone and the fact that is indeed a PHONE with a CAMERA and not a CAMERA with a PHONE. Here is a link to a picture I took with the camera at work. [...] . This phone is semi customizable like being able to change your wallpaper and having your own mp3 ringtones, via a usb cable. Like I said my version came with cable, data software, itunes and stereo head phones I don't know what this version comes with. Next I'll list pros and cons.PROS:Small sizeLooks GreatGood reception and sound qualityCustomizable featuresMp3 player capabilitiesTakes fine photos and videoIn my opinion easy to use and straight forward navigationSpeaker phone is loud and clearCONS:iTunes seems to limit the number of songs you can have depending on what size transflash you have. For example with my 256 card it only lets me have 50 songs and on a 512 card it'll only let you have 100 songs.A delicate phone, I use extra caution handling this phoneFront screen resolution could be better, but gets the job doneIncluded java games suckIn closing I think this phone is well suited for me, by being slim, customizable and having mp3 playback. Even if it does cap me at 100 songs my walk to and from work is quite a short distance anyway this way I can just keep the ipod plugged in the car and just use my phone for music.", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "THE BEST CELL PHONE TO DATE!!!

I am not sure why it is not readily available in any US store.  There seems to be a lot of confusion out there about this phone.  The V3I is awesome.  Hands down the best cell phone device that I have EVER purchased.  The itunes capability is great, even though the song limit is 50, it works great as an ipod back up.  The sound is as good as you can expect and you can listen to your itunes songs over the speaker without having to use any headphones.  The best thing about this phone is the removable transflash card that can be used (up to 1gb) that can be used to store songs, use as a thumb drive, or whatever you would need a 1gb worth of space for. In addition, the one megapixel camera is a definite upgrade from the old V3.  Also, the video capability is awesome.  Unlike its predecessor's, the V3i will take as long of video as your memory will hold (three minutes, thirty minutes etc).  The looks and feel of this phone are amazing too.  The gunmetal look stands out among the sea of normal RAZR phones. Also, I love the front blue light, which you can program to flash differently for different things.  The only problem with the phone is the fact that you cannot purchase it at any United States phone dealers.  You either have to purchase it here or someplace like eBay. I purchased mine on eBay for about $250.

I'm not exactly sure if the reviewer with the multiple address problem has tried this:\"Just change the \"sort by\" option in the address book setup to \"Name\". Then add numbers to the names instead of making new entries.\"That sounds like it should resolve it.There is one other caveat.

(It doesn't matter with my wife, since she doesn't have keen ear).  In ebay, there are some items - instructions to add itunes to this phone - at 10-30 dollars. I didn't try it yet and I didn't hear the success story.

I got the phone (ebay), 1gig transflash sd (amazon) and stereo headphone (from ebay) and three year warranty from ebay and in total, I paid $300.

First of all, the amazon phone does NOT ship with iTunes, but comes with the DAP (which I don't consider a problem because the iTunes one has a song limit and this one doesn't). The only things I am dissapointed with is that this one (unlike Cingular's one from the store) does not ship with a MicroSD, but you can buy a 1gb on amazon for maybe $30. It's definitely not for America because it shipped with multiple language manuals and an adaptor for the charger.

Diaz \"Dorothee and Jerry\"", "ReviewID": "R23220SH5JBJU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Synopsis:  This phone is sexy, rugged and feature-packed, and highly recommended, if you can look past its few flaws.Detail:  I'm a veteran to the RAZR line, having purchased one of the first black models when they were first released.  I thought the phone was excellent then, but with a few minor revisions, Motorola has brought the RAZR back to the forefront of the rapidly-moving world of mobile phones.  However, there are a few notable exceptions to this glowing report.First, the pros of the V3i model.  The call quality is somewhat better than the original V3, which already had exceptional sound clarity and reception in my experience with it.  Staying with the quad-band format is one of the best decisions that Motorola could have made with this phone- for individuals like me who travel abroad frequently, having a phone that can be used Stateside and overseas is an absolute must.The Bluetooth interface is seamless, but I use a Motorola H3 headset- if you use a headset of a different brand, you could encounter some difficulties, although I've not heard of any.  The camera, now 1.2 megapixels, takes (quite frankly) amazing photos for a mobile phone.  My wife decided to keep the pictures I took of our newborn son, as opposed to the pictures that were shot with our digital camera.  The video capture feature is good too, although I don't usually find myself using this function too frequently.Having the ability to switch to an \"Airplane Safe\" mode is also a plus, as you can still use the games and MP3 player while on a long flight.  Obviously, however, you won't be able to send or receive calls or data while the phone's in this mode.  The switch between these two modes, however, takes less than half a second.The physical size of the phone is also a major plus.  It's still a comfortable size to fit in your hand, but it's thin enough to easily fit into the front pocket of a pair of jeans.  The fit and finish are top shelf, the iridescent silver outside (seems to change to a smoke and a purple in different lights) contrasts well with the sleek black of the interior of the clamshell.  The outside display is bright and clear, and the interior screen is also bright and easy to read.  The keypad I find to be very good, but some people don't go for the feel of the cut metal keys.  Personal taste, I guess...Motorola's operating system is, in my opinion, clear and intuitive.  I've never found a system to be easier- the only one that's been nearly as easy was Nokia's, to give a perspective.  Icons are easy to interpret, commands are simple to issue to the phone, and with the TransFlash card installed, there's only a theoretical limit to the number of photos or videos you can store and take with you in your pocket.As I mentioned, though, there are some chinks in the armor.  First, the iTunes format is clunky and slow to navigate through.  Your iPod defintely moves through the menus much more quickly than does this phone.  Also, regardless of the size of the TransFlash card you have installed, iTunes limits the number of songs you can store to 50.  I've heard that some later models have this limit removed (or at least increased), but my version caps the fun at 50 songs.  Also, while the external speaker sounds good, I forego using the Motorola stereo headphones due to their poor sound quality.  Obviously, when I'm at the gym or on a transatlantic flight, I rely on my iPod for musical entertainment.Another con is the lack of EDGE or 3G technology on this phone.  Cingular is currently offering a 3G RAZR with many of these features (having iTunes replaced with Motorola's proprietary DAP MP3 player and no song limit), but sadly that phone is a tri-band model.  The download speeds are comparable to a 56K dial-up home connection, but many of us are now using cable or DSL at home, and at work using a T1/T3 connection, which makes downloading data from the Internet on my phone seem slow and cumbersome.Overall, this phone is one of the best on the market today.  I was a convert with the first RAZR, and with its subtle upgrades and refinements, the V3i is truly a worthy successor to the original.  However, with its few flaws, I'm still anxiously awaiting the \"perfect\" RAZR to be released from Motorola's braintrust.  Perhaps you could consider this the \"penultimate\" RAZR instead of the \"ultimate\" one.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Did not funxtion", "Author": "lauren outlaw", "ReviewID": "R15D7IH1ROFST2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product did not work well.

I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.

Extra features aside, I got this phone because of the memory expandability that the V3 lacked. I'm one phone user who doesn't use whatever extras are stashed in to make a phone worthy of one's time... so long as I could make/receive calls; send/receive text messages, and listen to a bit of music.

I have had it for 3 days and tried almost every possible feature and read the accompanying documentation.My previous cell phone:I had the Sony-Ericson T610 and I was quite happy with it I must say. The only issue is that it was getting old (three years already). I wanted to change it because:- It did not have \"out of the box\" any way to synchronize contacts with my PC (ok Bluetooth, but no software provided and my PC would have needed a very expensive Bluetooth adapter).- No MP3 player.- Its display is very difficult to read specially under sunny day light.- It is very slow and annoyingly lagging (seems to be the Java running on it).Apart from these, it is -in my opinion- the best phone ever, user friendly, lot of great options, navigation and facilities and the T610 do really synchronize wit my Apple iBook.The new phone Motorola V3i:Pros:- The phone V3i is indeed very appealing, most appealing at least for me was the fact that it has all \"advance level\" phone features like e.g. QuadBand, GPRS Class 10 / Bluetooth / USB, etc.- Especially nice the MP3 player with expandable memory and it works ok, the music hears laud enough as to have (while wearing the stereo headset) one colleague of mine complaining 4 yards away from me :). The phone comes with a card of 64MB, rather too little for the high price.- It also includes software to synchronize with your PC whether through USB or Bluetooth. But please note I mentioned only PC, Mac users do not have a chance with it, read on.- Finally it has a very nice design, it is quite eye catching and rather easy to handle. This is the main reason I attribute to the fact that everyone wants it.Cons:- Totally excludes Apple Mac users and this is not stated in the system requirements on the box (btw there is no system requirements on the box) not even in the very poor Users Manual. Hence, no way to get any contacts into my little iBook, no Mac software included. Not even using iSync, iSync *does not support* this phone. Please have a look at:  [...]  if you see the phone V3i listed there, please let me know. Also google for \"iSync Motorola V3i\" to find a large list of frustrated users.- Very poor written documentation at least the Users Manual in German, Italian, French versions. They only took a bit of effort in explaining the trivialities and leave out the important information e.g. you do not find anywhere how to manage contacts i.e. *search contacts*. Funnily you find something like 3 pages explaining how to open and close the phone.- The software included with the phone \"Motorola Phone Tools\" from AvantQuest is a baby's joke e.g. in the middle of the synchronization it would continuously ask you to delete all of your Outlook contacts with no setting anywhere stating to delete anything. It would hang eventually until you restart your computer times enough as to feel like throwing phone and computer over the window. The software is in general very complicated, it would ask you for every contact, one by one to repeat the same action again and again, so be ready to be very very very patient with it.- Synchronization could not be more user unfriendly: I did not find anywhere stated that the phone had to be *closed* while synchronizing, I just found out only because of the fact that I got continuous synchronization errors. When you get errors you can only abort and there is no information given (synchronization log \"Error found.\" cool).- Software documentation is and old-fashioned 5-pages marketing material subset of the phone written manual. If they invested so much time developing the fancy application phone \"look and feel\" they could have at least explained that the crappy phone e.g. denormalizes the contact data or that it discriminates Mac users.- This beautifulness of phone is or at least imports contact information from SIM cards or Outlook in an **incompatible** way than the usual design of contacts data, meaning how contacts are organized in Outlook or even other phones like Sony-Ericson i.e.  Instead of saving contact like should be:  Name: Manuel Peres  Cell: 111111111  Home: 555555555  Email: manuel.perez@email.me  The V3i saves it like:  Manuel Peres (111111111 Cell)  Manuel Peres (555555555 Home)  Manuel Peres (manuel.perez@email.me Email)Meaning they denormalize or repeat the same contact information (name, address etc) for every different phone or email information. This makes it a real perfect mess for any user to handle e.g. say you realize you made a mistake and want to change in your phone \"Manuel Peres\" to \"Manuel Perez\" SO guess what? you have to change three records! instead of changing it only once! This problem has a name in Database Design and is called \"Update Anomalies\" (google it please). The same situation goes also for addresses. The same happens if you need to send e.g. via Bluetooth the contact, then you must do it three times, once for each different registered phone! plus it will be received as three different contacts on the receiver side! oohhh dear!- The functionality offered with the phone is very poor. You do not have any way to search a contact by name or the reverse lookup. Instead you have to search a number navigating the contacts one by one each phone number or ease the pain filtering by category. So go figure if you have over 200 contacts that are flattened for each different phone number makes it 200*(3 phones each approx.)=600 entries to navigate one by one! namely SUCKS. Actually you can use a \"speed number\" assigned to each phone number ... so ... you would need to remember something like e.g. 345 is the \"speed number\" assigned to 3051111111. Well if you have to remember the speed dial number 345 then just save in your brain the next 4 digits and get the phone number itself LOL.- Yes it has MP3 playing functionality that works sometimes i.e. it however does not support iTunes m4p format, so forget about copying from iTunes folder directly to the V3i memory card => unrecognized format. Many mp3 files that work on the PC are not recognized either, do not ask me why. Not to mention it takes something more than 10 minutes to copy 50MB, and I have a very fast PC with USB 2.0- So little time owning it, and have got already several total phone crashes and hangs. The only solution have been a hard restart ... thankfully though, and at least, the crash display is not blue but white (just for a change).- Be sure to allocate some additional bucks in your budget to buy the expensive headsets for this phone, because motorola made sure to make the connector incompatible with any ordinary headset. For example, here in Switzerland you do not find the motorola stereo headset anywhere, so mp3 player without  headset :). I got mine somehow.That said, there is no lower score I can offer for this expensive crap.Please accept my apologies. I only write reviews when I am extremely happy or extremely frustrated. In this case it is unfortunately the later. My advice is if you are planning to get a professionally designed cell phone device that is not just a crappy but good looking and very expensive MP3 player,please sleep well and look somewhere else.Good luck!- Giovanni", "Date": "February 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Hey, I've got a Mac...", "Author": "David Muszynski \"Apple Technician\"", "ReviewID": "R3UN31VWK1Z7QV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "And I can sync my phone just fine.
