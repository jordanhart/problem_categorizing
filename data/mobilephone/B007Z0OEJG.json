The Corning Gorilla Glass is durable and scratch resistant. It has a great battery life, which is good, especially when you are on the move, using GPS. The Play Store has 1000's of apps to choose from. The phone has an amazing build quality, and is very tactile as well, the display is well lit, and it's easy to customise your phone, to your own liking. It is great for taking rainy day pictures when nothing else can survive.Pros:Resistance to dust, water, and shock,Solid feel,Easy to use with a single hand", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tough!", "Author": "Katie Steele \"cfs4\"", "ReviewID": "R3P8V89BFFVDNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it!

When I called Samsung, they directed me to call the UK Samsung branch since this phone has no US Warranty.The phone that I received kept on restarting at different times.  Since the phone is defective, I shipped it back to Amazon and they have sent me out a replacement.Looking forward to receiving the replacement, and hoping that there are no issues.

The screen displays change from one use to the next.  It locks itself and has to be turned off/on in order to get it back to normal.  I thought it would become easier to use/manage after I got use to the screens but that is not the case.  Since I do not depend on a cell phone but once or twice every other day or so (when I leave the house) - this thing is useless to me.
