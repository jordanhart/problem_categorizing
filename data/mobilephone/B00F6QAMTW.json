It seemed to work fine for the first month but then she started complaining that it kept crashing or it just wouldn't work. Eventually she decided to buy one on her own. I wasn't able to return it right away cause she had left most of the components in storage that it had came with.I would recommend buying a phone with more ROM built within - at lease 3G of ROM on the phone instead of the 512 that this came with. It would solve most of the crashing program problems with more memory.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F6QAMTW"}}
