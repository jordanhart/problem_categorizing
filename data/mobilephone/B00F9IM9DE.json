It did not come with the micro SD card or the book on the phone. It was a Christmas gift for my mom and she was sooooo sad we had to send it back. We talked to straight talk and Samsung and they tried to help and had great customer service. But in the end no body could get the phone working and we had to send it back and order a different phone.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "straight talk phone.", "Author": "emilyy17", "ReviewID": "R1SB3383HO7CAR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my first andriod phone i was excited to finally get one. But this phone is not what i thought it would be. For starters the battery life was not good at all. The memory one that phone was almost pointless. I was always deleting pictures or messages to make room. If your memory gets to full you are unable to recive messages. The phone was also alot heavier then i thought it would be. After about two months the phobne wouldnt charge so i had to go get another phone. I would personally not reccomend this phone for anyone.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "This version of Android sucks", "Author": "Harmony Marie Hanrahan \"Harmony M Hanrahan\"", "ReviewID": "RX9M1CR6HAJ7P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had nothing but problems since I got this phone the memory in it isn't very big so it freezes up constantly.
