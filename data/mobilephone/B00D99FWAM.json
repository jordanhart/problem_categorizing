My next option was the S2 but I went with this phone instead. It's a great bang for your buck. I would call it the baby version of the S3. I am pretty satisfied with it. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a tendency to freeze up/ restart on sometimes. It doesn't happen frequently but when it does happen it's annoying. If I would have paid more for it, it'd be incredibly upsetting. Otherwise, I would recommend this for someone younger; maybe a first smartphone for a preteen or teen that won't cost you too much.UPDATE: Do not buy this phone, I have only had it for about 2 months now and it shuts down more and more. I've already had to do a master reset, and that was the last straw. I think if it wasn't a single core processor it would function better.

It puts the Rise to shame hands down but it does have some quirks. I have had a couple apps crash and setting it up was a pain but so far so good. If you like a lot of apps, text a lot, or are a gamer than this phone will likely not be for you. Jelly Bean doesn't allow moving apps to SD card so you are stuck with a little over 2gb (operating system eats some of the 4gb total). Pretty silly considering I have a 64gb SD card with 59gb free. Stock Samsung keyboard is a little laggy for speed texters but you can try other options (again using some of your 4gb), I happen to be a slow typer so no problem for me. Processor is only 1.4ghz single core so gamers may want to bump up to the Victory for a few dollars more. All in all this phone suits me and my situation. Music sounds better than it did on Rise, the apps I use and internet are a bit faster, and it has a bigger screen and weighs a bit less so I am happy with it.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely solid, reliable phone", "Author": "Paul Gillette", "ReviewID": "R1PEZP0QI2GT9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have no complaints whatsoever.

Then again this one costs $110 versus around $600 and $650 for those.  For best value this is tough to beat.For me the screen is a great size as it fits in my pocket with no issues.The processor is fast but not multi core.  There is a lag getting web pages open even on wifi but it is not bad.  It only has 3g and the processor is fine for that speed.  You'd really want dual core for 4g so you can see the speed benefit over the web.  If you are wanting to be on the web a lot on your phone you would be happier with a dual core and 4g phone.  For me this is fine.Andriod versions are a bit odd in that the newest version is never on any phone for a while.  This is 4.1 and that is the newest widely used Andriod version.  Some phones like the s4 are beginning to have 4.2 now.  The newest actually is 4.3 and that ought to be compatible with apps so this should be fine there.  Andriod can have multiple apps be running at the same time.  Since this is not a multicore processor if you leave things open and running my guess is that reviewers are doing who say the phone freezes up on them.Especially the first couple of days the phone did seemingly randomly reboot several times.  This is because Samsung, Google, and Virgin are all wanting to update certain things on the phone.  The problem is they don't prompt you so you can't just ignore it and reboot later, it just does it.  This really is annoying but it also is not the fault of the phone.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just a friendly reminder, this is not a computer, it is a cell phone", "Author": "Benjamin J.

Due to the state of current technologies, a device of such a size is limited in its capabilities.What you can expect:The length of time in which the battery can go without needing to be recharged will vary based on how you use your phone.* If you use it strictly for phone calls and nothing more, you will experience longer battery life.* If you use it for entertainment purposes (e.g. games, videos, internet), the life of the battery will be significantly shorter.Why? Because you are using it as though it were a computer. Such activities require greater processing power which, in turn, requires more battery power. In other words, the more the processor has to work, the more power it needs.I am 30 and I have witnessed the evolution of the cell phone. If you are 15 and you complain about battery life while using the phone as if it were a computer, you are wasting your breath. You cannot play games or watch videos or browse your favorite websites with the expectation of having to plug your phone in only once every 24 hours. I'm sorry, but mobile phone technology has not yet advanced to such a point where it can run on a 4Ghz CPU  and a 1Ghz GPU with 3Gb of dedicated graphics memory and 32 gigs of system RAM for a duration of no less than 8 hours on a single charge. If that's what you want, you may have to wait a decade or so for it. And by the time that comes around, you'll complain, because you were expecting more.You may need to be reminded that only ten years ago, Snake was one of the most popular games for mobile devices.What you cannot expect:The performance of a PC in the palm of your hand.---With that, and having one of these phones, my phone, charging not 5 feet from me, I would recommend this phone to others.

This is one heck of a durable phone.The drawbacks are the keyboard. Plain and simple. The preemptive technology does not function or is non existent on the touch screen.. making texting rather difficult. The spell checker and suggestions can be turned off to make the screen area bigger, but this results in a million typos. The keyboard should send the majority of a button touch, it does not. The other thing was the alarm clock app.. it really should lock the screen from rotating, because when you wake up to hi snooze the thing is scrolling all over the place and you end up literally chasing the snooze button with your finger. The final drawback was a glitch in the music player, which alows the media player to select the default album cover used in all tracks, from your personal photos!!!! There are horror stories of this all over google, as there is no way to erase that default album artThe phone itself is great.. if your willing to experience some difficulty in texting for an extremely well built phone, this is a great deal.. way way better than any LG phone, and nicer than the iPhone.

I am still going to keep the phone, but I am less impressed over time. There are three things that don't work on this phone: apps2sd, screenshot, and tethering/wifi hotspot. The inability to use all three of those has become an inconvenience, and I think the only way to get around them will be to root it. There is one good thing I can mention, though. The phone has not crashed even once since the one and only crash while I was installing Skype, so I think the update to Android 4.1.2 solved the crashing problem.I wish I had waited one day to buy this because it looks like the Amazon price dropped by $20 since I bought this phone at Radio Shack last night. In any case, so far it seems like a great purchase, even at the higher price.I had my LG Optimus V for three years before the vibrate died and I finally decided it was time to upgrade. I debated between this and the Optimus F3 and finally decided on this one because of the front-facing camera and increased internal memory. The difference, so far, has been phenomenal. The V was my first smart phone, so I have a limited frame of reference, but I can definitely highlight the ways that this phone is better than the Optimus V. Here are my pros and cons so far. Both are based on my comparison with the Optimus VPROS1. It has an LED flash/flashlight. Optimus V had nothing like that.2. It has plenty of internal memory (2GB, versus only 140MB in the V)3. It has a bigger screen. Holding them side-by-side at the store, the difference didn't look substantial, but after using the Galaxy Ring for a couple days, the screen size difference is definitely noticeable.4. It plays video and music sound on both the front and rear speakers. The Optimus V only played sound on the rear speaker, which meant I would have to leave it propped up or face-down if I was listening to something.5. It has a MUCH faster processor (1.4GHz versus 600MHz in the V). I have not seen any lag yet, whereas the V would have a lag of sometimes several seconds when opening an app or the browser. I even had the V rooted and overclocked but it still had lag issues.6. Newer version of Android. I did the Android update as soon as I turned on the phone, so I am running 4.1.2. That will enable me to run some apps that the V just couldn't handle.CONS - I don't have many cons yet but I will update this if anything else come up. The few cons that I have found are why I gave the phone 4 stars.1. Slippery case. The V felt secure in my hand, but this Galaxy Ring feels very slippery and I am constantly worried I am going to drop it. I have ordered a protective case for it just to combat this problem. I didn't need a case for the V.2. Battery life. I must admit that the V had terrible battery life at first too, but there were lots of options for extended life batteries for the V. So far, I haven't found any such options for the Ring. If someone knows of an extended battery available for the Ring, please let me know. With the extended battery on the V, I could get two full days of use before a charge. This one has only been unplugged from the charger for 3 hours, and I have already used 20% of the battery life just by checking email, facebook, reading a news article, and installing Skype. We shall see if it even makes it a full day.3. Crashing. So far it has only crashed one time, while I was setting up Skype, but it is worth mentioning.4. Things are too spread out. This might just be a matter of me getting used to the larger screen, but it seems I cannot reach both the trash can icon in the upper right corner and the menu button in the bottom left without adjusting my grip. I may just have to get used to holding the phone a different way, but so far that has been an inconvenience.5. Once in a great while the speaker sound will sound scratchy.

The sound clarity is very good, even with my Koss Pro headphones (see review) plugged in.Connecting it to my car stereo was way too easy, & linked, they work great together. Better than having satellite radio (depending on your app, of course).Every now & again there is a glitch, but all electronic devices have those.

We made many, many phone calls to Virgin Mobile to try to work through problems.I was forced to replace the phone, using a credit from Virgin Mobile to help with the cost.I love Virgin Mobile and we've used them for years, but this is the worst phone by far that I have ever used.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Regret getting this phone...", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "R1D5R19C72QOZ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Virgin Mobile has been great, and their pricing is hard to beat! Unfortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is frustratingly bad. I've had mine for just over 6 months.

When I mailed it to them, I included a note asking that they also check the speaker because it would squelch and phone call were often hard to hear. Well, presumably because that wasn't in the initial work order, they didn't do anything about the speaker. Now I can barely have any phone conversations because the squelching is so bad when the other person is speaking. And my only option is to ship it to Samsung for additional repairs. Yeah, that it tremendously inconvenient, not to  mention I still have to pay for the phone service for the 7-10 days that Samsung has it.

Music also sounds distorted. So I called Amazon and got a refund and ordered another one. Customer service was great and refund and delivery of new phone was fast, which makes me feel a little bad because due to working very long hours for like two weeks straight I have not had time to return the old one which sits packaged and labeled, ready to be sent out Monday morning. Of course I did say \"a little bad\". I'm actually quite frustrated that I not only had to go through the steps of activating a new phone, and anyone who has done so knows the time it takes to do that plus download all their apps, transfer music, etc., etc., but I had to do it all again for the new one WHICH HAS THE SAME DEFECT! so I will have to do this all over again. Luckily Amazon has great customer service, because if not I'd be rantin' and ravin', instead I just wanted anyone who goes to order a Samsung Ring that getting two in a row with speaker defects tells me never to buy one again. So now I have to contact Amazon again and this time I'm using my refund towards an upgrade by purchasing either the LTE or if someone purchases off my wishlist the S3 I can give the refund to that person.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions.

These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now.
