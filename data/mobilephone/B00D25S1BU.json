So it comes to $3 more than face value. Here you are paying $65 for a $50 or $55 card, plus $5 shipping?????  If you buy this, it would explain why the seller is selling it, because people are buying them at this price.If I give you a $5 dollar bill, will you give me a $20 dollar bill in return?

I paid $69.95 for the thing. So yesterday I get an email from them saying they refunded $5.00 to me. I thought that they perhaps changed their minds and figured they were selling the cards for too much money. In the mail today, comes the card, and low and behold - they sent me a computer printout of a pin number for $50.00.If they can do a printout for $50, why not $55. I most definitely will NOT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. If there was some reason they could not print out a $55 card, they should not be advertising that they do, and they should have canceled the order since pin numbers are not refundable.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "You got what you paid for", "Author": "diane", "ReviewID": "R2C0KOIVWXAEOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The minutes work.
