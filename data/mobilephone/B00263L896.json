Took less than a week to ship and arrived right on time.  Bought mine used from \"Teczilla\" and it was in better condition than I expected; it hardly shows any signs of use.  It's an unlocked AT&T; phone and works with my T-mobile SIM card.  It has a setup wizard that provides everything you need for basic setup.  The price is great, even if you are buying it new.  I will edit or comment this review in about 2-3 weeks to confirm my satisfaction as that seems to be when most defective phones start to act up.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was very Surprised !", "Author": "Georgia Gibson \"Georgie\"", "ReviewID": "R2PD4CL5VP2UWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter kept breaking and losing phones so I  thought it would be a better idea to by just a cheap phone .

I ordered on a Friday, and wasn't expecting them to arrive for a week, but they were on my doorstep in Arkansas the next Monday afternoon.  Nice.  They were well packaged with everything separated by bubble rack.  Both phones looked new inside and out and had protective peel-off film on screen and back.  Put them together with the two batteries that were included and put them on to charge overnight.  Next day, still nothing but the battery with a red slash emblem on the screen.  Fortunately, my wife (who I bought these for) still had her old Blackberry batteries and when we put them in both phones fired right up as normal.  Keep in mind these were genuine Blackberry batteries that hadn't been charged in over a year (but weigh twice as much as the included batteries).So far, both of them are working great, but the battery thing was a bit annoying.  I thought the $40 price was fair, especially considering how good they looked upon arrival, and I wouldn't have minded paying something more for a good battery.  If my wife hadn't had those available, I'd have had to drop $34 at my local battery store for one I knew to be fresh (Li-Ion batteries age in their packages from the time of manufacture, which is why you can get some many online super cheap).", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad key", "Author": "bao", "ReviewID": "R28D3SZOVU07S9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The little white circle in the middle doesn't function right.
