There maybe some wait (a couple of weeks) while buying via google play, but the wait saves you a hundred dollars or more. Its your pick!**Update September/2013 ***The pricing difference between amazon and google play isn't as significant as it was when the phone was launched in late 2012.Still enjoying the phone, the battery still runs good, the screen hasn't had any scratches and it still feels almost like a new phone. Guess I ll be skipping the upgrade this November and maybe buy a Nexus 10 instead :-)**********************************************************************************************************Ever since the concept of smartphones came out, there has been a talk of this so called 'convergence'; Wherein you own one device which can practically do everything under the sun. With the Nexus-4, I think the so called convergence is here, well almost. The only thing that is still lacking is the camera, since I don't see it replacing my DSLR (or even a really good point & shoot). Of course, this shouldn't be taken as a negative point for the phone since I don't think there isn't any other phone which could do the same (The IOS religious fanatics would disagree, but I don't think the Iphone camera comes close to DSLR quality either). Apart from that, the phone does perform rather well in all the other departments. Jellybean is the best Android flavor so far, the UI is great, the experience is smooth and apps in the google play store are abundant. Battery life is decent, engine horse power is phenomenal (Thanks to Qcom) and the Network data speeds are great. A brief summary of points follows:a) LTE or Not! : The phone doesn't support LTE, but supports HSPA+ which some (T-mobile) still tout as 4G. If you are on T-mobile, getting the phone is a no brainer, since you will get the best speeds that their network can provide. AT&T; is a different story, AT&T; supports both HSPA+ and 4g LTE. It has been stated by multiple reviewers that AT&T;'s LTE is much faster than their HSPA+ network (this makes logical sense since for AT&T; LTE is the latest buzzword and they probably want to promote it over HSPA+). The other fact is that AT&T;'s HSPA+ is slower than T-mobile's HSPA+ network and it is suggested that T-mobile's HSPA+ may be comparable to AT&T;'s LTE. To keep it short, this phone will give you the best experience on T-mobile although you should be able to get decent speeds on AT&T; as well. (The phone won't work on Verizon or other CDMA networks).b) Cost of the phone: I purchased mine from google where it retails for a standard price of $350 (plus taxes and shipping). Some people may compare this price to the contract price of an iphone (or other android smart phones), but that's not a fair comparison. Most contracts factor in the cost of the phone in the plan and by rough estimates an average customer pays around 20$/month for getting the phone subsidized. Multiply this by 24 for a 2 year contract and you are paying 480$ over a 2 year cycle and that's over & above the initial downpayment of 200$. That's a total price of 680$!! T-mobile for sure gives you a discount if you opt out of the phone and other carriers may have similar plans. The other thing which adds to  your monthly payments is the tax on wireless plans. In the great state of Texas the monthly tax for cell phone plans comes to 17%. So if you have a monthly plan which is higher in cost, you also end up paying higher tax on it. (Compare this with 8% sales tax that you pay when you buy the device up front. Even if you assume that the total cost of the device to the customer is the same, whether purchased via contract or by full downpayment, the contract options leads to a higher tax on the buyer. Ofcourse, the contract plans never really disclose the full picture so you never get to do the maths).c) Connecting to a TV: The Nexus 4 doesn't have a mini HDMI, what it does have is a micro usb which supports slimport. You can buy a slimport HDMI adapter for under 30$ and connect your Nexus 4 to your TV (In contrast to the Nexus 7 tablet which purportedly doesn't support slimport). The other emerging standard is 'Miracast' which would enable one to wirelessly stream the display to a Miracast enabled TV. (Don't worry if you have an older generation TV, the market will be soon be seeing a flood of Miracast adapters which can convert an old TV into Miracast compliant using the HDMI port).Once the connection to TV is sorted out, I think the phone can work as a good replacement to a gaming console or a streaming device. You can play high quality games (and the games on google play are much cheaper than their console brethren)or watch movies/tv on Netflix.The only drawback, there won't be Amazon prime instant videos on this. You can watch Amazon instant videos using the browser of the phone, but Amazon doesn't allow instant videos to be displayed in HD on Android devices. (It does allow that on IOS or custom devices which support the amazon app or on the kindle fire). I guess that's just Amazon's marketing strategy.d) Camera: The camera is decent, comes with an led flash, but isn't something that would blow my mind away.Overall, it's a very good phone at an amazing price point. No wonder it's sold out on google and selling at a premium on Amazon. I will continue updating the review as I spend more time with the phone. Do check back later and if you find the review helpful, please vote on the helpful review button. (It gives me the much needed encouragement to take time off from my busy work schedule and write lengthy reviews)***Update***I have had this phone for a few days now and I'm quite satisfied. There are a couple of points to note though, the phone does have a tendency to slip out of one's hands (it maybe the larger size and slippery surfaces), so a protective case is necessary. I use the SF Matte Black - Rearth Ringke SLIM for LG Google Nexus 4 Soft Feeling Premium Hard Case - ECO Package [Revised Version] case. It's a hard back case with a soft feel and covers the back and the sides. It's slim enough to be unnoticeable, however unlike the google certified nexus 4 bumper, this one does cover the beautiful back of the phone. It's also slightly loose around the volume button, but at half the cost of the google nexus 4 bumper and available without delay, its not a bad deal.Camera Quality: People have commented on comparing the camera quality of this vis-a-vis the iphone-5. I haven't had time to do tests myself, but on doing some research online, it is suggested that the Iphone5 camera is perhaps slightly better than the one on this. This is particularly more for color tint and saturation than for the actual sharpness of the image. I believe this is nothing that cannot be fixed by future software updates.***Update-2 : Feb/2013 **The camera app is noticeably buggy. In some cases I have seen that the blue camera button refuses to work till you exit the camera app and restart it again. I've also had the flash freeze while it's on. Issues are not that frequent and easily resolvable, but this now appears to be a genuine bug on Android Jelly Bean. I hope google has a fix soon, it can be a source of potential embarrassment when it hits as you are trying to show it off to the iphone cult!Some other points which I've noticed which are plus points for the Nexus 4:  a) Wireless charging support; No official charger is out there yet, but some models which support the nexus 4 exist. It's much more convenient to just place the phone on a charging mat/surface rather than plugging it in.  b) NFC tags: The phone supports NFC. There isn't much commercial use of it till now (NFC payments hasn't really kicked in), but there are some nice things you can do with NFC tags. For around 15$ you can buy a set of 15 tags which can then be customized such that the Nexus performs a specific action when it's near them. (For instance you can program and stick a tag in your car, such that when you enter the car, the bluetooth and gps is automatically turned on and the wifi is turned off. Helps in extending battery life by switching the appropriate antennas at the right time). More on these later, when I actually get to try them out.**** Update-3: 20/Feb/2013 **With the latest upgrade of JellyBean, the camera bug seems to be resolved.

Burkhouse", "ReviewID": "R1CHPJYTY13PB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Nexus 4 from Google for $350. It tool about three hours of retrying on there web page. When I ordered it said it would ship in two to three weeks but it was on my door step in two.My last phone was an IPhone 4 on AT&T.; I just shut it down removed the SIM, inserted the SIM in the Nexus 4 and started it. That was all there was to it, no calls to support or fiddling with setting, it just worked. The screen is great and the GUI is super smooth. I did find I had to buy two apps. Air Play by Double Twist allows the phone to wirelessly sync play lists with Itunes on my iMAC.  HD Widgets allows the creation nice custom widgets to manage bluetooth, Wifi and ringer settings. I have had this phone for almost two weeks and the more I use the phone the more I like it. It is much easier to manage my apps and track down which is doing what in the background. At first I thought the battery might be an issue but that seems to be getting better, I got rid of Yahoo Weather and that helped a lot, it pounds the network and GPS constantly. Signal strength is at least and good as the IPhone 4 with WiFi and 3G and way better with bluetooth. The phone works well and there have been no issues with hearing or being heard. The camer works well and takes nice pictures but i don't thing it is as good as the IPhone 4s or 5. The flash is much more powerful then the one on my IPhone 4.The stock phone is a bit slippery and there are very few cases available thus far. I tried a soft TPU case which fit fine but felt crappy so when the Google Nexus 4 bumper came back in stock I got one of those. The bumper from Google is way nicer than I expected. It has a real metal band around the outside and the buttons work and feel even better than the stock phone buttons. The bumper makes the phone very easy to hold on to and has metal around the USB and headphone jacks that make plugs easier to find without looking without preventing any plug I have tried from being fully inserting.I have no regrets about switching and have no plan to go back.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A well made device with amazing performance", "Author": "Kion S", "ReviewID": "R3R1UY3L7LFLPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just some background,I am coming from the original Galaxy S i9000, which was the flagship phone of 2010I was eagerly awaiting the next nexus device for quite a few months. My previous phone had its screen cracked from a fall around July, and overall, I was starting to get anxious to be back with the latest and greatest, instead of being stuck with a 2+ year old phone.I just received the phone yesterday evening, so essentially, these points are from the perspective of someone who has been using the phone for less than a day.ProsThe build quality of the phone is great.It feels like a premium device, despite its no-nonsense, straightforward look. Essentially, the out of box feel was a very pleasant one. This is, of course, a subjective point, but several other friends and co-workers had the same reaction to seeing the physical device, so I think it's safe to say that my opinion on the build quality isn't unique.Large memory means apps stay open.This device has 2 GB of memory. What that means in real world usage is that recently used apps don't seem to close that often. On my old phone, if I was browsing the web, switched to the Message app to send a text, switch to a couple other applications to do other things and then switched back to the browser, the browser would have to reload the page because the other applications kicked it out from memory. That doesn't really happen on this phone. I can't speak for games that are generally larger and take up a lot more memory, but I had up to 20 apps `open' at one point, and was able to quickly switch between them without any of them having to reload.That leads to the second observation...Everything is quickThis is partly due to the specs of the device - it has a high end quad core processor and gpu so things generally load up very quickly. But also, because of the large memory, most things don't have to reload if you switch to some other task and switch back, so it makes multi-tasking a remarkably quick and enjoyable affair.Screen is beautifulThe applications seem to sit directly on the screen, rather than behind it, due to the very little space between the screen and the glass. Coming from a device with an Amoled screen, at first the colours seemed washed out, but after a few hours of allowing your eyes to adjust, you appreciate the beauty of the more natural looking colours, and amoled screens seem loud and over-colorful in comparison.ConsNo expandable memoryThis concerns me just a little, but I had a 16gig sd card in my old Galaxy S, and I simply never used used it. At all. And that phone had 8GB of internal memory, so I think I will be ok. But this is the one issue that has me just a tiny bit uneasyUnlock key hard to reach for a left hander - big annoyance. I know the majority of the world is right handed, but I got used to holding my old phone in my left hand with every button within easy reach due to the size of the device. With the nexus 4, somehow, hitting that power button is just a little bit too difficult to do one-handed.... Not impossible, mind you, but difficult enough that I notice it. This issue may become a non-issue with time as I get used to the device, but it's worth mentioning for any potential left-handed buyers.The size of the screen is also just a little too big to comfortably use one handed, which again, I will probably get used to, but is annoying enough that I notice it a lot. This isn't only a negative though, because I enjoy the size of the screen when it comes to actually looking at and using the device and would probably appreciate an even bigger one. So, this annoyance is something I'm comfortable ignoring since I prefer the added screen real estate.No toggle widgets in the notification tray (WiFi, GPS, etc)They are reachable via shortcuts, but it would be nice to simply have a simple toggle switch right there in the notification tray. This is not a big deal, just a minor annoyance, but worth pointing out.Battery life doesn't seem fantasticI can't speak for how well the phone really performs battery-wise until I've used it for a couple of weeks, but the initial experience with the battery usage is a bit underwhelming. I'm assuming that once the battery meter is properly calibrated, this will noticeably improve though, so I will update this portion of the review in 2 or 3 weeks.Finally, no LTEThis is a non-issue for me, since LTE is not available in my area, but it is worth pointing out for those that have that option that may be disappointed by this news.Upon looking at the review, one may get the impression that this is a negative review of the Nexus 4. It's not. The performance of this thing is top notch and makes using the phone an absolute pleasure. Everything just works, and coming from the Galaxy S, where the GPS never worked reliably and the I/O performance was flaky resulting in random hiccups in the user interface, it's definitely been a huge pleasure to switch to this device.I can't say that it is a device without compromises, but the performance of it makes the tradeoffs of no LTE or expandable storage a no-brainer decision for myself.  Unless LTE is important, or you know that 16 GB is just not enough storage, I cannot recommend this device any more heartily.Update: Looking back after 2 months of use, without a doubt, this was a great purchase.It is well performing device, and does it so effortlessly that i no longer even notice how well it performs, until i use another phone as a comparison point.The size of the device no longer bothers me - after spending some time with it, i can now comfortably use it one-handed, and do so 90% of the time.The power button issue also has gone away as i've gotten used to its location and how best to reach it while holding the phone one-handed.Up until last week, the battery life was still nothing to talk about, but the recent update to 4.2.2 seems to have changed that in a very positive way. I generally unplug my phone around 6 am in the morning, and usually, i would plug it back in to charge for an hour or so at some point during the day to ensure it will last for my 30 minute walk home. This week, after getting the update, i seem to be getting home comfortably with about 30% battery remaining, without that midday charge, which is great. So, if that holds up, the battery life will also cease to be an issue.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R33IKFYZ5N6ISG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own this phone, but I bought it from the Google Play Store. The prices from resellers are ridiculous! It goes for $349 before tax and shipping. Don't even think about paying more than $400 for this device. Yes, it is worth a lot more, but I'd allow for Google to get their stock back up from LG before considering purchasing.1. Build Quality: This is without a doubt the most comfortable phone I have ever held. It's glass front and back sandwiching a smooth grippy edging makes for one enjoyable handholding experience. It's not too light and not too heavy. It is a little wide if you use a bumper, but on it's own it feels really good in average to large-size hands. The curved front is extremely smooth and once you swipe across it a few times, you will never want to go back. It's that good. I will say though that the phone gets HOT when downloading a lot of videos, and gets pretty warm when playing games for an extended period of time. If the back were made out of plastic it would be less of a problem- I guess you are trading off practicality for elegance that situation. The faint checkered back breaks up the \"black slab\" appearance of the phone, and looks good, but it's not a game-changer. WIth the glass back, the tapered edges, and the grippy sides, you'll be tempted to NOT own a case.  This is one elegant phone! Just don't drop it. Glass breaks.2. Android 4.2 -  Enough has been said about Android. If you're looking at this device, then you probably already know that this OS is the most flexible, and powerful OS around. The difference is that you get fast updates vs. other Android phones, and it is VERY stable and crashes less than any other phone I've used. The phone is extremely smooth and I have yet to see lag, even with multiple widgets on several screens. . Even though Photosphere panorama is cool, you won't find yourself using it much. Google Now is a really useful tool once you have it set up correctly (it can seem to read your mind), and the new camera filters and editing options are awesome. I think they dropped the ball with the lock screen widgets since you can only set up 1 per swipe/screen, and very few widgets are actually supported. Facial unlock is super-fast now and is my preferred way of securing and unlocking my phone now. The clock app is greatly improved with adding back the timer and stopwatch that were missing from previous builds. You can even set world times. The quick setting shade is NOT as useful as just dropping a toggle widget on the screen, but some people may prefer the option.  Android 4.2 is SMOOOOOOTHH and buttery. The stock calendar app & widget blows every other calendar app and widget out of the water.3. Cameras- The camera is not all that great. Even though it is 8mp shooter, the pics come out grainy and not much better than the Galaxy Nexus. Video looks good and the audio recording sounds solid. The front facing camera underperforms significantly- even though it is 1.3mp. One bug that is still there is if you have a Picasa account set up and a Google Plus account, it will duplicate photo folders pretty horrendously. That's more Android's fault than the camera, but it is a unique problem for Nexus phones. I'd say pictures taken on the N4 are at best 20% better the GNexus.4. Speaker- The speakerphone sounds pretty good. It still has that tinny smartphone sound with a lack of bass, but that's par for the course. It's much louder than the Galaxy Nexus. Calls sound crisp and clean.5. NFC- I'm just now getting into using NFC. Radioshack, Macy's, Old Navy, OfficeMax and many other stores can take Google Wallet's \"tap and pay\" service. What I think you will get more millage out of is by using NFC tags. You can get them on Amazon. Basically you can set up spots in you home/car/work where you can tap the phone and have useful profiles activate. Check out CNET or Youtube to see how you might use them. If another family member or friend has NFC, you can easily share stuff by holding the phones together. It's MUCH faster and efficient than \"Bump\" and bluetooth.6. The screen- The screen is absolutely gorgeous! It is bright and colorful. Very accurate images. Since it is a 720p 320ppi screen, you have to stare very closely to see any pixels. Basically, you need a microscope to see any jagged edges. Letters are extremely sharp and clear. The only issues are that if you are coming from an AMOLED phone like the Galaxy Nexus, the blacks aren't nearly as deep and you will notice it. Also, the screen gets washed out a bit when viewing from the side, rather than maintaining contrast.7. Battery life. The phone will last you a day with light use (quick use of apps/widgets and plenty of texting/Facebook, with live wallpapers ON), 9 hours with moderate use (a few calls, some extended app use, and a GPS mapping trip), and 5 hours with heavy downloading, photo taking, and gameplaying. Better than the Galaxy Nexus.8. Multicolored Notification light- Good in theory, but Android doesn't use it well and the LightFlow app is still not reaching it's potential.9. HSPA+ 42. This is a 4G phone. Don't believe the techsnobs who try to act as if this is \"3G+\" or some such nonsense. On T-Mobile this phone flies, and downloads at speeds 6 times faster than what you would get with a 3G phone. I get an average of 12mbps and higher in good reception spots. That's fast enough to download most apps in a couple of seconds, and to play 1080p HD video with no lag or stuttering whatsoever. Is it as fast as LTE? No, but depending on where you are, it can be just as fast, with no additional battery drain. Also, the Nexus 4 has an LTE antenna which can use T-Mobile's AWS bands when they are repurposed for LTE this year (2013). That won't help you if you are on ATT, since ATT uses a different frequency for their LTE. When T-Mobile lights up LTE in your city, Google \"Configure Your Nexus 4 for LTE Access Point\" and you'll have access to their LTE.The bottom line is that it's not a perfect phone, but the phone is amazing regardless, and the best phone on the market right now. The only thing I miss is the lacking expandable memory of phones like the GS3.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Find a better unlocked phone for this price... heck, for twice the price... I dare you.", "Author": "The Mad Shopper \"emfroggy\"", "ReviewID": "R15X41MR74B7QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK.. So like everyone else on here, I bought mine directly from the Google Play Store. As mentioned - it is quite a bit cheaper there. And now that they have gotten past the original supply shortages, you can order your phone and have it in hand by the end of the week. Maybe not Amazon Prime fast - but what is? :-)I've had this phone for a little over a month and can honestly say its the best phone I've ever had - maybe even the best piece of technology period. And for the price (even if you buy through Amazon), you will not find a better device. Not only are the specs incredible (quad-core processor, 2gb ram, etc).. but pure android is a joy to use. Especially since Google's project butter smoothed things out. Prior to that, pure android still had some weird lag (maybe not the right word for it) when navigating the phone. No such problems here however.The are only a couple of drawbacks to this phone that I would communicate to those looking to buy. These weren't issues for me, but I know some others might want/expect these features.1. No memory card expansion. If you are an android user, chances are you have a device that you can insert a memory card into. This phone does not have that. This is not an issue for me because all of my media (music, pics, docs) are stored in their respective cloud containers (google music, google+, google drive). But for those that prefer to keep things off the cloud, you will find 16gb might not be enough storage. Totally a preference thing but worth noting nonetheless.2. No LTE (sort of). The phone technically speaking is capable of 4g LTE and, before the 4.2.2 version of Jelly Bean, their were some nerds - I use this term affectionately - that were able to mod the phone to connect to LTE. Otherwise, the fastest network you can connect to is T-Mobile's HSPA+. If you think you need LTE, you are just being picky. HSPA+ is plenty fast depending on where you live, which of course holds true for LTE as well. I regularly get download speeds of 15kbps and up on HSPA+.. and the network is very fast - im not sure I'd be able to tell the difference in day to day usage (maybe only when downloading movies and other large files).All that said - I have a $30/mo plan with T-mobile that give me unlimited data (first 5gb at HSPA+), unlimited text, and 100 minutes per month. I user skype to get around the minutes issue so 100 is plenty.Bottom Line:Do your self a favor and buy this phone for $350 and go to T-Mobile and get the $30 prepaid plan. You'll get a fast network on a ridiculous phone (has brains and beauty) without having to give your first born to Verizon/AT&T; for something that the average user won't actually need.God Speed.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like the difference between a 1962 VW bug and a 2011 Porsche Targa", "Author": "Stephen Witte", "ReviewID": "R1KYDLSG8N4EOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "O.K. This is my first \"Smart Phone\".  Yes, I had a \"Blackberry 8820\" which could, sort of, go on the web.  It would lock up if I went anywhere except a few websites that were o.k.The difference between the Nexus 4 and the Blackberry is about like the difference between a 1962 VW bug and a 2011 Porsche Targa.  The Nexus 4 does everything with such smooth silkiness that it is a dream come true.  Everything works.  I never \"downloaded\" an \"app\" until now, but it is so easy, like falling off a log.I have created a Google list of people by uploading my Outlook contact list to the Google website, and instantly, all the contacts are available in the new Nexus 4.  Incidentally, I've had the Nexus 4 for about a week now.I've answered email, placed stock buys, sent SMS txt messages, bought stuff on Amazon, and generally had a really fun time with this phone!You will have to have some patience dealing with Google Play store.  They were the worst buying experience I ever had.  However, the phone is so good, I don't really mind.  Expect delays of a month or more to get the phone.  Go to Walmart and buy a $10 dollar phone to tide you over if you need something right away.  This phone is worth the wait.Also, regarding the business of lack of LTE, I haven't noticed anything.  If the phone gets a signal, the data rates are plenty fast for me to watch U tube videos, play Pandora, etc.  If not, then I get nothing at all.  Usually, it simply works.Also, regarding 8 Gbytes of memory vs 16 Gbytes, I bought the 16 Gbyte because every review I read strongly encouraged that.  However, I still have about 11 Gbytes free and don't anticipate getting anywhere near to using all this memory.  Perhaps I'm just used to the 8820 blackberry and haven't figured out how to consume memory in large chunks yet.  If you bought the 8 Gbyte model, be happy, it's fine.I love the phone and would recommend it to anyone, but only at the $ three hundred and fifty dollar price directly from Google.Addendum 12 29 2012:  I should have mentioned something about the cell phone provider that I use.  It is T-Mobile, their $30 a month plan for 5 Gbytes of data + 100 free minutes + unlimited texting.  This is a prepaid plan, which required some negotiation with T-Mobile because I was already with them prior to getting this plan.  If you look at the fine print, they have this plan for new customers only.  I simply explained to them that it wouldn't be a problem if they couldn't provide that plan to me as Virgin Mobile had a similar plan for $35 a month but included 300 minutes.  So long T-Mobile, but the gentlemen quickly said \"wait a minute\" we can provide you with you want, no need to switch.This is what an \"unlocked\" phone is all about:  NO MORE $60 or $80 or $100 a month plans.

With that out of the way, let me say I've been using this phone for about 3 days now as I managed to score one when they went back in stock on the play store.BUILD QUALITY The phone itself seems very solid, It features a rubberize metal frame with Gorilla Glass 2 front and back plates.  The phone is built much like the iPhone 4 and 4s line and like those phones the Nexus 4 also features a non-removable battery.  No real complaints over all with the build quality.SPECIAL FEATURES  The three biggest features the phone adds, in my opinion, are NFC with Google Wallet support, Wireless Charging, and Wireless display / Mirracast (this might be the first Google Device with Airplay style Screen Redirection).Google claims that 200,000 locations are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) and setup to use their wallet for payment services.  I haven't seen one yet but, I haven't really activated Google Wallet yet either.Wireless Charging is really cool but, as of right now the optional accessories required for the feature are pretty pricey and I cannot see myself spending $70+ for a piece of hardware to charge my phone when I have the plug that came with it for free.  I might consider buying a few of these if they were say, $30 each.Wireless display has been around awhile and the Android version is Mirracast, this is cool and it is an open standard so more devices than just Google TV will support it.  This will be really cool in the future but, right now it is a work in progress.DISPLAY  I am not somebody who felt that the iPhone display was the best on the market, as it clearly was not and hasn't been in some time...  With that said, this phone again took a page from Apple's book as LG went with a 300+ PPI, IPS based Display.  After using AMOLED for the past several years, I'm honestly disappointed in the Display.  Yes the display is sharp, bright, and overall very nice.  However, compared to AMOLED it has poor black levels, color saturation, and battery efficiency.  To me, this is a step back from the Galaxy Nexus and it's a shame.PERFORMANCE  This might be the only quad core S4 Krait based phone in North America (I cannot think of another at this time) and as a result, the CPUs are likely the fastest around (yes faster than the iPhone) but, the use of an Adreno 320 GPU makes it a decent performer but, not the best in terms of Graphics.  Overall, a very smooth phone that will not have any issues running the latest apps and games but, it could have been better.NETWORK PERFORMANCE  The Nexus 4 is an HSPA+42 GSM based phone and for what it is, the performance is great.  HSPA+ is good but, it is no LTE so if that matters to you, then steer clear of the Nexus...  For me, I use Net10 on the AT&T; Network and I really have no issues with the speed as long as I can have unlimited Data for a low fee.  This is pretty much a wash until Carriers return unlimited data connections with LTE speeds.CAMERAS  This is a tough one, I never really think much of the Video-Conference cameras as most get the job down pretty well and the Nexus is no exception.  The actual still / video camera on the phone is another issue...  I find the camera to be among the best in modest to bright sunlight but, less than ideal in lower light.  Of course, just about everyone else has included some form of stabilization in their main cameras and this is sadly something the Nexus is lacking.  Overall, they're very good cameras.SOUND  Sound is solid and I have no complaints, I don't really see this as a strength or a weakness of this phone.BATTERY LIFE  Wow, this is certainly not the strongest point for the phone!  Out of the box, the phone might get you through 8 to 10 hours of heavy intermittent use but, it is not an all day beast by any means.  I had to turn off Google's Maps and Latitude Service as that is a huge drain, it is like running Apple's find my phone with the phone reporting in every few minutes and of course turning off the GPS is a must as well.  To me, knowing there are no battery cases, and knowing you have some pretty intensive features in the OS would make the non-removable battery a suspect decision.  This might be the biggest weakness of the phone.SOFTWARE  Android Jellybean is simply the best and most feature rich OS on the market and there's not much to add to that.  The phone came unlocked and contract free so there's no skins or malware installed on the unit.Google Hangouts is far better than FaceTime as you can have 9 people on the same video chat at once.Google Maps trumps Apple Maps by a mile.Google Chrome much more feature rich than Safari.Mobile Hot spot, being an unlocked phone makes for an unlocked Hot Spot and that is a huge benefit of this handset.CONCLUSSION  It is a nice phone but, I really hate that these companies are going so far after the iPhone features that they fail to exclude many of the weaknesses!  Samsung was pretty bad at this but, at least they left most of it in software and adjusted for the hardware.  With LG creating a phone that has a Glass front / back plate, a sealed battery, and an IPS Display just seems like they've included too many of the negatives of the iPhone and taken a the Nexus line a few steps back in some areas.Now, let me say I've only been using the phone for a few days but, this isn't my first smartphone.  Do I like the phone?  Yes, I like it a lot!  Do I love the phone? I think it is too early to say, as there certainly are features that are problematic to me.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Google Nexus 4 - Good, not great.", "Author": "Timothy Rupright", "ReviewID": "RJPSUKZZS1919", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the unlocked Nexus 4 in order to buy in to the T-Mobile 5GB data plan ($30 w/ 100 minutes).  Previously I had an LG Optimus S for over three years...it was a decent phone that was built like a tank, but the lack on internal memory finally became just too much.The Nexus 4 is a nice looking piece of hardware and feels pretty solid in hand.  I haven't had a problem with scratching, but I installed the Skinomi TechSkin - LG Nexus 4 Screen Protector Ultra Clear Shield + Full Body Protective Skin + Lifetime Warranty on the front and back and purchased the Nexus 4 bumper from Google.  Together they make a great encasement for the phone - and the bumper actually makes it easier to hit the power/volume buttons.Performance - it is quick, snappy, and can do pretty much anything you would like in a very short period of time.  I like the integration with Google+ and GoogleNow is a pretty neat service.  The interface is smooth and simple...I love it.  The texting/swiping feature is way more accurate and intuitive than my old phone's Swype feature.Screen - The screen is nice, crisp and a really good size for viewing web pages in landscape mode.  I've found that it is almost easier to read text on the Nexus 4 than it is on my tablet or (admittedly old) 15\" computer screen.  Streaming video is clear and crisp as well.  Side angle viewing is not great - at about 30 degrees you experience notable dimming of objects on screen.Call Quality is clear and vastly superior to my old Sprint phone.  I have no problems with dropped calls or distortion even though T-Mobile's coverage here is somewhat spotty.The biggest negative I can share is that I'm very disappointed with the camera.  The HDR mode is useless unless you're taking a picture of a still life scene.  When I attempted to use it in an action sequence (my son on a bounce house type thing) I got some crazy ghosting/negative space image that was totally unrecognizable as a human.  In the standard photo option I have been observing obvious graininess and pixelation even when taking photos of stationary people/objects.  The video camera is all right, but don't count on it for clear images of rapid motion (a video of my son in the same bounce house is pixellated and overall poor quality).  Hopefully this can be fixed in a future update as I do use my phone camera frequently.***UPDATE 4/3/13***Perhaps my initial criticism of the camera was a little too harsh.  I am finding that under well-lit conditions, the camera performs well in the standard mode.  I haven't attempted to use the HDR mode again given poor earlier results.  Low-light is a little dicey and is where I see the most graininess in photos.  The video mode works much better in well-lit environments as well.  It's still far from perfect (lack of stability control is probably a prime contributor), but it is good for most environments in which you'd be taking photos.************If the camera met even my minimal standards this would be a 5-star smartphone.  It's a joy to use for 95% of its functions.  If you rely on your phone to be your only camera I would buy the Nexus 4, take it for a test run and determine whether it's for you or not.  If you don't care about the camera it is a no-brainer for an Android phone.  The only other phone that came close in my opinion is the Lumia 920 - also a great phone if you prefer the Windows ecosystem.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus 4 is one of the best android phones, but not without its drawbacks", "Author": "Harry Chan \"Harry\"", "ReviewID": "R356562MVS6YNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost, as other reviewers have mentioned: do not buy this phone from Amazon as it costs less buying directly from Google play.  Also, this review will be long and somewhat incoherent, but I'll try my best to cover as much as I can about this phone.A little bit of information about me, I am a computer hobbyist whose first venture into the realm of smart phones is the Nexus 4.  Yes, it's been a long time coming, but I've never felt compelled to join the ranks of mobile tech enthusiasts until now, and the reason boils mainly down to the fact that the Nexus 4 is, at least in my opinion, the best bang for the buck you can get within the vast selection of Android smartphones out there.The hardware, even now, is still top of the line when it comes to the combination of processor, GPU, and the 2GB RAM.  It's far ahead of its time relative to the software optimized for it, given the fact that the iPhone 5 can match and even exceed the Nexus 4 in various benchmarks, despite the iPhone 5 having inferior hardware and less RAM.  Therefore, people who opt to purchase this phone won't find it crucial to move up to the next one for quite some time, unless they want the absolute bleeding edge of technology.  One important thing to note is that, because smartphones in general lack any sort of self-cooling system or even a heatsink to quickly disperse the heat elsewhere, doing CPU and GPU intensive tasks will heat the phone up quickly and can cause system throttling, which lowers the performance of the phone in order to preserve the life span of the components and the battery.The built in microphone quality, as far as phone calls goes, has been clear enough for my purposes.  I don't expect too much out of microphones, and this one has not disappointed me yet in conversational clarity.  For video sound capture, however, it seems a bit unsuited for expeditious recording, but may be adequate for stationary recording.  Being on the T-mobile Unlimited Plan, myself, I found the data speeds to be more than adequate and the Wi-Fi reception to be comparable to that of laptop quality.  The Nexus 4 has a dual band HSPA+ 42 which means that it transfers data from two towers at once, obviously making the signal much stronger and more consistent than single band.  Finally, the screen quality represents the same level of clarity as my desktop LCD, as far as I can observe, which is impressive by my standards.On the subject of operating systems, the Nexus 4 separates itself from the Android competition by being first in line for Android updates.  This is because the other manufacturers who advertise their own features to the Android operating system, such as Samsung and its Touch Wiz, have to take time and implement their own features with each and every update.  As a result, nearly all of the other phones must wait a few months to receive the latest updates, which may or not be of great concern to the general smartphone consumer.  It is also important to note that Android smartphone users are free to format their phones and implement whichever version of Android they please, modded or otherwise, but doing so is not for the faint of heart.  Incidentally, I've noticed that the Nexus 4 snappiness is slightly, but noticeably smoother than the Samsung variants I've demo'd so far.  One potential downside is that Nexus 4's Android OS, more commonly known as \"stock android\", is  somewhat less user friendly than the flavors of Android that are reworked for the purposes of other Android smartphone manufacturers, which has perhaps, in part, lead to the Nexus 4 being dubbed \"the Android developer's phone\".The build quality, as noted by other reviewers in ambivalence, has style more in mind than durability.  Both the back and the front appear to be gorilla glass (though I could be wrong on this), but the back glass lacks the oleophobic coating that is, in actuality, what deters scratches and fingerprints, not the glass itself.  The oleophobic coating is a very thin layer whose presence is known by the slickness that gradually fades as the coating wears away over time and wear.  The good news is that, for those who don't want to purchase screen protectors and enjoy the slick feeling of the coating, there are oleophobic coating replacement kits on Amazon that have enough supply to very quickly and easily reinforce the coating for months and months.  However, I would personally recommend not only a screen protector (since they last longer and add additional, albeit slight, shock protection to the screen and usually don't require replacements), but also a durable protective case, since the glassy nature of the Nexus 4 puts smartphone care on the difficulty level of hard mode.As far as unlocked phones go, and they're rather taboo nowadays due to the silly for-profit legislation, the Nexus 4 is priced far lower than its competition.  And while $299 for the 8GB version and $350 (prices may vary in the future) for the 16GB version seem like very tempting deals, there are some general consumer expectations that this phone meets and does not meet.The battery life, for me, was very manageable.  Of course, it must be said that I am a moderate user, with the knowledge that screen brightness and just having the screen on drains the battery more than anything else one could possibly be doing with it.  It is important to note that there are programs that one can find in the app store for free that can assist in managing the phone's battery life, especially ones that put the phone into deep sleep when the phone is off.  People may often wonder why their batteries drain so quickly outside of active use, and this is often due to background programs continuously utilizing the CPU and consequently draining the battery.  A bit of research can go a long way, as the greater freedom of Android also comes with it a greater chance to find ourselves in unfavorable scenarios if we're not careful.  It may take a some fine tuning, but the time, effort and results are worth it.  I have been able to get through an entire waking day, with a total on-screen time of about an hour and a half watching YouTube videos and checking e-mail down to about 50%.  To me, that's more than reasonable as far as smartphone battery life is concerned.One major downside of the Nexus 4, at least in my opinion, is that it does not have an expansion slot for memory cards.  This is can be a make or break aspect for those of us who like to have a large repertoire of music and video files at the ready without having to rely on data plans to stream them for us.  When queried for an answer as to why this feature was not implemented, a Google representative said something to the extent of SD cards being an archaic technology and some other condescending nonsense.  I found it more comical than anything else that the attitude in response to a legitimate question was one of arrogance, rather than acceptance of one's failure of awareness to consumer demand.Another meaningful downside is that if you are in the market for a smartphone that will effectively double as your camera, the Nexus is not the best that Android phones have to offer, but it is sufficient in a pinch.  From my experience, it's been rather difficult to tame the consistency of photo quality.  Video capture quality was fine for my purposes, but the sound capture, as mentioned before, was rather mediocre.Finally, there are a few more issues with this phone that are less egregious but are nevertheless meaningful to a select group of people.One is that micro-USB OTG, known as \"on-the-go\" was initially advertised as supported, but now the Nexus 4 manufacturers have recanted this as a \"mistake\" after its purchasers discovered otherwise.  For those who are unsure of what the feature is, OTG support allows us to power certain devices out of the charging port of the phone, provided that we have the appropriate conversion cables and that the phone can supply enough voltage to whatever is being connected.  For instance, with OTG support, we would be able to connect things like keyboards, mice, gaming controllers, and even thumb drives at the obvious expense of less battery life.Another issue is that the Nexus 4 doesn't seem to handle wired headsets with as much grace as other phones.  I only mean to emphasize that this goes for *wired* headsets and not Bluetooth ones.  Whether it is a hardware or software problem is outside the realm of my current scope of knowledge about the phone, but the problem seems to be that the volume adjustment affects the strength of the microphone gain.  Thus, if you want the volume to be low, the microphone will be accordingly weak.  This can be, in actuality, an extremely significant issue for people who are accustomed to making phone calls with wired headsets, since it forces us to blast our ears out with the highest volume only to render the microphone useful.  This may be fixed in subsequent updates, but, honestly, this should not even be an issue to begin with in the current generation of phones.UPDATE: It seems that newer batches of this phone have the microphone gain issue corrected, so if yours does this, LG/Google will likely accept your RMA request and have a new unit sent to you.Update #2: It seems that Android 4.3 has remedied this issue to a great extent for the remaining phones out there that still have this issue.Finally, there is no legally accessible LTE support, for those who are looking into jumping on that bandwagon.  For those of you who do not know, LTE stands for \"long term evolution\" and it is, at least of this writing, the fastest method of data transfer between phone and phone service.  One can also purchase USB dongles (yes get your giggles out) to plug into our laptops or, if desired, desktop computers as other means of using 4G LTE on more powerful but less portable work or play stations.  While the speeds are indeed impressive, with people able to achieve 175 megabits per second (translates to 175/8 or nearly 20 megabytes per second, statistics gathered from a Google search of the terms \"4G LTE speedtest\") the coverage seems to be rather sparse, limited to only a a few carriers, two being AT&T; and Verizon, and mainly within the most metropolitan of cities in the USA.  Not only that, but 4G LTE seems to make battery power management a bit more cumbersome.  Now, there would be great uses for 4G LTE in terms of using one's phone as a tethering device, which means that other devices, such as a laptop or desktop computer, would connect with your phone's 4G LTE service to gain Internet access that way.  Also, in areas where 4G LTE is prevalent, one could quite literally video chat on the fly, which is quite handy for the extreme mobile tech enthusiasts among us.  While I've been able to achieve about 10-20 megabits per second in data transfer speed with my HSPA+ data plan, which translates to roughly 1-2 megabytes per second, it's honestly generous enough for all of my applications, whether it be streaming YouTube videos or Spotify/MOG music, but may not be consistent enough for video chatting on the move.  For those that can afford it and want near-seamless access to the Internet through their wireless phone service, it might affect their decision to opt with this phone or another one that has FCC licensing for general consumer use of 4G LTE.Overall, I think the Nexus 4, despite its caveats, is the best bang for the buck as far as Android phones are concerned.  For the budget-conscious buyers who want top of the line processor and GPU, this is the phone to get.  For those who don't mind that there is no expansion slot and only 16GB max of onboard memory and want the snappiest possible Android experience, this is the phone to get.  For those of us who want an hacker-friendly device that's free from the clutches of carrier restrictions, this is the phone to get.As I learn more about this phone, I'll continue updating or altering parts of this review.

I'm used to apple products. I have iPods and iPads. But for $700 did not want to buy the iPhone. For half that I can get the Nexus 4, and with better specs than the iPhone 4S.Love the screen size. The speed and reliability of this phone. Never an issue making calls on T Mobile. It did freeze on me once when I ran a new app. Had to hard reset and deleted the app. To me this phone beats the iPhone. I just can't use the iPhone 5's tiny screen. Going from an ipad mini to an iPhone is too much of a down size.The battery is just about average. Heavy use will probably not last the day. Medium use barely makes the full 16 hrs. So basically is charge at night use during the day, repeat.Android OS is nice, not as polished as iOS 6. The trade off is freedom from big brother apple, but some of the apps really suck. The same apps in android just don't look as good nor perform as well as the same apps in iOS.Stock android apps also aren't as full featured as apple apps. The clock is so basic I had to get another one.  The calculator is almost useless beyond +- / *.So in summary. The phone itself is a 9. Now compared to newer ones down to an 8. But the price bumps it up to an 8.5. The most bang for the buck by a long shot. In fact there isn't any competition in this category. The biggest disappointment is the OS. Definitely a downgrade from iOS. But then I don't have to deal with iTunes, so it definitely wins there.Love this phone and so glad I bought it over iPhone and S3/S4.***** Update *****After daily use for awhile now I love this phone even more. And loving T Mobile too. Because T Mobile now is offering unlimited everything and no contracts, having a smart phone is affordable and a tech geeks dream.Briefly, since moving to T Mobile I don't have to worry about any overage charges, just the same bill month after month, no surprises.  Because I get unlimited data even on the lowest tier plan (only 500 mb of high speed data, then it is throttled down to 2g speeds), I can use the Nexus 4 without a worry.  Actually my only worry is if the battery will last the day.  I love driving around town using GPS and Pandora at the same time. I was afraid that the 2g speeds would prevent me from doing this, but it streams music and runs Navigation seamlessly. It seems to all work as if I were on 4g speeds, I cannot tell the difference in performance.This brings me to my most pleasant surprise so far. Since I need to pump Pandora through the car speakers with an audio jack and I like to use Navigation at the same time, I was startled to hear the music being muted then the Nav voice tell me where to go through the car speakers!  I had no idea that it could do this. I know pretty naive, but this is my first smart phone. Google Nav blows my Garmin away. I don't have to worry about outdated maps, slow start ups, input that takes forever and a dead battery. I hardly use the Garmin any more. Garmin had better watch out before it becomes the next Block Buster.2g speeds: although running Pandora and Nav doesn't seem to be any slower, web surfing sure is. It may take a minute to open a web page that took only 10 sec on 4g. So there definitely is a throttle, but for me I may only be throttled for the last week or so of each month.  Definitely worth the savings for a minor temporary inconvenience.The Google Nexus 4 has made my life a lot easier and T mobile has made it all happen without much more cost than what we were paying for two dumb phones.****2014 update ****I'm reducing the star rating to 3.5.  I have to reset the phone every week. Thing start to not work, most importantly it will not charge!  What a strange thing to happen. The instructions even say to rest the phone once a week. That's just silly.  Anyways the phone wasn't that expensive compared to the flagship phones of the big boys, so I can live with the annoying rest requirements.

It is a little bit bigger than my hand, which took some getting used to when migrating from my old phone, but I was able to adjust. The volume buttons are in a slightly different position than my old phone, so the first few times I used them I missed and ended up hitting the up volume when I was  aiming to turn it down. This is mostly due to me being used to a smaller phone, so if you are someone upgrading from a smaller phone, these are things you should be aware of.As for the phone itself, it is quite thin and has a very nice finish on the back. The size makes it feel slightly more prone to slipping from your hand, so I do suggest purchasing a case. I have not picked out one myself yet but do plan to.As for the responsiveness of the phone, the processor is very fast and the fact that you get the latest updates to Android is a major bonus. Within the first time of powering on, I had already received my first Android update that I have ever received over the air, and I have been using an Android phone for a year and a half. The fact that it doesn't come with any extra bloat from carriers is a very big bonus.Now some things I have heard mentioned that are major complaints about the phone: lack of LTE and lack of removable battery, and the lack of an SD card. The lack of LTE doesn't concern me very much, as through T-Mobile I have still been able to get 10Mbps down and 1Mbps up easily. The removable battery would be nice, but at this time it has not been too big of a concern for me. If you run the phone very hard, chances are you may drain the battery in about 5 hours, but if you simply use it for light browsing and keep it locked some, it will last you through the day. For the final concern, in order to get around storing my whole music collection on my phone, I have begun using google music. Since you get 25,000 songs for free, I was easily able to fit my whole music collection on google music. If you do this however you will want to be careful with any limits your carrier imposes on your wireless, I have already used 1.7GB of my 2GB plan halfway through the month, about 500MB of which was used on music. Now that I know I can easily \"pin\" and \"unpin\" songs while I am on wifi in google music (which downloads them to your phone for listening), I will be using that feature to save my phone bandwidth.To wrap up: Great phone overall, and if you are looking for a clean android experience with no hassles, this may very well be your phone.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone but...", "Author": "Kibi", "ReviewID": "R2S3S6QTBDU3HM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bearing in mind the Nexus 5 (brand new with same amount of memory, better hardware, newer firmware) is available right now on the Google store for the same price (350), don't you think it's about time for a price reduction?", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bareback = slip & slide", "Author": "WorknMan \"worknman\"", "ReviewID": "R30L1Q2KVPLNPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good phone and I don't think I can say much more than people have already said, but it has one glaring flaw that I don't hear people talk much about. If you're like me and don't like having a bumper or case on your phone, be careful where you put it! Unless your house is very level, it's likely to slide off of a lot of smooth, flat surfaces because of its glass back. It's not unusual for me to find my phone on the floor, after it slides off of whatever I put it on. Thankfully though, I have carpet :P This problem is ESPECIALLY bad with the wireless charging orb; you can find some time-lapse videos on Youtube of people's Nexus 4s sliding right off of it. So I'd recommend at the very least putting a skin on the back. I'm going to do mine, but just haven't gotten around to it yet.Also, if you're an AT&T; user, you're probably going to get painfully slow speeds out of the gate, but some tweaking to the APN settings should help out a lot. Just Google 'nexus 4 apn at&t;'. When I did this, I went from less than 3mbps to 10-13mbps. I'm not sure how/if this works on T-mobile.UPDATE: March 2013 - They redesigned the phone so that there's little nubs on the bottom that keep the glass back slightly elevated off surfaces. This should help with the sliding issues. If you get a used one though, then I suppose all bets are off. I also put Ghost Armor (google for more info) on the back of mine, and it has helped a great deal, esp with the wireless charger.I've also tried it with T-mobile, and it seems that the default APN settings are fine. Overall, it's faster than AT&T;'s HSPA, but just like any other carrier, if you don't have good coverage (which T-mobile seems to lack in a lot of places), it will make your life miserable.

When I hold an iPhone now it seems like a silly toy.Advantages - Fast, intuitive, easy to use, customization ease, no more dreaded iTunes, beautiful screen, Google's synchronization, I could write for an hour.  Perfect.  One more thing - the size.  The size is just right.  It is larger than the iPhone, but smaller than the massive silly looking Galaxy.  The movies, surfing, app use, and a navigation are all MUCH better than iPhone.  The larger Samsung Galaxy just looks and feels too big and silly in one's hand.  It looks like a brick or a tablet.  Nexus is the perfect phone size.  They got it right.Disadvantages - few.  You will need a case right away because it does have a glass back.

Comparable phones like the Samsung Galaxy S 3 cost double and are not as good as this great phone. You get it unlocked to use on any carrier that is compatible. There are a few negatives to it, though.PROS:1. 2GB of RAM and a Quad-Core Qualcomm processor make this phone completely smooth and effortless.2. This phone runs the pure, stock Android from Google unlike most phones like the Samsung Galaxy that have interfaces to slow them down and make them ugly.3. You get the newest version of Android straight from Google before anybody else. This is very nice to have and is one of the main reasons I bought it. Your phone has the newest and best software always.4. The Google Play store for downloading apps is incredibly well stocked and has even more apps than the Apple App Store.5. The screen is beautiful and the phone itself is very nice feeling.CONS:1. The battery life is less than stellar, but it does last plenty long for a light day.2. The operating system occasionally has a few problems, like the thing randomly shuts down and things like that, but it is okay.3. The phone is a bit fragile. I use this case:Ballistic SG1098-M005 AGF SG Series Case for LG E960/NEXUS 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black and it has protected it very nicely. I have a case just like this one Asmyna ALGE960HPCAST003NP Astronoot Premium Hybrid Case with Durable Hard Plastic Faceplate for LG Nexus 4 E960 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black for my HTC 8X and it is very nice for a low price.

This was the last shot I gave to android.I figured that if I did not like the nexus, I would return it and just get an iphone.I'm keeping the nexus. It works perfectly for my needs without lag or crashes. It does not overheat or drop wifi or irritate me with nuisance issues.Read on for a brief comparison of what I can remember now. . .I've used the samsung galaxy tab and the S3 (I9300) for over a year now.I never liked them. Applications were slow and laggy. Both my devices used to reboot every day on their own, often in the middle of something.Sending an email with an attachment would make the email app crash.They were loaded with bloatware. There was no way to turn the animations off either.The list of issues was endless.I was annoyed with the dark spots on the screen (visible while watching youtube at night).Magenta would look like red. There was no way to calibrate the screen to make it look 'normal'. Cyan and Aqua were the same color too.Somehow, I always felt that videos were like watching recolored b/w movies or sometimes even cartoons.The capacitative touch buttons were always getting in my way. Samsung voice was a royal pain.After the jellybean upgrade to 4.2 the S3 was far from butter smooth. It was a pain to launch the phone app, wait 3 seconds for it to load then type a phone number with a half second lag pressing each button.if I held the S3 in my left hand, wifi would drop 2 bars. It rarely connected to free wifi offered at hotels.I could not hold the S3 to my face for more than 5 minutes. It would get really hot at the earpiece area.I bought my Nexus 4 from google directly. I figured I could return it within the 15 day period for a full refund.It's been a month now, I am not returning it.It is super fast and smooth. If there is an android phone which can rival the smoothness of an iphone, it is this.Sure the battery does not last me two days like the S3. It only lasts me one day, but I am always thumbing this phone.All the stock applications work perfectly.The camera is also 8MP, but the picture clarity is so much better.HDR shots need a steady hand, but come out looking beautiful.I've installed many apps from the play store now. Apps like lightflow which never worked on the S3 work almost perfectly on the nexus.Apple was right about one thing. Don't look at the specs of the device alone. Look at the overall package.The nexus 4 has a lower clocked processor than the note 2 or the S3. But everything works perfectly.Bottomline: Google gives out a free os which works almost perfectly on it's own. The stock os is the way android is meant to be.Phone makers spoil the experience by loading their bloatware.The nexus 4 does not have any of the issues of the S3, and I do not miss any of the features which the S3 had (turn around to mute, palm swipe to take a snapshot.. .).", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I have ever owned", "Author": "joseph aorahim", "ReviewID": "R10QCG3A0ZR0LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just so you guys know how I use this phone, I am currently a contractor in afghanistan and I am currently using a local Sim card in this phone.

The Nexus 4 was my top choice. But it was out of stock in the Google Play store, with no ETA in sight for its return. And if you could find one for sale elsewhere, the prices were jacked up. No, thanks.So I compromised, and bought the Samsung Galaxy S III Mini I8190 - which is a fine phone. I posted a favorable review of it and don't take it back. But. The Nexus 4 is more optimized for my carrier (T Mobile) than the Galaxy S Mini (the diff is the 1700 band which T-Mo uses, the Nexus has, and the Mini doesn't). Also, I wasn't happy with the Mini's camera, which I thought was laggy when taking photos.Now, the Nexus 4 is back in stock at Google Play. Last week I surrendered to temptation and bought it from Google Play. No regrets!Pros:*** Camera is really good, much better than the Mini.*** No manufacturer bloatware. I think the built-in digital clock display is ugly, but found an attractive and efficient weather/time widget for the home page - Android Weather - so I don't need to display the ugly digital clock.*** Blazing fast operation, and an elegant interface. For instance, I touched the link to a Word file attached to a Gmail message, expecting to have more steps to open it. Nope - it just popped open on my screen. Instantly. Sweet!*** Using Adobe Reader, fabulously responsive swipe/enlarge function with pdf files.*** I'm getting better connection speeds on the T-Mo network.Cautions:*** My Mini uses a regular sized SIM card, and the Nexus 4 takes a micro SIM. However, the guys at the local T-Mo store were helpful with that.*** No slot for microSD card. This is my first smartphone without that, but so far I've loaded it with my apps and a bunch of Kindle books and still have 11 or 12 GB of available space. Videos would take up a lot of space but I would rarely want to keep those on my phone.*** The battery isn't user-replaceable. So I've bought the Anker\u00ae Astro 5600mAh Backup External Battery Pack High Capacity Charger, to carry when I'm going to be away from power outlets for long days, which isn't unusual. I did a test-charge with it at home and it fully charged the phone and had plenty left in reserve.

So went to Google play store and ordered this beast .... and as expected, it a powerhouse phone with lots of features and lots of frills. I am quite comfortable with iOS and android OS and I know that android lets you to customize your phone in a way you like it (so many gadgets makes this phone very cool). So overall I am happy with my phone.Things I don't like-1. It's a big phone (like Galaxy S3) and I don't understand this new trend of making big phones. I have big hands and I still sometimes need to use two hands to type message or handle the phone. It was quite easy and best selling point for iPhone5 to make it 4 inch phone, just about enough to handle with one hand and your thumb can reach corner to corner easily, unlike N4.2. Touchscreen is not sensitive enough as compare to iPhone5. While scrolling, zooming in and out, you can feel the difference effortlessly.Things that I like:1. Powerhouse phone - the speed of this phone is tremendous, no buffering while opening books or documents, opens and closes the apps in seconds.2. Battery: many people complained about battery issue; however, I think battery is great. I am not heavy user of my phone and I do whatsapp almost all the time. I use att's 3g and home wifi (80/20) and with this internet use my phone lasts for entire day and still have 20% battery left when I go to bed. Battery usage was quite comparable with iPhone5 (but it used LTE which was more power consuming). In a nutshell, I am quite satisfied with battery performance in N43. Stunning look - it looks different and more finished and stylist. There are lots of plastic phones in the market and this is far superior than them.4. Price - $349 for N4 unlocked its like a dream5. Wireless charging - not needed but very convenient feature6. Display - beautiful colors and perfect saturation, videos look awesome.7. Hardware - front and back gorilla glass gives this phone perfect premium product feel in hand. Its not thin as iPhone5 but still thin enough to keep in front pocket.Overall, I love my phone and I would recommend anybody to buy this phone.PS", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value, sleek clean design", "Author": "F.

Also note the phone tends to ship faster than Google's site indicates.Also, ALL NEXUS 4 Phones are UNLOCKED by default. Don't pay more to someone trying to make that a selling point to sell for higher than MSRP!With that said, I had a iphone 4s before I bought the nexus. It takes a bit of getting used to in transitioning to the Nexus but overall, the Nexus is a solid contender with a sleek design and a more versatile o/s. The iphone is much simpler than the Nexus in function, things are much more logical, and what I mean is you can give it to your grandparents and they can intuitively figure it out for the most part. The Nexus while simple, has much more functionality and wouldn't be something your grandparents could master as fast as an iphone. However, do note that my grandparents loved the Nexus once they figured out how to use it but they did miss Siri quite a bit. The key difference is this phone is noticeably faster when you swap apps and has a much clearer and larger screen. The battery life has so far been better than my iphone 4s by a noticeable factor.

So far haven't found any.Here are a few observations:Speed:I used to get about 4mb speed with Galaxy Exhibit, on Nexus 4 I am getting between 8mb to 13mb on average in my daily usage area. Plenty fast for anything I want to do on my phone.Cover:Put Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for LG Nexus 4 - Retail Packaging case and it looks great. Yes can't see the back side Nexus 4 logo. But I guess I could have waited for the translucent version. No big deal.No heating issue :Have tested for the heating issue by browsing internet for an hour. Phone gets a bit warm but definitely not hot.Camera:Camera is of high quality. One needs to learn the different setting. A little bit of practice on Photosphere needed. I was able to take some fantastic pictures.Battery life:One hour of web browsing (I use Dolphin browser) takes bertween 25% to 28% of battery. No different than any other high end Android (that don't even have quad core CPUs).All I can say is the phone is simply excellent: blazing fast, super smooth, Android Jelly bean is miles ahead of the competition as one learns the seemingly never ending features, unlocked, carrier bloat free and of course contract free.This is truly a game changer device from Google.

The representative convinced me to try one master reset of the device (which worked perfectly as far as restoring contacts, calendar, previously installed apps, etc.), and see if by any chance it makes a difference on battery drain.  To say I was skeptical is an understatement.  With 23 hours and 16 minutes of very low use of the phone two days ago, I woke up yesterday morning to a completely discharged battery.  Totally dead less than 24 hours after the last 100% charge.  So needless to say, I was fully expecting to be talking with Google again today to finalize return of the phone.  Not so!In the previous version of this review (a 2-star rating) I said, \"If it fixes itself with the reset, I'll update this review.  If the review isn't updated, you'll know it went back to Google with no swap.\"I have no idea what might have been wrong, but I've used the phone considerably more yesterday and today since the total reset and it's been over 25 hours since it's last been on a charger.  Current battery life?  Still 44% remaining!  I can't argue with that, since the usage has been far heavier.  So, on to other phone features I've been able to check out since receiving it almost two weeks ago.I love the voice recognition system.  It's proven quite accurate with text messaging, for example - just don't have any background noise, but that stands to reason.After not being able to get the speakerphone to work, it's now working great.The back camera is outstanding (haven't really checked out the lower resolution front camera), and video with voice is quite acceptable.  I also tried out the 360\u00ba panorama feature on the camera.  Even at close range (they recommend more than 30' from you to whatever's around you) I was able to get a rather acceptable image of a room in our house.  And it's quite easy to adjust white balance or image brightness before ever taking a photo.Settings are much easier to follow than with my previous LG phone (an Optimus T).  I've been able to find a number of things much easier than was ever the case with the previous phone - layout is more logical and self-explanatory.Importing and exporting files is quite easy using my Window$ computer.The phone is very easy to use, fairly intuitive, and turned out to be far less of a chore to learn a new phone than I expected.And finally, I have no issues with speed.  Despite not being LTE capable, the system used by this phone with T-Mobile is light speed compared to what I ever got with my previous LG phone.  If you MUST have speed, spend more money.  But if you are comfortable with decent, very acceptable speed, why spend the money?Overall, if you can still find one through Google at $249, GRAB IT!  And even at the somewhat higher prices on Amazon, it's a nice phone with a lower price than some with far fewer features.  Whatever happened with the system reset was magic.  I'm keeping the phone.  It's a rather strong 4-star rating in my opinion - nearly five, especially considering the direct Google price (reportedly now sold out).  I'm just hoping the Nexus 5 doesn't come out next month at a low intro price - hah hah.CONS: It seems a fair number of people have broken these in the first days of owning theirs.  With glass both front and back, that's a risk.  I got a wallet-style case, and am very happy with it.  Even if I drop the phone, I've got a fair likelihood of the phone coming through intact.  Just be careful (like so many other phones these days).", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Maybe not for everyone but I love it!", "Author": "S. Elmore \"Ned Nickerson or Don't see a name ...", "ReviewID": "R67S3SI60UJER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine on google play cause it was cheaper that way.  Before this I had a Samsung Exhibit 2 because it was 4g, which is really 3g plus or HSPA+, and through t-mobile I could get the plan where 30$ a month you get 5gb of HSPA+, unlimited text, but only 100mins of talk time.  I already used skype as a phone at home so I figured I would just use skype on my smart phone since I had 5gb of data.  This worked great for a while but the Exhibit 2 only had 512mb of ram to begin with and because of the OS or whatever only 300mb was actually usable and since I pretty much always need to run skype the phone got real slow and would shut down apps a lot and became frustrating to use.So I needed a new phone but wanted it to use the same plan I had before meaning it had to be unlocked and take a t-mobile sim card.  The Nexus 4 comes unlocked and had 2gb of ram so I knew it would be able to run skype and other apps at the same time without jamming up or slowing down.  It also cost half the price of many other phones with similar specs, if you buy them without a contract.When I got my Nexus I did have to cut my t-mobile sim card so that it would match the size of the newer smaller sims. I was nervous about doing this but I have amazon prime so I bought a sim cutter off amazon they sell them for under 5$ and the come with adapter so if you want to put the sim back in your old phone you can. Anyway this worked fine I used the sim cutter turned it to a microsim put it in the Nexus and presto my phone was running didn't have to call anyone and change my plan or anything.  I feel like its important to say that cause I went with my girlfriend to a t-mobile store and the swear up and down you can just switch sims like that even if the phones unlocked.Using the phone:CONS I've had it for a while now over 6 months and I love it but its not perfect.  First I would buy a good case mine has a soft rubber thing that goes around the phone then a hard plastic shell and it works great, knocked off the table last night and didn't hurt it at all.  But without a case it seems fragile cause its all glass.  Other cons are the memory I am use to having expandable memory and I like to store a lot of music, podcast, and take lots of pics and video at highest res I can.  So for me even 16gb isn't enough and I have to always watch what I'm downloading and go through and delete but this isn't as big of a deal for a lot of people. The battery doesn't last as long as I wish but that is because I love the phone so much I use it a lot more than I have any other phone I've ever owned.  Last is I have trouble with connecting to HSPA+ and sometimes the data says its connected to the high speed but is moving very slow and what I have to do is go into settings click connect to 2g data only wait a min then unclick it and that fixes the problem.  Oh and the speaker is a little too soft for me but that is minor.PROS2gb ram is amazing I can run any apps I want no problem they run fast and smooth.  The camera, now I am not a camera person and I am sure that for real photo fans this isn't the camera you would want to use, I love the camera.  This summer I have really discovered how great it is from taking pics of my son on trips and for my untrained eye the pics have turned out wonderful and video too.  I love how you can take pics while video taping something.  The zoom isn't a real zoom and is just enlarging the pic and lowering the quality of the picture so I wouldn't recommend zooming much but everything else about the camera is great.  The screen looks great and while the phone is a little big I love having a big screen because of the battery I try to keep the brightness down or on auto but it looks great as good as an iphone imo.  There are a million other things but the last thing I will put down for a pro is it is a official google phone which to me is like having the iphone for apple only apple doesn't let anyone else make iphone compatible smartphones.  And since it is the official google phones you get perks the main one being it is always updated first so you are always on the latest android os and everything that google makes is made to work for nexus products.OVERALLI really believe that pound for pound dollar for dollar this phone is unmatched and that while this phone doesn't have every bell and whistle that the top tier phones have its strengths far out weigh its weaknesses. I really don't think I would get anything more out of the newest iphone or galaxy except the LTE and since I rarely watch videos over 2mins long on my phone I don't think would add much to my experience.  Most of my family uses iphone and while I don't know what they paid upfront but I know their monthly bill is over 100$, I pay 30$ monthly and 350$ to get the phone so even if they got their phones for free at the end of the year they will have spent 1200 to my 710 and I almost certainly, being a bit of a nerd, use and get more out of my phone than they do.

I love the stock Android experience but was hesitant because the Nexus 4 only seemed like a small upgrade. While the changes are not mind-blowing, a lot of small things have been improved to deliver a better experience. I've been using the phone for a couple of weeks and here are my impressions so far:Pros:-It's a Nexus device! Vanilla Android w/ no bloatware is wonderful.-Unlocked for international travel.-Very fast/responsive. The processor and 2GB of RAM make for a speedy device.-Comfortable to hold/use.-Screen is crisp and bright. Sunlight visibility is greatly improved from the Galaxy Nexus.-I like the slightly wider screen resolution for viewing websites/documents.-Call quality for me w/ T-Mobile has been fantastic and the earpiece is loud and clear.-The back pattern is unique. Whether you love it or hate it, you can't deny that it is unique.-Wireless charging is a neat feature. I recommend the LG WCP-300 wireless charger.-Noise cancellation seems to work well.-The notification light a nice feature. Try the LightFlow app for maximum customization.-The price.Cons:-No expandable storage.-No USB OTG support.-Glass back is slippery. Installing a \"screen\" protector will help tremendously.-Glass back looks pretty but based on user accounts is fragile and can crack easily.-Some very minor build issues such as the phone creaking when pressure is applied. Tightening the screws helps temporarily.-No LTE. Maybe this helps keep costs down?Notes/Observations:-Battery life is pretty average based on my experience and that seems to be the general user consensus.-Screen is a little washed out but the color temp seems pretty spot on. You forget about it and only realize when you see it next to something like the HTC One.-Vibration is not very strong. It is hard to hear/feel on surfaces like desks or nightstands.-Speaker is loud but sounds only average. It can sound tinny and harsh at times.-Wi-Fi and cell reception is average based on my experience.-The camera is fine but nothing to write home about. It's fine for the occasional snapshot but don't expect great quality. The same goes for video as well.When it comes down to it, the Nexus 4 is great because it offers the ability to run vanilla Android on an almost top-tier phone for a fantastic price. Sure, the phone has its faults just like every other phone but for me it performs wonderfully.If you are sick of carrier bloatware, manufacturer skins, device upgrades every two years, and locked phones then check out the Nexus 4.

She had the 1x and I had the One X plus. Although the screens on both of those phones were amazing and on my phone I personally loved the 64GB, they had quite a few quirks that really annoyed both of us. it was so bad we had to exchange both phones and that did not fix the issues. On both phones we would sometimes be in the middle of a call and it would suddenly just reboot and both would always say no sim card found and we have to restart the phone. That continued even with the second set of phones. I was thinking what are the chances that both phones would do this. Also we use Gmail to save all of our contacts and for some reason HTC decided that the default contacts save would be in the phone itself so we would have to continually choose to save it into Google contacts and there is no way to set it to default save to Gmail. This was annoying because in our line of work we both constantly have new clients and we try to save their phone numbers and I like having the phone numbers available across all my Google devices, not just on my phone only. My wife would especially forget to sometimes save it into Google so when we switched phones she noticed that she was missing several contacts and AT&T; had so much system bloatware on both of the phones that when we disabled quite a few of them it probably made the phone act crazy as well. Even when you turned both of the phones at initial setup, the phone was practically begging you to save all the contacts into AT&T; which would be the stupidest thing in the world to since they would only be available on your AT&T; account. I have noticed that more and more Android phones are trying to get you to get away from Google services even though its Android. Now I understand why iPhone is the way it is. Anyways, Snce we use both of our phones for business, I had no choice but to try something different. We tried the Galaxy S phone and I did not like that TouchWiz at all, it also had little things that wanted to separate you from Google, plus the screen did not look as nice as the HTC One. Anyways now we have the Nexus 4 and it is hands down the smoothest version of Android we have ever seen or used. the screen looks just as we as fantastic as the one x plus, I thought I would not like the fact that it does not have true 4G but I haven't noticed a real difference at all for what we use it for. It really should be the number one phone, but I'm sure that's Google not properly advertising it the way Samsung advertises their phones, so unfortunately most people will never get to experience a phone that truly rivals the iPhone in overall satisfaction. After several months of use, we pretty much have had zero issues with the phones, everything works and there's absolutely no unnecessary b)apps on the phone. I would pretty much have to say we are probably going to use Nexus branded devices from now on as long as they work as smooth as these phones are right now. Liked it so much  we even got Nexus tablets. The only thing I wish personally for me is I wish I had at least 32gb because on the HTC One X plus I had 64 and I used about 27 gigabytes of it. I love media and I love apps. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a truly great working phone that pretty much does everything you need to do without all the extra gimmicks or loaded with things that you'll probably never use.

It has some weird color saturation in the display, but honestly I am not picky about it and is not an issue to me. The display still looks super good.  Before I bought it I saw online that all these people were complaining about the camera... well obviously its not gonna take pictures that a 1,000 dollar camera is gonna take. But for a cell phone.. the pictures are good enough for me! It runs extremely fast, loads games and any apps very fast, and can have multiple apps running (ive had 20 running at once).I guess the only slight downfall I can think of really is the battery, the battery is kinda so-so.  If you use it a full day with moderate texting and light gaming or facebook you will probably get between 12-16 hours of use, or 3-4 hours of screen on time.The itself is build pretty well I would say.  I mean yea if you are dropping it on concrete all the time... don't expect it to last very long.  But I just got a thin case for it and it is just fine.  The speaker is also pretty descent, not amazing but does the purpose fine in my estimate. The buttons on it compared to some phones I have used and seen, are very good. Don't seem like they will wear out very soon.I must point out that amazon and ebay and all these online stores are charging WAY to much.  You can get the 16GB model on google play store for 350, and the 8GB for 300.  sooo why pay over 400 for the same phone.... Get a nice case or accessories with the saved money!

The Nexus 4 8GB I ordered which said ships in 3 to 4 weeks, shipped in 6 days.  (Nexus 4 8GB now says 1 to 2 weeks, not 3 to 4, so I suspect shipping would be far less.  Apparently Google would rather deliver far faster than the \"expected\" date, rather than risk disappointing a customer by shipping later than they would expect.Even though it was 2 day shipping, all 3 Nexus 4 phones I've ordered so far have arrived the next day after shipping, but that's more because of my location (North Carolina) and UPS doing a good job.For me, the only phones I'd consider purchasing are the Nexus series for a few reasons.1. Timely updates. You will always have the latest version of Android (unless you are on a CDMA network like Verizon which can take MONTHS to issue updates to their phones, even Nexus models.)2. Pure Android experience. No over-lays or extra fluff installed on the phone taking up CPU, Battery, Memory or storage space.3. Ability to root the device easily in case you want to experiment with an alternative ROM.

LG has neither good nor bad image to me, but this phone showed their potential to be great.The phone runs fast as expected(Project Butter helps a lot too). I has 10-20 apps open at any given time and I noticed no lag. The support for HSDPA+ 42 network shows off really great. I get 10-12 Mbps down and 1-3 Mbps up in Seattle area(though the phone will indicate 3G every now and then but it seems the phone is still on H because I got about the same speed).Now there are few flaws.1. Storage. 16Gb is still not enough for me. I filled my phone up after 4 days(no joke). So if anything get 16GB its worth the extra 50 bucks.2. CPU power throttling. In order to make great use of the average size 2200mAh battery Google/LG has put in a throttling system where if the Battery is certain temperature the CPU speed is clocked down to lower speed. I am not that much of a power user so I haven't seen great drop in performance(the throttling start at 36F). But for any intense gamers this isn't the phone to get.People like to complaint about the non-removable battery, but the phone is actually easy to open up when you need to replace the battery(Go look at the full tear down on YouTube Channel l355on5).Also there is no support for LTE. So the phone isn't exactly flag-ship material as Google would like to make it out as. Despite the lack of LTE support, for users looking to go pre-paid this phone will do great.I would also like to remind you that this phone will stay relevant for longer than average phone(with exception to iPhones, and Galaxy S3 and Note 2). As a Nexus Google will be the one to send out updates to your phone for Pure Android experience which I found to be just fantastic. iPhone and GS3 is 600 at best unlocked for 16 GB. So go for this phone you wont regret it.This phone is a steal for 350 on Google Play. Pricing here is bit high for some reason so head over to Google Play store.

So I'm assuming you want to know about the Nexus 4, no?  For this review, I'm going to be breaking it down into segments for easier reading.  So, have at it!  PS- I bought this phone though Google itself, so I based the pricing on that since it's the only official way to get it for now.  They're way more expensive here on Amazon for the time being.Look:  The phone is HUGE.  It isn't thick or heavy, but due to the large screen size, the thing is wide and tall.  It is almost all black except for the silver bezel, which is a much welcome addition (it would look very boring without it).  The back has a very fancy patterned glass which looks vaguely like a disco ball when there is a strong light present.  It doesn't come on too strong, though, so don't worry about it being too flashy.  There is a large \"Nexus\" logo on the back, and the camera is in the top left corner just above the N.  There are a total of three buttons on the side- a power button on the right and volume buttons on the left; Simple and easy to remember.  Overall, it's kind of boring for a design, but there's enough zest to make it fun to look at.Internals:  It's all over the internet, but there's a quad core processor, 2 GB of RAM, a 8 Megapixel main camera and a 4.7 inch HD screen.  also, on the front, there's a video chat camera.  What all of this adds up to is a high end Android phone as of late 2012/early 2013.  There's not too much that you really could be asking for, since this will let you do anything you could possibly ever want it to.Android:  Out of the box, it comes with basic android 4.2.  It's a great operating system that all other manufacturers seem to love building upon.  It works just like any other android phone you may have had, but it works more smoothly and has a few more features than before.  There's lock screen widgets, for example, which lets you view information without unlocking your phone (don't worry- you don't have to use any of them if you are weary of strangers seeing your inboxes).  Everything is very robotic and cold-toned.  It looks very cool, although it will take a little bit of time to get used to some changes from older versions.Battery and Storage:  the battery is 2100 MaH, which is unremovable.  Luckily, though, the battery is strong enough to last you at least a day.  Myself, I make sure to not have anything I'm not using on (such as wifi, GPS, apps, that sort of thing), and I can get 2 days of use.  Not spectacular compared to a feature phone, but not horrible by any means for a smart phone.  16 GB of storage for this phone turns out to be 12 GB once they've loaded the operating system on it.  This is for you to decide whether it is enough, but I find that I have over 10 GB left, even with all of my apps and photos on it.  If you are going to have music, maybe not.Camera:  The cameras seem to be where LG and Google cut the price of the phone.  The interface for the camera is elegant and very easy to use, which makes it all the worse that the camera is so... average.  It isn't horrible, but you are definitely going to want to bring a stand alone camera with you when you go on a trip or to a family party.  It will work for spur of the moment photos, of course, and if you don't want to carry around another camera, you could surely do worse.The front camera isn't too great, and it was really only meant for video chats.  It has no auto focus, which means everything will be grainy and fuzzy-looking.All-in-All:  It's a great phone, period.  For the price, it's AMAZING.  In the US, it's $350 without a contract, which is a few buck higher than a similar phone on a major carrier.

So with that in mind, lets get started:Let me start off by admitting up front, based on my brief stint working for AT&T;, I was NOT a fan of LG phones. Not in the slightest. In fact, some of the worst phones I've EVER seen were LG models (however, in the spirit of honesty, I can't comment on LG models sold on the Verizon or Sprint networks). I have always wanted the Pure Google Experience, but for one reason or another, the opportunity never really presented itself...until Verizon lied to me about keeping my unlimited data plans, took it away from me, and oh yeah, the fact that they charge OUTRAGEOUS sums for their service, well, it bugged me once too often and I jumped ship.I used to believe that once you've had LTE service, you'd never go back...that is until I had the AT&T; Galaxy Note, and where I live, we are blanketed with their low-tier 4G service, and no LTE. Verizon literally covers almost my whole state with LTE service, however. The difference between that low-tier 4G & LTE--at least as far as how I use the internet, was rather minimal, or at least not so significant that it bothered me. Now yIn my area, T-Mobile happens to cover the area rather sporadically with their HSPA+ service, which they bill as ALMOST LTE download speeds, which is pretty good--IF you can get the service. Unfortunately, the 4G is SO spotty, that taking just ONE step in any particular direction can mean the difference between full 4 bars of 4G and NO 4G whatsoever. A rather large portion of my town has ZERO HSPA+ service...something I did not know until after I joined up with T-Mobile. Oh well.I did a great deal of research about the Nexus 4 (unlike the poor reasearch I did about coverage...) before making my decision, and after all is said and done, I am VERY impressed with the phone. At first I thought something was wrong when I went into the app drawer, but it dawned on my quickly that because its Pure Google, I don't have to be weighed down by all the TONS of bloatware that ALL carriers dump into their phones. Color me very happy indeed. The phone itself is very nice, feels great in my hands--however, the rather large b-u-u-u-t that accompanies that statement revolves around the fact that next to the iPhone 4 and 4S (the two most easily shattered phones ever designed in history), the Nexus 4 is remarkably easy to break as well, considering how much glass its packed inside of. I hear that even the Gorilla Glass 2 front is prone to breaking as well. No matter how you slice it, you simply MUST purchas a case to protect this investment or the inevitable WILL happen, it always does.Performance...? Awesome. Flawless, to be exact. Everything is crisp and QUICK. Thanks to the quad-core processor, things fly at lightning speed and I have yet to see any kind of hiccup...which is very nice. The scrolling with Jelly Bean is fluid and very buttery, like they said it would be. Nice to see they were right. From the lock screen's new additional widgets, to the wonderful cool options of Google Now (think iPhone's Siri only SERIOUSLY better), there is a LOT to like.One thing I do a LOT of on my phone is text...so the keyboard is critical to me. Adding its own gesture/swype-like keyboard was a nice feature, but I got to missing Swype...enough so that I went to their website and downloaded it myself (had to jump through a few hoops to actually get it to run, but it was worth it). The whole speech-to-text function has received a GIGANTIC overhaul...you'll either love it or not. Personally I think its a nice step up. I really think if you have a phone with Jellybean 4.2.2, take advantage of Google Now. If you don't you are missing out. Seriously.One other thing I REALLY like is the addition of Phonetic Spelling to contacts. The truth of the matter is this, we ALL know someone with an odd spelling to their name, or last name that speech-to-text function never seems to recognize, so this function really allows you to be creative in phoneticially spelling that name, and allowing Google Now to search it easily on your phone. It may be an easy and simple thing, but it was a VERY welcome addition if you ask me.The camera seems to have undergone a nice overhaul, too. It looks entirely different now, but not too difficult to navigate through. I haven't tried Photosphere yet, but I'm anxious to give it a shot. What I REALLY do like is the photo editing feature that makes cropping, Coloring & regular editing fairly simple and intuitive. Haven't tried to video anything yet, but I'll post my results when I do.What has bugged me was how un-impressed I am with the battery. Coming from the Droid Razr, with a rather anemic 1750 mAh battery to the Nexus and a much larger 2100 mAh battery, I truly expected a great increase in how much I could use my phone...alas, I was mistaken. I really believe that I could get about 30% more usage on my Razr than with the Nexus. Pretty disappointing considering the difference in battery size. I've also owned several smartphones over the years, and heavy internet browsing generally heats up the phone to a certain degree. Some phones suffer from this more than others, but I have to say, the virtually all-glass Nexus heats up to an uncomfortable degree, enough so that I once placed it on my knee while wearing shorts and it almost burned me. Sorry, but this is unacceptable. Maybe a change will come soon with an update, which, thankfully with Google, should come fast and regularly. Otherwise, I may take it back to see what the deal is.I really like the position of the buttons. Not bothersome like on my Razr. I HATED having the volume buttons directly under the power buttons. The number of times I pressed the up volume instead of the power key and wondered why the phone didn't turn on (or off)...well, its enough to drive you nuts after the hundredth time, trust me.I am also impressed with how thin the phone is. Just barely thicker than the Razr (which is truly the thinnest phone around) and yet overall, no bigger. Set the phones side by side and I was very happy with the fact that my screen is a full half-inch bigger, and yet the phone isn't any larger overall. Nice.The screen--while true HD, well ISN'T nearly as vibrant as I expected it to be. I may be in the minority here, but I just expected it to pop more like a Super Amoled screen does. With that being said, the screen IS beautiful, and probably renders colors more natural-like than Amoled screens do, at least I can be honest with that. I just personally prefer the over-saturated colors I got with Amoled phones. Oh well.Call quality and speaker functions were exceptional, too. Didn't drop any calls, and I was impressed with the clarity and loudness of the speaker on the back. By the way, the phone has dual mic's so you have the noise canceling function that most high-end smartphones have been including for a few years now.All things considered, I am VERY happy with the phone, other than the small complaints I registered above. Overall, I have to say this is probably the best Android phone on the market (unless you MUST have LTE)...at least for the time being. I realize that will change any moment now, but such is life in the world of advancing electronics. Look for updates soon...***UPDATE***Totally forgot to include this in my initial review: the LED light which at first I thought was absent entirely, well, it turns out that the Nexus 4 really DOES have an LED indicator light...unfortunately, it isn't a bright one, and its at the bottom of the phone (in the center) instead of at the top as per most smartphones. I don't really care where the light happens to be, just that the phone has one. The original Galaxy Note didn't have one at all, which I felt was a GIGANTIC Fail on Samsungs part, but oh well. The LED on the Nexus 4 has to be enabled in settings, as it comes out of the box disabled--which I find a bit puzzling. On top of that, mine never really seemed to work worth a darn--until I downloaded an app which allowed me to access it and therefore adjust it for how quickly it blinked and what color. Again, it seems sporadic as far as how easy it is to get the thing to properly work, but at least it does. Honestly, the fact that it doesn't work ALL the time is a fairly big Oops on LG's part. This technology is pretty standard in even ultra-cheap phones and smartphones alike, so the fact that this one only works so-so is a problem with design. I've noticed forums online which speak to this in-depth so it isn't just an isolated incident, fyi.Also, I had owned an Android-based Bluetooth keyboard which I LOVE and used regularly on both the Galaxy Note & the Droid Razr without problem, but unfortunately, will NOT work on Jellybean 4.2 and above. It'll pair no prob--but there is no way to get the keyboard to actually WORK, and trust me, I've read as much as I believe you can on the subject and still nothing. Honestly, I believe a work-around will arrive probably rather soon via an OTA update, but in the meantime, I have this nice keyboard which is on my shelf now collecting dust as it is unusable for the time being. Another big Oops if you ask me.I really like the screen's responsiveness. MUCH better than ALL previous Android devices. Even close to the very edge, where I had noticed a lack of sensitivity on all other phones I had used. Nice going, LG.The Nexus boots up from being turned totally off in a remarkably short amount of time--easily 75% faster than any other phone I've used (with the possible exception of the HTC One X, which still may be the fastest available--at least that I have personally seen). Nothing was slower than the Blackberries, but this was a nice and VERY pleasant surprise. Maybe those extra two cores help in that matter...Camera is impressive as well. Clearly better than all other models I've used, again, with the possible exception of the HTC One X, which has an absolutely STELLAR optical device. Honestly, I'm not a photographer by trade, but the Nexus 4's camera certainly seems to be the equal of the One X in pretty much all areas other than color saturation. The addition of photosphere is just brilliant. You simply have to try it. I really love this feature, even though its more novel than anything else, it IS pretty dang sweet. And I REALLY continue to love the photo editing features which come with Jellybean. Nice touch, Google. I keep wondering when we'll start to see megapixels larger than 8 become standard on these phones. 8 has been around for an eternity (as far as electronics are concerned) and I'm thinking a 10MP camera really ought to be the norm by now--but what do I know, huh?***UPDATE #2***As I stated above, I downloaded Swype simply because in my experience, it has the best function which I prefer at understanding accurately what I'm trying to write. I recently tried Swiftkey Flow (trial) and found it to be pretty much just as accurate, and I even like the customization--however, I see no reason to PAY for the full version (because I'm a cheapskate, honestly) when Swype will do what I want for FREE. With that being said, let me admit that I like to change things up quite a bit on my phone, the background, widget layout etc. and once in a while, I like to switch keyboards just to make my experience varied. I tried to go BACK to the stock Android keyboard (which really IS pretty well done), and no matter what I did, I couldn't get it enabled. I spent the better part of 2 days trying to figure out what was wrong. I hadn't deleted it, so where was it? Finally, out of sheer frustration, I kinda gave up when it hit me. I went into settings, down to apps, and searched for it and voila! There it was. I have no idea HOW or WHY, but it had been disabled. Don't get that at all. I didn't do it, but at least it was an easy fix to re-enable it. The gesture typing (as they are calling it) takes a bit to get used to since as you trace along the screen a little box follows you with the predictive text it THINKS you're trying to write. It IS correct more often than not, but I have to say, it DOES take a bit to get used to that little thing following your finger around. You can turn it off, by the way, but once you get used to it, I found it actually kinda useful. Let me say this: if Swiftkey Flow was free, I'd keep it in a heartbeat. LOVE its layout and convenience. I dare say its the best Swype-like keyboard I've seen to date. Don't be fooled, there are a bunch in the Google Play store to choose from, but while some spend a great time in making the keyboard LOOK good, they spend much less time making it accurate. I won't name names because what I dislike, YOU might actually prefer. Everyone is different, and I recommend trying it yourself before making decision...don't just take my word for it.***UPDATE #3***The longer I have this phone, the more I really like it. I cannot stress, however, how important it is to get a case to protect it. Being virtually all glass, it certainly FEELS like quality--unfortunately, it also feels rather slick. I've noticed it slipping on the counter when I placed it on top of a stack of items that was slightly at an angle. Slippage that wouldn't have happened with any other phone I've personally owned, and definitely not with a decent case protecting it.Google Now is simply awesome. I've watched several video's and read many articles comparing it with Siri, and almost all have them neck-and-neck except for a few which were ridiculously biased towards apple. They each have their own strengths over the other. If you like snarky responses, Siri is your gal. But if you want a service which will (over time, of course) recognize your schedule, commute time and other things you do regularly, and offer you with simple solutions, such as knowing that you have an appointment at 5, but the busses in your area are running slow, or traffic is backed up due to an accident, Google Now will send you a reminder to leave a little extra early. Siri not only doesn't, but cannot pull this off. The honest truth is that the differences and preferences are pretty much personal, and in no way mean one is inherently better than the other. I found Siri to be a great novel idea which--after a couple months, very few people regularly used. However, Google Now (IMO) offers things to me as help even if I don't ask it to. I can choose to ignore them or heed the advice. Its up to me. Just points to ponder.I have changed my opinion on the clarity and color saturation of the screen (for the most part). I simply wasn't using a screen wallpaper which allowed the phones color to really shine. I also had the screen brightness as low as it would go. Turn it up and you'll see a world of difference.Screen responsiveness remains very good and while I've personally used Verizon's 4G LTE (as well as AT&T;'s) and I am VERY impressed with T-Mobile's HSPA+ speeds. I won't place it up with LTE, but I must admit (when I actually HAVE the service) that its mighty quick. With a good signal, I'd say its 85% as fast as LTE. VERY impressive, T-Mobile. Now hurry up and get those two other towers in town so I'll have a decent signal all over my small town. One other thing about T-Mobile's service in my area, its either their 4G or Edge service, no 3G at all. Talk about a MAJOR differnce. Holy COW! I may end up moving to Vegas before too long and I know my service will work great with the coverage they have down there.Google went to work on Jelly Bean with Project Butter to help with how the screen fluidly switches from one to the next, and no matter how tiny that may seem to you, the end result is pure bliss. It works...really, REALLY well. Not only do I have no complaints, but supreme kudos to Google for pulling it off and in VERY nice style. No longer can my iOS friends claim better screen transitions. In truth, this is something that Android has had to play catch-up on for far too long. It SHOULD have been worked out back when Froyo came out several years back. But at least its here and works wonderfully.Google Now just keeps getting cooler to me. It \"Learns\" your life and reacts accordingly the more you use your phone and the longer you have it. I have added a Google Now widget to my homescreen, and it just popped up to tell me my commute home would take a bit longer than usual due to traffic issues on the route I normally take. A few minutes later, the time was changed again as the traffic became even worse. I didn't ASK Google to give me that info, but since I allowed Google that ability in settings (you have to give it permission, otherwise Google Now is only a nifty tool, more like Siri) it just gave me that info right away. If I have appointments, it looks ahead to see if I need to leave sooner to make the appointment based on traffic, or if I take the bus it'll remind me to leave sooner based on those perameters as well. It LEARNS...Siri does not. For that alone, GN beats apple. No doubt that will change with the newest iOS update scheduled for later this year. But having a Nexus phone assures me that no matter how much iOS improves, Google will, too and I'll continue to receive the FIRST updates when they become available.Another cool feature of Jelly Bean is Smart App updates. In a nutshell, before when an app I downloaded received an update, I would have to re-download the entire app all over again from the Play Store, and within it would be the small update. Even IF the actual update was only 1mb in size, but the entire upate was 22mb's...you'd seriously use up bandwidth as well as precious data (for those not on unlimited plans). With Android 4.2 when an app needs upating, you download ONLY that part of the app which is new, therefore saving a great deal of bandwidth AND data usage. This is not only smart, but freakin' genius if you ask me. I'm kinda surprised that Google doesn't shout this from the rooftops because its a pretty big deal for those who have data limits and no regular access to WiFi like some people are fortunate to have.I've tried several different Home Screen Launchers since I got the Nexus 4 and always seem to just go back to the stock Launcher. Don't get me wrong, some of the newer apps are simply brilliant, and the 3D effects are just awesome. But truth be told, these days that just does't cut it for me. I just want my phone to WORK. The less stuff I add to it, I find it just works better. Thats just me, though. I understand that may not be for everyone. To each his own, right?One more thing: I've recently discovered the Tasker App for Android. Holy freakin' COW! The closest thing I'm aware of that is similar is something Motorola has started to add on their newer devices--but it can't do a tenth of what Tasker can do. It is TOTALLY worth the cost (and so far, the ONLY app I've ever paid for). You can set your phone to turn up the brightness when opening up Google Chrome, and it'll automatically dip down to whatever setting it was before (you have to NOT have it on Automatic Brightness for this to work, however). I've set my GPS to auto turn-on the moment I open the Maps app, and shut off as soon as I exit. It may sound less than interesting, but trust me, its amazing how helpful it can be. If I receive a phone call and I want to silence the call, I simply turn my phone face down, the ringer will automatically shut off. Now, keep in mind this app takes a bit to get used to and I doubt many will ever truly use it to its full potential (yes, it can do THAT much stuff), and I recommend looking at the YouTube instructions which will help immeasurably on how to set it up and give you an idea--it'll help more than you know.***FINAL UPDATE***After a bit of a struggle, I received and downloaded update 4.4 Kit Kat a few days ago. First off, I gotta say I'm disappointed. Not with how the phone is operating, but with what we were TOLD to expect, and with what this update actually delivers. I've watched several YouTube videos with early versions on the N4 as well as Google's official tour of what to not only expect from the N5 but the official reviews after it was initially released. A LOT was placed upon the new & improved Transparent home screen. Did that come to the N4? Nope. Also, the swipe to the left to get Google Now also wasn't included. Now why wasn't all that made clear from the absolute BEGINNING has been a real disappointment. At least we would've known instead of waiting this whole time only to find out AFTER the download instead of expecting it the way Google SHOULD have handled this debacle. And the fact that Verizon's Moto X got the update BEFORE ANY Nexus device was not only an insult, but a slap in the face, too. Yes I understand that Motorola now being owned by Google makes their products kinda, sorta Nexus-like. Yes, I know. But regardless, that doesn't make them Nexus devices. Period. Even if my phone had received it a day BEFORE they released it, I still would have been surprised, but a lot less perturbed. These are the reasons why people like me purchased the Nexus in the first place is because we were lead to believe that WE'D get those updates FIRST. Not so any longer. Also, after positioning 4.4 as for ALL--and bragging how it uses the least amount of RAM of most of the earlier versions of Android and yet NOT making it available for the Galaxy Nexus could be the biggest insult of all. It'll run on as little as 512MB of RAM and yet you won't allow the GNexus to update? WHY?? That alone makes it NOT the OS for everyone. Oh, I'm sure someone will make a modified version available for the GNexus probably soon, but the fact that it wasn't issued by Google itself is an Epic FAIL in MY opinion. Just sayin'.The icons are bigger under 4.4. Quite a bit actually. And I'm NOT a fan of that. Sure my screen is decent sized, but even with such limited real estate, I hate for too much space to be used up by simple icons which CANNOT be re-sized or moved. Some may not be bothered by this at all, but I felt it was worth mentioning all the same.For those who have the N4 and STILL want the N5-like experience without actually having to buy one, go search for the 'Google Experience Launcher' (as I write this, you cannot find it in the Play Store). It will in fact give you the transparancy home screen, the swipe to left Google Now as well as the ability to simply speak \"OK Google\" while on any home screen to launch Google Now. Keep in mind that by enabling this feature, because the N4 wasn't designed for this function, it WILL use a bit more juice than usual (fairly noticeable if you ask me). You can turn the feature off and retain everything else, but its worth noting all the same.Google Now is more fluid and the speech recognition seems greatly improved. Sure, some words are problematic, but that's life when using technology (and I might add aren't any easier to speak using Siri, either). I've noticed a nice improvement overall with it. VERY happy with that aspect. For me, the new phone functions are simply awesome. MUCH better than before. I'm really liking that part of Kit Kat A LOT. Still a lot to like about the N4--but the battery life is still pretty miserable. I WAS considering getting the Nexus 5 seeing as it was supposed to essentially be the G2 without all the LG bloatware and UI crap. But the battery on the G2 is massive compared to the rather anemic one they put in the N5. Maybe that was for budgetary consideration seeing as they are selling it for about the cheapest price you can purchase a first class smartphone these days. Oh well. I just may go with the N5 after all...if not that then maybe the Note 3--which I really like. I just want to see Kit Kat made available to that before I take the plunge. I just loved my first Note. Size DOES matter, and for me, it was awesome. SO hard to go back to anything else without that large screen.

First off, the  Nexus 4 is excellent value (Google play!) and great for prepaid plans (I don't text that much). I just got the 4.3 Android update and it is running as smooth as when I bought it. The only noticeable delay is when it is starting up, but that is normal with most electronics. I have noticed people complaining about battery issues - as far as I'm concerned it is fine and we will see what will happen when the phone comes of age. I do not turn wi-fi on unless I am using it or at home/near a battery source. I use this phone mainly to chat with friends and browse the web. I do play some games occasionally, but I have a computer and console for that! I do understand that watching videos is battery-drainer on this device, but I mainly watch movies on my phone at home so that is not an issue. The appearance of the phone is very nice. In fact, it is so nice I still cannot find the off-screen buttons. The screen is similar to most smartphones and will need care. You wouldn't drop a few hundred dollars, try to not drop a few hundred dollars device! I have a cover and a screen protector and I do not even notice the screen protector. The screen is noticeably big for my small hands but I have come to love the screen and now I can't go any smaller! For people wondering about the sound, the speakers are pretty average and they are hard to hear when the phone is put down screen up. But yes, it can be a bulky mp3 player. What's almost unique to this phone is the onscreen navigation buttons, which promise more screen real estate. I have figured that you cannot get rid of them without rooting for the most part, but most of the time it is not an interference.Overall, if you are looking for a smartphone and can't afford those 600 dollar plus smartphones, the Nexus 4 might be the perfect choice for you. It can achieve many of the features high end smartphones can at an ideal price.

I was skeptical but post a lot of research decided to pick it. It was difficult to buy this as I am from India and was visiting US for a short time and the phone was not available in any store except @ Google Play or Amazon. Finally bought 16 Gb model from Amazon.The phone is just great and I have had this for 2 months or so. It has already got updated to 4.3. The phone performs very well with no lag. The touch is perhaps the best I have experienced. The network / WiFI speed is good and no jitter while watching video. It does get warm during use.  The price / performance is perhaps best build quality is luxurious with all glass. But this is also a problem as the glass is very slippery. I recently placed the phone on some clothes and the vibration from an incoming call caused the phone to fall 2 feet and the front glass shattered and the touch became unresponsive. Fortunately this phone has been released in India and I got my screen replaced ( took the LG technician 20 mins to do so ). Damage INR 4726 :( - I am now investing in a bumper case. Many users have complained about the fragile nature of the phone. The phone battery is in built and costs INR 900 odd here.The battery lasts a day and but has a sharp drop from 100% to 90% and then discharges at an acceptable rate. This phone requires a heavy charger and a typical 700 mA charger will take a long time to charge esp. beyond 80%. Use the OEM charger.

So at the end its not a big difference and here the shipping was fast and was able to use some gift cards already had.Now about the phone. Because of its 2GB of RAM, you can throw any memory hog app and it will take it with class, not even a blink. I got this phone for my wife after I put the last one in the laundry by accident ( or maybe she put it there intentionally to get a new one ) She installs a lot of apps and keep them running at all times, this will would get her 512mb RAM old phone to a crawl.

Bah", "ReviewID": "R3C6CJJAD540NB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an incredible phone with a few drawbacks depending on your preference. The first thing you will notice if you come from other Android phone is the smoothness and speed. You touch the screen and it responds. You swipe down and follows. It doesnt think a second or two to know what you are up to. This may be partly due to its latest Jelly bean 4.2 software. All the Android phones I have used so far have rooms for improvements when it comes to performance. The lag is sometimes unbearable.The design is great eventhough the glass back looks delicate and so it is better to have a nice case to protect it.  It looks simple on a table but feels solid and expensive in your hands. The weight is just right in my opiniom. Things like the voulme and power button are rightly placed. I really enjoy holding this phone just the way it is but unfortunately I will have to get a case for it.THINGS I DONT LIKE ABOUT THE PHONE:NO SD CARD is an issue for me some what. I am not a heavy user of music files but I feel like I might need more storage in the long run. But now I just have to go easy on downloads.CALL QUALITY definitely needs some improvements. I feel like the volume is a bit low and so it is sometimes hard to hear the other person if you are in a noisy area. The outside speaker is tiny and poorly placed in my opinion. Its easy to cover it if you lay it on a table. This is where the HTC One clearly outperforms the compitition.BATTERY LIFE is about average depending on how you set things like screen brightness and auto syncing. I wont say that it is horrible but not great either.NO LTE can be an isue for some people but not for me. I hardly use mobile data. Most of my internet browsing and downloads are on Wifi.OVERALL this is a great phone in my opinion and I honestly will find it very difficult to use any other Android phone right now. The price is right and the fact that it is unclocked is an added value. Also since this phone is by Google it will always get the latest Android updates. Other Android phones are notoriously slow to catch up.I WILL RECOMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE.UPDATE 9-13-2013:  The biggest issue with this phone remains the volume. I listen to music a lot while driving and when connected to my car the sound is just too low no matter what I do. Now I am not sure whether this partains to my phone alone but I have no reason to believe that all other Nexus 4s does not suffer the same low volume issue. At one time I even planned to cancel my Google music subscription because I just wasn't enjoying it the way I would like to but I later changed my mind.

That's not even entirely true. It does have an LTE chip built into it but 4.2.2 update killed it.

Never seen such impressive display", "Author": "reader", "ReviewID": "RDUB4Z3ITK8JA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of all the smartphones I've used this one has the largest screen ever and it is very impressive. I bought mine through google play for 380.  Now I have to discuss some pros and cons about this device.Pros --1) Powerful machinery. 2GB RAM is the highest maximum in the cell phone industry as of now. You will not find any android device with more RAM.2) Powerful processor,  1.5 Ghz snapdragon is possibly one of the most powerful processors in the cell phone industry, with only 2 to 3 phones having more than this.3) Rooting not required. Due to such powerful machinery, the speed is incredibly fast. Hence rooting isn't required. The main purpose of rooting the device is to save RAM and CPU usage and to make the device faster. But since it already has such maximum capacity features, rooting isn't necessary here.4) Excellent call quality5) Huge screen. No problem seeing any website. The visual display is large and very generous. Iphone dipslay seems tight compared to this. For videos or website viewing, its simply awesome.Cons ---1) Due to its powerful machinery, the battery life isn't that good. Takes very long to charge to 100 percent. Can take hours in fact. Battery may diminish fast.  However that is not a problem for me because wherever I am I can either charge it through USB, wall outlet or car charger. If charging isn't available then I don't think the device can last longer than 3 hours.2) Holding it in one hand maybe a challenge at times due to its big screen size. May feel bulky too for 1 hand. At worst case, may give hand pain if holding with one hand continuously for long periods. You have to use both hands or give your hands some rest.3) 16 GB internal storage though ample, is not the industry max.  However industry max is 64 GB internal storage. With the RAM and processor being industry max, if the internal storage was 64 GB too then this phone would defeat any smartphone hands down.4) Comes with pre-loaded malware. After installing Kaspersky antivirus, it detected 3 backdoor viruses in it.  These 3 pieces of malware work as spyware.  So if you don't have antivirus, you must install it.  I believe they are intentionally inserted by google to spy upon.5) May appear to get quite warm at times.

The Nexus 4 is similar to iPhone 4 and 4s in that both the front and back panels are glass. The outside edge seems to be made of a matte hard plastic but doesn't have a cheap feel to it. It's a very elegant looking device and while the glass front and back can cause some mild anxiety, a bumper can rectify any concerns you have. Also the Nexus 4 is thin and while the 4.7 inch display is large, the phone is really not that bulky. I have fairly small hands and didn't have too much issue using it with one hand semi-comfortably. The volume and power buttons are appropriately placed. There are no other capacitive buttons on the device.PERFORMANCE:The Nexus 4 running Jelly Bean 4.2.1 is blazing fast and fluid. Google did wonderful job with Jelly Bean. It's now much more fluid, lagless and robust as on OS overall. The on board quad core processor and 2GBs of RAM make for super fast loading of applications and content. So far, no force closes either.CALLS/DATA:Using it over T-Mobile's network, the Nexus 4 has been extremely fast. Web pages loaded in a 3-5 seconds and calls were clear. Since I've been using the Nexus 4 for the past two months, I haven't had a single dropped call.CAMERA:Although not one of the best cameras I've used on a mobile device, the camera will get the job done for quick capturing or video. The shutter time is about 1-2 seconds so no obnoxiously long waiting times.COOL STUFF:NFC - Near Field Communication - This allows for wireless charging and sharing with other devices that are NFC enabled. I own the LG Wireless Charging pad for my Nexus 4... GREAT STUFF! And it's awesome to be able to share pictures, files, etc. without needing an App and simply by touching devices.COMPLAINTS:The sound driver in the Nexus 4 must be super small because the sound quality through headphones is absolutely dreadful, although through speakers, it's great. Also, the only complaint I have about Android OS is that in the GMail App, you can select all emails and mark all as read... a very minor complaint but something useful none the less. Also, no expandable memory or included earbuds.CONCLUSION:Should the average consumer grab this device? Absolutely... for a $299 outright price point all while being a competitor in terms of specs with the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy SIII, unless you really have a disdain for Android OS, you can't go wrong with the  Nexus 4. Also, because it's a Nexus device, it will receive \"special attention\" in terms of updates from Google. It's an excellent device. Google and LG have proven that they can break barriers without breaking pockets.It's just a really, really good device.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned mine to T-Mobile, bought at Google", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RLR2HYERBG5RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I love this phone!

Sams Clubs (and many WalMarts) imho are some of the better free wifi spots, and of course they are all over the country.The big delay seems always to be associated with the N4 not being able to handle the splash or welcoming screen you always get at a  free wifi spot. Sometimes the splash screen doesn't appear (or it takes a long time for it to appear). Once it appears and you accept the terms and click on the connect button, the N4 wants to do weird things like save the image of the button, start a new page or tab, etc...I had no confidence the N4 was even trying to connect, and no feedback on what it was doing. When I successfully connected I left the N4 run for what seemed like minutes and lo and behold when I checked again it had connected. By comparison an Apple iphone 3gs connected in seconds.Afaik there is no solution to the inability of the N4 to connect to ad hoc wifi networks. Does this mean no one at Nexus is willing to explore this long standing issue?Other than this the N4 seems great.

It's simple-- the edge of the phone has a really nice bevel to grip it. The Galaxy Nexus has a pretty smooth edge which requires you to \"cup it\" in your hand and sometimes use two hands is easiest. This phone has a nice bevel to keep it gripped in the hand so there is no issue holding it.From a performance perspective I should notice a marked increase from the Galaxy Nexus but I'll be honest-- this is not something I noticed.

The iPhone 5, by comparison, has a 1.3GHz Apple A6 chip with 1GB of RAM, so you can see that this is indeed a powerful machine.Build Quality: The nexus 4 feels great in the hand, it has a gorgeous screen with a glass leaded back and has a better build than any Android smartphone I have seen, although you might want to keep it away from concrete at all costs.Customization: Android is a highly customizeable OS out there because users have more control over the OS unlike iOS, so for an intermediate to advanced user Android is the way to go, but if you are a new Smartphone user you should try checking out iPhone 5Flexibility: If you live anywhere outside of the US and especially in a third world country where you markets are full of cheap android tablets then you are in luck as this IS the most powerful and economical Android phone to date and you can use it with any of those cheap tablets to achieve a lot of functions at a very low cost.Updates: This smartphone has the latest 4.2 OS which is not available on any other mobile and nexus 4 will get all the Android updates faster then any other Android phone as there is no modification needed before the release of the update i.e. when Samsung etc get an update they then have to modify it for their Touchwiz OS and then modify is again for some specific devices. Nexus 4 however doesn't need all this and as soon as the update is out from Google it can be installed without any modificationsPrice: The price of the stock device from Google is 350$ which is WAY less then any other device of similar specs and size.The Bad:Price: Yes I have included the price in the good section but I am also including this in the bad section because as you can see you are not paying the stock price for this on Amazon but over 500$ which is a lot.Strange Noise Issue: There have been cases(not with me) of buzzing noise coming from the phones earpiece in the earlier models but seems to be fixed in the newer ones, so be careful before you get one.LTE: There is not LTE capability on this device so if you use LTE you should try looking at the iPhone 5 or the Galaxy S III.Lack of MicroSD: there is not space for e micro SD card so you cannot add more storage space and are pretty much stuck with the storage space you buy.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Didnt get any warranty document with it.", "Author": "Ron S", "ReviewID": "R15KKCS61ANN3S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Though this product is sold with international warranty, no one in my country respect it.

I love new gadgets and I love anything related to technology. With that said, when the Nexus 4 was announced it intrigued me. I've tried Android about 2 years ago on a Galaxy S phone and wasn't impressed. I wasn't sure if it was the operating system itself or the experience that was given through the Galaxy S phone.When the Nexus 4 became available again on the PLAY store I decided to order a 16 GB model. For only $50 more I felt it was worth the upgrade. The phone arrived on Monday, February 4th. I was excited for it's arrival as I was anxious to see if the Nexus Android experience would lure me away from my iPhone 5. I've been using iOS for several years and while the simple interface of icons did bore me a bit, the phone did everything I needed and more.PROS -There as much to like about this phone. When I unboxed it, the large display instantly grabbed me. I was excited to try a phone that was a bit larger. I unboxed and powered it up. I didn't have a micro-SIM card so I couldn't start using it right away (the iPhone 5 has a nano-SIM). I set everything else up and connected to WiFi. I started configuring all my accounts, apps, etc. I came across some issues but overall it was nice.Screen (4.7\") - The screen on this phone is very nice. I don't feel the quality is the same as an iPhone 5, but it's definitely one of the best on the market. It's larger, but not huge like the Galaxy Note  and Note 2. It's also one piece of glass on the front of this phone so there are no grooves are indention's of any type.Customization - One of the biggest things Android fans talk about is the customization that is possible in the Android operating system. The possibilities are endless, of course, having the time to play with these options is another story. You can almost do anything you'd like if you take the time to find the settings and/or app that will allow you to do it. You can also load custom ROMs and root your phone to allow more options. I did not go that far with this phone as I really didn't have the time or the need, but the possibility is there.Android OS directly from Google - The main reason I chose the Nexus 4 was because I liked the fact that the operating system was provided by Google and wasn't junked up with any added interface like HTC, Motorola and Samsung like to do. It's a pure Google experience with OS updates directly from Google and quicker than any other phone. Android 4.2 really is the best Android OS to date. The options are endless, the system seems more refined than past versions and overall it's a needed and very nice improvement.CONS -As a user of iOS, many Android fans would call me a simple minded person. I take that as a complement. I love technology and I love playing with new gadgets, but for some reason, when it comes to my phone I just want it to work and do what I need it to do. There were several situations that I came across that prevented me from doing what I wanted. Here they are:Battery Life - Far and away the most frustrating part of using the Nexus 4 was the battery life. With my iPhone 5, I was accustomed to getting almost two full days of battery life out of my phone. There were many occasions where when I layed down for bed at 10 PM my phone would be at 53%. This was not the case with the Nexus 4. My battery died every day anywhere from 3-5 PM. I spent several hours tweaking and configuring settings on my phone. I turned the brightness of the screen down to 10%, I turned off unnecessary features like NFC, bluetooth, cellular data when not needed and wifi. I disabled all widgets, I turned off syncing of many apps except email. I essentially turned my phone into a dumbphone by disabling all the things we love to have with our smartphones. Even with all of this, I still was lucky to have 10% battery life by 6 PM. This was unacceptable in my mind and was a big drawback to using this phone.Earpiece and Speaker Volume - Another big issue I came across was when I was speaking to anyone whether it was on speakerphone or via the earpiece I could barely hear them. I spoke with several people ranging from landlines, to iPhones to Android phones to basic flip phones. It was all the same. The volume was up to the max and I could barely here them. The speaker volume was exactly the same, which leads me to my next issue...Speaker Placement - I will never understand why LG and Google decided to put the speaker on the back of this phone. This really diminished the audio quality of watching videos/movies or talking to someone on speaker phone. I found that whenever I used speaker I had to be very careful how I held the phone or where I placed the phone or the sound would either be very low and/or very muffled. This is a serious design flaw in my opinion.Notifications - I know that the Android notification system is loved by many, but personally I did not like it. Perhaps I'm too accustomed to iOS notifications, but I personally don't like to have all my notifications pop up on the top of the phone. It's great for text messages and missed phone calls, but I didn't want all my e-mails to show up, all my google voice calls and texts and others. I realize I could turn these off, but with iOS I could actually have a badge show up on the app showing that I have a notification for that app. Nothing more, nothing less. I simply would open the app when ready and check what it is. I prefer this method because I use my Google Voice account for business and didn't want to be bothered with notifications all the time, but did like to know when something was there for me to check when I had a chance.Apps - The Play store has many apps to choose from and I like the changes that have been made in the transition from Market to Play. Unfortunately, the quality of the apps was very poor in my opinion. I use a variety of different apps, utilities and games. Many of the apps I used (particularly banking apps) were very poor quality. They were clunky and looked unfinished and many were very unstable. They stopped responding, they crashed, etc. When browsing the Play store, having to sort through the junk apps to find higher quality apps is another bother. I realize you have junk apps on iOS too, but I noticed far too many apps that did not apply to what I was searching fro when browsing the Play store. I know that Android is capable of having a smooth interface and app experience, but it's up to the developers to refine their app and that clearly didn't happen on the apps I used.Size - I listed this as a  pro, but I found it to also be a con. Here's why: I'm not a small guy - 6'1\" and 190 lbs. My hands are average size and I found the phone to be difficult to hold at times. I loved the large screen, but the comfort level of holding a 4.7\" screen is not very good. I nearly dropped the phone on several occasions, and did not like the feel of the phone in my front pocket (how I carry all my phones). I prefer on handed operation on many occasions, but found that wasn't possible with this phone for most of the things I did.LTE (or lack thereof) - Obviously, I knew this phone was lacking LTE when I purchased it. I've read many reviews and everyone said that while it doesn't have LTE, it still was fast enough to get the job done. My provider is AT&T; and I saw a huge speed difference in the iPhone 5 and the Nexus 4. The iPhone 5 was constantly grabbing 40 Mbps down while using LTE. I was lucky to get 2-3 Mbps on the Nexus 4. I don't blame the Nexus 4 entirely for this as I understand that it's the AT&T; network more than anything, but the phone is lacking the latest technology (for many reasons, some out of Google's power) and that hurts it's functionality and value in my mind. Streaming video on LTE is like no other. It's faster than my home WiFi and is very smooth. HSPA+ on AT&T; and the Nexus 4 felt very bogged down and slow.CONCLUSION -After spending about a week with the Nexus 4, I decided to go back to to the iPhone 5. I enjoyed using Android and enjoyed a lot that this phone had to offer, but the battery life was one of the biggest problems with using this phone. It's a shame, as this phone has a lot of potential. My experience is going to be different than everyone else, but I hope that this review will help others decide whether or not the Nexus 4 will fit their needs.EDIT (3/1/2013): I would just like to comment on the customer service I received from the Google Play store. For a company the size of Google, their customer service experience was quite pathetic. I returned the phone on February 11th and it was received by Google on February 14th. I have been calling to inquire about the refund as I fell within the 15 day return period. I wasn't able to get much information from anyone other than \"they would reach out to a specialists to follow up\". I have finally received notice today my refund is being processed (3/1/2013). A full two weeks (10 business days) to process a refund is absurd, but perhaps it's because I'm spoiled by companies like Amazon who process refunds within two business days of receiving an item, but usually even quicker than that.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A lot of phone", "Author": "Mark Mc", "ReviewID": "R3CVO4R2PPGRAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've held off buying a smart phone for several reasons, not the least of which is cost.  The amount that service providers charge monthly for contracts is enough to choke a horse.  But now, here comes an unlocked phone that you can buy for a lot less than anything comparable, that can use either Straight Talk or T-Mobile's pre-paid services (45 and 30 dollars per month respectively) among others.  So, what about the phone?  It feels good in my hand, even with the i-Blason SoftGel Flexible TPU Case for Google Nexus 4 Smart Phone by EG E960 8GB 16GB (Frost Black) I bought for it. I'm slightly hard of hearing, so a really good speakerphone is important to me.  The Nexus 4's is very good.  As is the regular call quality.  And my old Jabra headset paired up just fine for those calls into customer service centers or other places where you sometimes have to strain to hear.In reading reviews, I constantly came up with two complaints.  No USB storage and no 4G.  Well, a lot of the software sits in Google's cloud.  As does a copy of my music collection that I can download to the phone if I want to listen offline.  Further (and I don't know how long it'll last), I got a free 50 Gig of storage on Box.com.  What's more, for about 4 bucks I can get a Zuweiyu USB 2.0 A Female to Micro B Male Adapter Cable Micro USB Host Mode OTG Cable that allows me (with a Google app) to use a thumb drive or a portable hard drive.  As for the speed, I'm using Straight Talk and the response speed while using the phone is comparable to using the same apps over wifi.  How fast it'll download a file, I can't say, 'cause I've only download when I'm attached to a wifi network.  But that might be a problem for anyone without access to a secure wifi environment.The best parts for me are the start-up speed (about .5 seconds) and the screen.  The screen is simply gorgeous.  I'd considered a Sammy SIII, but with all those reviews reporting a darkish screen... anyway, the Nexus 4 has a truly outstanding display.  I can read very well using a Kindle app, and Netflix is crystal clear.The phone uses a micro-sim card (GSM) that you need to get separately from the prepaid carrier of your choice.  It took Straight Talk about five days to get me the sim card.  The Nexus itself showed up the day after I got the Google Play Store e-mail announcing it had been shipped.I want to stress that part of the reason I give the phone a 5 star rating is because I will *not be a heavy user of data or calls or texts. My needs are more moderate. Therefore, my emphasis is on picture quality, screen sharpness, easy to hear volume levels and quality construction.  I find the Nexus 4 more than meets my needs and I find the phone itself attractive.  Did I mention it's also comparatively inexpensive to buy and use?Update:  I've also purchased this little Anker\u00ae SlimTalk 3200mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with Embedded Micro-USB and Flashlight for iPhone 5 4S 4 3GS, iPod (OEM CABLE REQUIRED for Apple); Android Phones: Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy S2, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy Note / HTC One X One S Sen...].  I charged my Sammy dumb phone from about half full and the Nexus 4 from about half full, and there was still enough charge in the Anker external battery to recharge the Nexus once more from empty.1/19/2013: Edited to add that the on the go USB option is NOT currently available.  But the problem is solved with the Flixter app, Ultraviolet and Vudu.  I signed up for disk to digital, took 10 movies to Walmart, and had them registered for 20 bucks which got me another ten titles I didn't get to choose.  Let me tell you that the movies in SD on the Nexus 4 are simply stunning.  I also purchased a pair of Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging which entirely compliment the incredible picture on the screen.I'm also finding that from grocery shopping to being aware of weather alerts through various apps available at Google Play, I'm using the Nexus way more than I anticipated.  For instance, I stream tons of music while driving.  So, now I can tell you that the battery lasts all day - even when using a golf GPS app (golf takes about 4 hours to play 18 holes).  I'm still glad I bought the back-up battery, but I've only needed it once.  That despite using the phone up to seven hours a day.  I do charge it every night, but on light use I could get away with skipping a night.With all the cloud storage available from Audible, Google Music, books, movies, magazines, Amazon music, movies, Kindle and the Flixter/Ultraviolet/Vudu combination, about the only things stored permanently on the phone are about 100 songs, 70 apps, an Audible book, a Kindle book or 60 and maybe 50 photos and three videos (the camera in combination with the Snapseed app is spectacular!), 1 of which is a full-length Hollywood title.  That, believe it or not, still leaves me almost two thirds of the on-phone storage available!If I were going to buy another phone right now, I wouldn't bother considering anything but A Google Nexus 4 which has enhanced my life way beyond any expectations I had going in.Oh yeah.

Voice leakage during telephone conversations and a third-class camera are what killed it for me. I compared this phone to Galaxy S4 and the latter just blew it away... into very small pieces.For the price, it's a good phone. But my suggestion is to get top of the line Samsung or Apple, you won't have that awful feeling during a vacation that I wish I had a better camera or get embarrassed with awful voice quality.I could go on and on about the different bugs, especially with switching audio sinks (between bluetooth, headset, speaker...) or the inaccurate touchscreen that will drive you nuts but I will give it a rest.For the record I've probably got more perspective than most people posting here -- worked on Blackberry phones for a few years, have most of Apple products at home and have this guy as my primary phone along with two Android tablets (they are even worse) and a BB Playbook (a level above Android tablets).

And 32GB's would be nice.At the end of the day how much is this stuff worth to you?  For me maybe a hundred bucks or two.  Certainly not $800 which is about what I'm saving over two years by buying from Google unlocked plus a terrific prepaid plan from T-Mobile.  Maybe half that if I upgrade to the next Nexus in another year, which btw will likely have all the missing features mentioned above.Google, T-Mobile, and I would all like to thank Verizon for making me a new customer and saving lots of dough.  If VZ had offered the HTC One or come out with a good Nokia Lumia sooner I wouldn't have bothered to do the research on this beauty & would've continued paying thru the nose for minutes I don't use, annoying contracts, and outlandish bloatware.  If you live in North Dakota I guess you don't have a choice, but if you're in a major metro area where just about every carrier offers decent reception?  This phone is a no-brainer if you just want a good functional device with some cutting edge stuff, but aren't obsessed with the latest&greatest; (if you are you have to switch phones every 6 months).To my surprise I don't find it all that difficult to use either, even though I am not the techie type.  Pretty much got everything down within a couple days (except for the camera which I haven't explored much) including 5 different wallpapers & apps/settings etc.  Google Now is pretty much the coolest thing ever.

Beautiful design and a lovely glass back. Remember to buy a good case to protect the phone.Was overly expensive at Amazon while stock was limited. Now (post Feb 2013) it's available at a decent price. The 16GB version is best as you only get 12GB available (hence the 8GB would be very limited)Only issues I would raise would be that it does not have a memory expansion slot and a bigger battery. The battery does tend to get used up pretty quickly if you are on 3G data. I generally keep settings at 2G data (for incoming mail, and other instant alerts) and use WiFi whenever available for faster Internet. This way the battery does last longer and you can get though a day and half.The only other phone currently I would consider is the Sammy Galaxy S3, but for the price (approx USD 400) the Nexus 4/16GB is a win and I would say even better.

Now I say that as a man with fairly large hands. For someone with smaller hands, the iPhone might work better, my sister and girlfriend both think this phone is too big, so I throw that in as a caveat. But for me...What makes the Nexus 4 great are two things 1) the price and build quality of the phone and 2) the PURE Android experience.  Honestly, (keep in mind I own an iMac, a Macbook Air and an iPad Mini) the learning curve was SUPER low and once I got the hang of it, I actually found it easier to use than my iPhone.  The other thing is the Google integration and given my work related calendar and email revolve around google - this phone was actually more seamless than my iPhone because it integrates your info automatically.  That said, it was a bit freaky when my old GF's numbers came up in contacts that I long thought I had deleted, so Google and privacy/deletion are what they are, but as far as work integration I like it.Now the physicality/hardware of the phone is pretty simple design wise, but it does not feel cheap.  I really liked the Samsung Galaxy III and ESPECIALLY the Note 2, but as much as I loved the screen real estate they felt a little cheap and plastic-y in my hand.  Now I realize the Google glass might be an issue for some who might drop their phones or let their kids play with them (I know moms and dads sometimes you'd rather keep them quiet even though they may drop it! haha) but for me I don't see it as an issue as long as you get a protective case.  The Nexus 4 feels just right in my hand and it grips really well.  The screen is FANTASTIC, now quite Droid DNA'ish (thats the best I've seen on a phone) BUT it's close and for the price difference and lack of 2 yr contract - for me - totally worth it.  On the negative side, that pretty and large screen, if the brightness is turned up DOES suck battery pretty quickly.On the software end, the pure Android Google experience in my opinion exceeds Apple's latest iterations of iOS.  It just does. It's easy to use and smooth and the ability to use widgets for my calendar and email is great.  I also really LOVE and this deserves to be on it's own line so:GOOGLE PLAY!!!!This takes iTunes to the level that it should be.  You can load up to 20,000 songs on Google Play from your iTunes and have them available for streaming (Spotify style) one your phone ANYWHERE you go.  It is simply the BEST music experience on any device I have ever had.  You don't have to load your phone's memory down with too much music, nor do you have to buy a more expensive model with more storage because ALL YOUR music is available at any time.  I really appreciate this because as a premium Spotify user some artist (the Beatles, Led Zep, Pink Floyd, Radiohead etc) are NOT available on Spotify.  In fact I would personally cancel my Spotify but my GF loves it so she uses it on her iPhone.One last thing, I use this phone on a month to month contract with Straight Talk with an AT-T SIM card and it works almost as well as my Verizon service and I live in a remote mountainous area, so I would recommend that service as well.Anyhow, more later, but so far I don't anticipate using another phone for a VERY long time.

The size is nice- not too big and not too small- fits in my shirt pocket and it is easy to operate- same as a all other nexus products. Just remember it is almost all glass (front and back). Get a very good case if you are clumsy.  It will break if you are not careful. FYI: The case I bought was the Reath Ringlke SLIM because the reviews said protected the phone well.  Phone and case is too new, so time will tell.I purchased five Nexus 4 International phones from 5 different sellers.  The first one I received was not new and had a scratch on the screen, but was an international phone.  All but one seller HassleFreeCell (who I highly recommend) sent a non-international US phone. Bought via Amazon Prime and returned all of the non-international phones with no problem.  Amazon Prime did a great job.There are several ways to determine if the phone is an international phone: 1. Phone package will have an international manual; 2. Phone package will have an international charger; 3. You can call the manufacture of the phone and give them the IMEI number (in this case LG electronics) and they will tell you if it is an international phone. Also, my guess is if the seller writes in the description that it is an international phone, it probably is an international phone, but you will not know until you receive it.I also want to point out that the Black Nexus 4 phone is advertised as with a warranty and the White Nexus 4 phone is not advertised with a warranty.I am not sure if an independent seller will stand by the warranty on the Black Nexus 4 phone, but I spoke with Amazon Prime and they said that they will stand by the warranty for a year.  So, if you are not buying from Amazon Prime, you may want to contact the independent seller before buying the phone to see how long the warranty is for.  To be safe, you may want to only buy an international phone through Amazon distribution, as most international phones do not have a warranty.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone stopped within 2 months", "Author": "Pauline G.", "ReviewID": "R1HXPWW3VPISHP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great phone at first, lovely design as well, however this one that I bought from this particular supplier stopped working withing 2 months.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "All OK", "Author": "Mario", "ReviewID": "R8JY4DKUMR8WS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everythink was OK, the mobile was without any scratch and it works well with my sim card in spain.

Lam", "ReviewID": "RM9XNEXTT30QS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought the Nexus 4 not too long ago, when it dropped it price. It was a very compelling to purchase. Figured, made in Korea, very good hardware for the money, stock android, which I like. The most desirable feature is Nexus is the first in line to get new android version, albeit sometimes buggy. Starting with the Nexus 5 however, everything changed. No longer the older Nexuses going to get new features. I just flashed the stock factory image and see how nothing really changes from the outside. All the new features on 4.4 remains exclusive for the Nexus 5 for now (very Apple-like now, as whenever Apple release a new iphone, all new features are on the new iphone, and older iphones receive the update but wont' get every features). This case, I don't think hardware is a problem as the Nexus 5 is very much nothing evolutionary to the Nexus 4. So what does this mean? Nexus line is no longer the best in android. Price is good, but there are always compromises to be made, such as no expansion in storage, camera is underwhelming relatively to the competitions. This is very sad as in the past, Nexus suppose to the first one to get everything push out by Google. Now there is that 18-months window too. This made Nexus line on par with other brand, even though other companies are so slow to push out updates. So, Nexus line is no longer the products as they were the past several years. From the looks of it, Google won't change how thing operate now, which is very disappointing, consider how thing were in the past several years. So now, beside the no expansion storage, Nexus line now has more compromises to be made. The biggest is you will receive updates but not every new features, and now, there is a window for when the updates will stop coming. I know, you can find ROM and whatnots from online but it's the changed in fundamental with the Nexus line that is disappointing. So go buy the Nexus 5 and avoid the Nexus 4, but similar to iphone now, buying the Nexus 5 knowing that coming next year, your phone will missing out new features and want to buy new phones because of that.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just awesome.

Only red led light sometimes when charging it. I've done all the button combinations possible for more than 60 seconds, and nothing (Power + Vol Down for 10 or >60 sec, Power + Vol Up for 10 and for 60 sec, Power + Vol Up + Vol down for 10 or 60 sec... all of them connected to computer, to AC power or not connected... even tried some combinations found online x sec vol down, then connect to pc, then Vol Down + Power... etc, etc, etc), and the phone is dead.From the two phones I bought one was for me, the other for my dad who doesn't use much of the features, mainly phone calls, whatsapp and Waze, and nothing more, so I would have expect that my phone could have failed before.From who I should reclaim the warranty? from google directly, from LG, via Amazon?Thanks=======First review: Real android is amazing, Phone lacks some really basic stuffI've been an android user since the Motorola Droid, and by far the user experience on the Nexus 4 with Android 4.2, which updated to 4.3 during the first hour of use, and in some weeks will update to 4.4 it's simply awesome. Amazing job google, and more shame to Samsung and it's TouchWajjjj, HTC and all other companies which ruin the experience, and delay and block android updates.The really bad side, is that although amazing and in the correct line in terms of software... with all the spirit of Google, Android, Linux, etc... the hardware has some major flaws. How not include an external micro SD card slot, not interchangeable batteries, no radio, no MLH... it's a pitty, and the SD card and the battery, it's so Microsoft and Apple way that it's unbelievable Google could have accepted something like that. I hope on Android 4.4 they don't make it mandatory to use iTunes or Outlook.Not considering these major hardware omissions, what it is on the phone, and it's built quality is awesome. I would prefer hard buttons on the front instead of the screen ones. The led is implemented great, why not put hardware buttons next and under it? instead of the software ones (which can't wake the phone and make playing impossible). Also it would be good that the borders protrude 1 mm or less as to be able to use the phone without the bumper case, making it less slippery and add enough protection to put it on different surfaces without worrying of the glass getting scratched.The speaker is weak.And the battery doesn't last enough... if you are in a place with bad signal reception, the phone will drain all its battery in a couple of hours!!!...I miss my Galaxy Note 2, which could last for 2 days with no problem, and if it died on battery, I just poped in a fresh one. Also I have a 64 Gb card on it with all my mp3's and videos... I could hear radio and could reproduce videos, music or see pictures or manage/transfer files from & to a pen drive with a micro USB to USB connector, or output full HD videos through MHL to HDMI cable to any TV. The perfect thing would be a Galaxy Note 3/S4 with Android 4.3 with no Samsung Bloatware, which could update to last Android, with no need to be flashing firmwares, etc...", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "works well and gives good performance. for it's price worth every penny.", "Author": "Lior Joseph", "ReviewID": "R1Q2PN0PX06XFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "most users will not need anything more..(I run AnTuTu benchmark application on my device and it scored 17126 points )", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "best price/quality relationship by far", "Author": "Abelardo A.

I moved up from a feature phone (Tracfone LG 840G) and an iPod Touch. As you may know, the iPod Touch (I had the 4th gen) has all the capabilities of an iPhone/smartphone minus the phone-calling/data feature. Since I have access to very fast WiFi both at home and at work, I was using the iPod for my email, text messaging (using Google Voice/iMessage/etc) and had all the other typical smartphone apps and functions. And my \"dumb\" phone, obviously, was used for calling when I didn't have access to WiFi.Well, I was looking at upgrading and having just one device to carry around, and so when Google lowered the price of a device I was already interested in, I jumped in and got the Nexus 4.I got the phone directly from Google (it's more expensive elsewhere) and added the $15 Straight Talk AT&T; micro SIM and their $45 30-day unlimited plan. So far (nearly a month) the phone has worked great and I love the Android OS. The phone is very fast and capable running a pure version of the latest OS (4.3). I also like the 4.7 inch screen.The lack of of an option to extend the 16 GB internal storage was disappointing at first, but I've since found that I don't really need any more space. For one, all my music (2000+ songs) are uploaded to Google Music and I just stream them. Also, I transfer or upload all the pics and videos before they fill up my phone. And lastly, all the essential apps that I've got so far have only used 3 GB of the phone's space -- leaving me with plenty more space to use.However, there are some things I do not like about the Nexus 4. The biggest issue is the battery life. Having used the iPod Touch as a smartphone-like device since it came out in 2010, I was expecting newer devices to have far better battery life. I do understand that compared to the iPod, this phone has a bigger screen and a faster processor (both of which use more power). But I still expected a better/longer battery life. Having tested the phone multiple times, I usually get about 8-10 hours of use -- one or two phone calls, a few texts, a few web page views -- nothing heavy. That, to me, is very disappointing. The phone is fairly light but I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit heavier, and had a bigger battery.Another gripe is about the brightness of the screen. Even at full brightness, the screen looks dimmer than the smaller iPod Touch's screen. I usually leave it on auto and it's fairly dim -- but I still get poor battery life.Now, before anyone comments about my phone usage, I'm not a heavy phone user and the phone spends a lot of time in my pocket. I also turn off anything I don't need (WiFi/Bluetooth/etc), but I still don't like the battery life I'm getting. The next big leap, I hope, is not towards bigger and bigger screens, but in extending the battery so that it'd last at least 24 hours in light use.Having said that, I do understand that there are phones out there with longer batter life and that the Nexus is a great value, but I still think that all phones from now on (now that we have the fastest processors, HD screens, etc), need improvements in battery life.I'll come back and edit my review if anything changes. But for now, to summarize the review, I'd encourage anyone to get this phone if you want a truly unlocked GSM phone with pure Android experience. Even though the phone is no longer available from Google, it can still be found elsewhere and is a great phone for anyone upgrading from a feature phone or not wanting a contract.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent.", "Author": "Luciano", "ReviewID": "R1ZAZ1OKSH1E77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, fast, reliable, software works great and everything updates automatically.Battery could last a little longer.Speaker is a bit low, for example when using it as GPS in the car it is hard to hear instructions", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I recommend it", "Author": "Maritza Zambrano", "ReviewID": "R2Y3F00ZPL4NJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was an excellent purchase.

Since I am, by nature, a seeker of improvement opportunities, here are a few (after three weeks of using the phone, and upgrading to Android 4.3):- Having come from a smartphone with a 3.5 inch screen, I find the width a little unwieldy, but I am getting used to it.- I installed another keyboard from the native Android set. Instead of simply *adding* the globe key which changes keyboards, the system *replaced* the comma on the English keyboard with the globe. Not convenient.- The staying power of the battery is not as advertised. With nothing active on a regular basis (not Bluetooth, not WiFi, not Auto Sync, Data Transfer turned off, there is no radio...), the battery is half run down in 14 hours. And I use the telephone less than 30 minutes in a day. (So why did I spend so much money on a phone? - Ah, that's also a good question.)- A solution to this situation would be to carry a spare, fully-charged battery. But the battery in a Nexus 4 is not removable.- The Nexus 4 was recommended by folks at work who are highly knowledgeable about such things. One of the points they made is that, with no service provider involved, I would be getting native Android, without all the bells and whistles added by service providers. Not true. There is a whole bunch of Google stuff included which I will never use, and which I cannot remove.On the plus side:- The sync is almost instantaneous - and I have as much stuff to synchronize as I did on my previous phone, where it took five minutes or more (with 4GB of memory, as opposed to the 16GB I have here).- On my previous phone, the pull bar on the Contacts list went from A to Z and then \"other\". On the Nexus, the order is A to Z and then my second alphabet, letter by letter, from beginning to end. A really handy improvement.- I am not a major user of the camera. However, for those times I have used it, it has performed well and given me crystal-clear, well-defined pictures. (I haven't yet used the video feature.)Now I intend to read through the user manual (over 200 pages) and really learn about the phone.

WHY GOOGLE WHY? other than that, this phone is a monster. NO hiccups anywhere! with 2GB of RAM how can you go wrong? This phone's design mirrors that of the iPhone 4. No, there is no stainless steel band running around the perimeter of the phone acting as an antenna, but there is gorilla glass panning the front and the back of this phone. another little minor feature that every user appreciates but doesn't really notice during every day use is the little glitter specks lighting up the back of the phone in a ray of bright dots. The phone has an 8MP camera sensor and a 1.3MP sensor on the front bringing beautiful clear shots with a minute lens. Google incorporates \"photosphere\" (360 panorama) into all of its newest nexus devices running android 4.2 Jellybean or higher, and the ability to upload them to google maps for the rest of the world to see which is nice.

The phone is sleek, smooth and surprisingly light. After using other relatively low end android phones, the switch is like moving to a Nissan GTR after driving a Micra.I like the swype style input mode but it still has a long way to go being as intuitive. The screen is good and even when it's off seems to have a certain black shine to it. No issues running multiple apps though it does tend to heat a lot sometimes. Overall sturdy build but I was forewarned about the back panel being fragile. Please invest in a good case as there have been reports of cracks being extended onto the screen owing to the moulded screen design that wraps around.Just updated to 4.3, feels good getting updates directly instead of relying on the firmware updates by other manufacturers. Screen size is ample, though a tiny bit smaller would've helped. I have big hands but I find that sometimes while selecting a corner on the right using one hand, my hand tends to select the option on the left side.Battery life is decent and you can get through a full day with both wifi and mobile network on. Games work flawlessly and the hold and playing feels good due to the phone's aesthetics. Videos play well but the default player might not be able to handle all HD videos well or play formats like MKV. MX player is a good alternative. Organizer - Google Now is very intuitive and will pick up on your searches/routes traveled/ places you like to eat and a whole lot of other stuff to make life easy.The home screen switching with customizable widgets let you get all your updates without having to unlock the phone. Be warned though using a pin/passcode screen lock will limit this functionality sometimes(especially using Exchange configuring office email).Sound quality is good but volume level has scope for improvement. If you're not buying the earphones from google(no they are not part of standard package), please test out any earphones before you buy.Camera quality is good but ones taken in low light might not always be good. The 360 view takes a bit getting used to(and makes you look like an idiot sometimes :P when you are trying to align the other frames to the original reference one). Don't expect it to replace your digital camera but decent enough for family pics and nights out.Overall, this is the best phone you can get in this price range.

I haven't used my iPhone 4s since purchasing...Snapdragon processor is quick and snappy. :) This phone runs Android 4.2.2 extremely well.  All transitions are butter-smooth and applications launch promptly.  To be perfectly honest, this phone is actually smoother than my Nexus 10, for reference.  If you've been looking for a wonderful, pure Android phone experience, this is it.External speaker is just okay, nothing extremely special--it works.  Phone is well built--solid, yet light, and soft/smooth in the hand.  The subtle, curved glass front adds a nice touch to the phones finish, and it is effective for allowing one's finger to smoothly glide across the screen from the side.  The phone is glass front and back, so putting it in a case is pretty much a no-brainer.  Regardless of what anti-scratch techniques are used, glass will still be fragile, and if dropped, _will_ break if not properly protected.  This phone is no exception to that.  Additionally, the glass back makes the phone especially slippery.  Slippery both in the hand, _and_ most importantly, it slips on surfaces.  When I first got this phone, it arrived before the case.  During those 2 days, I could have sworn that this phone sprouted legs and walked across seemingly flat surfaces when I wasn't looking!  I am not joking, this phone is super smooth...and slippery.  Luckily for me, I noticed before it had a chance to fall.  You've been warned. :)Overall, I am happy that I purchased this phone.

The phone came properly sealed in a box, brand new and flawless no complaints whatsoever.With regards to the phone itself I must say that it looks gorgeous very sleek design high quality nothing cheap, the screen looks amazing very natural color unlike the amole screens that look saturated. The screen is also very sharp and the phone behaves very well. It is fast, intuitive and fluid.The sound is great very clean and I have not tested the c\u00e1mara very well yet but so far so good.I haven't had the phone long enough to say my last word about it, but this is my third android, first nexus and so far it's the best overall. I'll come back with a review later to say my last word about this babyUpdate 05/09/2013 downgrade.The phone has WiFi issues it appears to me that it's software related but I'm downgrading my inicial rating to 3 stars only because this is unacceptable... The download speed while watching stream video suddenly drops so much that you just can't go on anymore, though I must say that you can do light web browsing without problems but I'm concerned about software updates because they imply lots of data...I searched for this issue on the web and there's a lot of people having the same problem, some of them from December 2012 and the problem still remains nowadays. So I guess I'll have to wait like the others for Google to release a proper fix in a small file so you can download it...very disappointing and a shame given the fact that this is a great device considering pricing.Having said that the phone drains the battery quick but if you use a battery saving software that controls the data network connection and low the screen brightness to almost a minimum the screen still looks fine and saves a lot of power to the point that you can end the day with 20% of remaining battery on moderate use. Heavy use will drain the battery before the end of the day.Update November 2013WiFi issues were solved long ago in a software update, so I have no complains on the phone. It's just one of the best phones I've ever had. Nexus 5 has just been release but I won't update because I don't think it's worth it.

I am one of the lucky ones I haven't dropped the phone, nor has it slid off of counter, so it is in the same shape as purchased.  I use a bumper at all times.  I tried the case flip cover thing, but it annoyed me too much to continue with it.I still find the ease of seeing all of my accounts.  Once I realized how to use the three different methods of finding a phone number to call and how one of them can be used similar to a speed dialing, I became less agitated as I didn't have to go through so many screens to make a simple phone call.Compared to my son's Samsung Galaxy I find the photo quality lacking.  The camera itself is fairly easy to use but I have seen better.My main issue is sound.  It is so limited.  I realize the speakers are on the back but this wouldn't have to be a big deal if I could put the volume up.  Even while talking the other person's voice is often very faint.In addition, even being in an urban setting my phone is often unable to catch a signal.  I could blame my carrier, but I will be sitting next to someone with the same carrier and they have 5 bars while mine sits on 2 or even none.The worst is the number of times I have pocket dialed someone. Unless I insure the screen is locked or the phone screen is on the number pad screen any stray movement can cause the phone to dial out.  I have made several accidental calls just when trying to hang up the phone.  Once the red is gone if my finger is anywhere on the screen I call someone.  One of these days it is going to cause me great embarrassment.I wish I had known the HTC version was coming out when I purchased this.  I would have waited and compared.  As it is, my friend is very happy with his HTC Google phone.I will continue to use the LG Google phone, but I don't think I will keep it the five years as I have done on my other phone.  The first real excuse I can find and it is gone.ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEWI am not a techno geek, just someone who likes to use all of the bells and whistles.  I am not one to upgrade for the sake of having the latest and greatest, I had my blackberry for at least three years and would probably be still using it if I hadn't dropped it for the umpteenth time.When I realized my phone was dying about two months ago I started the process of researching.  In my house we have the iPhone5, the Samsung Galaxy3, Nokias, Blackberrys, and have owned many others.  As I live in India I had shortlisted down to iPhone5 and the Samsung as these were readily available.  I was leaning towards the Samsung when I asked my nephews opinion.  He told me forget everything else and just get the Nexus.  After more research that is what I did.The first order of business was that my old, very old sim was too big for Nexus.  It was even too big to be cut down and so I had to go to Airtel which for Rs 25 gave me a new micro sim within 5 minutes and even installed it for me.  I wish everything else had been so easy.When I first turned on the phone, I was walked through many of the usual set ups.  The major problem came when the first time the phone rang.  As I had never used a phone touch screen before, I didn't realize that I just needed to swipe my finger from left to right over the little circle.  I missed a lot of calls before I went to the forums and found out that I wasn't the only one wishing there was a how-to booklet in the box.I have now been using the phone for over two weeks.  I have learned to answer the phone and learned how to find all the messages by pulling down the front screen. I've learned that there are some exciting things such as the maps that can navigate even in Haryana. I have all of my email account and social networking apps installed.  I can surf, and search. I have learned to appreciate the cards that pop up with timely information.I have learned to swipe write, still have mistakes but it has made writing texts so much easier to swipe from letter to letter like cursive texting than to try and hit teeny tiny buttons with my big fingers.I was first taken aback when a Picasa album that I had made years ago and forgotten about appeared in my gallery.  This is when I truly realized the power of having a Google phone.  I am still discovering, but I look at it as an adventure.There are some things I'm still not happy with.  The lack of any documentation is deplorable.  I realize that many already understand the concepts, but some of us newbies and converts would like to know what all the bells and whistles are without having to resort to the forums.  I thought I had loaded my music onto my phone, but somehow I am unable to access any of it. When I have time I will research what I am doing wrong.I thought I would be able to convert all of my contacts from Outlook to the phone.  That doesn't happen.  I put all of my blackberry contacts into my Google Account and then synched.  There may be an easier way, but I couldn't find it on the forums.There is no mute button.  I realize that is a small thing, but when you have forgotten to turn the volume all the way down and you get a call at the most inopportune time, it is an issue.So while I haven't learned all the bells and whistles, I am looking forward to the adventure of finding them.If you only use your phone for calls, texts and perhaps an email account, I would recommend that you find a more basic phone. If you can't take the time to learn and research don't get this.  While many of the things are intuitive, I know I am missing out on some fun things.However, if you have the fortitude and the desire to have a phone that can really be that personal attendant and not just a telephone.  Then this is the way to go.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.ETA:  Have discovered that my wma files cannot be used on an android.  I now have to convert my music to a usable format.

Apple (iOS) as everybody knows is a closed, restricted. iOS is certainly a 'weaker' OS, while Android lets you wander freely in the open sky and its more powerful. You will never feel restricted when you want to do anything with it. YOU FEEL YOU TOTALLY CONTROL YOUR DEVICE. That's where I like Android more over iOS. Android does not treat you dumb, it treats you intelligent, responsible and let you control your device and hence its overall usage.I just don't understand how one fruit company can control your device so much whereas on the other hand people even control their own life. More confusing is how people can let a company do that. Just because it produces the best looking product? IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY NOT BUY SOME ART WORK? AT LEAST WE WILL HELP ONE ARTIST. The device is for show-off or your own experience? What is more useful? A trophy wife or a mom like wife which does not look best but keep growing on you each day? Keeping the OS such dumb is for probably making the UI simple. Well use Android (pure stock Android that comes with google devices and you will never go back to iOS and rather you will find iOS lesser user and CUSTOMER friendly.Now little into specs->-----------------------1. Absence of LTE (The so called biggest flaw) -> Well the most sold iPhone 4S was same just 6 months ago and apple fan boy were not complaining at all and they would not had iPhone does not have LTE. Absence of LTE saves battery drain, data usage and HSPA is good enough for what smart phones are intended for and looking at smart phone usage pattern [MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE].2. Camera is not great but good enough.AND REST EVERYTHING IS JUST GREAT-> Super fast, snappy, Screen (as good as retina), call quality, battery life, built quality, looks (great), ease of use. After nexus 3 and nexus 7 this device offers you the best value for your money. You are free to switch carrier or at least deny contract and hence control on your device by the carriers. GOOGLE DEVICES ARE ALWAYS FIRST GET UPDATE. My wife is having S2 and she is still waiting for 4.2 even after 6 months of 4.2 coming.----------------------------------------------------------------------Two Real life Examples iPhone lovers who converted into nexus 4 users----------------------------------------------------------------------1. My friend who was using latest iOS on iPhone 4S just said: AFTER USING NEXUS 4 iPhone FELT LIKE TOY. Now there is no going back for him.2. Another prime example (probably one of the biggest iOS (apple) lover Ralf Rottmann. He is co-founder of biggest iOS (Apple) app developing company of GERMANY and has the latest Apple TVs, two iMacs, the latest MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, more than five AirPort Express stations and Apple's Time Capsule and yes iPhone 5 as well.HE HAS NOW TOTALLY CONVERTED INTO NEXUS 4. Read this great article (gizmodo.com/5973073/an-iphone-lovers-confession-i-switched-to-the-nexus-4-completely).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bottom line-> Need phone now or need unlocked phone?

If you're reading this, you've probably seen quite a few reviews of this phone already... It's a Nexus phone people! You get the latest Android updates! (Jelly Bean is snappin fast!), it's stock Android, which means you won't get any of the additions of any other company (Touchwiz-Samsung, sense-HTC.... you name it)Plus, the specs... 2 GB of RAM, quad core processor.This phone is freakin FAST! No lags when loading apps, multitasking is a breeze, and it's just so easy to work on this phone, and do whatever you want to do with it! In terms of putting apps, downloading stuff, etc. This phone will do the job just fine.Now, this isn't a perfect phone of course.Here are a few flaws:1) No microSD slot: This is a problem for some people, since 16GB is not enough if you take a lot of pictures, or if you listen to A LOT of music. The HTC One on the other hand, even though it doesn't come with a microSD slot, it comes with either 32 or 64 GB of internal memory, instead of 8 and 16 (which is the case for the Nexus 4). And I think that for a cell phone, even 32GB is more than enough.2) no LTE/4G: Guys, we don't even have 4G in my country. We do have 3.5G, or H+, which is what you see on your phone. And since that's my personal case, this doesn't bother me at all. Also, I've heard that even in the US there's still no 4G coverage everywhere you go, so... it relaly depends on our location.3) Photos are blurry when the place is dark, and you take pics with the flash: This happened to me at least 3 out of 4 times. It bothered me a little bit, but.... meh. It depends on what you're looking for. You bought a camera or a cell phone? Besides... in daylight, the camara performs well enough in my opinion.Except for the third one, you already knew about the first two, so that shouldn't bother you if you bought, or are thinking about buying the phone, just because you already know/knew what to expect.However, as I said before: I wish you the best trying to look for a phone as fast as the Nexus 4, with the same specs, for the same price or better. At the time of me writing this review, there just isn't any!So yeah, there you have it. Go and freakin buy this phone. At least for the next year or two, you're going to be the first one receiving the latest updates to the Android OS. And if Google keeps it the way it has been so far, the phone can only get faster.

May", "ReviewID": "R1QD93XLCXGAYW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a committed Google product user.  I've been using Google for 13 years and would never consider a different brand if Google has the product.  However, I live in an area with no cell reception so this is the first time I ever used any smartphone.  This puts me in a unique position to list the bugs which make the Google Nexus 4 so hard to learn.  I need a place to keep a running list of bugs as I encounter them.1.  The entry of user name and password is so difficult that I've given up trying to do it without a Blue Tooth keyboard, and even then it takes several attempts.  The following are the bugs only associated with this problem.  1a:  The \"Show Password\" check box is on a different screen than the password entry screen.  By the time you get the wrong username/password message, you can't go back and look at what you entered.  1b:  When you set \"Show Password\" it often lapses back into the no show mode.  1c:  The on screen keyboard is too small for people with big fingers, and there's room on the password entry screen to solve this problem for the limited case of user name/password entry.  1d.  The username/password characters that you type are often forgotten before you can complete entry.  1e.  The phone does not include a stylus which is needed to get started. I have not yet found any household material that will do as a stylus.  I ordered a stylus from Amazon, and neither end of the stylus would work on this phone.  1f.  There is no undo.  While you can't undo a call, for example, there is a need for an undo when entering username/password.  1g.  There are error modes when your finger lands slightly off target or on 2 keys, where the whole screen changes, and you can't get back, and by the time you do, what you typed is gone.2.  The battery screen gives %, and \"time on battery\" but does not say if these refer to power and time USED or LEFT (remaining), or perhaps the charging efficiency.  Between the battery, the charger, the cable, your power outlet, the message system, wireless or wired charger, and if you are using a case, there are many variables and you need to know what Google is attempting to display.  2a.  This bug is compounded by the fact that the % does not always update when you select REFRESH.  2b.  This bug is compounded by the lack of little blue '?' symbols that let you know what these numbers are measuring. I'm still trying to figure out if my wireless charger works the same through a case, and knowing what the numbers mean may help.3.  Camera.  The camera will take Spherical Pictures and upload them to Google+, and allow viewers to explore the photo  like an ant walking on the inside of a photo sphere.  This type of photo is commonly seen on realestate sites; but now its on the phone and easy.  However, I'm finding bugs.  3a.  It is not obvious how to exit camera mode.  There's a secret spot on the screen that has no label or icon that you have to touch to get out of camera mode.  Each little gotcha like this requires a Google search to learn what should be obvious.  3b.  I love my spherical pictures, especially when I can use INSTANT UPLOAD and view them on my PC monitor.  Only problem is that sometimes Instant Upload works, and sometimes it doesn't.  This is no doubt due to the fact that you have to turn on instant upload in some menu that is so buried that once you find it, its hard to get lucky twice.  The Instant Upload command should be located on the camera screen as well is buried deep within the menu structure.  There also may be other things that must be set ?  3c.  There is a screen with 8 different things to set to get camera uploads to Google+.  With some settings, there has to be a check mark next to the selected alternative.  With some, setting an option changes the text to say what option you selected.  For one there is a barely visible check box that selects the option.  This is hopelessly confusing, and I still only get some of my instant uploads.I will be adding and subtracting this list as I climb Google's first product with a steep learning curve.All this being said, I would never consider getting a different phone and there are many innovations including important innovations in photography.  The phone would be well worth the money to me even if I only used the camera.  So I give it 6 stars for innovation and important new inventions, but one star for having too many bugs.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome cell to dominate all, price awesome", "Author": "Mauricio A.

This is my first smart phone, my previous one was a Nokia dumb phone.  Maybe I expect too much or otherwise lack of comparison to, say, iPhone, it has been a disappointment so far.PROS:1. The screen is big.2. Processor speed is good.3. Google navigation is cool, but a battery drainer.CONS:1. Cannot hang up during the phone call.  The screen is black during the phone call, and it's virtually impossible to get it back.  After googling, it's a widely complained problem, related with the problem of sensor.  The suggested solution is to use power button to force hang up, which is annoying because I lost keypad access during the call.  I also tried without covers, played with power saving options, no good. It's a problem with the phone. I hope they fixed it for the new phones.2. Battery life is very short.  For web browsing, twittering, and stuff like that, less than half day you see red line on the battery. Charging is slow too.3. Glass on screen is fragile and repair is expensive. The phone fell to the ground from 3-foot-high table top, screen was in pieces.  Try repairing it and you will feel the pain.4. Gmail always complains \"no connection\" over 3G wireless, even though all my other Apps, including yahoo mail, work perfectly.  Again googling reveals that this is a widely complained problem.  Playing with the options doesn't help much.  Now I don't have Gmail access on my Nexus4 over 3G.  Why can't google make such a simple App work on their native platform?In short, it's a nice phone on the first sight, but after using it for a while, you found lots of problems.  While this sounds familiar, I still feel regret as most of these problems are easily fixable.

She has taken a few tumbles, some with a case on and some without (not hard these times though)and im pleased to say that the glass is definitely not as fragile as first so those phones must have been defective.Call Quality:Pretty good.

I think it's the Nexus' biggest flaw. It takes pretty good pictures in bright light but if the lighting is uneven my pictures tend to come out looking very pixelated(?), especially when zoomed in. Also colors almost always looked washed out when taken with this camera so I recently downloaded a HDR Camera app to try help matters a bit. And btw you're definitely not getting a good lowlight camera here.Having upgraded from a Nokia N8, which beat my panasonic point and shoot by a mile, I guess I maybe needed to adjust my expectations a little and remember it's a phone not a camera.Bluetooth:If anyone can figure out how to bluetooth a song on this phone then PLEASE let me know! I had to download an app to be able to do it and it's a bit tedious.Screen:Gorgeous!!! I find myself cleaning the screen like 4 times a day. It is beautiful but more importantly it feels awesome under your fingertips. I have not been able to bring myself to buy a screen protector(fingerprints) to this day.Responsiveness:Very fast!!!!!! Minimal to no lag and i'm more than half way through my memory with over a hundred apps.Sensor:The sensor is very sensitive and sometimes the screen will go black and I will get totally scared until I realize that something(my hand, a piece of paper or once I swear it was just a few wisps of hair) is hovering over the screen.All in all I still love my Nexus 4!

With very sparse use - around 30 minutes talk time, 20 minutes of mail  the battery still drains to 0% in about 8 hours, most often requiring 2 charges per day (you can see that the OS is using up most of the battery life). At this rate the 800 charge cycles will get used up in a years time before the battery starts to degrade. And then it does not come with a replaceable battery nor replacing it looks easy. There are tons of battery woes posted on XDA and Other Android forums. If Google can somehow solve this problem, it will be the best phone ever for its price.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Skype crashes and shutsdown randomly", "Author": "Shehab Ahmed", "ReviewID": "R3KUSNY6WH3M9W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Skype crashes and shutsdown randomly.

SO i am happy with the purchase.Second, amazon is perhaps the only true way to buy this out of US, precisely Central America. Local LG store claims they will bring it here with a pricetag of 650-700 and untill the end of Feb. So no thanks.Third, at 350 i would of course be extremely happy of the price but as i said before i am happy with what i received for what i paid.And last, the phone is a beast.

On day 12 I was holding the phone in my hand while laying on the beach in florida. Suddenly, I heard a clicking sound and when I turned the phone back, I saw the back glass cracked. The slight temperature increase on the sun has caused surface tension and the thin glass on the back cracked. The phone still works, but it does not look nice now. Will have to return it to Google. The phone was excellent othetwise , except 2 other issues: the screen is extremely power hungry compared to other phones. Even with moderate use the screen consumes nearly all of the battery life. This is probably why the phone is offered at such a low price of 300-350 USD at the Google store. Another flaw is that it does not have the SD card slot, limiting all of the media data transfers to slow speed over the USB 2.0 or the wifi. I think that LG is well aware of these issues and this is the primary reason of low stock - they don't want to be in a position having to warranty service all of their phones with cracked glass in the summer or in the cold winter.

Dent", "ReviewID": "R1NAAGTYZHE3B8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE: SEE BOTTOM OF REVIEW.I held off on buying the Galaxy S3 since I knew this phone was being released, and after tinkering with several s3 phones this is clearly the best Android phone you can own.Size: - I was a bit worried about the screen size moving from a 4.3\" Galaxy S2 to the 4.7\" Nexus, but the screen actually feels more accessible. The technical specs say that the Nexus is larger in all directions, but laying them on the table side by side, the Nexus is thinner, slightly narrower, and a bit longer. The back of the Nexus is not rounded, but instead has formed edges. When I pulled the phone out, I expected that to feel awkward but really it just made the phone feel more stable in my hand. It feels solidly built even if it doesn't have that smooth feel of an aluminum back like on the iPhone. Part of feeling that way is it's weight which you can definitely sense, but is not prohibitive.Android 4.2 Jelly Bean:  - Alright, I fully admit to being an immature child about certain things, and this phone is playing on those tendencies. I took 5 or 6 photo spheres of my living room just trying them out. You can see one here: [...] . As you can see, the stitching doesn't work all that well in a small, enclosed area. It's been a bit too cold to do a good one outside but I imagine it will look a little bit better when the objects are further away.  - Google Now is just asking to be messed with. The voice recognition is good as long as you enunciate. My favorite part is testing to see what it will answer back with (it will tell you how old Samuel L Jackson is but won't tell you when your next appointment occurs). I am sure this will improve.  - Beam is awesome, but so few people I know have this feature. You can instantly share things from an app. I used youtube and told my wife I had a video she should watch. Rather than hand her my phone, I put her phone up to mine and tapped the screen and she could watch on hers. Score one for selfishness.  - Jumping from 2.3.6 to 4.2 means a bit of a learning curve. Some things I like, some things not so much. The dedicated real estate for the softkeys means the 4.7\" screen is really only like 4.4. There is also way too much wasted space on the \"hotseat\" aka the dock or launch bar or whatever you want to call it. You could probably squeeze one more icon in the bar, but even more than that, the vertical space between the top and bottom of the bar is too big. Regardless, Netflix and other apps nuke the softkey bar.  - The mail app is fantastic now. I was sick of searching around for replacements for the stock mail app. Now my mail is taken care of.Speed: - The phone is crazy fast. I didn't really think my old phone was slow until I used this. Instant app launches, fast screen transitions, quick photo processing, it's all just fast. Obviously there is critique about the lack of LTE, which you can read about in depth elsewhere. For average phone users and even above average users who aren't serious whiners, the HSPA+ speeds are sufficient.Misc: - Screen is beautiful and readable in daylight (read my note about the softkeys and dock about screen real estate). - Call quality seems good but I have never been a stickler about phone audio. - Battery life is great and the phone easily gets through a day of regular use. - It looks smooth as the screen reaches very close to the sides of the phone. - Could've done without the sparkles on the back. - 16gb storage should suffice as long as you stream things (use Play Music, it is fantastic).Summary: If you have read this far, you either want to start a fight or you want this phone. For my two cents this is a phone you need to get if you are a fan of Android and are at least close to the cutting edge in terms of phone purchases. If it's time for a new phone, do yourself a favor and head over to the Google Play store and pick one up for $350. If you are peeing your pants in excitement, pay $600 here or ebay.Massive change in opinion:  Still read the above for my impressions about using the phone, but note that my review is really defined by the following two paragraphs.  Despite the fantastic experience I have had with the phone, in 5 months time I have had two phones break. The whole screen became unusable on both when they were dropped from less than two feet. The second one was in a case and it didn't matter, same effect. There are serious build concerns with having an all glass front and back.If you do buy this phone: 1) you MUST buy something for the back or it will slide off the table/chair/whatever. 2) Make sure you get a case that will completely eclipse the front so that no part of the phone will touch the ground ever.

Defective product! & Terrible Service!I stil cannot believe why some people choose \"not helpful\" for the review of unreasonable back crack. It's the truth. Only what I can believe is either Nexus/GOOGLE fun or GOOGLE/LG hire somebody to click \"no\" for it.A week ago I see a crack on the back of the screen. It's only 3 weeks after I received the product.I used the phone for 3 weeks with no drop on the floor. I'm a kind of person always taking care of my personal stuff so well. So I believe the phone is under my control.Then I did some research and find a lot of similar problems happened. There has been some conclusion that it is caused by temperature. So technically, it should be a design problem, which I believe that it is defective product issue.Then I contact GOOGLE and learn 2 things:1. Google only has 15 days policy to return the product.2. Google will charge 15% restocking fee if we return the product.What a big company! What a terrible return service policy they have! Especially comparing Amazon!Then I told them the problem about the crack, they said they are not responsible for the \"damage\", I should contact LG for repair.After I contact LG, the customer service is terrible. The first one said they don't have this kind of problem, and he said that it is physical damage and not apply to the warranty, and need me to send it to LG to do examination, and need two weeks to get the phone.1. I need to pay the shipping fee.2. Wait for 2 weeks.3. Probably I need to pay repair fee because they have made decision that it doesn't apply to the warranty.4. I told him about the defective problem caused by temperature, he told me he's never heard about that and all customers called about the cracks are because they drop the phone. The truth is I've never dropped the phone after I got it, and there has been some news can be searched online by GOOGLE! How happened it has been in some news!Conclusion:1. Terrible services by two big companies throw the ball with each other. The customers are the loser finally.2. I still believe the CSR in LG is lying.3. I won't believe Google can do anything anymore.

Having owned the original Nexus One since the week of it's release, I sort of expected better durability with the Nexus 4. Granted, the One was made by HTC and the four by LG but still, somehow my Nexus One has survived tremendous abuse over the past three years while I was pretty careful with the shiny new Nexus 4.  Perhaps the problem is the over hyped Gorilla glass.  The Nexus One does not have it but the other phones that have had a version of it - my wifes HTC Sensation and this Nexus 4 - both ended up with cracked screens.  With the Nexus 4, I actually noticed fairly quickly that the screen scratched much easier than the original Nexus One in normal use.  Finally today though, somehow the screen cracked, leaving the touch interface inoperable.  I'm pretty careful with phones - not a single failure in over a decade with any other phone - so I was pretty shocked that my Nexus 4 screen cracked. I guess I will avoid phones with Gorilla Glass going forward given this experience and that of my wife with her HTC Sensation.Otherwise, the phone was alright.

A company as big as Google should be able to handle a simple RMA, especially since they will be selling them in Italy soon.Other than Google's complete lack of \"global\" service, the phone is pretty nice.

At first I thought that maybe the odd ticks and bugs where just the way Android was.  When I finally saw Android on the Samsung SIII though I could not believe the difference.  It was hard to believe they were using the same OS (Android).  Samsung's Android implementation is worlds better than this one.  It is hard to believe that the phone Google is selling could have implemented Google's OS so badly.There are so many things that make the experience on the Nexus4 painful.  For example.  If you click on a link that is a PDF.  Every other phone will open a PDF viewer automatically so you are able to view the file.  One step and you are done.  The Nexus4 downloads the PDF of the phone to a folder and pops up a little window to say \"downloading.\".  So you have to close the browser, then go find the downloads folder, then try to figure out which file in the downloads folder it is that it just downloaded, then click on the file then, and THEN select what app should be used to view the file.  Five steps.  Something so simple that is made so difficult gives you an idea of how needlessly hard this phone can be to use.  Pros:  * Complete freedom.  The phone is totally unlocked and supports GSM and CDMA so you can take it with you to any phone company and use it with no contracts.  Con:  * Terrible Android implementation.  See the description above for details.  This one was the deal breaker for me.  This is painful to use compared to Samsung's Android implementation.  * No expansion slots for added memory.  * Really high bandwidth usage.  You will need a MUCH more expensive data plan.  Since the phone can not store much with it's limited storage it constantly needs to go to the Google services to download contacts, music, photos, etc.  So you need one of the highest end data plans.  * Battery life is nowhere near what is claimed.  Plan on having it plugged in pretty much everywhere you go.  * No LTE support.
