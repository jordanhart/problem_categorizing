I have not tried the LiveView for Facebook or Calendar yet, but it absolutely works as described for phone calls and text messages.  I downloaded the firmware update from the Sony Ericsson website (see link below) before connecting it to my phone (Samsung Droid Charge) via the LiveView app available from the Android market.The LiveView is very light and I'm wearing it as a watch with the included band.  One note about the band is that you may miss the tiny little pins that come in the box.  Since there are no directions in the manual about assembling the watch band, I'll give you a hint.  Snap the LiveView into the included watch backing which includes tiny holes for the pins.  You then have to carefully and patiently attach the backing to the wrist band by threading the pins through the loops on each side of the backing and fit the pins into the backing holes.  It's not unlike most pin based watches but it can take some time and dexterity.When you receive a call or text you (as programmed via the app on your Android phone) will get a short half second vibration along with a color coded LED notification on the top right of the LiveView.  The device is very well made and very classy, including the understated band.The battery life seems very good which is important since you have to remove the LiveView from the watch band to charge it via the included USB cable.The LiveView sold by Amazon.com is for the US market and includes a US style charging adapter.In summary, if you want to make your Apple Iphone friends jealous (LiveView only works with Android now) this is the way to do it.Update on 7-23-2011I a returning the LiveView to Amazon because the device constantly drops its connection to the phone and does not automatically reconnect.  This occurs even when the phone is within 3 feet of the LiveView.

Although it has standard watch hardware, so you might be able to attach a better looking strap.- Setting up sync up with a phone is not straightforward. Although instructions are helpful, so eventually you will get it.- Costly, esp because it does not work for most of the times.Ugly:- Freezes once in a while, randomly, and then comes back.- Awful battery life.

In fact I bought two, one for my son and one for mine of course. First I was sold by the concept of this product that's letting you know what's happening in your phone before you even try to take a glance at it. This product is so cool. I know many reviews where bad but I proceeded anyway and bit the bullet.  The only drawback is the syncing of your phone and the liveview when the two lost contact with each other e.g. when you go far several feet/meters from your phone/liveview or vice versa, when bluetooth communication of both device where cut off you have to press the liveview button or open the liveview app itself to sync again and that is taking both device within each others bluetooth signal range and that is cumbersome specially when I arrived home and just put my phone above the drawer and expecting to be notified from my liveview of updates from my phone. But once the connection is made it is pretty solid. Unlike the bluetooth headunit in my car that whenever I start, it automatically sync with my phone no buttons to push or any settings to be made, once they are paired and bluetooth is on and your good to go. This would however be cool if sony still have the interest in updating the firmware of this device to automatically re sync when the signal of both device is within range of each other.  Be aware also that this device has a firmware update last year which somehow improves connection issues but that doesn't include the automatic syncing as what i have observed. With my sgs2 liveware manager causes undesired operation between my phone and the liveview and I just uninstalled it since it is not necessary. This is a great product and i hope sony will push a new firmware update for this device not just left it in the dust. i know they have a new smart watch but ohh!!!!! Sony come on don't leave us behind with this unfinished product.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool toy, sony ericsson finally fixed the connection issue", "Author": "Tim Yenmor \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "R111QZJ80B5TRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product now sells for $20 or so on amazon.  Just got one.  Just thought everyone might want to know that the connection issue has been fixed.  There's no more connection issue.  My liveview stays connected to my galaxy s 4g.  And when I come back from outside of range, it automatically reconnects.I can control music, take pictures remotely, make my phone sound an alarm for me to find the phone, send text messages for missed calls, secretly record conversations, read text documents, etc.Also, the design flaw with the charger location I've managed to solve.  Very easy to do.  The liveview comes with 2 pieces that can attach to it.  One piece is meant for you to wear as a watch and the other has a clip and lets you clip it on things, like your backpack.  Just super glue the part with the clip onto your liveview.  Make sure you avoid super gluing the charging port area.  The point of super gluing the 2 pieces together is your liveview won't fall off the clipper piece.Now, put your strap on your wrist.  Clip the liveview perpendicular to your arm.  Look at where the metal piece is where the strap wraps around and goes back to Velcro.  There's an opening within the metal piece of the strap.  Slide the liveview clip in there.  This way you can view the liveview like a watch.  I can't stress this enough.  Do not clip it parallel to your arm.  Clip it perpendicular to your arm via that opening within the metal piece.  Sits very tight on the strap and very comfortably on your wrist.I'm still amazed at how many things this \"toy\" could do.  It does everything from letting you read text documents from your phone on your wristwatch to making your phone fake call (get away from a boring conversation) to secretly record a conversation to giving you your gps coordinates on a map to selecting from your contact list and making calls.  Just do a search for \"liveview plugins\" on google playstore and you will find dozens and dozens of plugin apps for you to play with.No, it's not a very fashionable watch to wear.  Those of you who care about fashion should stay away from this product.But for 20 bucks, this makes a really cool toy to have.

It's actually really awesome when it does work, but it often stops working and requires a bevy of resets to get things going again. I bought this to control Google Music on my EVO 4G. I have bluetooth in my car as well and jacking around with my phone to control my music was pretty dangerous.The good news: It works for this purpose. The bad news: Not for very long. I usually start my 30-minute commute with things working, but by the end of it, I'm back to jacking around with my phone since the LiveView has disconnected itself and refuses to work. I guess what's most frustrating to me is that after it disconnects, it doesn't seem to try very hard to reconnect.Honestly, this device really does itself a disservice. Lots of people have asked me what kind of watch I'm wearing and when I tell them, they want to see it in action. This is the critical point when an accessory can really sell itself, but 9 times out of 10 it doesn't work and they say \"oh...\" and walk away. IF IT WORKED CONSISTENTLY I would love this thing!!! As it is, it fails at the main thing I bought it for, which is to keep me from having to look at my phone for things since you can't trust that this thing is ever working at all.There was apparently a firmware update last year that addresses some issues. I have no way of knowing whether mine had this update pre-applied or not since the updater fails to find my device in DFU mode. Navigating the Sony Ericsson website for what you need is an exercise in frustration; it's as if they went out of their way to make finding information about how to fix a LiveView as difficult as possible.I don't know that I'd purchase an improved version of this. I think it's such a colossal failure that I've lost a bit of faith in this brand.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not great", "Author": "Spaided", "ReviewID": "R29U3DCPCRZ282", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, to start with....1. It technically isn't supported (via Sony Website) by my HTC Sensation 4G.  It does however function properly \"most\" of the time.  It does connect and show the information stated.  I do notice however, that it likes to freeze up and not show ANY information unless you give it a few minutes or restart it.  I have updated it via it Sony software from the support site and it appears to help a little.  I does show the names of the people who call you which is a very neat feature, so you can decide if you want to reach \"all the way\" into your \"pocket\" to get that noisy device!2.  The battery life seems to be good.  I played with it for hours and it never died.  I know with normal use it will probably last few days if not more, but I cannot verify that yet, do to me only having it for about 18 hours.  I will update this review as needed.3.  The device is very easy to use \"when operating like designed\"  but when it freezes up it become very frustrating.  The touch sides are very responsive, and if you wondering, no the screen itself isn't a touch screen, you actually touch the watches bezel for it to work.4.  In conclusion, if you were buying this to actually fully work 100% of the time, don't!  I am kind of a tech junkie that likes to try new devices, especially ones with a lot of POTENTIAL like this one.  If they could get the software to not be quite so buggy this device could be a show changes, especially at less that 70 dollars.  I hope this helps some of you out.*****UPDATE*****Returned Item!The thing proved to be not what they described (sony, not amazon) It would not stay connected to my phone for more than 15 minutes.  I tried and tried to get it to work but to no avail! I am soooo glad that Amazon is a reputable company and took it back, it just didn't function like promised. I have changed my rating to a 2 b.c. it still have a LOT of potential, maybe with firmware updates or something but it was unusable with my brand new HTC Sensation or my wifes Nexus one, or My Touch 4G.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Will end up in your junk draw before long.", "Author": "Donald Olsen \"Eagle One\"", "ReviewID": "RM6E2J5V1DVMQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There is a reason this sells for 80% less than its original list price. Don't be fooled into thinking this device will improve your life in anyway. After 3 days of trying to make the Liveview usable I have just about giving up. First off you have to search the Sony website for a long time before you can locate the update service software. Once you do it takes an inordinate amount of time to install. So you allow it update which it needs, and hope for the best. Well it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. First off it's not very easy to tap the edges of the screen with a finger that is of normal size for adult. Secondly, it is slow to respond when you so you often times end up bypassing the icon you hoped to use. Thirdly, it times out no matter what function is being used in less than 20 seconds.Fourthly, and this is the big one. Once you do manage to get a Bluetooth pairing (good luck) it will not retain the connection for any real length of time. I was lucky if I could maintain Bluetooth connection for about 5 minutes at a time. So I look for answers on the Sony website and not much there to help. So I read thru the comments on the two apps on the Google play store which you need in hopes of finding some tips. And again to my dismay not much help there. Then I stubble upon a developers web site with a Google search that points me to a 3rd Party application and for those who may want to try it it's called \"Liveview Charm\". This helped things a bit and the first time I was able to maintain connection for about 4 hours. Then it lost connection, and after trying to pair it for the next 15 minutes without success I gave up and wrote this review. The 3rd part application did a commendable job trying to salvage this device but 4 hours is only long enough to further frustrate you. It's almost like enough to say hey maybe I will like this thing but as they say the Liveview device pulls the rug from underneath you.So what I'm saying is, discounted or not it's probably not worth the aggravation and you know that junk draw in your house with old cell phones, iPod Nano's and defunct watches your grandmother might have given you, well yes that where this will probably end up in short time.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it so far", "Author": "Owen P.

I found this (Sony Ericsson LiveView) and it looked ok. The price was right so I gave it a shot. The Smart Watch by Sony also looked enticing. I got this a few days before my Birthday and imediatly charged it. That was the first design flaw i saw. The charging port is blocked when attached to the wrist strap. You have to take the LiveView out of the strap to charge it and it does not come out easily (which is both good and bad). The two button operation and the \"touch screen\" are very easy to navigate. It has a short timeout period which was nice to save the battery. The blue tooth connection would drop periodically, but I found a free app to help prevent that. The apps in the Market are pretty limited, but the few i found are nice and work well. The instructions for the unit are very limited too, I had to go online to find how to enable most of the \"plug ins\" as their called. Just quickly, install the LiveView app and then find the plug-ins you want. Open the LiveView app and go into setting and manage plug-ins. This is where you can enable the individual plug-ins. The plug-ins are kept on your phone and the LiveView get a list and can start and stop those plug-ins remotely. The GMail plug-in has a very small font, but works well. Over all I would say to give it a shot if your considering it, just don't expect a large selection of plug-ins and full control of your phone. Mine is paired to my Motorola Droid Bionic and works fine. One thing I do wish for is a Pandora plug-in (if any developers are reading this).

After updating the firmware, I've had minimal connection issues (one of the reviewers below mentioned a recent new update).  I've got it connected to my Galaxy S3 running Liquid Smooth v2.3.  Disconnect's are occasional (maybe once a day), but usually resolve automatically or will require a quick tap of the Connect button within the LiveView software.  The range isn't amazing, but is at least 7-8 feet.It does exactly what I wanted it do (allow for discrete notification review without pulling out my phone) and more for an incredible price.  There are a few plugins available on the Play store for the LiveView as of now, I highly suggest utilizing SimpleGmail, Dial, Music, and the Mode plugin.  All free, all working perfectly on my unit as of now.To address a couple of the cons people have mentioned:-I agree that the watch strap isn't that comfortable or aesthetic, but it can be easily changed out for any 18mm standard wrist strap.-The SimpleGmail plugin offers Gmail notifications, works perfectly (so far).-Battery life - mine has been rather good.  While I do turn it off at night (since I obviously dont need vibrating notifications while I sleep), mine has been going for 4-5 days without a recharge.-The watch blocks the recharge port - annoying, but there is a \"creative\" workaround for this on YouTube for those who keep the original strap (cant find it right now unfortunately).

Not a single disconnect in at least the last 2 months.

It's still dropping connection but I can make it resync in about 10-30 seconds without touching the cell phone.Every review cons is pretty much accurate:Cons:- Connection is not reliable. (making the device unusable to a regular not curious or experienced user)- Once you put the watch plastic back, you woudn't be able to pull it out without risking breaking it.- The watch wrist band blocks the usb port, HUGE design flaw. you need to pull it apart everytime you have to charge it.- Without syncing, this device is pretty much just a watch. And even then, you need to sync at least once to setup the time, there is no menu or independent setup.- Small nitpicks: the surface is curved, so I couldn't use any screen protector, and the touch buttons are on the side so sometimes you activate them by mistake.PROS:- Once it syncs at least once, the time stays in the device even after disconnected. This would be a sort of \"watch mode\".- Battery can lasts days with the unconnected \"watch mode\" i mentioned above.- Battery lasted me 4-5 hours paired to the device. Up to the user to decide whether or not that's enough.- Vibration is good enough to call your attention. In that sense it does a better job that my cell vibrating in my pocket.- I like the way it looks. It's somewhat bulky but the led is bright and clear.I would recommend it only because of the price. I would say: buy it if you can spare the $20 for something you know might not work and eventually become a (somewhat bulky) led watch.(FYI, when installing OpenLiveView, if the device connects and immediately drops, you might want to try unpairing the devices via the bluetooth menu, then, just to be safe, restart both devices.

Bring it back in, plug it into the charger again, still nothing. (The charger, by the way, is a euro style with a funky US adapter) so I try the described reset procedure, nothing. Everything else I can think of, nothing. Finally I figure it out. It needs to be where all crappy electronics need to be, file 13! So that's where it is, and that's where it will stay.

As described, this is a remote control for your Android cell phone. I am using it with a Google Nexus GSM and Liveview, Liveconnect and the plugins I tried all work well with it.The only big negative is that they supplied a European charger (this product was obviously intended to be sold in Europe). I charged it with a standard micro USB cable - wall adapter I have, but at least they should have included a EU to US plug adapter.Although the unit does everything it claims to do (and unlike many others I may have lucked out since I had no disconnect problems) the issue becomes \"so what\". I can use the unit to read text messages, tell who is calling, control the Android music player and so on, but since my phone is only a few inches away it is no harder to simply use my phone.  If I am at a meeting putting the phone on silent mode works as well as using LiveView. As far as I can tell using this means having to charge and manage two items instead of one for the dubious benefit of having a remote control that handles a limited number of your phone apps and which (since it is bluetooth) has a limited range that it operates at. At the price I paid this is a cool gadget and it was well worth it to experience what a \"Smartwatch\" is currently like - I am glad I didn't spen the money for the Pebble or Sony Smartwatch. Maybe when Apple, Google or Samsung come out with one they'll also come up with a reason for actually using it, but that's not the case with this.  So, I'm giving this a 3 because of the great price and the fact that it seems to work well and does what it claims to do.  I would give this a 5 if it weren't for the fact that I can only think of a very few limited possibilities where using this is worthwhile.

When I got the watch I immediately upgraded the software on the watch itself, and downloaded the latest Android app to sync it with. Despite using the latest software (on the watch and phone, both) I was unable to keep it paired for more than a couple of hours. When the battery on the watch got to ~70% it cut out and would not sync again until fully charged. If the watch was moved out of range and back again it would not re-pair with the phone unless I went through the entire re-pairing process from scratch. If the phone went to sleep, the connection would be lost. Overall, except during the brief periods (typically 15 minutes long) when the connect worked, the watch was useless. When it worked (however briefly) it was very nice and showed a LOT of promise especially with some of the plugins that are available.After I gave up on the Sony software, I then tried an open-source project called OpenLiveView that is available on Google Play. This was, remarkably, able to maintain a Bluetooth connection, and if the connect was lost - for example if I went out of Bluetooth range, just pushing the button on the watch caused it to re-pair in seconds. Unfortunately, OpenLiveView is in the early stages of its development, so it does not allow you to use plugins YET.Overall, I am going to keep the watch because it is so cheap, and wait for OpenLiveView to mature.

The clip and watchband both broke within 2 months of having the unit, so I have a device that I can't wear.  This is a poor design.  If you could charge the unit without uncliping it from the band, then it would probably have held up.Limited apps, and poor construction of band and clip.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "did not work right", "Author": "vincent capps", "ReviewID": "R18NJTT506XDO0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This thing did not work right.

Its reasonable quality for the price, it's plastic (though I bought a screen protector along with it, so I'm not too worried about scratches.)  Keeps good bluetooth connection and works well with my Galaxy SII Epic Touch.  Problems:  Once you put it in the watch band, you can't really remove it, so to charge, you must remove the watchpin (not hard, no tools required, but those pins are delicate, so may have to go to jewlers to get replacements eventually.)  Also facebook and twitter notifications don't work.  I'm not the only one with the problem.  I suspect it's because I'm not using an xperia phone, though the instructions included indicate it should work on all android 2.0 or better.  Maybe a software update will eventually fix that.The screen look good, is bright enough, but it doesn't have that true bright whitepoint quality I'm used to with computer displays.  I'm really not complaining, but these are some improvements you'll see, I'm sure, if you buy sony's newer smartwatch at nearly $100.00.It offers basic functionality but doesn't do anything more at all.  No settings to change backlight duration, clockface, colors or anything of the sort.  It feels like a first gen (or even beta) product.  For $23.00, I'm perfectly happy.  If I find I really like the smartwatch idea, from my experience with this, I may invest in something that costs more.
