My last flip was the LG CU515.  If you've used one of those, this phone will be very familiar - the operating system and layout is nearly identical.  The only real difference is that this phone is better.PROS:GSM phoneSimple address bookAT&T; address book if you have AT&T; (syncs your contacts, as I understand it)Pretty nice processor, a big improvement in speed over my CU515Beautiful, bright internal LCDNice external LCDVery impressive camera for being an older dumb phone (up to 1280x1024 photos, high quality).  Image capture features include a few lighting and color adjustments, a Timer, and resolution and quality setting.Good speaker volume3 speed dial keysSelectable Mass Storage over USB featureVoice Command feature (haven't used it)Threaded Text MessagingVideo Share featureIM, Email, and Web browsing capabilityLightweight phone with rounded edges, feels good in the handBig buttonsCheap.  I picked up my Unlocked phone Used for $30 from ReCellular here on Amazon.Made by PantechCONS:Proprietary charging / headphone / data cableText message tones can only be selected from audio files in the \"Alert Tones\" folder, and you cannot transfer files into that folder from inside the phone - don't know if you can do it over USB.BOTTOM LINE:The perfect simple flip; I love it.Big buttons, Speed Dial keys, simple features, Breeze mode, and up-to Very Large font size (only in Breeze mode) make this a good choice for anti-tech seniors with bad eyesight.
