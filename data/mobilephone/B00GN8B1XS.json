But then this seems to be the new Nokia ...Every Lumia phone as well as the Asha Touch phones use the Fabula design , based on the legendary Nokia N9 . It looks wonderful on the N9 and the upper ( 8xx and above ) level Lumias but on the lower Lumias and the Asha 501 it looks cartoonish with the cheaper materials .On the Asha 503 and its sisters the 500 and the 502 , Nokia added a transparent outer layer which not only protects but also jazzes up the looks , the 503 lOoks sharp and classy ! I do , however , have a few issues with the design . First no camera button. Sure accessing the camera from the lockscreen is both cool and useful , but a camera button is more useful or better yet both !The other issue is no 2mm charger port . Yeah this is a Nokia thing but the ability to charge your Nokia while using the micro USB for data is very useful . Plus the 501 has the 2 mm port , Nokia could have added it here too .A third design issue is that the back cover is very difficult to get off . It gets easier with time but Nokia should have done better . Oh and you have to use the supplied headphones , the 503 doesn't seem to recognise any others , though the speaker's stellar ! Now for the software ...Nokia touts this as the all new Asha Touch platform but this is simply s40 optimised for touch with some Meego bits thrown in . The Meego bits do help but Nokia's asking a lot of s40 here and it shows . The UI lags at times , not too bad but Nokia should certainly fix this .The most touted feature is Fastlane . It's undeniably cool , even useful if you don't use the  503 too much . But if you use ur phone a lot like I do , it quickly gets out of hand ! Sure you can control what appears there but again if you use it a lot you are faced with. Either crippling Fastlane's usefulness or simply not using it . I rarely do .The most annoying thing about the software is the email client which is very slow . Social is adquate but no more .the app store , and I don't normally complain here , is heavy on games and personalisation but very light on apps .Otherwise , the software pretty much flies on the 503 . The Nokia Xpress browser is a bit limited but it flies on the 503 and gets the job done nicely ! Swipe works well and generally the 503 works well , Battery life is good though I recommend keeping an extra handy if you use it a lot .If you are looking to upgrade from a dumb phone or don't want a full smartphone , this is a great choice if you can find it at a decent price ! But if you are a power user like me looking for a backup , the Asha 311 is a much better choice if you throw in a 32 Gb Micro sd card !
