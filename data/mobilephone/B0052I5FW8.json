I actually tried the new Blackberry Q10 and hated it so much, I sent it back and bought this phone.  It is just the right size, easy to type on the keyboard.  I enlarged the font some so it is very easy to see, I can't believe how super fast the Internet speed is.  That blows me away.  I added a Micro SD card and some pictures off of my computer for different wallpapers.  It has a good battery and came with lots of apps but I'm going to get more from Blackberry World.
