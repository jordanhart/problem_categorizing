{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not show ready but acceptable if you're coming from a flip phone or other dinosaur phones", "Author": "Juls of Antelope", "ReviewID": "R10JYOZXS7CTBP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are coming from some dinosaur phone like flip phones like startac, razr, or the likes, then this phone for you can be the killer phone best bang for the buck.  It does pretty much everything your current phone does and most of the new phones do.But I'll be basing my review from my own experience and coming from an okay phone, HTC Sensation, 4.3\" screen with android OS and a dual core processor.  So, based from where I am coming from, this phone doesn't come anything close to being usable.Number one: It has limited viewing angles.  If the screen is in landscape watching videos or playing games can trigger a headache.  There must be a scientific explanation to that that I can't explain.  But for some reason, each eye kind of feels like seeing something similar but not close enough.  Is it the refresh rate causing it or invisible flicker that starts from top to bottom (when in landscape from left to right)?.  Anyone capable of explaining this phenomenon please help explain.Number two: The screen color is too washed out looking.  It's not even in the acceptable region.  It's embarrassing almost to be seen with such a cool looking phone only to see the screen is bottom end quality.  The best comparison to its color is the laptop screens around 1998 or older.  It just doesn't have enough color quality to pass as modern device.Number three: The resolution is too low.  I really had hoped I could work on the low resolution as I do prefer bigger fonts and bigger  icons.  But this one is plainly too low.  It's like stretching a thumbnail picture out to a 6 inches screen.  Juggeddy everywhere.  Higher resolution pictures when shown on this screen came out juggeddy.  Best comparison here is you know when you first start a netflix movie when everything starts out pixelated until seconds later resolution catches up and becomes acceptable?  This one doesn't catches up, resolution stays pixelated through out even when the movie is actually already on the memory card.Number four: The processor is slow.  I'm sure they'll fix this in the later version but with this one, the speed is slow.  It seems like the same speed as single core old android phones.  It's acceptable though but definitely does not feel like a dual core because there seems a long lag in all response times.  You may have seen videos on youtube showing you the response time but in my experience it's only true when there's not a sim card and no memory card on the phone.  The lag doubles or triples as soon as the phone is loaded with tasks from both cards.The good things:If you're coming from a dinosaur phone, I can see this phone as being super cool super phone for you.  Plus the speakers are really loud so that's big points for this phone.  The build quality too seems like very good very sturdy.The battery endurance seems very good as well.  Lasts a good 12 hours in my experience, even better than my HTC Sensation.  That is of course explainable due to the fact the this phone doesn't have 4G which sucks out battery juice really bad as we all know.The size is acceptable too.  It's not too big at all and I'm only 5'9\" male with average hand size.  I can see this being an impossible to handle phone for person that is much smaller than my size.The OS is a true 4.0 android which is pretty nice.  No complain on this one.The cover is acceptable too on the build quality.The color orange, this one you gotta like orange or bright color to like this one.  The orange is the good shade of orange but still too bright and too attention grabber.In the end, would I recommend this to a friend?  No.  What about to a grand parent just entering touchscreen phones?  Big yes.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "A cool idea but falls short...", "Author": "M. Perez \"Wireless Provider - Solavei\"", "ReviewID": "R3D4M4L9X81IVX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone, when it worked was pretty amazing! huge display even though the resolution was not so good 800x400, but was still very readable, touchscreen was very responsive, sound was pretty good, speakerphone was very loud. The shortcomings of this device is that, like all the other Chinese made knock off models, the frequencies will never be supported in the USA Mobile market. No matter AT&T; or T-Mobile, or even the MVNO's \"Straight Talk, Solavei, Simple Mobile, Red Mobile, ETC\" you will only get EDGE 2G data. this is because for 3G HSPA+ on this device and 99% of the other Chinese knock offs, the only frequency they support is 2100. In order to have HSPA+ on AT&T; you need 1900mhz, on T-Mobile its 1700mhz (1900MHZ by 1-1-2013 in select markets) so yeah, you will all-ways be on EDGE 2G in USA Market. All though the build quality is impressive, very sturdy, great weight, and 2 battery cover options, after 2 weeks of continuous usage the display started to artifact, the phone was still usable, just was difficult to see. I had to send this device back.Again, when working, this phone was amazing! In the long run... no so much. I would not recommend this device.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "MAKE SURE it is really MTK6577 dual-core 1.2GHz inside", "Author": "Himadri", "ReviewID": "RTUAEXUB4G0MQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Look at the two pictures and notice the color of the rear camera is not the same.

The phone it self is a solid build and feels good in the hand. Even though the reselution of the phone is quite lower then what I orginally was hoping for it still works and operates great. The dual sims are an awesome feature of this phone and being i am on prepaid it works great!!! Yes it does recieve hspda+ 3g/4g speeds on the Att Network being it has the 850 mhgz band which is atts main 3g band! The dual sims help me save money while getting the most for my money att 3 gig tablet data plan 30 + Tmobiles unlimited talk and text for 30 = $60 total and get the best of prepaid!!! The software itself is android 4.1.1 jelley bean and it runs smooth with a little hick up here and their, but over all cant complain for a $168 phone. The GPS itself is a little slow to lock the first time but after that it locks perty snappy. The camera itself seems more like a mid-grade 5mpg camera but then again did not buy this phone for the camera it functions well for snap and go but nothing really mind blowing like the n8 I had. The call quality is great and is very loud. When playing music the phone is loud! It does distort the sound at the max volume level but 2 knotches down is still louder then the galaxy s3 I had and great quality! Over all if I had a chance to buy this phone over again i would it comes with a 2 3200mah batters, charger, head phones,a flip snap on case as well and does what i need it to with out a hassesl over all very happy!", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Dual Sim Card Support,\nBiggest Screen 6.0\" AMOLED,6.0 inch FWVGA 480*854 High Resolution AMOLED, Capacitive Touch Screen\nUnlocked, travel anywhere with this phone,COME WITH FREE PHONE CASE $10 VALUES,\n5.0 Backcamera, 0.3 front camera.
