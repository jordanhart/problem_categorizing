The price through Amazon was half of what Verizon wanted to replace the phone.  Overall, the Spectrum is a nice smartphone.  The size is a good balance of good viewing vs compactness.  The display is crisp and I have not had any problems running any Android apps.  The only issues that I have with the phone is sometimes the menu is a little obtuse and the premature demise of the Spectrum phone which prompted this purchase.  However, the predecessor phone was not truly dead; it just had \"issues\".  And my Spectrum, purchased at the same time as my wife's Spectrum contract phone is still running.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than what i expected", "Author": "Very Satisfied", "ReviewID": "R2HQQEYKH8A0X2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The shipping was very fast (it came within four days of me ordering) and being that the phone was used i expected to get what i paid for but the phone was in like brand new condition and only a VERY small scratch on the back overall i am very pleased with their service and would recommend them to anyone looking for an affordable phone", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "addicted to amazon", "ReviewID": "RBVM8Z4RTJ8WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. came sooner then it was supposed to. the picture is very clear.

What a LONG two years it was, too.The First lesson I learned is that I will never buy LG again (EVER) and will strictly avoid Verizon contracts as well.The second lesson I learned is the 2-year contracts are for the birds.Let's talk about the pros of this phone.  This won't take long.Big beautiful display?  Check.Durability from scratches and from drops?  Check.Call quality?  Check.Now let's talk about the cons.  Get comfortable this might take a while.Slow and laggy phone.Sluggish - sometimes freezes (daily occurrence).Gets very hot and randomly restarts.Horrible battery life - under normal usage requires multiple charges daily - uses 25% battery life just to reboot.Picture quality is below average.Video quality is below average.Switching between screens is nightmarishly slow.Speaker quality is below average - videos are hard to hear - volume not adequate.Bloatware is abundant.Boot time is ridiculously slow.Charge time is about average.Seeing the screen is next to impossible in the sunlight.Overall this is a clunky, infuriatingly slow and glitchy smartphone.  Factory reset helped things a little bit - but right off the shelf it was clear that I (and my wife) were going to hate this choice.I have read some moderately good reviews of this phone of PC Mag and Amazon.  Don't you believe them.  So many times over the past couple of years I just wanted to throw this thing on to the concrete pavement just as hard as I could, then stomp on it for a good solid 10-minutes just to get my frustrations out.  Yes, it is that bad.All of my friends have different phones and none are as bad as this one, and most are far superior.What will I get next?  Not sure.  The only thing I know for certain is that I'm taking this thing to the shooting range this weekend.  Just me and my trusty Elite Operator 2 and this phone set up at 100 meters.  Then I will mount it (hole and all) on the wall of my den for all the other phones to learn from the example.------UPDATE:  This phone is now on my mantle.  Hole and all.  I got an Apple 5s as a  replacement which (so far) is behaving itself mainly because of the example I made.  It's not perfect by any measure, but it is superior to what I have endured these past two years.  I will never forget ... LG engineers have no idea what they are doing when it comes to smart phones.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "stellar phone", "Author": "Rodrigo R.

It came quickly and as soon as she saw it she was amazed. She expected that an item marked \"used\" would like like it had been used but she was so excited to find there was not a single scratch on the screen or back. The only mark was on the corner where it looked like it may have been dropped lightly. She also raved for days about its features. It had an updated operating system and added features that she didn't have on her old phone. She could not believe she got such an incredible deal on it.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Nicholas Strope", "ReviewID": "R1NSIBY0MFE3DI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is the worst.

I've gone through probably 15 in the past two years because I'm irresponsible, however, after trying others, this is the one I always come back to. It's 4G, snappy interface, takes a very good quality picture, and can use almost all current apps on Google Play.Pros:- 4G - For the price of this phone, 4G is worth it all by itself.- Camera - Love it! Takes better pictures than my girlfriends iPhone, especially in  low light- Interface - I think it comes with Jelly Bean, I think. Don't quote me on the but the interface itself is still great. One thing I LOVE which I think goes unnoticed a lot is how easy it is to delete apps. My older Droid Incredible require me to go into settings, manage apps, etc. This phone however allows me to delete them right from the app selection menu.- Screen - It's big and beautiful. Looks great whether in the brightest sun or darkest room.- Durable - My phones hit the ground a lot, and this one has never seemed to care. Literally, the worst I've done to this thing is make little micro scratches that show up on pretty much all devices after regular use.Cons:- Battery life - If you're getting this phone, get an extended battery. It will last about 3-4 hours if you don't and is very annoying. However, with the extended battery it will last all day. Yes, this will make it bulkier, but the phones already big so oh well.- Size - While the screen is beautiful, the phone itself is just to big. When using one hand it's hard to function due to the large screen size. My short little fingers don't fit all the way across the screen :(CONCLUSION:- If you're looking for a cheap 4G Verizon cell phone than the LG Spectrum is the one for you. While it is large in size, the bigger screen makes watching videos ten times better. Also, the camera, interface, and durability are outstanding.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R36VHTWVL6P5SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has a very big screen, but is very light and sleek.
