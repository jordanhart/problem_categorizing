Jones \"The Tool Man\"", "ReviewID": "R3OP14WXND5OAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to purchasing the Tracfone, I was on Verizon and paying nearly $45 per month for 400 minutes.  I looked back 1 year and found that the most I ever used was 50 minutes for a month.  I decided to try the Tracfone and bought one with double minutes for life.  I switched my Verizon number to my new phone and have had it for over a year and I love it.  Just yesterday I bought the 1 year/400 minutes card, put the 15 digit numbers in on Tracfone's site and within seconds I got a text message saying the minutes were added to my phone.  Since I have the double minutes for life, it gave me 800 minutes and 365 days to use them.  All this was added to what I already had on the phone.  With Verizon, if you don't use your minutes, they're gone.  With Tracfone, unused minutes carry over to the next expiration date.  You can text and use the web, just like other phones too.We travel quite a bit and I have never lost service and it sounds as good as my Verizon phone did.So basically I have just as good phone service for $100 a year instead of $540 a year, just not as many minutes.  If you figure it out, it comes out to about 67 minutes per month and 8 cents per minute. Perfect for me!  It even calls internationally for no extra charge.  You can't use it to call FROM other countries, but you can use it to call from the US TO other countries.  If you are a power user, this it not for you, but for the occasional user, it works!  I did have to call customer service when I first got it to help me set it up, but they got it done in short order.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "This Card Workes Well & is Easy to Use.", "Author": "Rich K", "ReviewID": "R1RZILU1PK7GBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It seems that some reviewers would rather discuss the Pro's and Con's of TracFone and there customer service as apposed to this card, which is what the review should be about. So let me review this card first and touch on the rest later.Previous to using this card I was using  prepaidonline.com  for my Tracfone minutes. They are about the same price as Tracfone but unlike Tracfone the service was excellent. All my transactions where over the phone to a US operator. My minutes where added to my phone while I was talking to them \" Nice and easy with no problems \". I saw this card on Amazon for 30% off the list price and $30 less than I was paying, so I bought it. True it only has 400 min. on it but I have double minutes on my phone so that adds up to 800 total. With prepaidonline.com I was getting the 800 min plus 200 bonus minutes but my phone is rarely used for long conversations, so 800 min. is plenty in fact I have 900 min leftover on my phone now. All I was concerned with was the time left, and this card gave me another year. The Amazon seller was Veronica Tablet and they sent it overnight even though I was expecting Prime 2 day delivery. It was packaged properly and super easy to use. I just put the pin # from the card in on my phone to add minutes and within a minute the time and minutes where added to my phone. I noticed the price fluctuates on this card depending on the seller, I have seen it go from 69 to 99 dollars.  Best to keep watching it untill the price is right.As for Tracfone I have had it for nearly 5 years and love it. I have not had any problems PERIOD. I have traveled extensively on the East Coast with no dead areas or connection problems. Reviewers mention Tracfone customer service is lousy, well I have never used them. I have used prepaidonline.com from the beginning, that could explain why I have not had any problems.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Long Time User", "Author": "John E.

We really like Tracfone. You have to realize that if you get a really good deal on a cell phone and air time the customer service will be commensurate. So if you want snappy customer service, buy your cell phone from ATT&T; or Verizon -- they can afford it because you are paying a whole lot for it.I especially like the prices of Tracfone air time here on Amazon; We usually just buy a year's air time every January. Buying a year from Tracfone is about $100.00. We just paid $75.00 for a years airtime here on Amazon - that's about $6.00 plus a month - not bad - for our 2011 service.If we lose a phone, we'll just buy another one, and get it from Amazon.We were pleased with the prompt service from this retailer of airtime, the card even came with a thank you note with an email contact if there was any problem. the airtime loaded without a hitch.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "it\"s really not a hoax", "Author": "ray", "ReviewID": "R1NBXFBQCL00J1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "recieved card earlier than expected. scratched card entered 15 pin code then entered promo code  press ok . told to leave phone on waited for about 10 seconds and got my 400 minutes plus triple minutes plus 200 bonus minutes...  1500 minutes total, plus added 365 more days to service days ..  now have 2711.60 minutes plus 748 service days left. bought card for 74.99$ comes to about 6.50 a month for a cell phone service. where can you get a better deal. thanks amazon for saving me a bundle..", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "1 year tracfone card", "Author": "ranhelp", "ReviewID": "RRDXBML9PEOO9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 1 year card was used before I was able to used the card.

It was easy, and within what seemed like less than a minute, the time was added to my Tracfone.Evidently the price on this product varies with vendor so when it is near time to add more minutes I will watch the price.I had no interaction with \"customer service\" so I didn't rate it.  I don't see how the \"coverage\" rating applies to a minutes card so I didn't rate that.

It is a perfect emergency phone. The 1 year purchase for $100 is one of the best deals you can get.  I don't think of the cost as how much I pay per minute, but rater per month cost of having an ability to make a phone call when I need something when I am away from home.  I have had Tracfone for 5 years, and have paid under $10 a month for each month I had it.  I think this is a pretty reasonable cost.I had to call customer service a few times, and I found customer service to be acceptable.  The wait was not too long, and even though the support center was clearly overseas the staff had understandable accents, was polite and was able to handle my issue/answer the question.You can roll over your minutes from to year, as long as you renew your annual contract before it expires.  You can switch phones and roll over your minutes to the new phone.I found that the price on the 1 year contract fluctuates. I generally have been able to buy it for $100.  There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  \"Online Price Alert\".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on \"online price alert\" in Google it will be come up at the top.

The pictured item appears to be a retail card.  Also the description reads \"No unexpected surprises\" which is kind of ironic as I was expecting the retail card for a gift.  Somewhere in the description it needs to be stated that you will not receive the retail card.  Look through these reviews and see how many other people said the same thing which means this item is being misrepresented.  shopcelldeals offered me $10 but I told them that I don't want or need their money, I simply want the picture OR description edited to include \"not the retail card\".  So far neither Amazon nor shopfordeals has made these changes and I did not accept any refund or coupon offer of any kind.Let me explain, when I come on Amazon I feel like there should be a higher standard such that I shouldn't have to worry about things like this happening.  In fact, I pay a little more sometimes because of their good customer service.  I was certain other online merchants would do this so I ordered here.  Many people do the same.  We trust Amazon.

My experience with Tracfone is absolutely the worst I haver ever had with a so called \"service\" provider.  I have returned the cellphones and canceled my airtime plan.  I am still out almost $30, not to mention the hours I spent with their inept support phone staff - and the grief.I tried to order 3 cellphones online, but didn't make the last click because the promised free shipping did not show.  So I called.  A woman named Sofia in Belize (you will visit various 3rd world countries dealing with the support staff) took my order and told me that even 'though the free shipping didn't show in the invoice, I would get the discount.Sure enough the next day I saw the full amount taken out of my bank account - no free shipping.So I called.  I was told that I could not be refunded cash.  I would have to get credit for airtime.When the phones arrived, it took hours to get one of them activated.  Then after one day, I lost service.  It took me another hour with 2 different support staff to discover that when the phones were shipped, the sim cards had been switched.  So I had to switch them back.  After one day, I lost service again.  I was told the SIM card was defective; I would have to wait 3-5 days for a replacement.Meanwhile I tried to activate the 2nd phone.  I was told again the SIM card was defective.  I had to wait for a replacment.I believe I spent 10 hours altogether with the support staff.  Every time I called I had to spell out my name, address, etc.  - and tell the whole story all over again.Finally when I decided to send back the phones and end my relationship with dysfunctional Tracfone, I was told I had to pay for the return shipping; and they do not refund for airtime (I had joined their \"value plan\").

It was not an actual card such as you might purchase via a retail outlet, but just a printed piece of paper with a PIN code.It is interesting that their web site shows a shipping charge of $0 for \"standard handling to the continental USA\" but this \"card\" isnn't available via that route as far as I can find. That was slightly annoying to me, though I can't put my finger on why I feel that way.I tried to enter the code via my phone, but the code kept giving an \"error code 7\" message. I went to the tracfone web site, and the code worked fine. The cost via this method worked out to about a 15& discount over the price on the tracfone web site.. $15 bucks is $15 bucks.

Tracfone gets credit for trying to be a \"value-positioned product\"I had no reason to  contact the seller so I can't speak to their customer service.I rank it a satisfactory experience, even though there was some slight variance over what I expected.It is worth mentioning that if you buy through TracFone, you normally get 250 bonus minutes for purchasing this same 400+365 deal.. (I'm not sure this is ALWAYS offered, but I've never looked that it was NOT offered). Since it costs $5 for \"shipping\" on this card, it means $90 for 400 (double-able) or $99 for 400 (double-able)+ 250 \"bonus\" minutes.. cheaper online by the minute, but it's your choice. I will say that buying direct from TracFone they add a bunch of \"fees\" on to increase it nearly $10 which you don't have with this item.[edit 8/2013] I note this is up $5, so after shipping it is only \"fees\" cheaper.. so it's less of a \"deal\" Watch the prices and act accordingly :/ This last round I just bought from Tracfone", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product was as described", "Author": "Swepson J.

Added the minutes on the phone from the Tracfone web site with no issues. I'm glad I looked to see if Amazon had the cards as I saved about $25.00 on the card.A comment on Tracfone service: We've been very pleased with our Tracfones. Tracfone uses the T-Mobile network (which has very good coverage) in our area. We've used the phones all over the country without problems. I think it's a great low cost deal for people that don't need a large amount of minutes or data. We did have issues with the phones updating (adding minutes and time) when we had a monthly family value plan (which resulted in several lengthy phone calls with Tracfone customer service), but buying the one year cards has resolved that (at a lower cost). Tracfone customer service has always been professional and helpful, but sometimes difficult to understand.02/16/2012 Update: I bought a second card from CardArt for our second Tracfone. It worked just as well as the card I had purchased earlier. I did have some trouble applying the time to the phone, but I was able to use the online self-help feature on the Tracfone website to resolve the issue (saving a phone call to Tracfone customer service).", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "very satisfied!", "Author": "fritz", "ReviewID": "RJ0SJUF99N7GM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an LG800g (2X) phone plus a 60 min card, to see how cell phones worked, (my first cell phone), and it worked fine!  next, I bought a package:  another LG800g phone, (this one with 3X minutes) + 1200min + 12mo, and moved my land line # to it;these 400min + 12mo cards go as low as $75, but $80 is decent, too;  always use a bonus code when you add the minutes!  some codes come with the phone, but there's other codes that can be worth even more!  ie: with my last 400min card, (plus bonus code), I got 1500 minutes;  check around! you might do even better!with these 400 minute cards, my phone costs run about $5/mo, plus under 2cents/min, so with bonus codes, this price slightly beats any other vendor;Tracfone support hasn't been needed;  everything works!  some documentation could be better, but I only use these phones as phones, so I'm very happy!** the best feature:  when a 'salesman' calls, I save the number in 'contacts', and then add it to a 'blocked' group;  => NO more sales calls!!!

I entered my new card with 22 days service remaining, and now I have 387 days service.  I was so please that I was not robbed of my 22 remaining days, the way those other cellphone carriers rob you.

Tracfone airtime with a substantial discount.", "Author": "cobaeno", "ReviewID": "R3563GY7BKEB49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Tracfone for six years now, and I am pleased with it in every way.  The voice quality has always been good, but with the new LG 500 I now use it is really outstanding.  I have normal senescent hearing loss, and I have problems with even our landline at home, but with my Tracfone the problem is almost always the phone of the other party.I live in Montana, and we don't have the internet feature available, but I doubt if I'd use it that much anyway.  The coverage area here, by the way, is as good or better than the regular carriers.  The one unusual Tracfone feature that I make regular use of is the international calling access number, which makes it the cost to make calls to our friends in Germany and Mexico as it does to call a neighbor. The problem in Mexico is that our friends are all rural folk with almost no landlines, and so the Tracfone international access doesn't work.  But you can get an access number in Mexico that people there can use to call you at local rates (which are unfortunately expensive, thanks to a near monopoly of Telcel, which is also owned by Tracfone's parent company America Movil). It works well and calls in my experience go right through.This year I've used about 1000 minutes of airtime, which I've now gotten--thanks to these discounted cards--for $75, about what most folks I know pay per month for cell service. I notice that in areas (not mine unfortunately) Tracfone now offers triple minute phones whereas mine is a mere double minute phone.I have used their customer service to resolve a few problems or get help and generally their people are pretty good.  They are all over the place: Canada, Belize, the Caribbean and sometimes you have to work through the varous Englishes.  I've also tried their Spanish-language CS just to see how it works.

I decided that it would be more beneficial not to renew my contract (I think I was paying $50/month) and purchase a prepaid phone. Initially I purchased a phone with double minutes but once I did the math I decided that a phone with triple minutes was a better investment. Initially I was purchasing 200 minutes and 90 days of service card, I made the mistake of purchasing the service card at my local retailer for about $46 after taxes. Once I did the math I was expecting to pay $184/year for approximately (2400 minutes plus 4x(50 bonus minutes)) 2600 minutes that comes out too $0.07/minute. Now for the 1 year service card I paid $77 and got a total of 1200 minutes plus 250 bonus minutes a total of 1450 minutes which comes out too $0.053/minute. So the 1 year service card ends up been less expensive than the 200 minute card and almost what I used to pay in 1.5 months with my previous phone provider.

Service in our area degraded the last year I had the phone (2012), and there was no service in one whole area of downtown Chattanooga, which is where I work.  I called their customer service about the poor coverage.  She wanted me to call Tracfone from my home, since the phone number was based on my home address.  I explained that the phone worked fine from home (which is not where generally I use it) and that in the beginning coverage had been better.  She then said they needed to change my phone number to match the area where I worked, which is only 12 miles from my home.  That made no sense--did they only expect me to use the phone from one location all the time?  She was not interested when I told her I was going to change providers when my service expired.

Okay, I'll stop my ranting and get to the point of this review.TracFone and other pay-as you go plans free occasional cell phone users from the monthly charge.. The Tracfone 1 year card retails for $100 for 1 year of service and 400 minutes of talk time. Many newer Tracfone models (including some smart phones!) double or triple the number of minutes (1200 minutes).The minutes never expire if you don't use them. I still have minutes that I purchased 3 years ago.As you can tell by my opening paragraph, I think most cell phone users abuse the priviledge and use the cell phone at inappropriate times. But for emergency use, they are great tools, and for $120 per year, you have an emergency communication tool at your disposal. Try to find a pay phone these days.

A Tracfone 1 year / 1000 minute card (400 doubled + 200 promo code) is much better for our usage.After 3 weeks of customer service calls with the annoying \"3 minute holds\" described in another review, about a dozen tedious code entries, and a mailed replacement SIM later, we finally had a working phone with an old provider's number ported to it.  The second phone was easier to activate with a non-ported number, but Tracfone still initially rejected two valid airtime cards (\"card not in our system\").  I'll give Tracfone's customer service an E for effort - they were always available and friendly - but it really shouldn't have been necessary to talk to them so much.Now that the phones are working, they are fine.  The LG 420G is a great basic cellphone; unlike the Net10 Motorolas with non-functioning USB you can bluetooth ringtones and pictures without having to waste airtime, and the phone comes with a car charger, a headset, and double minutes for life without having to buy a separate double card.

With 8 days left, I still have 1700 minutes hanging around, so I just wanted a year card with no minutes.  This card is the closest to it.  I could do the six dollar a month add 30 days and no minutes plan, but at 85 dollars, I'm basically paying 13 dollars more for 800 minutes in addition to the year of time, so..,Tracfone customer service is excellent, which was good because the phones out of the box aren't always 100 percent.  We had to call tracfone to have them help get the internet functionality setup on each of our phones- the person in India spoke english better than I do as they read off half a dozen 20-digit codes needed to enable the internet functionality on our respective phones.

We have a Canon SD3500IS for taking the best (amateur-level :)) pictures and video, but the tracfone paid for itself a hundred times over at the scene of a moderate fender bender we had.As a PS Samsung T301G is the only tracfone cell phone worth buying.  The others are refurbished, and the LG600something disconnects itself whenever it touches your face- its survivable but annoying as heck.

After more than an hour on hold, I finally got to a representative and was repeatedly put on hold \"for 3 minutes\" while the rep. consulted a supervisor and then \"another department\" about the issue. At last I was told that the department that would verify how many minutes were on the lost phone was unavailable and that it would be necessary for me to call back the following week (even though they would be operating the following day)--more than 2-1/2 hours absolutely wasted!The next call took about 1-1/2 hours on extended and \"3 minute\" hold before the representative could come to grips with the unbelievable situation that a teenager had lost his phone, and before the \"other department\" could reach a decision.I used a tracfone for a bit more than a year and suffered through a few instances of having to resolve minutes that did not load, or promotion codes that did not work.

Last week my wife's phone, with 128 days of service left, lost all 1800 plus minutes that she had.  They blamed it on the phone.  They would not help me unless I had the phone with me.  Initially I thought this was a great provider but since the corporate neckties in the company decided that greed was better they went downhill fast.  I will never recommend them for anything.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "10 YEARS WITH TRACFONE !  BIG MISTAKE!!!!", "Author": "Trump22", "ReviewID": "RTLIXG4JYUBLU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "(i would give it negative 10 stars, but one star is the lowest rating at Amazon)In short, here is my summary after 10 years:1.The customer service non-existent:  they take your money and run, you are on your own after that.  if you call customer service - brace yourself for at least 30 min waiting time.2.The phones are flimsy. They feel cheap and they look cheap.3.I've got huge number of unknown incoming calls (which were burning my airtime).  Sometimes in the middle of the night.4.Cost of call per minute is higher than any other carrier.5.If you want to roll over your unused minutes you have to keep buying more airtime - which is essentially a rolling contract -  more expensive than VZ or ATT.6.Miniscule pool of phone numbers to select from (i could choose from only one!)7.They can close the shop at any given moment - and you'll pick up the loss.  They don't care about you anyways!8.Terrible connection.  Phone connects sporadically, sometimes does not connect the call at all.I had this phone for emergencies for my mom, and I have a contract with Verizon.  When you call Verizon they work with you to solve the problem.  When you call Tracfone - they don't give a \"1234\" about your problem, they don't even ATTEMPT to solve the problem!!!Before dealing with tracfone ask yourself:  if they treat like \"1234\" a customer who was buying from them for a decade, how will they treat you?PS. BTW, when i callded tracfone with a problme, they essentially told me that they have company policies, and they don't care about the customers or long term profits (only short term).  I was shocked! What a myopic vision: in the current economy a company dependent on month-to-month sales would severe 10 year long customer relationship!", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Adds 1 year to your service end date\nIncludes 400 minutes of airtime\nNo unwanted bills\nNo unexpected surprises", "Name": "Tracfone 1 Year of Service & 400 Minutes", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BaJ%2B2Gq1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002ZCW91Y"}}
