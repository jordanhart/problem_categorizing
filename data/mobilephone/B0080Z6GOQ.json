{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "MJM \"MJM\"", "ReviewID": "R1E8SXFY8SIN7A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Pantech Breakout is my first smart phone.  So, I don't have much in the way of comparison.First, my carrier is Verizon.  I cannot comment on how this product would perform with other service carriers.  Nevertheless, here are my impressions after using the device for about three months now:1. Call Quality -- It is great.  No problems whether using an bluetooth earpiece or not.2. 4G LTE -- Downloads and uploads are very, very fast.3. Size  --  Not sure, but it has a 4-in screen.  The length of the phone is about as large as I can comfortably carry on my belt.4. Screen --  To my eyes, the quality more than meets my needs.  Text is clearly defined and readable.  Colors look awesome.  Moving graphics look great.  Although I know that there are screens with greater pixel density, I am not going to be using my phone to watch movies or play games.  And even if I did, I would believe that the tiny 4-inch screen display would clearly render the tiny movie and game images.5. Construction -- I am a bit clumsy and have dropped the phone a number of times.  Other than some scratches on the case, the screen did not break.  This seems to be a well-made and durable phone.6. Camera -- I am an amateur photographer with a good SLR Canon with a high quality lens.  When I want shots for a family album or to share with friends, this is what I typically use.  However, having a small built in camera on my phone is pretty cool.  And the Pantech camera has a 5 mg photo sensor.  Would I get rid of this phone to get a camera with an 8 mg sensor?  Nope.  In the world of photography, 8 mgs or 5 mg sensors are BOTH now hopelessly out of date.With that being said, the 5 mgs on the Pantech is great for that spur of the moment shot that I can instagram to my friends.  If I have a picture I want to print, I can still upload it to my computer, do some digital adjustments to the color or whatever, and then upload to some site for printing.  And a 5 mg shot will still allow me to easily enlarge to sizes at least 8 in x 10 in.  My recommendation:  Don't get fooled that you have to have 8 mgs or you pictures will be awful.  At one time not long ago, a digital camera with a 5 mg sensor was the absolute \"state of the art\".  For what we are using them for, the 5 mg cell phone cameras are, in my opinion, plenty adequate.7. Operating System. This is Android, as you know.  I have always had Windows computers, so I am used to the occasional bug in the system or the need to reboot.  At least to me, using Android on a phone is similar to using Windows on my computer.8. Battery life -- If you get this phone, \"splurge\" for an extended battery.  It still won't be as good as some of the newer phones are reported to be, but it is, at least for me, livable.  It is the primary reason why I did not give the phone five stars.9.  Memory  --  In my opinion, I wish the phone had more internal memory.  However, it can expand up to 32 mgs with a micro SD card which I have done.10.  CPU  --  I don't know the specs on the Pantech's internal computer chip.  For me, it was 'I don't care'.  I don't need a PHONE with a CPU powerful enough to run my business. Whatever CPU it does have is fast.  Very fast.  And with 4g, it downloads and uploads quickly.  However, I am not a gamer.  Thus, there might be situations where playing a game on a tiny, tiny 4 or 5 inch screen, instead of on your computer monitor or your TV screens of 40in or 50 in., might require a slightly faster or more sophisticated chip set.My final recommendation: The Pantech Breakout is a great purchase if you want to make receive calls with good voice quality; if you like 4g; if a 4-inch screen that has good color rendition and smooth graphics (keep in mind I am not a gamer), and if the ability to take 5 mg pictures (which look fine when uploaded to the internet) works for you.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "love my phone", "Author": "C.

It has it's glitches and quirks: The ringtone resets itself a lot (pretty much always), the stock music app crashes every now and then needing a hard restart, and the phone comes preloaded with useless, undeletable Verizon apps (verizon only?) that eat up a good amount of the hard disk space.In spite of these glitches, texts always go through, calls are made fine, never had a problem with sending or receiving emails, games play fine (jewles, candy crush, words with friends, stuff of that nature), facebook app works fine, etc.The camera is what you would expect from a cheaper phone, but I have taken over 200 pictures with it and functionality is decent.I have grown to live with the glitches and overall really do like this phone. 3 stars is still good, just not amazing!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "HATED IT.", "Author": "goa tse \"Eh\"", "ReviewID": "RHW189NKL6ORX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "around 200MB of free memory for your apps after verizon finishes loading all thier bloat that can't be removed.HATED IT.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO BUENO", "Author": "Jena Reid", "ReviewID": "R2RTTLL9EQM97W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This used phone was listed at a price I couldn't pass up. Let me preface by saying anyone who's ever dropped their cellphone in water and it didn't \"die\" instantly, knows that the phone operates-- but with a mind of its own. I bought this phone to replace my work phone (which is the same make, model, carrier). When I took it to Verizon, the tech told me the reason the phone was powering on and off on its own, etc. this was because it has water damage ;-/ ??? So as you can imagine, I would have never purchased a phone with water damage, and caused myself all this trouble and hassle to have it returned, paid more in postage, etc. My money should be refunded + the extra return shipping fees, as stated by the seller. Let's hope so... otherwise this review will have a to be continued.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "0 this phone is useless", "Author": "kym sandford", "ReviewID": "R2CUA2TX7IUB0A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really am being kind with this phone at a one star it is usless not enough memory and when updates come from the verizon app which you can not uninstall ones you do not want as it there apps.

Im a teenager and I will cherish any phone but this phone. I know this was at a low price for a cool smartphone, but its not worth it. I had to get 4 replacements for this phone within a year. I never dropped it, or threw it. I didn't even drop it in water. That didn't matter. It was the memory, and the battery. Let along the sim card. It kept turning off by itself and it was just screwed up. My sim card was disabled not too long ago, so I just went in to Verizon and complained so much I felt like i complained for over an hour. So, they let me get the iPhone 4 which will be better tun this Pantech. So if you want to buy a phone, DO NOT BUY THIS MESSED UP PHONE!!!!!!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had for 18 months", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R289WGTDJ7N4FP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "By far the worst phone that I have ever owned in 20yrs.  Battery life sucks, and then there is the memory.  Yes you can upgrade with an SD Card, but some apps won't work at all when on the SD card, and as soon as your phone is around 70% capacity, it will not allow some of those apps on the phone to even function.  With that said, Verizon will give me a whopping 6.00 (Six .....not a typo) dollars for a trade in.  That should tell you how high on the chart this phone is.  I wouldn't even allow Verizon to send me another one to replace this one.  Same issues with other phones of same name in the family.  Not just a single glitch, its a bad phone.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "pantech break out", "Author": "ricky", "ReviewID": "R1SSLGC0LWTGDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "does it have wifi and is it good I JUST WONT OT KNOW PLEASE REPLY IT WILL BE GREAT HELP", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0080Z6GOQ"}}
