But don't look for it on LG's website - you won't find it.  It is a special prepaid model for TracFone/Net10 only.  I don't even find it listed overseas.I have had mine for about four weeks.  It is not a full smart phone, more like half-smart, when compared to something like the iPhone.  It doesn't have accelerometers, it doesn't have WiFi, and you only have limited capability to change orientation of the screen.But at only $50 or less, it is a very good value for the features it does have - a very good cell phone -- with a music player, HD camera (stills and video), external memory (optional), data cable (optional), a qwerty keyboard app, texting, and included apps for games, alarm clock, stop watch,voice recorder, calendar, memo pad, tasks list, scientific calculator, and World clock. And, you can add hundreds of your own apps, provided they are java apps.You can surf the internet and access your email and text message - all costing you minutes.  I personally don't have anything important enough to pay for cell phone internet connect time and downloads.  But if you do, you can do it with the LG 800G.While the external memory (microSDHC card), and USB data cable, are not included, you should consider them essential and buy them.  The reason is that it is much cheaper to download apps to your computer and transfer it to the LG 800G by data cable.  The data cable must be a USB-typA to a micrUSB-typeB.  The data cable can only access the microSD card (external memory) and not the internal memory.You can also use Bluetooth to connect to a Bluetooth headset, or to transfer files to/from a computer (if it the computer also has bluetooth.) You can set file transfer to be either to internal memory or to external memory.The LG 800G comes with double-minutes-for-life, and if you catch Home Shopping Network just at the right time, they occasionally have triple-minutes for life.  The cost per minute is around ten cents, and even less.The LG 800G has just too many features to discuss here.  You will find the TracFone User guide that comes with the LG 800G to be pretty basic -- mostly devoted to activating the phone.  You will want to access the TracFone LG 800G on-line Tutorial.  There is no link on the TracFone website to the tutorial but you can find it, and the best user forum/blog, by Googling \"TracFone LG 800G Tutorial.\" The top three or four hits should take you to the tutorial and to the Turk Forum LG 800G discussion.All in all, I very much like the LG 800G, and would recommend it to a friend.  My favorite app is the music player, which also has an equalizer and Bass Boost.  With a good stereo headset, especially one that also receives calls, it is as good as it gets.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE this phone!!", "Author": "LMC \"Peachychick\"", "ReviewID": "R1P21GSWURTYJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to get a Trackfone because I just can't justify nearly $100 per month from AT&T; when a Tracfone would only cost me about $100 per YEAR. This phone does everything and more for me especially since I only use my phone to talk and text message, occassionally check facebook or e-mail online with it, but that's about it. It's the perfect phone, so lightweight, easy to use, easy to see for someone with low vision like me which is perfect, and just neat with the touchscreen capability. Definitely get a cover for it though because without it it is EXTREMELY slippery and easy to drop. Love everything about it otherwise though.UPDATE: July 14, 2011After leaving my glowing review a few days later I also began having the texting problem most people seem to have. I was receiving the same message over and over and OVER again and couldn't get any new ones either. I called costumer service and spoke with a very friendly, very helpful woman who reset my text message service and within a couple hours it was up and running again and has been great ever since.  I adore this phone and wouldn't want any other as of now. So rest assured that if you do get this phone and IF it did develop the texting problem then it can be easily fixed. I still give it five stars!!!!", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Like it, with some caveats", "Author": "Audio Guy in NC", "ReviewID": "R3FS5S491P10UD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone for $40.00 and put a 60 day NET10 card on it to try it out.  So far, here are my observations based on how I use the phone.  (I don't do texting)1. Lightweight and size are fine.  Phone fits easily into the hand.2. The 'touch' screen sensitivity is chosen obviously to filter out accidental 'presses' to icons on the screen, but---it filters a little too strongly for my taste and I wish this was adjustable.3. The camera is said to be a 2mp design, but it does not seem as good as the camera in the LG 900G, which is also a 2mp camera.4. The camera 'take a shot' button is virtual, not a real button, and I find that this causes some shots to blur, since in trying to 'push' that virtual button, the camera can easily move and you get a blurred shot as a result.5. There is major shutter lag, so that the pic you see and want to capture might not be what you get, aka, with animals and kids or any kind of action.6. The phone seems plenty signal sensitive, based on my use of other phones.7. Battery life is ok, not amazing.8. From what I got in an email from NET10, the phone needs an external memory card in order for the USB data transfer to work.  I decided to use Bluetoothto avoid putting a memory card into the phone (you hve to remove the back of the phone and take out the battery to see the memory slot)9. Since I don't do texting I cannot offer an opinion.  I have read on other sites that this phone has texting problems and that NET10 is going to fix that problem with an update.10.  Overall, I like the phone, but wish the camera was as good as the one in the LG 900G which I found to be truly excellent.  The 900G also has a real shutter button and less lag and images come out less blurred.It's not a smart phone but for the price and NET10's service plans, it's an excellent value in my view.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect but I'm perfectly happy!!", "Author": "TimTime", "ReviewID": "R2VUG4ZJY23S8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for a Net 10 plan and I think this is a fantastic phone. I use it mainly for phone calling and occasionally checking Gmail or Facebook wile I'm away from home. It's not a smart phone but for my use it is perfect especially with a $25 a month 750 minutes a month NET 10 plan. I don't browse on a phone, not even on my iPod touch because phones are too small for browsing the web, I save that for my laptop. No apps on this phone so if you are looking for that, look for a smartphone.Pros: Size. It fits well in my pocket and isn't as bulky as a Iphone or Blackberry sized phone. Easy to see dialer. Touchscreen. Easy to turn to silent mode and back as well as locking the phone. Nice clock display when in lock mode. Sound quality on calls are excellent. Hasn't dropped a call or missed a voice or text message. Customizable to an extent. MicroSD slot inside. Bluetooth. Sleek looking and slides right into my pocket.Cons: I think the Bluetooth is just to connect to an earpiece because i couldn't connect to my Ipod. Np biggie. No GPS or Google maps unless you go into browser mode. The touch-pad is not as precise as a Iphone but it still has qwerty features (though not in the default browser). It even has handwriting recognition but i find that slower than the qwerty. I love how easy it is to spell qwerty haha.All in all a great phone for $39. I had originally purchased the LG 900g but returned it for this one and i am quite pleased.

My contract with T-Mobile expired some time ago with a shared family plan, two phones, and a 1000 minutes per month for $49.99.  Pretty cheap, right?  That's what kept me as a customer for quite awhile in that I really couldn't find a better deal.  Then I noticed we got dinged 10 cents for every text message somebody sent us (our Motorola Razr's were difficult to text from so just didn't use it).  I also couldn't do any wireless web access without paying a big fee.  And after taxes and fees we were up to around $64 a month.  I also noticed that my wife used the bulk of the minutes while I only occasionally used mine.  We thought that if we could get her onto a reasonable plan with lots of minutes and me on a cheap plan with few minutes that would save us some dough.After doing a ton of research I found that my wife's phone could be moved to a prepaid plan with 1500 mins/texts for $30 a month.  After switching the plans I then discovered the Tracfone LG800G at my local Target.  I saw from the reviews that many folks liked it a lot while others really hated it mainly due to issues with texting.  Not being a big text sender myself, I figured I'd give the phone a shot.  After buying it, I went to Tracfone's website to activate it while transferring my existing number.  Halfway into the process, the web site went down for \"maintenance\" - UGH.  Not a good start.  Being patient did pay off about 4 hrs later I was able to complete the number transfer request.  I braced myself for the possibility of having no phone at all while the process played out in the systems.  An hour later, I saw that my current phone was indicated as \"cancelled\" at T-mobile's web site - PROGRESS!  About 20 mins later I logged into Tracfone's web site again and saw that my phone required \"updates.\"  After following a long process to enter multiple number sequences into the manual code entry of my phone, it came to life!  My number was transferred in a little under 2 hrs from the time I hit submit on the form.Coming from an old phone like the Razr the LG800G has been amazing!  Love the touch screen, the features, and ease of mobile web and messaging.  I can easily connect it to my iMac via Bluetooth connection and drop ringtones, wallpapers, and apps onto it.  Sure, it doesn't run iOS but that's why I keep an iPod Touch around for (costs a whole lot less, too!).  Based on my limited testing, I'd say that Tracfone now has a handle on the texting issues as I've not had any problems with it yet.  Sound quality is great, my signal is a lot better around town than I had with my old phone but I can't say if this is just new technology or the fact that I'm now on the AT&T; network.  I was able to load up the phone with 200 minutes using a 60 min card, the double minutes for life feature and a promo code.  This put my cost at about 10 cents a minute if I don't count the out of pocket cost for the phone.  If you're looking for a nice feature enhanced touch screen phone in the pre-paid wireless space, you could do a lot worse than this one.  I'm completely impressed, so much that I wrote this review and I don't write very many.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Prepaid Touch Screen", "Author": "codegeek", "ReviewID": "ROTW674H19VT4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I came to Tracfone over a year ago as a way to save money while I paid off my disconnect fee from VZW.  Here I am, a year later, and still a Tracfone customer.  I was going to switch to another prepaid phone with a QWERTY keyboard when I saw this phone come onto the market, and I snagged it.  Here are my thoughts on this phone:1.  This is Tracfone we are talking about here.  My first phone cost $10.00.  This one cost $49.99.  Don't expect too much.2.  The call quality on this phone is excellent in the Atlanta market, much better than my old phone.3.  The touch screen is responsive enough, even for a fumble fingers like me to use the QWERTY keyboard.4.  The blue tooth works great.  I have transferred music to it from my laptop, as well as connected a blue tooth headset.  I can't use the buttons on the headset to answer calls and redial etc, but see #1.5.  The camera is \"alright\", but if you bought this phone to take pictures, see #1.6.  The web browser is a really nice feature, and the one I missed the most moving to Tracfone.  It's a little expensive for my taste, but its there if I need it.7.  I was able to download my required two custom ring tones :-)8.  There is enough features on this phone that is customizable to keep it interesting.Every time I have had an issue, with the notable exception of their SMS gateway sending me repeat text messages over and over, the service department has been able to help me fix it.  They have been friendly and responsive.  If all things stay the same, I'll probably hang with Tracfone for a while.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad but a few things to watch for", "Author": "viewer956 \"viewer956\"", "ReviewID": "R3KS3571NNXX6C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the LG800G for about 3-4 weeks now on Tracfone after having had a Motorola V176 on Tracfone for about 3 or 4 years.There's no sense in repeating what others have said in their reviews but here's a few points of comparison if you're like me and just switching from a \"flip\" phone to a more modern touch screen on Tracfone.1) Battery life on standby is maybe 60-70% of my V176.  It's not horrible; it's just not the heroic 10-11 days I'd get from my V176 when it was on and not being used for 75% of the day.  Of course the screen is 2-3x bigger too on this phone so that's not going to help the battery life.2) Touch screen is nice; it does take more pressure than an Iphone but it's not unreasonable at all.  Note that you only get a virtual keyboard to type on when you're actually sending texts and not in other instances.3) Documentation is scant; you'll find yourself scouring the internet for the information and tips you'll really need to operate this phone.  Google is your friend!4) Call quality seems to be good; I don't have massive experience with it yet but so far it's been quite reasonable.  My location puts me on the AT&T; network with this phone.  You may also end up with T-Mobile as the carrier depending on your location.5) Speaker phone seems to operate well.6) You'll want a screen protector for this phone as well as a rubber skin/case to protect it.  If you want any music or pictures on the phone you can expect to add a 4gb memory card to it as well.7) Read up on the texting problem that this phone is known for and make an informed decision before you buy it.  Not everyone is affected; my phone hasn't been so far but I've not done much texting.  This may be a firmware issue that Tracfone can fix; details are not clear.8) Another issue to be aware of if you send/receive texts is that this phone will not tell you who has sent you a text until you pay to view it.  Doesn't sound like a big deal until you realize that you can't tell whether the text message you're about to read is a junk text from a spammer or from your family until *after* you've paid for it.  Boo, hiss!  This is an obvious firmware issue that needs to be fixed with this phone.  Even my ancient V176 would show you what number had sent you the text before you paid to view it!  Hopefully we'll see a firmware fix for this soon!I'll update this review as my experience grows with the phone.----Update 1:Tracfone now has fixed models of this phone w/o the dreaded texting issue where the phone doesn't display texts or fills your inbox with repeated texts.  Apparently to fix it they have to swap your phone with one of their new ones with this fix in place.  If you want to buy this phone and be guaranteed of getting one that is fixed you should buy it directly from Tracfone (at least at this point).I've given Tracfone some grief about this phone not displaying the sender's information before you read (and pay for) a text message and they were unsympathetic saying it was a feature just not supported on this phone.  Of course, they make money every time you read a junk text so they are not exactly motivated to get this problem solved...This phone really is pretty nice...", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good and Bad", "Author": "T. Lukas", "ReviewID": "R1GKMFLWN7AGZ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I replaced an old Moto flip phone with this a few days ago.The Good: The phone features are great.  Clear sound and good reception. Installed a microSD card for downloading music. The MP3 music play works very well. Calendar, contacts list, and other phone basics OK.  The QUERTY keypad is great for messages.  However,  other functions (contacts, calendar, etc) will use the phone keypad for entry. The keys can bey a bit touchy (Touch phone humor). If you load PDFs onto your SD card the phone has a built in viewer, but can only view smaller files (< 2 Mb) and it is slow to turn pages. The 2MP camera is ok. Some tweaking is necessary to get higher quality pix.The Bad: 1. The web browser is pretty much trash.  It is slow and unresponsive to accessing even the default sites such as weather.  Did not try the facebook or twitter. But, those minutes get used up fast waiting for a web page to show up.2. It does claim to run Apps.  However, these are not Android apps, they are JAVA apps.  The Java marketplace does not appear to be accessible from the phone (you would not want to anyway because of using up mins). The market is small, but several Java apps such as games are free by way of a PC download and transfer.  As with most phones you can pay to download ringtones, images and games, but if you can connect up to a PC via the USB port, these can also be downloaded free or nearly so.3. The USB cable, a case, and mobile power/charger adaptor are extra items.  Tracphone used to bundle these with some phones, but not the LG800G.4. There is no built in Email app. The Net10 version has it, but not Tracphone. There are a few Java Email apps out there but I have not tried to install them. There may be issues with the port opening (ie lockout) that can prevent them from working.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rockin Cheap Touchscreen Phone", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "R1TBIJABMOVFZS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a little leary about this phone because of the horror stories with the texting(which have now been rectified). So i went to pick one up for 49 bucks at wal-mart, and i'm very pleased. The one you buy there is actually NET-10, i guess Trac Fone is in cohoots with them, which is fine. It doesn't come with a pen, but you can easily find those for cheap at best buy, staples, etc. The touch sensitivity is just right, and it's very easy to calibrate. There are plenty of apps, and the internet works very well. The only thing i don't like which is even common on more expensive phones is that you can't watch Youtube or any other streaming videos on it. However you can watch Mp4 video format movies, and videos on it with no issues. The speaker is very loud, and great for watching thing and listening to Mp3s. I had a 4 gig mini SD card with my last phone, so i already had a lot stored on it to try out. Now there are some drawbacks which i will list under pros and cons.ProsTouch screen is great, lag free and smooth.Dialing it great, numbers come up quicker than with regular old push buttons.Has the feature where you can use handwriting (like an etchasketch) to right texts etc.(Pen recommended)Tons of ring tones, very loud speaker(phone), loud regular phone speaker.Internet runs smoothly for checking Facebook, Amazon, Reading, Google, Yahoo etc.(Keep and eye on your minutes though, it takes them fast)Great for watching videos, listening to MP3s, viewing photo slideshows etc.Also has built in video and picture cam.ConsMemory mini SD card fits inside the phone, so unless you buy a transfer cable you have to pop the back off to access it, and put it in your computer.Phone is very slippery when holding(using it). Be cautious, even when your hands are dry. Easy to drop.No streaming video, which some androids won't even do, if they do the Java always crashes. Save that for your laptop.Thats about it, as i said the texting issue has been fixed(just be sure to get a newer one at walmart). I wouldn't recommend Best Buy, or Radio shack since they don't sell as many as Wal-mart, and they probably still have the old defective ones sitting around. So if you want a great cheap touchscreen phone and don't wanna break your bank, the get this, i like it better than the 80dollar Motorola. Much easier to navigate, sounds is better, and the battery life is far superior. Motorolas dry up quickly, especially when talking. So don't fear, the problem has been fixed, and NET10 are a great company to deal with.Note:When i transfered my number from my old NET10, i only had about 259 minutes. Well upon transferring they gave me the full 750, that i get with the 25$ card plan i have ha. So that was a huge plus. Guess they don't mind giving away free minutes.

Why? Because it has a qwerty keyboard ONLY for texting.  When you browse the web or add a contact you are limited to a virtual keypad or buggy handwriting recognition. It would have been useful to know that before purchase. I did not find that in any of the dozens of online reviews I read, and Tracfone and LG kinda forget to mention that detail in any of their literature.  I feel deceived. A KEYPAD? With that much computing power on the phone?  So you have to hit 4 times to get \"S\" or try several times to have it recognize a handwritten \"g\". It is no improvement over a 6 year old flip phone.Forget browsing. See how long it takes to enter the url for amazon.com, or enter search terms in Amazon like \"LG 800G Net10\". After 7 airtime minutes trying handwriting recognition to input a secure password with special symbols, I gave up.How hard could it be to enable the keyboard for contacts and browsing? I am returning it and getting one that has a qwerty keyboard for all purposes.LG, don't waste my time.--- edit ---It gets worse. The keypad locks after 3 seconds. So, if you call and get a phone menu, you have to press and hold \"Unlock\", then choose \"keypad\", then press a number. The phone menu voice will say something, and your phone is locked again. You have to unlock it AGAIN and choose keypad for every - single - menu - choice.

Hymans", "ReviewID": "RNG1UGWRCKBML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With Tracfone, you pay for what you get, and what you get is a low-cost alternative to the big carriers and their bigger contracts.  What you didn't get up until very recently was decent phones.  I had been using a Samsung T301g slider until the battery started to die and I decided to upgrade my phone instead of replacing the battery.  After doing a little searching, I decided to go with this model because it seemed to be a lot more functional than my old phone, but with the price on Amazon was not much more money.  I am so glad that I made that decision, because this phone is a spectacular value for the price.The resistive touch screen works extremely well once you get used to it.  It didn't take much more than inputting my contacts into the phone before I had the feel for it down.  Although the \"manual\" that Tracfone includes with the phone is extremely inadequate, I was able to figure out my way around the phone relatively intuitively.  Most of the functions are similar to any phone made within the last 5 or so years, and if you get hung up there are a lot of places that have the information you'll need to get past your problem.  The interface is the only thing that's significantly different.  The phone has a very functional mp3 player built in that includes preset equalizer settings and the phone has a 3.5 mm jack on the top for a headset/headphones.  The Bluetooth isn't crippled like it has been on most Tracfones, and I was able to move about 3gb of songs to the phone without any problems (you will need to get a 4gb microSD card, though, because the onboard memory is only about 20mb).  I was also able to use the Bluetooth to transfer a handful of Java apps that I downloaded to my computer to the phone and they installed just fine.  Did I forget to mention that this phone runs Java apps?  It does.  It is a bit challenging finding apps that actually work on this phone, but a little trial and error will get you there.Oh, and it is a phone, so I should mention that call clarity, signal quality and the like are all top notch thus far, and I live on the edge of an antiquated AT&T; network out in the middle of nowhere in northern Arizona.  If it sounds good here, it'll sound good anywhere.As for the texting issue that many were reporting around mid-year 2011, it should be noted that Tracfone and LG have apparently fixed this problem with a software upgrade.  I was a little worried about getting an older software version with this phone, especially since it seemed to be heavily discounted, but when the phone arrived I checked the software version and found it to be the updated, non-buggy version.  What you need to check is in the phone's \"Device Information\" screen.  If your S/W Version reads: V10d, you have the old version with the potentially buggy texting.  If you have V10e, you're good to go.Pros for this phone:Good (and good-sounding) mp3 playerFully-functioning BluetoothGreat Calendar/Scheduling app built inQWERTY for textingTouch Screen works wellJava app supportGreat sound quality.Customizable home screen (all widgets can be moved or removed except the \"Prepaid\" one)Onboard document reader that works with most Office files, Open Office files, .txt and .pdf files.2MP camera that actually takes good pictures, and a video recorder.Cons:No GPSNo WiFiNo position sensor/accelerometerBuilt-in web browser is terrible (but can be removed from the home screen and you can use BOLT or Opera Mini apps instead)I purchased this phone along with a stereo headset w/mic (haven't had a chance to test the mic yet, but the headphones sound great with the mp3 player), a 4gb microSD card, and a set of 3 screen protectors and paid less than $60 for the entire package (all through Amazon, and that price includes shipping).  Overall, I could not be happier with the functionality of this phone, especially at that price.  Tracfone even effortlessly moved all of my minutes and service days over from my old phone (although I did have to wait for a new SIM card for that to happen).If you're looking for a great phone that has a lot of bells and whistles without locking yourself into a ridiculous contract or paying through the nose, this is the phone for you.

It's not quite a smartphone, but it's close.  I don't have to repeat the great features and capabilities; you can look at the specifications and see those yourself.  They all work well.While some have expressed concerns about the touch-screen sensitivity, I have not noticed any major problems with mine.A minor worry: max volume level for messages, memos and music is just adequate.  Ring tone volume is fine, however.I hope someday to see an improved version that supports many more of the great applications currently available with better known smartphones such as those from Apple and Google and others.  Currently the LG800G does very well with most generalized Java based applications.The price with double minutes is fantastic!

I like the phone, it is lightweight, and seems to get good reception, and the price is right for what you get.  I haven't had a touch screen phone before, so this is kinda nice.  The biggest problems for me is that the phone doesn't have a handsfree speaker and it doesn't stay charged very long.  I suspect this is because it is a touch screen and the display keeps lighting up while I'm carrying it in my purse. I found a carrying case for it, but that hasn't really helped the problem. I'm not used to charging a phone every night, my ATT phone would go several days before charging.  Guess I got spoiled.

I upgraded to the LG from an ancient Nokia \"brick.\" I won't go into its +++++s for other reviewers cover its excellent features--better than the manual. I do want to point out some good-to-know features others have not mentioned or that I've missed seeing (can't read all of them!). It's info you won't find in the manual (or from Tracfone customer service).1. I had a devil of a time finding out how, when you make a call and the menu options require you to click an option number, how do you make the dial pad appear on the screen? Answer: you push the return arrow command button--middle button at the bottom of your phone. DUH!2. How do you put a stop to unwanted calls? I got several from a # in N.C. shortly after activating my new cell # (googled the # and found lots of complaints about this #). They eventually stopped. Then just 2 days ago, started getting calls again from an unregistered cell # in N.C. I googled \"stop calls to cell.\" At one site, a Tracfone rep said Tracfone does not offer this service. That you had to change your phone # or get the cell phone listed with the do not call registry. Bummer! I then went directly to Tracfone's Community Forum and got an answer which I'll share. I'm paraphrasing what was written re how to block calls.The LG800G has a \"call reject\" feature!First: add the unwanted caller's # (or callers' #s) to your contact list and give them a name such as Reject Calls 1, 2, etc. Then, \"under more options below the image option is a choice to add them to a Group\"--I added them to my VIP group. The quoted directions from the Forum are a little murky but I was able to figure out what they meant and get my Group set up.Second: The path to now follow is Settings>Call>Common Settings>Call Reject>enable Call reject. Under Reject List select the Group you put the #s in and save. Any calls from those #s will get rejected.  You still might get an unwanted call from a different #, but all you need to do is add the # to your contact list and save into your Group for unwanted calls. It's that easy.I'm amazed the LG offers this feature. I couldn't get our local land line phone company to block particular calls w/o involving a police report--at least that was the case several years ago when we tried.Enjoy your LG800G!", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "R1OULKD2MYP035", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone... amazing text keyboard.I would recommend this phone.

I used to have a Tracfone and honestly thought that the reception was great.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they now had a couple of touchscreen phones to choose from.  I chose the LG 800g because the Motorola touch phone seemed to have too small a keyboard and I had read that you really needed to use the stylus with it, which I didn't want to have to do.Arrival:I got the phone, and having had a Tracfone before, immediately plugged it in to charge it.  After it was charged I activated it online with no problems.  Within a half hour I had my 3000 minutes, good for over a year.  The online minutes deals are better than the individual cards you can buy at the stores.  3000 for $200 works out to about .065 cents per minute (texts are only a third of that, so .022 cents per minute).Testing:I immediately started playing around with it when I could.  The touch screen was pretty responsive, though it does take a bit of getting used to when trying to scroll without accidentally choosing one of the items on the menu.  It's not an Iphone or ipod touch screen, but still it works really well.One of the downfalls I had read about was that the Qwerty keyboard couldn be used to input contacts.  This is true, but honestly it was fine.  Instead of using the number pad (which is a pain in the butt on all phones) I found that it was really easy to use the handwriting entry option - and it was really good at picking up my writing on the screen and converting it to the correct letter.It had two games on it that I played briefly - both were okay but nothign great.  I am used to playing touch games on my kids' ipods so these paled in comparison.Signal strength in my house when I first turned it on was not great, but it almost seems like the phone just needed to get warmed up because after the first day it has been fine.  Signal strength everywhere I have tried to use it has been great, with good sound quality.Downfall:the biggest downfall I have seen so far is in receiving text messages.  I have not had any problem with random multiple text messages coming in - it looks like they have fixed that problem that others were having earlier this year.  My problem with it is that when a text comes in, it doesnt tell you what number or who the text is from until after you have accepted it (and paid the 1/3 of a minute).  I got a text yesterday from someone I dont know, who obviously had the wrong number because they were looking for someone named Joseph.  Had I seen the number it came from I probably wouldnt have read it.  They then texted me again this morning, so they are wasting my minutes.  I did text them back to tell them they had the wrong number.  It would be good to see who is sending the text before reading.  And given that, it would also be nice to be able to block a phone number from sending you a text (just in case this person keeps texting me).All in all this is a great phone.  For a pay as you go plan, I think it's actually Excellent - never would have thoguht I could get a touchscreen phone and only pay about $200 a year for my minutes since I dont tend to use my phone that much anyway.I havent looked into adding any other apps yet, but have found a few sites that apparently have apps that work with this phone.  the cheapest way to get them seems to be to download to your computer and transfer them to the phone so you dont waste minutes downlaoding on the phone itself.  It also looks like you can only have about 9 icons on your main screen and I'm not sure you can scroll to the side pages and add more or not - have to test that.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 1/2 Smart Phone - LG800G Tracfone", "Author": "Thomas D.

Had to ditch my contract with Verizon because my monthly bill of almost $100 for unlimited everything on my HTC Incredible 2 is simply too expensive as I will soon be laid-off and don't know when I'll get another job that pays what I make now.I've had Tracfone in the past and they're OK, pretty much only good for a basic phone, nothing much else. This LG800G is sort-of OK. Maybe I'm just having smartphone withdrawals. Call quality is decent, almost better than it was through Verizon. I get a stronger signal than I did with Verizon too, but that's the same for my old Tracfones too. The internet browser is nothing special, though it does seem to display most pages. I haven't tried anything that runs flash yet though. It's only a little slower than my 3G was through Verizon, but I didn't buy this thing to surf the web either. Texting is pretty much a chore, if you ask me.  It does have a QWERTY keyboard that you set if you want, but the keys are too small to do any lengthy messages, though you obviously can if you have patience and good coordination. When texting, there is a slight lag from what key you push and when it shows on the \"notepad\" part in the message you're composing, it's a little annoying.  I've just discovered that in order to make texting a little easier, calibrate the touchpad with something that has a fine point, NOT with your finger, like I originally did.  This way you're not hitting every other key around the one you're trying to when typing texts. Text messages DO NOT display the name or number of who ever is sending it to you until you pay for it, which blows. However, to send/receive texts it's still only .3 minutes deducted, just like my old Tracfones, which is nice and cheap. Oh, and the predictive part of the texting sucks too, it doesn't know many words. I just typed and sent a few messages while posting this, and I'm just going to conclude that texting on this phone SUCKS. The camera is crappy but will get the job done. I used my camera on my HTC mainly to compare prices when shopping so this camera will achieve the same no problem. The speaker on the phone is cheap and sound quality is nasty, but whatever.

Basically, the only way to decently text is with T9, and nobody wants to do that anymore.Despite contrary belief, this phone is NOT a smartphone, even though Tracfone has advertised it as such. The only way you can 'surf the web' is by using precious units, and that service is slow at best. There is no wi-fi capability, which is definitely a downside.Now, for the kicker. As I stated, I have had this phone for two years. And now, the touchscreen will not work. At all. Whenever I try to get to a certain function, such as the PHONE DIALER, it opens up something on the far right of the screen. There is no way for me to place calls, text, or even access my prepaid options so I can activate the new phone that I have bought as a replacement.If you're looking for a short-term, relatively inexpensive touch screen phone, then this phone could be for you. After all, it has worked seamlessly (besides the issues with texting) for two years. If you're looking for something in the long run though, DO NOT get this phone. I have read everywhere on the internet that other people are having the same problem as me, as well as some texting glitches. The touchscreen will more than likely stop working after awhile, and then you will be stuck with a phone that only works with receiving incoming calls.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "maybe if it weren't tracfone", "Author": "marko1900s", "ReviewID": "R2J9I9L95VBJ2Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The lg800g might be a good phone if you didn't have to deal with tracfone I am new to bolth I was reading on their support web-site about adding micro memory because I added an 8g sd card as the instructions said, and calling tracfone support who told me only a 2g card will work, i installed the 2 g card and at least it seems to accept it but no clue how to use it. The phone goes online by itself and it is not an easy task you have to type with the tip of your finger but i can go to use my phone at any given time and it is surfing the web. I realized how bad tracfone was when I first got my phone they sent me a welcome text and charged me for it. unless you intend to pay for them dont set up your voice mail and it will tell callers u dont have 1 otherwise there is no way to delete them without paying, i can see the missed calls for free. As soon as i use up the time i paid for i am going somewhere else for service, i intend to have this phone unlocked and i will use it to go online if nothing else.This phone has the ability to connect with your home wifi and save u some money but tracfone locked it out with the many other options this phone has.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a prepaid phone.", "Author": "Miguel A.

The GUI (graphic user interface) is very user friendly. Now, the browser that comes with the LG 800g is a java based application and make surfing the web at a snail pace. To fix that,  I highly recommend downloading the opera mini browser, trust me having the Opera mini browser made surfing the web from my LG 800g a very pleasant experience. And the pages loaded faster. There is a downside and I believe its because the LG 800g is a java based phone; you will NOT be able to play Youtube videos (which is only the downside to this phone).  However, to go around this, just simply convert your favorite videos to MP4 format and upload it to your phone. I did this recently for a long road trip with my family and it kept me entertained for a while. I do recommend getting a larger capacity micro SD card (I got a 32 GB card). Surprisingly, I was able to upload 4 to 5 full length movies and some mp3's to my LG 800g.Yes, it is true that you have press slightly harder to browse the LG 800g phone but its not as hard as some of the negative reviewers as saying. I had no trouble with it. In fact, before you began using LG 800g, you go through a series of touchscreen calibration test.  In addition, I think the people who are writing negative reviews about this phone were hoping that the LG 800g would perform like an Android or iPhone but for fraction of the price.Finally, I recommend the LG 800g smartphone for those who want a smartphone but not have the huge bills for the data plans that comes standard with most Android and/or iPhone plans.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG pre-paid phone", "Author": "Ray Ray", "ReviewID": "R2XV00UAOQ8K0V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty solid phone and service was excellent.

After a few weeks and many hours with tech support I had to send it the tracfone back because we could not go online. It took a couple days before the second one arrived and after a week, we could not get the phone to work properly after many hours with tech support. Each time I recieved a new phone it took hours to get the minutes transferred and I was put on hold for a few minutes, the few minutes end up to a couple of hours because I had entry level people looking after me who had to go to their supervisor for help. Presently I have my fourth phone and I had to give up the original phone number because it was such a hassle getting it transferred, the battery does not last long and I have to constantly reboot the phone by taking the battery out. Also text messages are charged 30 seconds and even though you are given triple you eat up minutes fast. So in theory it is good but in practice you don't triple minutes. There are many places in the house I cannot use the phone, my husband's $9.95 tracfone performs much better. In conclusion, I think that the factory does not go through the phones when they get returns. The original phone was a new one and the subsequent ones were phones where something was wrong. I think the phone is a piece of crap. The tech support people eventually sent me to a supervisor and because the phone works sporatically they cannot do anything for me. One of the tech support people did mention that this phone was very \"sensitive\".  I would never buy one or recommend anyone to buy one. It is garbage.

I wanted serious apps, like maps, boating charts, business apps, etc. but the 'Java 2' operating system of the phone supports no real business related apps.One very annoying feature of this phone is the automatic screen lock. You must keep pressing the unlock icon to perform tasks, such as access to the phone keyboard.Yes, it has a qwerty keyboard, but even using a pencil for a stylus it has a high entry error rate.I worked around the 'no app' problem by getting various websites as bookmarks, such as Google Maps and Weather Underground. Weather Underground will give you animated weather radar for this phone. Time spent on line is generous, they don't bill you for many minutes online. However, not so with checking your email. I use the email client the phone comes with and it gobles up your minutes quickly. I will try to switch to a net based email client such as G Mail, that may solve the problem.Battery life is average on this unit, but it charges quickly. Voice quality sending and recieving is excellent.I purchased some screen protectors and a thin rubber protector for the phone. I strongly reccomend the rubber protector because it keeps the rear access door from popping open as it is prone to do. The screen protectors are great because they let you use a stylus (a pen, pencil, car key, whatever) without scratching the units screen. The screen protectors are cheap and easlily replaced when scratched up. I bought a five-pack here at Amazon.This phone's on/off switch is difficult to use and has a 5 second lag.I talk a lot on my cell, my typical bill is under $20/month. This is a great value.

I get told that I have to wait longer for the browser to start working...well three weeks later and it's nothing.

Also, I have to reenter the numbers with the main number I wish to use in the first location by erasing and reentering them.  2.Many times when I push on the screen and it freezes up and I have to push more than once, sometimes three times before it will respond.  3.Calendar function is a joke, If I go to a specific day and then I decide to back arrow it doesn't do anything, forward arrow does and then after pressing back error again it may go back day by day sometimes. 4.Speed dials have to be erased or changes to the phone numbers will not be changed with it.  5.General freezing up of touch screen.  6.No apps available so phone is useless as it won't work with say word files in at least that way you could read them possibly.  I added storage card but the directory structure is a mess and it becomes hard to tell where to are placing your files and if you create a folder for files you'll get your files stuck in there and may have much trouble getting them back out as I did, so it is only going to let you use folders that are already there it seems.  6.You must unplug and plug your phone back in your computer(assuming you have a cable like I do)for it to recognize the option of connecting as a storage device or not wanting this option, no way to toggle it through the phone, this worries me also because I am going to wear the plug/port out on my phone eventually as I also recharge it though my Netbooks USB.Good luck that is all I can say except, everywhere I try and write a review it is never posted..

And we are without a phone now while we wait for the SIM card.Plus we still have to send the old phone back.

Also I cannot figure out how to manually set the clock.I will update this review in the coming days as I learn more about it.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "frustrating", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1RZ1I58ZWKCZ5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I too had a lot of problems and no less than 17 phone calls and 3 weeks to tracfone (which is a challenge in itself).

It was her first time out of the country, and employees from two different locations (CVS and a travel agency) recommended that she purchase a tracfone instead of a phone card. She got to Europe only to be unpleasantly surprised when her phone did not work. It wasn't until after she arrived that she discovered that Tracfones ONLY work in the United States. The packaging of each phone says that you can \"call internationally,\" but that only means that you can call other countries from the USA using your tracfone. Your tracfone will immediately cease to work if you go overseas. My sister made sure to ask both employees if she would be able to contact her family in America while she was in Europe, and they both said yes.After looking over the packaging for the tracfone and the accompanying Airtime card, I could not find ANYWHERE a statement explicitly saying, \"Tracfones only work in the United States.\" On the front of the box, It says that you can call nationally and internationally, and that is it. The website offers the same amount of information. I called their support number to inquire about a refund, and they were very unhelpful. The one star is not only for the general cheapness of the product, but also for the misleading advertising and the horrible customer service.Even if you are not looking for a phone with complete international capabilities, I would still not recommend this product. Their packaging is misleading and, even though they have apparently received several complaints about the lack of specification of the phone's international capabilities on the packaging/website, they refuse to change it. Simply saying, \"Call nationally and internationally\" does not automatically imply that you cannot make calls from other countries. I even asked the customer service representative if an explicit statement could be found on any of their products, in the instruction manual, or on the website, in case I missed something. Even she said that there is no such statement anywhere to be found.I am deeply dissatisfied with the company in general, and, if you are looking for high-quality product that is backed up by sufficient customer service, do NOT purchase any kind of tracfone.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "DUMB and Dumber", "Author": "Hvyvshrk", "ReviewID": "R8MMZRVQ3CEZP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not ask for a refund I asked for a replacement phone.
