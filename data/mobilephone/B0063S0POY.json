{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone that many people do not know about", "Author": "Abes", "ReviewID": "RVXFHPCJY9ALN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony did a great job with this phone as it is easy to use and has ample space to store music, videos and pictures. Bottom line is that this is the perfect phone for someone who needs all the common smartphone features combined with a sharp 8mp camera that can shoot video in HD. I have 2 small kids and since I never carried my good camera this allows me to capture all those great moments in a high quality format. The video that you capture can be instantly displayed on your TV via the HDMI port on the Xperia Pro. I Have a Bluetooth enabled car stereo and the Bluetooth connection on the Xperia Pro works perfectly.The screen is large enough that you can simply use the on screen keyboard but it is really nice to have a full qwerty keyboard to slide out and complete different fields on web pages. I dont do much typing since the Google Voice search/text option works really well with this phone.The only downside with this phone is that you can only use the edge network on this phone in the US since the GSM carriers do not offer the xperia line of phones. This is a non-issue for me though since I mostly use data at home or work where there is wi-fi.I would Highly reccomend the phone as I prefer it over the Iphone", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Elegant Phone!", "Author": "mamagoch", "ReviewID": "ROUAH7U1FNDVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received this phone 2 days ago. One way to describe it is 'elegant'. I just love it! For how much it costs, it has quite a lot of functions and worth every dollar. No regrets about it.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "super awesome and cool phone", "Author": "Mayim", "ReviewID": "R3MP59BZFR35NQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this phone its very responsive and hardly ever freezes up i have always loved sony products and this has really met my expectations and then some i loved the fast and free shipping 2 i really like the keyboard  and the buttons are not too soft or too hard just the right touch and its the perfect size if u have smaller hands like i do i didn't want one of those really huge touch screen phones and this is just right u really get the best of both worlds if u like touch screens but still like buttons like i do really good phone i would  suggest it to anyone :D", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE my new phone", "Author": "Nancy A. Kearney", "ReviewID": "RKVZN2PP3HZ43", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a very hard time locating a good Android phone that had a Qwerty keyboard. This phone fits the bill!  The phone will only work on the T-Mobile or AT&T; network because it uses 1700/2100mhz band and took some figuring out.. and the signal in my house is not great. Also, the phone came with an overseas plug and transformer. That was a surprise! All in all..this phone is everything I wanted and more!  Great phone, super (dual) camera, really fun features.  I am very happy with my investment so far. I do wish it came with an owner's manual.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Xperia Pro", "Author": "Gaby Nehme", "ReviewID": "R1JB1H8T2BKFXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the phone last week (Xperia Pro) and still exploring it. It is a performer in every way: Screen, Camera, Apps, keyboard, etc.. Battery Life could be better(average 1.5 days), but is acceptable (my advice is to buy a car charger). If you're a SonyEricsson fan, you won't regret buying this!", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "XPERIA PRO MK16i", "Name": "SONY ERICSSON SONY XPERIA PRO MK16i", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31fjnyn3cjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0063S0POY"}}
