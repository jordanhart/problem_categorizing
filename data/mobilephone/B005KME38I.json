{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Serves the intended purpose well", "Author": "another brick in the wall \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R2PGRKM6E9SW8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased two of these phones, to free us from outrageous monthly \"smart\" phone bills and actually use a cell phone for its original intended purpose- to make occasional calls when away from home or work. No, these phones will not be confused with iPhones, but you won't have to work a second job to pay your cell phone bill, either. They are small, easily customized, and very reasonable to operate on the 10 cents per minute plan, no monthly charges of any sort. One buys $25.00 worth of airtime, good for three months; unused minutes roll over when more time is purchased. Other plans available include $2.00 per day the phone is used, unlimited on that day, or $50.00 a month for unlimited voice, data, and text messaging. Only two small quibbles keep this phone from getting five stars- it is relatively easy to hit a wrong button and trigger internet access, or at least the beginning of internet access, which, of course, will cost you a few cents. A more serious concern is the occasional reception of unsolicited junk text messages, which cost an outrageous 20 cents each. I plan to complain to AT&T; about the text messages. An internet or media block might also prevent me for being able to send a text message, so I don't think that's a solution, if it's even available on these phones.The battery charge lasts for days, even weeks, and reception and voice quality seem excellent. If you're tired of paying for your smart phone every month, are out of contract and looking to cut back on your expenses, these might be a good solution. We use Ooma for unlimited calling at home, which is also working out very nicely. Once your friends and family learn to use your cell only for emergencies and instead call you at work or home, you may like this phone as much as my wife and I do.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "1st Cell Phone", "Author": "snjguy", "ReviewID": "R20UOAD9PDPVVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK I just got this for $39.99 and it seems to be a great phone, but this is my 1st cell phone, so I really wouldn't know a bad phone and features.  AT&T; only has one lower priced Go Phone at $19.99, but it doesn't have Bluetooth. This has the Bluetooth and a camera. It's a small phone at 3 3/4\" x 2\" x 3/4\" when closed.  I wanted a clam shell so I can throw it in my pocket and this fit the bill. You can also get a data plan to do the web and such but I was looking for a reasonably price phone for calls. As with all prepaid phones you have to watch your minutes and expiration, but if you get the $100.00 refill for 1000 minutes they're good for a year and all the prepaid plans roll over the minutes balance if you refill in time. Or get a pay as you go plan and pay every month. The sound is very clear and it's Bluetooth connection to my GPS makes it somewhat hands free. You have a lot of options if you want to get a data plan. IM, mobile email, games & apps and web connection. It's a AT&T; private brand made by ZTE phones.UPDATE 7/7/2013 After a little less than 2 yrs of usage, here are some insights into the phone. AT&T; network isn't the greatest or maybe it's just the phone but a sometimes I'll get a missed call notice and the phone never rang. Also I'll get a message notice HOURS- yes, HOURS after the message was left for me. Glad it wasn't a emergency!  The phone isn't the most rugged phone. Mine developed a vibration in the speaker  when it rings like something is loose inside,  that could be due to dropping it. Oh and if you want a scratch free screens, GET YOURSELF SOME SCREEN PROTECTORS FROM EBAY OR AMAZON, the screens are just plastic and will get scratched from the keypad rubbing against the screen and stuff in you pocket.

Nice to know but a bit annoying. The phone itself is basic but has a few annoying features; the ones I like least are the multiple steps it takes to get to the address book and that to get a picture off the phone you need to message it someplace rather than using the usb cable.

We found a place called \"teytek cellphone and computer repairs\" that advertised their unlocking services on Craigslist. They confirmed they were able to do it, and we were able to to get it done for $30 Without the need to negotiate. Either way, I came from there yesterday after unlocking it, the performance was still great. I threw in my t-mobile sim card and the phone was still fast responding made a call with no problem.

This phone mostly meets my needs, and has additional features I don't, like being able to connect to the internet. It's been entirely adequate for my needs for the past two years, though it does have some built in annoyances.The most basic annoyance is this phone tends to just send people straight to my voice mail, and doesn't even log that someone has called me sometimes. It also has this weird habit of not connecting me at all when I call sometimes, and just leaving me there listening to a very loud echo of my own breathing. Both these things have gotten worse as it has gotten older.It also has various quirks doing really basic stuff. If you want to set your phone to vibrate, you end up in a menu with the options of \"General\" \"Meeting\" \"Outdoor\" and \"Silent\", and you're left to intuit which of these are ring, vibrate, ring and vibrate and none of the above. Being someone that's in meetings regularly, I also wish that I could switch between these options in fewer button presses. Another option and issue is just turning the volume to zero, but for some reason also shuts off the vibration function, which is a bother. The final thing you could do to silence it is to shut it off, and this is by far the worst option, since it insists of making this loud annoying jet swooping sound when you do that, and nothing says \"I am respectfully shutting off my phone to prevent it from being a distraction.\" like pulling it out and having it make loud noises. I have no idea why someone thought that was a good idea, but I curse them regularly.I do still use the phone, and plan to till it dies.

So, obviously, it made sense to just drop it and its astonishingly high mandatory data rates and get something that did the only thing I really needed it to do: Send and receive calls, texts, and sometimes emails.Since smartphones are becoming staggeringly expensive (especially if you're still an iPhone user, in which case you probably just go with familiarity since the phone hasn't really improved since the 4 [Siri was already on Android phones long before then, not that it was all that useful to begin with]) and also have new problems, like practically mandatory external chargers (ATT treats these as a casual given that they're happy to sell you, like it's somehow okay that the things can't even be used for one day without being recharged), abysmal battery life, poor voice quality in favor of data speeds, and basically, tons of stuff you *HAVE* to pay for that practically no one really needs. Data plans are only going up in price, and how \"smart\" do you really need a smartphone to be? At what point is it just a mini-computer and only secondarily a phone?Anyway, if you're like me and just said no to the smartphone boom that made cell phone bills shoot through the damned exosphere while *sacrificing* basic features older phones had (such as, say, working for the entire freaking day with normal use, and acting like having secondary chargers has always been the case), phones like these are really the way to go. Use your tablet for the tough stuff, it's far better at it, anyway. And less expensive, so long as you just use Wi-Fi for your data.If you want a small computer that doesn't even bother acting like it's technically a phone, knock yourself out and get an expensive smartphone. If you're a little smarter than that, get a tablet (they're now far more affordable and even sub-$200 ones are more than adequate for most people--and they don't have contracts) and a phone that acts like it's really a phone. You'll save a ridiculous amount of money in the long run and end up better off than you were before even if cost wasn't the motivator. Smartphones are so battery-craving and in many practical ways no better off than before, so they're really just absurd with the advent of contract-free, inexpensive tablets.I hope these things come back as viable options for people instead of the all-the-way-downhill iPhones of today that still dominate the market exclusively due to familiarity with the brand (it's true: Everything an iPhone has ever done has been done before on Android, bar nothing at all except the mechanism that makes it more expensive).

That being said, my old phone began to have issues so I bought this one.Out of all the cell phones I ever owned, this is the most frustrating one I ever owned. Just try and find things like 'missed calls' from scratch. Any other phone I ever saw was simple. Not this one! I've had it for awhile now and I like it less every day. Except for messaging, everything else is hidden or buried. There is NO entry for call history and there's no intuitive way of locating it. I found it once accidentally and never again since. I have spent more time going in circles with this phone trying to do the same things that were straight forward and easy on my last one which was also a flip phone.Reception is absolutely unreliable. One minute you can have full bars and the next nothing while sitting in the same place. No issue with hearing or being heard, but that's about all this thing does well.Add to all that that this thing is the cheapest, thinnest crappy plastic I have ever seen -again 100X more flimsy and cheap feeling than my last phone, and this becomes an even worse phone deal. It certainly isn't built to last if you actually handle it.I also found if you bought it from a certain retailer with 'Shack' in its name, you have to sign up with them to even access the help page for the phone which means SPAM, SPAM, and more SPAM. Been there, done that, won't happen again. There appears to be no way to opt out.I am looking for something better that isn't pricey because all I end up doing is calls, text, the rare photo and even rarer Internet access.

No issues there.  Also, it's a flip phone. I love flip phones (in general) because they curve around the shape of your jaw, when you talk on them, and also because they are small, and you can close them safely with no button smashing or pocket dialing.Cons -1. If you like to use the \"ZiAbc\" function (also known as the T9 function on every other phone I've ever had), texting has a terrible lag from the time you type a word, to the time it shows up on the screen. The dictionary is also lacking. You can add words to it, but only so many. After it fills up (which mine did after only a few days), every word you type that it doesn't know (which there are plenty), you have to spell out letter by letter, which takes even longer.2. The resolution of the pictures is terrible. You can't even tell what you took a picture of. I carry around a real camera for situations where I actually want to take keepsake photos, but I used to use my phone (other phones) for sending pictures of things to friends through text messages. That feature is an option with this phone, but its worthless because of the low quality of the pictures.3. Speed dial only works to directly call a person. Can't use it for texts. With my old phone, I was able to use the speed dial number for a particular person, then choose whether i wanted to call them or text them. With this phone, if I want to text someone, I can't even do \"new text\" and then type their name in. I have to do \"new text\" then \"contacts\" then hunt them down in the list.4. For some reason, for the first few months of use, this phone was able to store a couple hundred texts before I would get the flashing yellow envelope alerting me that the memory was full, at which point, i would delete the texts and everything would be fine for a few more weeks. Now, for some reason, I get the flashing yellow envelope after anywhere from 3 - 15 texts. I have no idea why this is happening. I deleted all of the pictures from the phone, thinking it was a memory issue, but it didn't solve the problem.5. The first month I had this phone, I was able to play the Tetris game that came on it. However, I tried to play it again the other day, and it said I needed to activate the internet in order to play it (didn't need to before, so wth?).I would definitely not recommend this phone, unless you're going to use it strictly for phone calls and not for texting or anything else.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great while it worked", "Author": "Hope54", "ReviewID": "RYE7KFRPIW54H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this for about 5 months before the screen started blanking out.

I spent hours reading the wonderful reviews for this flip phone and made my decision based largely on the positive reviews.  I didn't have time to locate and visit a store with active phones I could test beforehand because I needed to get out of another contract by a deadline, but I also needed to port my number to the new carrier.  I must assume that none of the positive reviewers for the Z221 have ever had a flip phone before.  I guess that's plausible because this Z221 is my fifth flip phone (I still am not drawn to any smart phone yet), and every one before this one including my very first, was MUCH better.If the only thing you want to do is set up a couple speed dials and talk to three folks total, then this is the phone for you.  I don't know if it's the service/network (AT&T;) or the phone antenna capability, but the only positive thing I can say about this phone is that the reception and sound quality are good--that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  Beyond that, it compares horribly to other flip phones out there.  I cannot believe someone recommended this phone for seniors--are you kidding?  I can barely dial the dinky keypad or read the teeny-tiny menus or contacts (with the exception of digits dialed) even with my glasses.  Just to give others who think this phone is wonderful, an idea of what other basic flip phones can do:1) Provide an easy-access menu button (I realize AT&T; flip phones have a problem with this).2) Provide a variety of ring tones, alarm tones, calendar tones, etc.3) Provide a loud volume level so you can hear the phone ring (without going through multiple sub-menus and still not getting a result).4) Provide a logical, intuitive menu structure so you can find items in one and only one menu tree (not hide the Tools menu--alarms, calendar, etc.--under the My Stuff menu).5) Provide easy access to menu items so shortcut keys are not necessary to set.  I didn't feel like searching to set up personalized ring tones so I knew who was calling (I can't hear the phone ring anyway).6) Provide a variety of vibrate options that can easily be felt & heard.7) I could go on and on, but my advice is to try another flip phone--even if you have to go to another service (Try the Doro 410 with Consumer Cellular--great for seniors; try the Kyocera Vero with Sprint--also great for seniors and for EVERYBODY who wants/needs a flip phone.Update:I've used this phone infrequently over the past three weeks (haven't returned it yet), and despite infrequent use, the battery seems to drain very quickly.  I've charged the phone five times for a total of 5-6 hours of use in three weeks.  Unacceptable.
