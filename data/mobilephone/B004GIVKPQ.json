Texting with its keyboard is great don't get me wrong but occasionally it wouldn't send text even though there is two bars of service. This is the 5th week since I obtained this phone and now its starting to lag ever so slightly and sometimes it freezes as I am sending a text(just pull the battery out and it'll be fine). There is also a problem where the sent texts that you have will magically appear in the draft box but its not a big annoyance. The phone works great if you are looking to just call and text and good for its price.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the price, but not great...", "Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "RZCEQBXMZXM9Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not a bad phone for the money, but I realized too late that it doesn't have wifi, which is of course my fault. But the responsivity of the screen is not very good, it's quite slow and the construction is not too solid neither. I don't think I will buy again any similar phone, better invest extra $100 to buy better one.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is very important!", "Author": "josed", "ReviewID": "R3UQVQ693RP4B5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As it says on the descriptions, Is it really an international version?
