{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quadband Dual SIM Card Dick Tracy Watch", "Author": "Jay Port", "ReviewID": "RF91L2DNS0WCB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many things I love about this cell phone watch and a few things I don't like. First the things I like:Dual Sim cards. I can't review how well this works yet because I live in an area with very poor cell reception. I have not yet been able to make a phone call but I have received a couple of SMS texts.MP3. Incredible! The audio quality is on par with my iPod! Very crisp, clear, rich tones when using the included headset. There is an included equalizer but I have not felt a need to adjust anything because the sound quality is fantastic. My one complaint? Volume control. I adjusted it as low as it goes and it is still a little too loud for my tastes. Without the headset the sound is just okay through the one speaker. I thought this had stereo speakers because of the dual pattern of speaker holes, but the left side is just for looks.Organizer Menu.This watch includes all sorts of fun diversions such as:1. Compass 2. Calendar 3. To Do 4. Alarm 5. Bluetooth 6. Calculator 7. Ebook Reader 8. Number Area Function (caller ID)The compass is very cool. The Alarm function is nice, offering 5 separate alarms, but not the ability to set it to your own mp3 songs or tones. You must choose from what they offer which is 5 midi tones. Interesting, because there is a ringtone in this phone of a rooster crowing which I wanted to use as my alarm clock tone but can't. The calculator works as a standard calculator and was one of the reasons I bought this watch. You can use the external buttons for entering numbers but you must use the touchscreen for math functions. The included stylus in the watch band works fine for this. I have not yet tested the Ebook Reader so I can't comment on it yet.Multimedia MenuAs stated earlier, the MP3 function is VERY nice and one of the reasons I love this watch. The camera works but is not a high end function, more of a toy in my opinion. Same with the video recorder. I have not yet tested the FM radio or Sound Recorder.There are many features for the phone that will take time for me to learn. I tried writing a text message to test the SMS feature but found it very confusing. I'll update this review later if I can get a good handle on it.The manual. It is good and bad. It included a good tip on how to play music in the audio player by saying to create a folder called My Music. I did this on my micro SD card and it recognized it no problem. Speaking of the micro SD, the description for this watch keeps referring to a T Flash. It is the same thing as Micro SD. The description also says a maximum 2 gb card. I have an 8 gb card in my watch and it is working flawlessly. I love the battery life. I charged the watch and went 5 days before needing to charge it again. There are 2 batteries that come with this watch. Very nice addition! The number buttons are lit up when using them and are very easy to see at night. The touchscreen is very responsive most of the time. When using the audio player you must sometimes use the stylus. I like the rubber watch band. This watch feels very light on my arm and extremely comfortable.Things I don't like:Video. I have tried everything I can think of but it simply does not work. Well, it doesn't play video but the audio works. I get a screen that looks very snowy while the audio comes through fine. I have tried several MP4 video files and they all show the same way. When in play mode, the onscreen menu at the bottom is totally useless...no fast forward, none of the functions work.Accessing the menus. I discovered this through trial and error since I don't recall seeing this in the manual. You must push the red button first, then wait for the unlock screen message to appear, then hold down the green button until you get a message saying it is unlocked. It should be simpler to access the functions. Once this is done, you must press the OK on the touchscreen to access the menu functions. The manual should have been clearer on this. You should experiment with the asterisk, 0 button, and pound symbol because they do different things on different menus. Again, the manual could be clearer on this. In the manual it references pushing the asterisk key in order to go into Meeting mode. It doesn't work. In the time/date function it offers 12 or 24 hour mode. I wanted 12 hour mode but it is impossible to set this. It is permanently on 24 hour mode. I'm a little worried about where I would find a replacement band if this one should break. There is no manufacturer name anywhere on the box or in the manual. So, no tech support. No website. Nothing.I'll have more to say as time marches on. I give this a solid 4, mostly for the very rich MP3 function and lots of extra goodies. Too bad the video doesn't work.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good phone watch", "Author": "jomar", "ReviewID": "R24KZAAHZJQJQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have this phone for 4 days now i have no complain on it the camera so good and fm tuner great mp3 is ok video not so good", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cell Phone Wrist Watch", "Author": "P.

My wife made a comment that she liked the looks of his watch. The gentelman replyed that this was his cell phone/ watch. When we got back home, my wife asked me to order the phone/watch for her from Amazon. The watch is quite unique its a full functioning cell phone, watch, alarm clock, compass, fm radio, with bluetooth and camera. My wife liked it mainly because she didn't have to look around in her perse when the cell phone rang, its always right there on her wrist to answer. The phone/watch has a place for 2 sim cards and it also has a touch screen for full phone functions. All of this in a very small package. I don't know how they can put all this in such a small package but I guess this is what the cell phone is coming too.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Watch", "Author": "Service member", "ReviewID": "R1ZUIX6S0XANPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to admit I like all kinds of gagets! But this watch is the greatest! I travel all over Europe and the Middle East and always have someone asking me about the watch when they hear it ringing or hearing me talking to my watch and realize it's a cell phone.My last travel I was on Emirate Airlines and my watch was ringing, when the flight attendent from Bulgaria asked to please turn off my cell phone. I took my watch off and turn off my phone. She was very impressed and talk to me every chance she got. Well, when we arrived in Germany she asked me for my number. Since I was in Germany, Anyway long story short.... Germany was great!!! It nice to have James Bond gagets! You never know who you meet and finds you interesting.
