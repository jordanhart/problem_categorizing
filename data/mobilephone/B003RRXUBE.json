The apps of the android system are great, but if you download many of them your system is likely to crash a lot. The touchscreen may be cool at first, but sometimes simple tasks such as dialing or saving a number may become annoying, especially if the system gets slower and slower due to apps. The battery life is not too good. I have to recharge the phone daily even if I didn't make a long phone call. I am satisfied with the camera, which produces very good photos in my opinion. What makes this phone great is its size, look and the camera. Although the size makes this phone pretty handy, the touchscreen and the system may not be very convenient especially for basic usage such as phone calls and sms. All in all, I still like it but I think I should have bought the version with integrated keypad.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fits  in your 5th pocket of your jeans.", "Author": "GadgetGirl", "ReviewID": "R1E3HXJB65WZ8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is really a nice size in the world , bigger is always better.Set up with ATT was automatic.

But that is not all about this great device. First of all it has to be its size which will make you wonder... can this thing carry of so many features.. and trust me.. it does and very easily at that.The good news is that SE has released the Android 2.1 update for this phone.. so a major problem of no bluetooth file transfer has been solved. The phone has an in-built memory of 128 MB which is kinda enough for the apps.. for me at least. The battery can be optimised with a few intelligent settings changes.. like keeping the background data off if you are not using the internet all the time.One reviewer said that this phone doesnt have the Android Market app... which is basically not true. This phone does have the app and it works like a breeze. Most apps work flawlessly keeping in mind the small screen and its limitations.You would either love this phone or hate it. I love it for the whole effort behind to produce something new, something out of the mould. Yes, for this design you would have to live with certain limitations.. but then, im not a great texter in the first place.
