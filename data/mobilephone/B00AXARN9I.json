{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall, a good phone for its price.", "Author": "Deborah Y.", "ReviewID": "R1XSQDKTOPELZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone about 2 weeks ago. For 2 weeks, I have been using the phone and observed it really closely to find its pros and cons.Pros: Price. For a price of under $60.00, it is almost impossible to find other 4G LTE phones made by major companies. Price is the biggest winner in this phone.Ok reliability -- Like other reviews, it is true that it freezes and may lose calls. But it does not happen all the time, they happen occasionlly.Reception is tolerable. At first, I thought the reception was horrible. But after removing the vinyl safety film that had covered the speaker, it became OK.Cons:Tends to freeze a lot, especially when you are doing something that requires a lot of memory. Definitely not a phone for heavy game players or data users.Blackout possible. When it freezes, it is also possible for the phone to black out.Touchscreen reaction is not the best of all. Many times you have to push the icon twice or three times until you get the reaction.Battery runs out rather fast. I am not a heavy phone user at all. I rarely talk on the phone, I never play games, just occasionally use internet browser, navigation app, and Amazon kindle app for reading books. With a minimal use, the battery does not last a whole day. It is a good idea to purchase an extra battery and carry it around, with chargers so that you can frequently charge it.Must get the SD card along with the purchase of phone itself. It has very little, almost non-existent internal memory, and without a SD card, you cannot even save contacts.Overall, an OK phone. Not so horrible, but when you think about the price and 4G LTE on the top of it, I would definitely recommend this phone to the people who are on the budget, not a heavy phone user, and first time smartphone users. People who have had smartphone previously from other major companies would not find the phone satisfactory, but for the starters and savers, this phone would be recommendable.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good 4G LTE phone", "Author": "Sean Kim", "ReviewID": "R2QPX9KY2T65LC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife purchased this phone for her first smartphone.

It's thin and doesn't weigh too much and it takes pretty good pictures. However, the best feature is the Swype setting on the keyboard. You just drag your finger around and it forms the word for you.

I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a phone that will work for a long period of time. It gets unbearably slow to pull up anything and has very little internal memory. It will begin to break down after a period of a few months so I would get this as a simple replacement if needed.

Owen, Ph.D.", "ReviewID": "R2KCKYOQI6OUYP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It\u2019s amazing how this phone is so poorly designed.  I got this phone because of a warranty replacement for my HTC Incredible.  Here I list the defects that make this phone almost useless:The headphone jack is not sealed, so dust collects on the inside screen and over the front-facing camera, making any such images look obscured and \u201cold-timey.\u201d  I would also prefer the jack to be on the top instead of the left side.I\u2019ve added an 8 GB microSD, but the phone can\u2019t use it for system apps.  It\u2019s fine for any added apps though.  There is only 376 MB of internal space and upgrading a system app eats into this and is quickly exhausted.  So you generally have to uninstall any upgrades and use the original version in ROM.The GPS just doesn\u2019t seem to work well at all and is useless for geocaching (maybe 200 ft accuracy).Because of the phone jack location, when propping the phone on exercise equipment to watch Netflix, the button on the bottom side gets pressed breaking the Netflix stream to start the music or recorded audio playlist.Battery charging is hit-or-miss also.  It will often say \u201cCharging temporarily stopped.  Battery temperature is too low\u201d or just not charge.The phone doesn\u2019t have a flash for the camera.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pantech Breakout 4G LTE Verizon Android Smart Phone", "Author": "L Mar\u00eda", "ReviewID": "R24UOA2KZI01W3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pantech Breakout 4G LTE Verizon Android Smart Phone is for my daughter.
