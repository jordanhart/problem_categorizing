Packaged well and delivered very quickly.  I bought this to replace a broken phone because our upgrade is not available until June and I am unwilling to increase my package to include a data plan.  It is a little on the small side especially for a man with bigger hands but doable.  This phone has good sound and picture quality for a basic phone and that is all we need.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Feature-packed messaging phone with slide-out QWERTY keyboard, threaded messaging display, colorful 2.1-inch display\nAccess V CAST Music with Rhapsody service (subscription and PC downloads); GPS-enabled for turn-by-turn directions\n1.3-megapixel camera for still photos; Bluetooth stereo music; microSD expansion to 16 GB; digital audio player; access to instant messaging and personal email\nUp to 5 hours of talk time, up to 300 hours (12.5 days) of standby time\nYour purchase will include a Cell Phone, Rechargable Battery, and Wall Charger.
