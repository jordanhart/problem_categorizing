{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HUGE safety gap with Kajeet Androids!", "Author": "LN", "ReviewID": "R20FZNQNGVP40L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded my daughter from a Kajeet Samsung 2700 to the LG Optimus and was totally disappointed to discover that turning on the phone's wifi circumvents Kajeet's Smart Blocker controls.  Wifi hotspots are easy to find (can you say, \"McDonald's\"?) and there's no way to close or password protect the phone's wifi functions, so if wifi is enabled your child will have unlimited access to everything available on the Web.  I've spoken to 3 or 4 Kajeet reps about it.  Most gave me a party line, which seems to be something about only being able to \"block or filter Web pages coming through our cell phone towers.\"  That makes zero sense for a content-driven filter.  I suspect it's more likely that Kajeet prefers that users only access data via their paid plans, rather than free wifi.  At any rate, one CS rep took the time to look up Web filtering apps that ARE actually content-based and so work with 3G and wifi.  Needless to say, I'm disappointed, because I've come to expect more from Kajeet and marketing their products as the \"Safest and Most Affordable Cell Phones for Kids\" isn't accurate.  I think I may actually have been better off going with a service like Virgin Mobile ($35 gets you 300 minutes of talk, plus unlimited messaging data) and downloading Web filters and the other parental controls myself.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone & service", "Author": "AmazonAficionado", "ReviewID": "R1HNM4V38C4DBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a dad of a young daughter who wanted a phone (not just any phone, a smartphone of course) and didn't really want to put her on my family plan. I needed more control on her usage and was afraid of her losing it. Kajeet (they use the Sprint network) seemed pretty legit, so I gave them a try and have definitely been satisfied thus far. :)I put the phone on an affordable monthly plan and love the free parental controls. The Optimus phone itself is pretty great and sturdy. I'm an iPhone user, and just playing around with the Android OS, I'm very tempted to switch over! I'd definitely suggest kajeet Optimus overall.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for Teens and Kids", "Author": "thwatkins2", "ReviewID": "R396SHD1OP5G80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recently purchased this phone for my 15 year old niece. She wanted an iphone and this was really similar. She likes the Android OS that the phone operates on and now doesn't even want an iphone. She loves it! She sends texts, can access the internet, and facebook.With kajeet, I only pay $14.99 for unlimited text and $24.99 for Data, which only makes her bill only $40 a month. That's waaay cheaper than my phone bill with AT&T; and it would have been much cheaper than adding her to my family plan. I really like the kajeet service, because I can block calls and texts from certain people, GPS the phone when I want to know where she is AND I can determine what times she is able to use the phone but always allow calls from myself, her mom, and a few other emergency contacts.Kajeet is great phone for kids. I even might get one myself, because the service plans are so cheap.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "EXCLUSIVE: Equipped with kajeet Smart BlockerTM technology that allows you to determine what types of websites can be accessed.\nThreaded text messaging display: lists text messages in an easy conversation format so you can see the entire conversation\n1.3 megapixel digital zoom camera\n3.2\" display with touch screen keypad\nSpeakerphone and Bluetooth\u00ae", "Name": "LG Optimus S  Android Prepaid Phone, Black (Kajeet)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Tb8tE1CLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0076P3GYY"}}
