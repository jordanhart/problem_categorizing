Dual Sim2. Simple to use if all you want is to dial, no browser feature (don't have a data plan anyway, its blocked).3. Music player (see con)4. Bluetooth5. Speakerphone very loudCons:1. Size, its kind of thick and lenght wise is about as long as my Motorola XT360 Android with keyboard2. Because its a simple phone, menu and features limited (what do you expect, an iphone competitior)3. Very limited instructions both in the box and even on their own website4. BT, but no voice command or dialing, again what would you expect for under $305. Downfall, it was almost perfect for a basic phone till the music player, major fail, since there is no audio plug, had to use bluetooth headsets.  The BT headsets works great with iPhone, iPod Touches.  However, when it came to the phone the quality is very poor. More like AM radio quality. Oh well.  Again, if camera, music is not your thing, this phone works great. No ATT bloatware or accidentally pressing the \"Net Key\" by mistake and get charged for \"internet/data\" use.Hints:To \"Activate Speed Dial\" (assigns a phone number to the keypad): Menu->Phonebook->7.Speed Dial->1.Status->On (yes, took me a while to figure it out.  You can assign the name/number through the contacts menu but each time I press and hold down the key, nothing happened until I went into the menu system to \"turn it on\".For manual keypad lock:Press the center of the d-pad (4 way directional pad - \"square pad right underneath the screen\"), yes the \"menu screen pops up\", but  then quickly press the \"*\" (star) key.  Its the same way to unlock it.Yes, these two pieces of information was NOT in the directions nor were they on the web site and could not find it online including google.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "inexpensive and very good dual sim phone", "Author": "eladbk", "ReviewID": "R26P42ROUTS7MV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good phone especially for those who travel because it can significantly reduce your costs abroad, has excellent battery, very simple menu (too simple - one might say poor), but for phone calls and text messages do not need anything better, there's also an FM radio with built antenna, which can be useful sometimes, and built-in lamp. All in all, more than expected for the price. The only criticism is a little delay when writing sms, but nothing to worry about, and that's all. I've tried many samsung dual sim phones, which are multiple expensive but none are good enough. So if you need a cheap and reliable dual sim phone my recommendation is that you consider this phone.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good basic phone", "Author": "lilgranma", "ReviewID": "RMS8RHW0CXC15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am pleased with the phone.  It has large numbers, pretty easy to navigate seeing it doesn't give you instructions.  I love the long life of the battery.  Had  it a few days shy of a month now and not had to charge the battery once. I would like more choices of ring tones since it only has two ring tones; but that is minor.  I couldn't figure out how to access my voicemail at first. It didn't have a number to access it so we tried putting in the AT&T; number my husbands phone showed and it worked.  All in all = its a good solid phone for the money.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for seniors.  Basic functions work great.", "Author": "Jung Y. Han \"Pungury\"", "ReviewID": "R2WVZYCFDZ4SNI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my father in law.  He uses T-Mobile pay-as-you-go plan.  He wanted a bar phone, big buttons, light, and easy to use phone.Ease of setup:  I charged it and put the old T-Mobile SIM card in to the first SIM slot (it has 2).  Turn the phone on, and it found the signal in 5 seconds and worked.SIM slot was little tight, but not bad at all.  The menu was not intuitive and the manual is not comprehensive.  To find out how to lock the keypad, I had to search the web.  Changing the ringtone and ringtone volume also was not easy to figure out.  Setting up clocks were pretty easy.  I give it 4 stars.Call quality:  Signal was stronger than his old T-Mobile phone.  He has a hearing problem, but did not have any problem hearing the ringtone and was able to hear the other person fine.  I give it 5 stars.Ease of use:  Just to send and receive phone calls, it is very straight forward.  Locking the keypad is little challenging because the middle navigate button really has 5 buttons hidden inside, you have to click the middle one then * key.  Could've been a little easier (like use the menu button and * button).  It has pretty decent size battery in it, so I am expecting it to last long time.  4.5 stars.Feature: The phone comes with only 2 ring tone (both are pretty lame).  It can use MP3 ringtones, but you will have to add them in.  It is not an easy task for technologically challenged people.  I love the built in flash light.  It can play FM radios.  If this phone was for me, I would give 4 stars for the features/price.  But for my father in law, not having extra built in ringtones, and not having physical volume control is major disappointment.  So 3 stars.  But flashlight adds another star.  So 4 stars.Overall, I would recommend this phone to someone who travels outside of US often, someone who wants a basic unlocked GSM phone.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm either the smartest man to buy this phone or the average user/consumer is a moron.", "Author": "Justin A. Wells", "ReviewID": "RDQFKZHI83N3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a cheap piece, perfect for travel. I was concerned at all the people that couldn't get it to work properly, no instructions, etc. I played with it for about 3 mins, figured out most features. I could care less about social networking, and anyone that complains about the quality of this phone or camera is just a moron. This is FOR MAKING CALLS! if you are thinking about getting this for your everyday phone.... i don't even know what to say. the cheapest virgin mobile is a million percent better for surfing, social media. This should be gotten for a cheap travel phone, if you lose it, no huge deal, you get a crappy camera, but its better than none and its on par with a camera phone that's 10 years old. The fm radio, long battery life, emergency camera, and flashlight really make this a great travel phone. So go take your vacation, quit complaining about how you can't twitter from your 30 dollar burner phone or go buy a 40 dollar virgin mobile phone that actually does stuff apart from being a phone. I'll be hanging in the rain forests of costa rica for a month, social media and the outside world besides calls to only close family and friends are going to be a nice thing to take a break from and just live life.PS. get a small capacity/cheap micro SD card, i found a really cheap 4gb one, that will hold about a bazillion photos, voice recordings, etc. (this camera could get away with like 128md or something tiny that probably doesn't even exist anymore.  if you don't get a micro SD, the camera and other items will be useless. cant save anything on phone, it has no memory.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good basic phone", "Author": "M1911 Guy \"m1911guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2B471N3LAFICB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good basic phone. good for overseas travel. the memory is very small basicly about 20 kbytes. on the phone. but you can add a mini sim card. and have tons of memory. but i did not by this phone for memory and music. thats why i have an ipod or regular cell phone. this is good for basic use. and works great in latin america.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the non-techie that wants a simple phone, long standby battery life.", "Author": "William J.

It also has a large battery.  There are two signal strength indicators and two missed call indicators, but only one voicemail icon.  I left a message on SIM-2 voicemail, and a TINY \"2\" appeared in the corner of the voicemail icon.  Next, I left a message on SIM-1 voicemail, and the TINY number changed to a \"1\".  I then left another message on the SIM-2 voicemail, but the TINY number still read \"1\".  Also a scrolling message appears near the bottom of the screen which says that you have voice mail, and tells you which SIM received the last message.  During a call on one SIM, I called the other SIM on the cellphone.  I did not hear any sounds to alert me of the incoming call, and nothing was indicated on the display.  I was unable to adjust the call volume.  I read a review somewhere that said you have to go into a menu somewhere to adjust it, but I searched high and low but could not find it.  I could not get the speed-dial to work right, and verified that it was set to \"ON\" in the menu.  The clock was not accurate.  Several times when it was turned on the clock would show an hour later, and then within an hour the minutes would be off by two minutes. The date has to be manually entered, and reads the non-standard day/month.  The color of the blue phone as pictured in the ads and on the box is not accurate.  The blue color phone is turquoise, which I did not like.  There are only two ringtones.  It comes with a small user manual in Spanish followed by English, which will require reading glasses to read.  It doesn't tell you much.  I bought this phone on sale at Newegg, but was shocked to find that they will refund only if the box is un-opened.  Now I'm stuck with it!
