I've been playing with it a bit and so far I'm really pleased with it.  We've hooked it up to the WalMart Family Mobile plan, which uses T-Mobile, so it appears to be truly unlocked, in case there was any concern there.  It uses Android 4.0.4 right out of the box, because I didn't update anything.  The screen is nice and fluid, and it's got more bells and whistles than I know what to do with.  I think he'll be really pleased.  I'd love to keep it for myself, and may end up buying another.The only, and I mean only, thing I didn't care for is the wall charger.  It appears to be for European use, which is fine, because it comes with an adapter for a US plug, but that adapter is terrible.  It doesn't fit snugly to either the wall outlet or the charger itself, which means it really won't charge the phone unless you hold it in place.  Of course, it charges from a computer with no problem, but if you're in the US then you'll probably want to buy a different travel charger for it.  Also, the little instruction book with mine is in French.  Which I guess means it really is an international phone, so that's a good thing.Oh, one other thing: if you're looking for an Otterbox for it, the Commuter series seem readily available, but the Defender series are more difficult to find.  These are different than what you'd use with the MAXX apparently.
