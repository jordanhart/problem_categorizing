{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Older Version of Droid, but a good purchase.", "Author": "Marlene Falco", "ReviewID": "R1COJ82RSXV2I5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung Galaxy S, the first one made and it was the best phone I have had, but I decided to upgrade bcuz it began having problems after the two years I had it and this was my upgrade or so I thought... After getting this phone I realized it was an older phone; the battery life sucks, freezes often, doesn't have screen shot, camera sucks, and it loads sooooo slow! The phone is reliable for calling and texting, but it isn't really all that. It would be a great phone for someone who doesn't use much internet, apps or calling and texting. Basically what I'm saying is if you hardly ever use your phone none of the problems will probably bother you, but I feel that this is one of the worst phones I've had and definitely a downgrade for me!!***Also sometimes this phone tends to not wanna make calls! I've pressed call several times and it wouldn't call the person but it'd let me text?!??!", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.95", "Features": "8GB Built-in Storage\n8 megapixels Camera Dual LED Flash, Video 1280x720 (720p HD) (30 fps)\nBuilt-in Facebook, Photobucket, Flickr, Picasa, Twitter\nDual core processor 1000 MHz\nLoudspeaker", "Name": "LIKE NEW VERIZON MOTOROLA DROID X2 MB870 8MP BLACK PHONE (WITHOUT CONTRACT)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31D8NVtlrCL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009EX813C"}}
