{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone - just don't get it with Verizon Wireless", "Author": "Zach Everson \"Writer. Editor. Consultant.\"", "ReviewID": "RUC3ECUZ2YVJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, as an early adapter, I guess I should be used to taking it hard. I bought Verizon's PalmOne Treo 600 the first day it came out - over a year after AT&T;, Sprint, and other comapnies released it. My plan is 400 anytime minutes, unlimited in-network calling, unlimited nights and weekend, and $5 for Internet access a month. Unless I go over, it should cost me $49.95 a month. I just got my first bill.$1,641.66.It turns out that the connection to the Internet doesn't shut off - even if you chose \"Disconnect\" from the web browser's menu. Even if you turn off the unit. It continues to ping the Internet looking for data every six minutes. Hence my bill show some 1023-minute calls.Steve in Verizon's data division said they've received a lot of calls on this issue and isn't sure why they even offer the $5 web-only feature, when customers need to get the $49.95/month unlimited data transfer or deal with $1,000-plus monthly bills. When I asked if there was a way to stop the pinging every six minutes, I was told no, \"it's a data phone first and a cell phone second.\"Interesting, as my friends who have the phone with other carriers have never had this problem. Interesting, as I was never told this when I bought it. All I wanted was a freakin' cell/PDA combo, so I don't have to carry both with me, making me look like I'm sporting a chubby in two pockets at once. With Verizon, the cost for doing so is $44.95 plus your calling plan a month, which for me will come to about $100.After 58 minutes, I was told my bill should be adjusted within 24 to 48 hours.Also, on Verizon Wireless's PalmOne Treo 600 Smartphone web page it lists a 5 MB transfer for only $24.95. When I asked the technical rep about that option, he said getting it would still cause a Treo 600 owner's bill to be over $1,000 a month. He said it was up there for use with other phones. He had no answer when I said there are no other phones on that page.Now, I probably could return the Treo 600 - except I already sold my old phone and Palm on eBay.Of course, if I could just get a free minute for every time I heard \"Oh, that's the new phone. I'm not familiar with it\" none of this would be an issue.Buy the phone from AT&T;, Sprint, Cingular, or another carrier and don't deal with the problems I had with Verizon Wireless.

Why?  Because at this moment its the best value for your money.  Sure, the 650 is better, but unless you want to lock yourself into a 2 year contract its going to cost significantly more.  Other comparable options cost similar to the 650.What I use it for: I'm a T-mobile customer and this phone is a) cheaper than the phone through T-mobile and b) is unlocked.  So when I'm in Europe this spring I can simply replace the SIM and go.  Note that this is the GSM model - it won't work on Verizon or Sprint.Pros: Syncing is effortless, scheduling software mimics Outlook 2003 perfectly.  Phone works great - good reception and sound quality.Cons: No bluetooth, no WIFI (the 650 lacks this as well).  Screen isn't hi res, camera quality is low (if you want quality get a digicam, I have a Canon S400).  Lets be honest - this is yesterday's technology.Unknowns: Reliability.  I've only had this phone for a few days, and we'll see how it stands the test of time.Conclusion: If you want the latest and greatest get the 650, Nokia 9300, or something else.  But you'll be paying that early adopter premium.  If you want something that elegantly does the job at a great price then get this.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone/pda!  (for about 6 months)", "Author": "Ryan M.", "ReviewID": "R1Y5PAX3WX85XM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As far as design and user-friendliness, I can't say enough about how great this phone/pda combo is.  I just wish it wasn't such a POS!I bought an unlocked Treo 600 directly from PalmOne.com about 1 year ago, as I travel internationally and didn't want the hassle of being limited to just one carrier's simcard.  It worked wonderfully for a few months, synched effortlessly with Outlook, and was a breeze to enter data into with the qwerty keyboard.  I loved trading in my Palm and old cell phone for one combined piece of equipment.  The only problem I had right from the beginning is that my earlobe (which must be a genetic abnormality, as I haven't seen any other mention of this problem) would line up just right with the \"hang up\" button on the touchscreen and would disconnect my calls.  I would finally realize it when my phone would ring loudly in my ear as the other person was already calling me back while I was still talking.  I can excuse this issue, however, and blame myself for apparently holding the phone at the wrong angle.  No problem.And yet... about 6 months into my ownership of the Treo 600, an extremely loud buzzing sound emerged on the other end of the line.  I couldn't hear it myself, but everyone I talked to asked if I was being electrocuted, or being run over by a train, or if I was standing on the runway instead of in the airport.  I called Palm and was obviously connected to Thailand or India or wherever the call center (which certainly wasn't a problem, just an observation) and they said this was a common problem and they'd be happy to send me a new one.  Great!  I got my \"new\" Treo very quickly with no charge for shipping, but was somewhat displeased to find out it was a refurbished phone and my old one I sent back was in better condition (as far as scratches on the body, screen clarity, etc.).  Anyway, I was so happy to get rid of the problematic one that I went along with it.  Now I wish I hadn't!About a month ago (just past the warranty expiration on the original unit, not sure it would even transfer to my refurbished one) the Treo's screen calibration kept becoming inaccurate.  I'd reset the calibration and not 10 minutes later it'd be off again.  It would get maybe 1 inch off calibration, so I'd intend to choose one calendar entry, and it would instead hit the button for Monday and skip to another day!  Or I'd attempt to pick 5pm and it would highlight the entry at 10am.  There was apparently no fix for this issue, even with hard resets, reinstallations of software, etc.I was pretty upset that within just over 1 year I was already trying to replace my second Treo.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I pawned it in Asia to a used cell phone vendor that was so desperate to get an American phone he didn't seem to care that the screen was misaligned, and now I'm here on Amazon purchasing a Blackberry...", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent Convergence Device", "Author": "chewbacca", "ReviewID": "R1XHV4O6A1ZME2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just like anything else...I guess a lot depends on our expectations before purchasing the device. With the Treo600 I expected some compramises in the pda functioning and cell phone features. This device does an excellent job in combining both in a neat package.

Good signal strength, clear calls (with Verizon NYC) My PDA software works seamlessly (epocrates, pediasuite, worldmate etc. I don't have much negative to say about this device.

It was a pain lugging both of them around and I wanted a device that had both a PDA and phone in one plus e-mail and web browsing capabilities like a Blackberry.  A tall order but this phone nearly pulls it off.Palm users will have no trouble using the familiar PalmOS apps that we've all come to know and love such as Calendar, To-Do List, and Memo Pad.  The 4-way navigation button makes it faster and easier to navigate than using the touchscreen although I do find myself whipping out the stylus every now and then.  There is no graffiti input on this PDA instead you must use either the qwerty keyboard or touchscreen which have their own inherent difficulties.  The tiny keyboard buttons are hard to press and often results in typos.  Its slower than using the touchscreen keyboard and definately not ideal for writing long e-mails and such.  The touchscreen on this phone is not as forgiving as the one on my old Handspring Visor.  You have to be extremely gentle when weilding the stylus because even a small amount of pressure can cause yellow spots to form on the LCD screen.  I use the touchscreen occassionally with great care and with a protective cover on the screen and yet I still got a faint yellow spot on the LCD within days.  For me this is the most dissappointing thing about this phone.As a phone the Treo 600's performance is mediocre to average at best.  It gets horrible reception indoors.  People often complain about static when I'm inside buildings.  Poor reception is also accompanied by a loud, annoying buzzing noise that both people on the line can hear.  I looked it up on the web and discovered through  user reviews that this was an all-too-common problem amongst many Treo 600 users.  When it does get good reception, however, the call quality is superb even better than my Moto Razr.  The speakerphone is nice and loud although it can be hissy sometimes.But my favorite feature by far is the ability to send and receive e-mail.  Using the Snappermail app (the built-in mail app isn't very good), I can seamlessly link up to my Gmail account and use push e-mail just like on a Blackberry.  Plus, its a lot cheaper to use T-zones for e-mail and Internet access on a Treo than the Internet/E-mail plans offered by T-mobile for Blackberrys.All in all, this is a phone I can live with for the time being although I am ever so-concerned about the LCD screen going bad with use.  The fragile screen, hard to use keypad, and subpar phone are the only real drawbacks of this phone but they are serious enough that anyone thinking of getting this phone should give it a good, hard second look.  I've heard the Treo 650 has fixed some of these problems and if that's true I would definately consider it over the 600.  I do plan to upgrade to another smartphone in a few months when my contract expires such as T-Mobile MDA or Treo 650.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "3rd try = Junk", "Author": "Aj \"Aj\"", "ReviewID": "R3NAHNHHVSRT4W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the 3rd piece of junk treo i have been given.

I had a treo 270 some time ago - but dropped it and it was not worth repairing.There is no comparison between the two- and I think the palm Os is better.

It has all of the functionality of my palm device, plus the wireless phone and internet access.  I really got tired of managing over 200 contacts on a cell phone - entering information using a phone dialing pad. Now I can enter contacts from my Outlook Contacts folder and hot-sync my phone with my laptop.  Buying the phone unlocked enabled me to just pop in my existing SIM and use the phone with my provider (Cingular).Here are the reasons I didn't give this phone 5 Stars (you can judge how important they are to you):1) Lack of bluetooth2) Camera is ok at best - don't use it for graduation photos :-)3) Low screen resolution (still good and usable, but res could be better)4) Not graffiti enabled (although I purchased third party software [Jot] that works great).If items 1, 2, and 3 are a problem to you, then you might want to try the Treo 650, which costs a little more, but addresses those shortcomings.  I am happy with the 600.  It has been worth the money so far.  ONE WARNING:  If you purchase the unlocked phone, be careful downloading firmware updates from the PalmOne website.  After performing an update, my phone locked and I couldn't use the phone with my Cingular SIM.

Although I list more cons than pros here, I really do like the phone a lot, and I would recommend it (4 stars).  The cons are minor things that I think would be a nice addition, and some people might find it helpful.Pros:- Combines a phone, MP3 player, and PDA in a nice package that fits in my hand.  All three have functioned very well for me.- QWERTY keyboard (though it is a bit small)- PalmOS (standard PDA OS; easy to synchronize with your computer)Cons:- No bluetooth (not a big deal for me)- No WiFi- Audio quality (phone is so-so, MP3 is decent)- Low-resolution screen (650 is high-res)- Requires special adapter for listening to MP3s (you can't simply get a 2.5mm-to-stereo adapter from RadioShack.  Otherwise the phone uses its speakers to play the music)- The camera is pretty much useless at VGA-quality, and don't even bother taking indoor pictures.I would also recommend getting the following accessories:- ZipLinq retractable USB sync cable (~$30; also charges the phone)- Seidio earbuds/headphones (~$30; made for Treos, you can listen to music with this one)- SD memory card (for MP3's)- a case (under $30 - if you don't want to keep it in your pocket)- PDANet software ($30 - allows you to use the phone as a wireless modem if you have Internet access in your phone plan)One last thing is, you can get a pretty decent GPS unit for another $150.", "Date": "January 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Palm not supporting it's product", "Author": "Said Boukkouri", "ReviewID": "RHPP5S35MS3DI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working.

It's weird that they all come one right after the other.  If I was a suspicious type...but I'm not.  Maybe there was a bad manufacturing run, or some people just had real bad luck, but my experience has been excellent.  As long as I'm on the subject of negative reviews - I've got tons of third party software loaded and this treo is more stable than the Windows XP desktop that I'm typing this review on.  It does crash, but, very, very infrequently.In fact, this has been the best piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned.  I've had it since the month it was released, and I'm still using it all day, every day, even up to now.I've used it with two different carriers - first Cingular and then T-Mobile.  It has had excellent reception, (better than my wife's Nokia), from both carriers.And it is pretty rugged.  I've dropped it: 5 or 6 times - on concrete at least twice.  It's chipped up, but still works the same as the day I bought it.I bought a 1 gig SD Card, and I carry around a lot of music.  So much that I never use my iPod anymore.  I also joined [...]and I have room for one or two spoken-word books too.On the large internal memory I have eBooks, games, business applications, docs, spreadsheets, a video player, more games, and did I mention games?The phone and PIM functions are smoothly integrated and email is a breeze.My company gave me a RIM BlackBerry 7510 phone + email device.  It is absolutly primitive compared to the Treo 600.The Treo's screen is super bright, easily visible even in bright sunlight.  I love the fact that I have a keybord on the phone even if I don't use it all the time.  I installed a thirdparty application that lets me write Graffiti style right on the touch sensitive display.The fact that it is a Palm device means it is as configurable as you want it to be.  There are tens of thousands of software applications and upgrades available.So, in summary, in one pocket I carry a great phone, a fine chess partner, a calendar, my contact lists, a memo/note pad, an ebook-reader and half a dozen ebooks, an Audible player and a couple of audio books, an MP3 player and a bunch of songs, a fantasy role playing game, a backgammon game, poker and a solitaire card games, an MS Word doc reader, the \"Bejeweled\" game, a midi music sequencer, an email application, a world alarm clock/timer, a space conquest game, an investment calculator, and 10 or so more things (mostly games).I LOVE this phone. And it is unlocked, so I was able to change carriers with no hassel - if you've done this recently you will appreciate that this is no small thing.So, you may be wondering, \"is this guy just going to gush?  Isn't there anything you don't like about the phone?\"Well yes, in fact, the camera sucks. It is better than nothing and I have had occasion to use it a few times, but it is low resolution, somewhat distorting and useless in anything but well lit situations.I'd still say it was the best, most useful piece of electronics I'd ever owned, even if there were no camera.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy a TREO", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R199XJSYVHUMKT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had such faith in this phone when I first bought it.  Now that I am 7 treo phones later and it only being a year and a half....I have to say that this is the worst high end purchase I have ever gotten.  In the beginning all of the reviews were wonderful from consumer reports and gadget blogs and electronic magazine reviews.  However none of these publications seems to have let consumers know the truth about the horrible quality of these phones.  As a pda they function fairly well but as a phone...the signal is always dropping (that is if there is a signal). Friends and family claim it is hard to hear what I was saying when using the phone and that it sounded like  I was in a tunnel. Hearing what other people were saying was difficult.  i would have to go outside to try to get a better signal just to hear what was being said.  I purchased my phone through Amazon to use with Sprint.  I invested in the monthly warranty to replace the phone.  This seemed like a good plan until I realized that they were replacing my phone with refurbished phones that had the same problems as the handset that I had just given them.  When my final sixth phone was replaced by Sprint I made a call to a friend from the parking lot to ensure that it worked before I left the store (I had learned by this point).  Five minutes later yelling into the phone and trying to call back 3 times with no success (and no...the mute was not on).  Realizing that I had yet another dud on my hands I went back into the Sprint store to take out the poor 16 year old clerk that had the misfortune of replacing my handset five minutes prior.  Apparently he had a panicked look on his face since he was waiting on customers who had just decided to get...you got it, a Treo 600.  Well he quickly summoned his manager who decided to give me a brand-new never been opened treo 650 free.  So yes I did get an upgrade free for all of my trouble.  It is not much better than the treo 600.  The signal is weak and it is hard to hear on both ends and when on vibrate mode the calls get sent straight to voicemail.  Convenient for emergencies I would say.  I live in Arizona but I sure do wish that I lived in California since there is currently a class-action suit against palm-one and the various cell phone carriers of the treo 600 and 650 for the poor quality of the product and replacing handsets with equally poor treos.  At this point since the treo 700 just was released, it probably is not on the class action suit.  However the treo 700 does run on a  windows operating system which will make your palm os software from your treo 600/650 obsolete. It will also make it morevulnerable to viruses and lets not forget that little trick of being able to erase a bluetooth devices address book when someone has bluetooth enabled, Also there is the ability to tap into peoples' conversations that they are having with their wireless blue-tooth headset.  (not that I do it but I'm sure that some people are actually enjoying rush hour much more due to this security flaw).  Overall I would say that palm-one as a company has gone downhill in terms of quailty and customer service and that both the treo 600 and 650 are phones that I would not waste your time or money on.", "Date": "February 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Treo is Total Junk !", "Author": "B.

I've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out.  I agree with many of these reviewers that the Treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc.  But it is completely unreliable.  I'm currently on my 3rd 600.  Each one died a hideous death after about 6 months.  First the normal phone speaker died.  So Handspring replaced it for free.  Six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when I was traveling.)  So again handspring replaced it.  About 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned.  This time when I called for a new one I was informed by Palm that, \"We don't replace phones for free any more.  It will cost you $200 to get a replacement.\"  So basically Palm's business model is:  we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry.  It's unbelieveable.  So I thought I'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability).  But Palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 !  I said, \"Wait a minute, Handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if I'd send my old one back.\"  But I was informed that Palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore.  What a joke.So I wrote a letter to the CEO of Palm to complain.  That was 5 months ago.  No response or acknowledgement.

The phone gets excellent reception; whereas I've heard many people in my town complain about getting poor service on their cell phones, I have never been unable to place a call on my Treo or been cut off during the middle of a conversation.  Those unfamiliar with the Palm OS will find it wonderfully easy to navigate and to configure.  Furthermore, there is a vast and diverse array of progams one can download for the Palm OS, ranging from games, e-texts and MP3 player software to business applications, medical references and legal dictionaries.  I originally had some qualms about the fact that the Treo had a keyboard instead of the graffiti system to which I was accustomed, but I've come to prefer the keyboard.  I can write with the Treo keyboard much more quickly and conveniently than I could write with the graffiti system on other Palm Pilots.  That being said, those who prefer graffiti to the keyboard can always download programs that enable one to write with graffiti directly onto the screen.  Also, I've found the Palm Portable Keyboard (sold separately) to be very helpful and easy to use when I need to write more than a few lines, and I would recommend purchasing that item as well.  My heart goes out to other reviewers who have found their Treos to be fragile, but I cannot claim to have had the same experience.  My Treo has gone everywhere with me during the past year and has hardily withstood much wear and tear during that time.  I've dropped it a few times without any consequences.  Furthermore the screen is as bright and easy to see now as it was when I first got it.  The camera part of the phone is admittedly lacking in quality.  On the rare occasion when I need to use my Treo to take a picture of something, I make sure to take several different pictures on the theory that at least one will turn out as a passable representation of what I was trying to photograph.  But the Treo's advantages as a phone, a Web browser, a word processor and a PDA far outweigh any inadequacies the camera presents.  In summary, my Treo is easily one of the best electronic items I've ever owned, and I would highly reccomend it over any other phone and any other PDA.", "Date": "April 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wait for something better", "Author": "Priscilla Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R1WKX0WHVJZ9V0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I sync my Treo with my apple computer and have no problems (you'll need the \"missing sync\" software). The Treo itself has some issues that have disappointed me, however:Like all PDA Operating Systems (OS's), including Windows, they tend to crash a lot. What I've discovered is that this OS is extremely stable but only when I load the right programs. It's like driving a car, but only down certain streets, or you'll fall off a cliff. It's hit-or-miss adventure; you'll have to load programs one at a time and after a few days, see if they created any problems or crashes. If not, then you should have no issues with crashes; then go ahead and load the next one. If you experience problems, you can delete it and it will resolve the crash issue. But not being able to use a program (especially a much needed one) is very disappointing and a downfall for some users like me. This hugely limiting factor seems to make my Treo resemble more of an expensive organizer. Some folks simply live through the PDA crashes but I can't adjust to it. You need to count on some good luck and hope a program will not cause problems. The good news is that the few times it has crashed, I never once lost my data and could go on using my PDA as before. This is important if you're not near your computer for a sync. You simply unscrew the tip of the stylus to reveal a pin that you can use to hit the tiny \"reset\" button. The Treo re-boots with all my data, contacts & calendar intact.Bluetooth: The lack of bluetooth is also a bummer. I did not think I would need bluetooth, but now realize its usefullness. As technology improves, this Treo is at a disadvantage.Phone contacts: You can easily pop in your sim card but you can't save or utilize the phone book on your sim card. You'll have to either import your contacts from your computer or type it into the phone manually. This is not a good feature if you pop your sim card between different phones.Internet: Good colors & graphics, but connection is slow. A real pain to type quickly with the thumb keyboard.Portability: This Treo is quite bulky and heavy. It's not one that you can simply throw in your pocket and go hang out in the park with. It gets in the way and fits better in your handbag or briefcase. But then you might not hear the phone or feel it vibrate, which is defeating.Photos: The quality of the pictures are not very good. You can easily set the phone to display a picture of your caller, but that's not a remarkable feature.Graffiti: You can't write graffiti style on the screen. You have to use the thumb keyboard or type it in with the sylus.To Do List: If you accidently tap the box next to a To-Do-List item, it will delete your note and sometimes you can't undo the action, so be careful.For most of these issues, there are folks selling third party solutions. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.There are some pluses: the Treo is a quad-band phone. I use T-Mobile in NYC and get great reception. I also travel all over the world to places like India, Egypt, & West Africa and call home with perfect reception. It has a never ending \"call-log\" that has helped me in many ways. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.Personally, I think this Phone/PDA is too expensive, too heavy and needs some upgrading. The PDA/phone market is slowly improving but it needs a lot of work. If you must buy this Treo, keep a small cellphone nearby so you can pop in your sim card and throw the cellphone in your pocket when you want to travel light. Otherwise, you'll be tied down to the Treo's bulkiness when you don't need it.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Never again...", "Author": "Honeybee", "ReviewID": "RU3Y2OMZVGB92", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for 8 months and since then Palm had replaced my Treo 600 4 times.
