The Desire came out on or near the top with the professional reviews as well as customer reviews. After realising that it met most of my requirements I decided to pull the trigger and purchase. After about a month with it I realised that I was even more impressed with its abilities than what I read. It just ran very smoothly and did everything as advertised and more; the screen is gorgeous, the processor keeps up the pace. I'm certainly no expert so I won't get into the technical details.The are a few negatives I can mention and for me they are very minor. Firstly there is the battery life which is about a day and a half with average usage. The other issues are the battery cover, which feels like it will break any moment when you are taking it off, but once on feels secure enough and lastly the camera would have been helped with the inclusion of an image stabilizer, but as I said these are very minor issues ford me.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Android Device", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "R29FNHS925RWM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is my first android device. I used to own a Blackberry Bold 9000 before this. It was a great device but really lacked a good browser, apps and multimedia functions. The HTC desire has a really great sense interface. It is said the sense interface is one of the best out of all the other android phones. Another great thing about the sense interface is that you have the option of switching it off if you dont like it. The desire is very fast and sleek. I have just been using it on the 2.1 and have not tried it with 2.2 froyo yet. The screen is absolutely stunning for photos, videos and web browsing. I really enjoy being able to view flash websites with stock browser which allows flash lite sites you can also download skyfire beta browser from the marketplace to view full flash websites and videos/games. The build quality of the phone is top notch. I really like the addition of the physical buttons like the menu, back, search and home. Also its nice to have a optical track pad and led notifications a few things I enjoyed from my blackberry. Call quality and reception are good. My only complaint is the speaker phone which is not so great for calls but is good for music and videos.My 2 main dislikes about the phone are: battery life which doesn't seem to last the whole day, I am told that 2.2 may improve this and also the internal memory for apps. The phone only has about 150 megs this is suppose to be better after 2.2 also since you can install some apps to the memory card with 2.2.Unfortunately after owning this phone for only 3 weeks, I started to have issues with proximity sensor and light sensor. If I was placing a call the screen would just lockup and remain blank after I pulled it away from my face. I wasnt able to end the call, change to speaker phone or enter any numbers. I tried many trouble shooting techniques like resetting the phone, trying different apps like shake awake and no lock but nothing helped. I also made sure I wasnt using a case or screen protector. Finally went to the wireless store where I purchased the phone and they have sent the phone to get repaired. I hope this is issue will be fixed once it is repaired. I have found many forums online where people had the same issue as I did. Its too bad since I really did like my phone.Update: I recently got my phone back from repair from the carrier which I bought it from outright which is Telus, although I am with Rogers. The phone seems to work fine now, Ive had it for about 2 weeks now since the repair. I have also upgraded to the HTC stock 2.2 RUU update and the phone works even better now. With the recent update my phone can now shoot 720p video, be used as a mobile hotspot, I am able to store apps on the memory card and the web browser has 10.1 adobe flash support. I am extremely happy with my phone now. Although their are still 2 man gripes I have which are not having enough battery life (I use wifi when at home to save battery and turn on 2G/edge when not home) and the app memory. Although 2.2 froyo does support storing apps on the memory card the app developer has to write this in the coding of the app in order for you to store the app on the sd card. Also when the app is stored on the sd card the whole memory of the app is not stored on the sd card a portion of the app memory is still stored on the internal device memory. I have found a work around (a hack available online) so that most apps can be stored on the memory card except for widgets and apps that run in the background. But again the whole app memory is not stored on the sd card. The only way to do this is root your phone and then partition your sd card so that it can be used completely for app memory. I plan on rooting my phone soon so I can take advantage of this. It is still too bad that HTC only provided around 138 megs of internal memory for the Desire and that we have to root our phone in order to gain more app memory. In this respect the iPhone is way better than the HTC Desire.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Device in theory, but...", "Author": "Chris S. Walker", "ReviewID": "R9R3Z3KMYLIPZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The HTC Desire is a great phone, when it works.  I ordered this phone from FGS Trading so that I could have it as i travel overseas (I was recently deployed to Middle East with the military).  The only thing is, I am one of the hundreds of folks who got an HTC Desire with the bad motherboard that makes the phone do random reboots (Google it for HTC Desire).  If I talk on the phone for more than a few minutes, \"reboot\".  If I use the internet for more than a few minutes, \"reboot\".  If I use the GPS even for one second, \"reboot\".Of course, I tried factory resets.  I tried anything I could try using the HTC Forums.  I discovered that there were many others like me who were experiencing the random reboots, and the ugliest part of the problem is that the phone doesn't reboot once and start back up... it continues in an endless reboot cycle until I hav eot open up the phone a take the battery out.  While I was in the Middle East, I couldn't readily take it in for a repair.  I had to wait to get back to the States. In December, I tried contacting FGS for help, and I got this response by email:****************I am sorry to hear this. This is the first i hear about the random reboot problem, but HTC would be the best bet to support the device at this point. If it's a motherboard problem, a warranty replacement would be best (if it was a software issue, a firmware upgrade would help, but it sounds like all the other people you checked with point to the motherboard).Please let us know if HTC was able to assistHappy holidays, and stay safe!****************Yeah, Happy Holidays...  Well, HTC said that they couldn't help me, and not being able to do much from my deployed location, I got my sister to send me a Nexus S (which I love).  Now that I'm back in the U.S., I have been trying to get HTC, FGS, and anyone else to help me, but to no avail.  Here's what i get from FGS:***************HelloThere is not much we can do at this point, since we are not the end user. HTC does not offer warranty support for resellers, they usually ask resellers to accept returns during the first 14 days, and then after that end users are asked to contact them directlyEmma***************I tried calling HTC in the UK and Germany, and from them, I found out the the phone's IMEI is from Vodafone.  So now I've been calling Europe to Vodafone Customer Service, and I keep getting passed off to different folks who give me the runaround.  I'm at the end of my rope.If you think that you may want service for your phone, do not buy from FGS Trading.  You will be out of your hard earned money with no support.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "htc phone", "Author": "d-dark-knight", "ReviewID": "R2L4W2ASKQSM4U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "hi, i am interested in buying this htc desire international $199. aam i going to have problem so i dont send it back to you....and how do i email/send u a message?", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad battery life, bad browsers, often doesn't remember settings, awful", "Author": "techdipu", "ReviewID": "R1ORM4F9PWYYLA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had an iphone and wanted to get a android device, HTC was supposed to make the best Android and their Desire HD looked really appealing. SO bot it for around 800SGD and made the biggest mistake.Here  are the few of the bads-1. If you are out on a street and look at the map which I have to  do a lot, within 30mins the phone will be dead from full battery life. And in stand by mode even I dont us the phone I will have to charge it twice everyday to keep it on. Most often it turns itself off and people can't reach me.2. The browser is clumsy, it doesn't render pages right and the touch operation is awful. To fill in the text field of a form it does all funny things.. it will tey to zoom in to that specific field and will not zoom back, if you try to move around with touching the finger it will take you in a blank space of the browser, it will not do automatic screen rotation even after shaking the device for 2-3 times, if you think you had enough it will not close after tapping the home button many times!3. Doesn't remember the settings of face book. email, alarm or weather...  and as it turns of frequently, I have to keep doing it several times a day... and its a new phone 1 month old.4.

I think it is time for a review!I love this phone there is just no other way to say it. I think it is stylish and I couldn't in all honesty live without it anymore.Pros:* Thousands of apps are available o the Android Market. I know you have more on the iPhone but how many apps do you want at any one time? I have more than I need.* My life is finally organized. I use the phone for its intended purpose and use the Google services that can be integrated with it. My Calendar is Google and synchs with my online Calendar. I can then be reminded of birthdays I've forgotten wherever I am. I'm also notified of new emails, and I can respond instantly.* It's very accessible, I can make fonts bigger in apps, zoom in on the browser and with my eyesight, that is essential.* Love the HTC Sense.* Love the fact that when I got bored of HTC Sense I tried other ROMS  and got even MORE customization capabilities.* ...and when I got bored of that I put Sense back on* It's constantly updatable. I feel I have a new phone every few months when I change things around.Cons:* I ran out of space on the phone memory quite often. To solve this I only had the apps I needed and then changed the ROM when I felt I needed more. Of course I then realized I didn't need all those extra apps and moved back to Sense.Why do I love this phone so much?Because I don't feel I need a new phone each year. Because I can change the look easily. I have to say, it feels like a new phone every couple of months. It's fast and does everything I need.
