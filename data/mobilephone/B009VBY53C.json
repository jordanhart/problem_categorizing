They worked fine for a while then we both started having constant issues with the sd card suddenly unmounting itself, messages saying the sd card is blank, or other random error problems involving the sd card. Some research on the internet shows that apparently several of LG's Optimus phones have this problem but of course there has been no acknowledgment by either LG or the network providers. No fixes or updates have been issued to resolve the problem. We will NOT buy any more LG phones - this was our first and last.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needs more memory error.", "Author": "Laurie Madelle", "ReviewID": "R2ZIG2WI015KXS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in Oct 2012 and I like the phone but around April I started getting a message that I need more memory so I bought the 32 GB memory card since this is the maximum it will take and that didn't solve the problem.  I still get message not enough memory.  I tried to transfer my contacts to the memory card to free up space but it doesn't work,  I called straight Talk and I was told after 30 minutes of trying this and that, that there is something wrong with the memory card and to buy a new one.  I can't bring it back because I don't have all the packaging and it was almost $30 for it.  So I've been looking for another phone.  Other than the memory problem I really liked this phone.  I have had 3 straight talk phones now and I notice they don't seem to last like phones used to 10 years ago.  The phones now are made cheap.  I used to keep my phones for years until I got sick of them. Now I buy one every year.  I don't want a contract phone because they charge twice as much for the same service.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R1C9GZGMKVN6RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like this phone more than any phone I have had, have great service through Verizon towers.

I basicly wanted a phone to talk and text.  I do not use the web much.  Only thing is the battery life is horrible,  I had to buy a replacement.

It was the best touch screen prepaid u could just about fine at the time. To slove the space problem you have to download a app killer or else u will have unnecessary apps running in the background. Also word to the wise any time you can use wifi do so the phone runs a lot faster for downloading. Also beware of charging the phone and sitting it on or under certain materials. Sometimes it will get very very hot while charging!
