Sapiens \"Amanda\"", "ReviewID": "R3RVDC7XEIZTPY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a basic phone with the added plus of having a SPEAKERPHONE. Unfortunately though the speakerphone seems rather staticky compared to turning it off (so it is not really a reception thing).Another plus is an external volume control. However, this is on the side of the phone. For me, it is right where I hold the phone, so I seem to be turning the volume up and down a lot unintentionally.There are only two very bad games. There are a couple pictures on the phone. There is a calendar, alarm clock, timer, and voice recorder (which is nice).It is small, but the keys are well placed. It is not hard to use at all.BATTERY CHARGE TIME - FAST! It fully charges in about 2 hours. Unfortunately, after 1 day and 3 calls (all under 5 minutes) it is already showing less than half charged. So, I think the battery life may be less than indicated. But, still better than my ancient Nokia.BUT, POOR, POOR, POOR reception. I am SHOCKED! I thought at first it could be the carrier (T-mobile). To test this, I stuck the SIM card into my old (3 years old) Nokia. Well, on the samsung I had no service to 1 bar but not enough to complete a call - on the Nokia I had 3 bars! I placed a call, and no static! Sheesh! So, no, not the carrier - it is the phone.If you search the CNET reviews for the Samsung X475 you will see it has poor reception as well. I took a gamble and hoped this was updated on the 495. But, I guess not.It is an attractive phone. I like that the time, date, day of the week, battery remaining, and signal strength are all displayed when the phone is closed. But, since I got the phone to actually make/receive CALLS not tell me the time of day, I have to rate it accordingly.I am going to return the phone and maybe try the Motorola V330 or something else with some kind of antenna.", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great phone if what you want is a great phone.", "Author": "IPLoya", "ReviewID": "R16IMFUE1MB5UX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When deciding how many stars to give this phone, I decided it really depends on your frame of reference.  If you are lining up all the phones currently in production, then you can arrange them in ascending order based on a number of factors.  The factors we use to judge a phone naturally include the number of features.  So in our hypothetical lineup, there are certainly other phones with more features, and those are likely to occupy some of the top spots.  BUT, another way to judge a phone is to ask how well the phone measures up against what it purports to be.  This phone has no camera, no bluetooth, and no email client.  If those are the features you are looking for, then this is not a 5 star phone.  However, this phone, to me, makes a statement abot its intended purpose by virtue of its selective inclusion -- and exclusion -- of features.  While it doesn't have all the bells or whistles in today's spectrum of wireless gadgets, what it DOES do well is act as a phone.  And in that context, it is a great PHONE -- having those features you would likely want in a device for making and receiving calls.  A large, easily readable screen font; a very lightweight housing (made lighter, no doubt, by not including extras like a camera lense); nice key layout with excellent tactile feedback (i.e. the buttons are easy to find and press, and feel good doing so); pretty good menus; excellent color display that can be viewed well even outdoors; a very solid feeling flip (the hinge is strong and pivots smoothly); teriffic battery life; and the phone comfortably cradles your face with it's angled v-shape when open.  Although I don't need a camera, I DO prefer to be able to sync with my numerous phone contacts on my PC.  I would have liked bluetooth for this reason, but a cable and software is available that I am going to try -- I will be satisfied using a cable interface if I can get some good syncing between the phone and PC.  Overall, I am conservatively rating the phone 4 stars, because the sky's the limit when it comes to gadgets, and in today's ever-evolving gadget marketplace it is hard to call anything perfect.

Thier entry-level sucsess started with the e105 several years ago. The e105 spwanned the award-winning e series phones (e105, e315, e317, e335, etc). Now, Samsung's x series has another winner. The x495 and its Cingular twin the x497, is a well designed phone that has basic features in a small package. The screen is well sized and vibrant and the menus are intuitive. Voice quality is average, but the speaker is nice and loud, a rarity these days. The flip is burly and seems durable. The exterior screen is informative and easy to read. Speakerphone is average and doesn't stand out in any particular way. The phone is compact and the keypad is easy to use. T9 predictive text is not my favorite (I prefer iTap), it is better than having no ptext program. T-Mobile is great, blah, blah, blah. They have great customer service and the best reception in my area. Their family plan is better than ever now, since they have added more minutes and lowered the additional line cost to $7.99 from $9.99 per additional line.In other words this phone has any basic feature you could want and it just works!(By the way, this phone is my backup for my Moto RAZR.

The messenger service quit working on the first one I had. When going to use the messenger feature, the phone would shut off on it's own & turn back on by itself. Luckily it was just days before the store warranty was to expire so I took it back & exchanged it for another of the same model. Well the store I purchased & returned it to only had three models to choose from, the Nokia 6010 and the newer Nokia which cost more than I could afford. So I exchanged it for a new Samsung x495 and this one is having problems as well. I just got it a couple days ago. The phone shuts off on it's own which is not a good thing because I use the alarm feature to wake me up. The messenger service on both of these phones is poor. When I type a message, the screen freezes. It does have poor reception, even when trying to send a text message. Alot of times the texts will fail to go through and if your using the T-Mobile to go service like I am, you still get charged 10 cents whether or not the text actually goes through or not. It costs 10 cents just to log into messenger and even more if you are able to send messages without the screen freezing up on you. The games,the wallpaper and the ringtones that are already on this phone when you purchase it are really bad. I do have to say that the phone looks really nice but that's the only good thing about it.

The phone was stylish and full of features but broke in a couple of months... therefore I've concluded expensive phones aren't worth the trouble and decided to stick with cheap, basic phones.  This phone was free with a 2yr contract (I'm on a family plan so ended up getting 4 of these).  First of all this phone is VERY BASIC, with no camera, bluetooth, and/or mp3 player, etc.  Most people do NOT use all of the features mentioned above so it may not be worth paying for those extras.  The phone is easy to use/set-up, which is the case with most Samsung phones (Motorolas on the other hand, are not very intuitive).  The battery life is pretty good (so far, I've had it for about a month) and last about 2 days with \"normal\" use, which means couple few minutes calls a day.  It has basic features like alarm, memo, and calendar for events.  The color scheme is somewhat feminine in my opinion but others may differ.  I don't recommend getting aftermarket covers since they are much lower quality than the factory part.  The phone comes with handsfree earpiece which works decent, but does not come with a car charger.  The reception is slightly worse than my old phone, which was a Samsung E720....... the previous phone was t-mobile so the generally weaker reception quality has to be attributed to this phone.

Of course with a new or extended contract you can easily get a new flip phone these days for a small fraction of that price.  With the Motorola V-Razor phones burning up the cell phone market now, it really leaves little left for the other guys, even Nokia has struggled to keep up with their biggest rival with the new Motorola \"Razor Craze\".Someone at Cingular recommended this Samsung x497.  To be honest I didn't even consider a Samsung flip phone.  I knew little about Samsung as a flip phone maker, only that it seemed overshadowed by its bigger brothers, Motorola and Nokia.  But I figured what the hell and decided to go with the x497.  Imagine my great surprise and shock when I opened the box and saw a very sturdy, solid-looking phone.  Once fully-charged, the x497 opens up to a bright, vivid screen.  Buttons and controls are solid without the least bit of \"wiggly jiggly\" feeling you get with other flip phones.  This one looks and feels like it can last several years and probably withstand some brutal drops onto the sidewalk (not that I will try it to prove my theory !)Reception and clarity are FANTASTIC !!  In the two weeks I've owned this phone, I've experienced maybe one dropped call and that was in a hilly area where all other phones had similar problems.  Speakerphone volume and clarity also are amazing.  I've read so many reviews and complaints from other Amazon users that speakerphone volume seems to be a big problem on many models.  Well, not this one.  I really had NO expectations for the Samsung and this one definitely is a KEEPER !Now the Cons -- It does not come with a camera or Bluetooth, but for me, those issues don't matter.  I am not someone who absolutely HAS to have a camera regardless whether I use it or not.  I know several friends who have to have a camera phone because it is the \"IN\" thing right now and all their friends and relatives have it.  Jeez !!  If these are not necessities to you, then it may not be a drawback.The other CON may be its size.  It's a bit on the small side if you are a big guy with big hands (like me), but I've gotten used to it and now actually like its size so it can easily fit into my pockets or held easily in one hand.Anyway, if you are looking for a SOLID phone with equally solid looks, feel, and performance, I HIGHLY Recommend this Samsung x497.  At first I thought the phone was a bit on the small side, but it easily falls into your pant pockets, but still big enough for you not to lose or misplace.  I've only begun to start tapping into its many features, but still performance is the key factor.Again, if not having a camera isn't an issue, you will be pleasantly SURPRISED by this Samsung x497 (only thru Cingular), but I imagine its twin brother x495 (for T-Mobile customers) would perform likewise.Bravo, Samsung !!

And the way things are set up inside the phone's systems are totaly counter-intuitive--it offers to edit numbers I want to call and call numbers I want to retrieve information on. Plus the little \"T-Zones\" button is totally annoying and puts me onto the internet everytime I breath on it! Oh and I found the battery life ot really be unsatifactory--when the battery is low--the phone gives you only a minute or two of warning before shutting down completely.  I'm going back to Kyocera as soon as possible!

The speakerphone works great and everything on the phone is VERY easy to use.The only thing I do not like about the phone is that the reception is not as good as it could be, perhaps because there is no antenna?  This doesn't bug me much though because the cell phone I had before this one was a Motorola with an antenna and the phone was HORRIBLE.  After only 2 days use the phone messed up and I could not hear anyone on it.  I will NEVER get a motorola again!Samsung is great if you're looking for a simple yet nice looking phone! :)", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Bad sound if reception is weak", "Author": "Mommy of 2", "ReviewID": "R3N9HPM9U9HI2N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not too imporessed. I've had the phone for 5 days now. I had a Nokia 6800 before this that would give good sound (hearing people, people hearing you) even if the signal was weak (one or two bars). When the signal is weak with this phone, I can barely hear people (their voices braak or sound garbled) and they can barely hear me. So this phone is going back.  Note that the phone picks up the signal at the same number of bars when compared to my old phones, its just that it can't handle the sound unless its a strong signal.", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Why didn't someone warn me?", "Author": "jjc", "ReviewID": "R26SSXDS6WUT5M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I shop through amazon all the time and I am usually very happy with my purchases. However, I was in search of a new samsung phone because I like their products and for some reason, decided on this one. The first thing that threw me off was the \"list price\" that stated the phone was worth $199. I have since been to a t-mobile store and the price is $9.99, for good reason. Why didn't anyone say anywhere in the description or the reviews that this is a YOUTH PHONE???It even feels like a toy. There are 4 screen savers. Lassie, some Lab puppies, a snowboarder, and some teacups, I guess for the sophisticated consumer. And I refuse to pay $1.50 to download a new screen saver because I am not throwing any more money into this toy. I am way too old to be carrying this phone and it is way too hard to return it to amazon without terrible complications to my phone service.
