I had just returned from Bogota Colombia where I had left my LG  at Eldorado airport so of to the store I went. Was looking to get another LG  but they were sold out. The guy at the counter knew I travel a lot so he suggested I look at the BLU 5.5S since it has dual sim cards so no need for another phone in Colombia. Well it looked nice and I played around with it for a minute. Very responsive so I went ahead and made the purchase. At this point I am extremely happy with this phone. Kind of makes me wonder why I need to spend another 100 dollars for a phone. This is thing is smooth, no hiccups. Huge screen, mini tablet, great for watching movies on the plane. If youre not a brand name junkie get this phone. I think this company has a bright future.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "ordred from ebay", "Author": "J.

I am using a straight talk sim card with at&t; service. picture messages come thru with no problem. my internet speed is 11mbps i can use my hotspot feature with no problem. the phone is huge. it is bigger than a galaxy s3 and s4. i just got the phone today and it looks great. i have a 32gb sd card so i dont have space issues, but the phone itself has 4gb, and after the preinstalled apps its only about 2gb or less. so you will definitely need a good size sd card. i will answer all questions ... they market this phone as 4g, im not in the 4g area, im in the hspa+ area, and its considered 4g because its faster than 3g. it is actually faster than my wifi. sorry for using ebay amazon.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked Great For First Two Weeks.", "Author": "Eve", "ReviewID": "R23RMWHUKLKV68", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a reliable phone that is fast, with a good camera, and a large screen. This phone is exactly what I was looking for. It is not an LTE phone but I could not tell the difference since it runs using HSDPA (4G) with my carrier and it's just as fast! The screen is very responsive to the touch. I have tried other phones in this price range and usually the screen does not respond the way it does with this phone and the pictures look great.  Some of the reviewers have complained that the memory is only 4gb. Big deal! I purchased a 16gb mini sd card.You may notice that it is a little awkward to put the mini sd card and one reviewer mentioned that they put tape on the piece of metal that sits on top of the sd card. There is no need to do that, the metal is supposed to snap from the front when you input the sd card and when you place the phone cover over it, the sd card will stay in place fine. Keep in mind that you are not purchasing a Samsung Galaxy and don't expect it to perform like a Samsung Galaxy, but you are still getting a great reliable phone at a great price and I couldn't be happier with it.Update on 05/25/2014Everything mentioned above was my experience for the first two weeks of owning this phone, however, on the third week of using the phone, the touch screen became very inconsistent. Some of the keyboard letters have to be pressed a couple of times before getting a response, and at times works in slow motion. I really liked this phone when I purchased it but ended up being a disappointment. I recently returned the phone and originally left 5 stars but I had to edit it to three stars.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for an equally great price. . .", "Author": "Jinx", "ReviewID": "R2LOEBO68ODX91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the last couple of years I have used lower end Android phones. I did extensive research before choosing this phone.  Let me say, this phone puts them and many higher end phones to shame in my opinion. I have had this phone for a month and have had no problem with it. It is fast, responsive, and the phones overall cosmetic design is gorgeous. I often get asked if my Blue is an HTC or a Samsung S3 based on looks alone. I have interacted with both of those phones and I can say that the Blu Studio 5.5S is quite similar to the Samsung S3 (except the my Blu cost significantly less than a S3 bought without a contract).Pros:-The price. When I saw this phone and its specifications I thought it would be at least $350, but I was pleasantly surprised when this phone was roughly half of that.-5.5 inch screen (great for reading and typing emails/documents)-8 megapixel rear camera (with flash) and a 2 megapixel front camera-Android 4.2-Good speaker compared to what I have had in the past-Comes with a phone case and screen protectorCons:-The phone case protects the phone somewhat, but it won't protect against accidental drops like a hard case will-It is hard to find a case other than the one provided that is specifically made for the 5.5S (I solved this by getting a small purse that is just big enough to carry my phone, wallet, keys, etc.)-Nothing about the phone itself.Overall opinion: I would recommend this to anyone who wants a Samsung, but can't afford one. It is sleek and fast. Its expandable memory is great and I really like the overall design of the phone. Although I don't like the case it comes with, it an easy fix if you're creative.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, my wife loved", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "RLUIH0ZPQU5ZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second blue phone they are great,  just wish they come with more memory, and accessories available like cases,  juice pack,  .", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome size, troubled phone1", "Author": "new mom", "ReviewID": "R203YBVOIR4MUX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not sure who has been reviewing this phone but they are so off unless the one I got is really defective.What attracted me to the phone was that the touchscreen was so responsive, no not this one. first off, it was delivered for free one day early(YEAH!).

I certainly did made a right choice. This phone is great and lovely. The screen is very fascinating, very fast and the battery is very long lasting. I only charge once a day. The wifi is also very strong in picking up signals compared to my old phone. The first fault I found was the MMS. Whenever I take pictures - which are lovely - and  try to send it through MMS the phone compressed it a lot. I mean a picture of 15MB was compressed to 33kb. This couldn't allow me to send MMS because people complained they can't see anything. Anyway I checked the MMS to see if there are changes that can be done, unfortunately nothing can be done to reverse that. Second, I shop online looking for a better case for the phone, couldn't find none. The silicon case that came with it, only protect the phone from getting dirty. I was in school studying and placed the phone on the table, and the phone made a slight, I mean slight bang on the table not on the floor; and from there on the issue starts. The issue of rebooting itself. I took out the battery, put it back, free the phone from some running apps, charge it, nothing helps. The crazy part is it will reboot just anytime by itself. I was scared so I had to return it. I've dropped my old phone so many times, on the floor, bed, table without any case and is still working; with a few drama but with not rebooting by itself occasionally. Don't get me wrong the phone is very good if only you are lucky to find case for it because once it make a hard contact on solid stuff that's the end .", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Ronald Bowden", "ReviewID": "RHAPC8SZBFRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my phone and it is really nice to be able to play games and read the new paper/magazines with out going blind with tiny 6 point letters.

I wanted a bigger phone (gluttony) and after careful research I picked the Studio 5.5S. However I ended up RETURNING it getting another one and having to return that one too because:1)While I loved the size (perfect for reading and watching movies), the phone even with the provided case on felt slippery. I felt that I could drop it at any time.2) There were no decent cases for the phone.  I searched and looked but to no avail. I love color and I was not going to settle for a rinky dink black TPU case.3) the phone is SLOW. This is what made me just give up on the BLU Studio 5.5S. I use to own the Iphone 4s and galaxy 4 and I am NOT comparing it to those. But the slowness was just too slow. I would start to type in messenger and it would freeze all the time. Websites would not load on my HOME wifi. It was a mess!4) DOES NOT RUN 4G on US ATT and Tmobile.The great thing though is the PRICE. I couldn't deal with the slowness but my mom probably could. Parents this is the phone for your irresponsible teenager.The phone itself is beautiful. I loved the size! Everywhere I went people commented on its 5.5 in screen. I didn't mind it not fitting in my evening clutch because it was a conversation piece. The white color with the silver line oin the botton and black edge give it a sophisticated look comparable to the Samsung Note 3. All in all good price for an okay phone.

The screen displays good but the resolution is so low everything is huge and blurry around the edges. I've been spoiled with an HTC ONE (M7) and a Samsung Galaxy S4 before I got this phone. I can really tell a difference between! *This would be a great phone for someone coming over from Apple or a first time Android user.*With all that said, I love the design and I like the phone but this is not a long term answer for me, just a cheap stop gap solution.

I was leary based on the cost.  The manual and website tell you absolutely nothing and the \"tech\" support for blu service do not seem to answer the phone...(waited 2 hours and finally gave up).  I had a lot of questions when I was researching the phone... such as what kind of sim card does it take found out it takes a regular size (not micro or nano).  I get 4g service.  Phone screen is great...I've watched tv on my phone via slingbox and in hd it looks good.  Ya it's no amoled screen but to most it won't matter.  It takes a micro sd card.. website states up to 64 however I found other sites where people have issues, so I stuck with a 32 bit.  One thing I wasn't too impressed with was bluetooth.  It connects with my car head unit however my pandora used to automatically sync with the stereo and I could see what was playing on the head unit... now only the music comes across.... no big deal.  It always seems to skip as well when first starting any music so I have to pause it... once I do it works fine.  Camera is nice, just remember to take the small piece of plastic off the lense.  Blu keeps saying it will update the os to kitkat.  I'd like that but I'm ok with the current as well.One month update: Still love the phone.  Downloaded a few apps to help save battery and I can get almost a full day of talking, texting and surfing with no issues. App is DU battery saver. It does adjust the timeout and screen brightness but I adjusted it a bit.  The only thing I'm still waiting for is a case. I want a better case to protect the phone than what it came with.  as far as kitkat....

I am regret that I have to subtract 2 stars, but I think 3 stars will get more attention.  Please note that these stars have nothing to do with the phone performance.UPDATE: There are several cons on this phone:1- The Android version on this phone lack some functions such as create a folder, user friendly for uninstalling an app... Again, I have to download apps for these functions.2- Don't expect the battery last for long, meaning you have to charge it everyday.  It will not last all day if heavily used! An extra battery costs $25 on eBay.3- Only about 1.8gb internal storage available because Android platform takes more than 2gb, so you certainly need a micro SD card installed.Pros:1- Very nice and sleek design.

I love how it looks.2- It is fast.3- I expect the phone will last very long, but time will tell.In the early update I thought there was no zoom option for the camera, but actually I was wrong.

It has a 6 Megapixel camera, Not 8, as advertised everywhere.  I can find no decent documentation.  I used a pin to lock, and find I have been unable to reverse this.  Drops calls frequently, so I am back to my 4 year old lg800 that works perfectly as  phone.**************UPDATE*******************I am wrong about Camera it is * mega pixel.  When you go to Camera settings and switch from Preview mode the camera will go from 6 o 8 Mega pixel.  Also I found pin lock unlock is under root settings by putting in pin under security it can be turned off.  So I am Liking Blu More now.  I will give it 4 stars with the dropped call problem under net10 at 3G.  Other carriers and other areas then Boston may do better.Anyway I am actually liking Blu and they did respond via e-mail where there Phone support is almost impossible to get through on.  Aside from that people say the quality of transmission while talking is great.  Maybe I will try one of the cheaper Blu's as a phone backup.So 4 STARS for me..
