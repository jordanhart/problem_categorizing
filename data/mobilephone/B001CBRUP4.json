IN FACT, I didn't believe it would be this nice, as I only purchased it because of the great deal since I am studying abroad in 5 months and will need to buy a new phone in that country -- This phone was so nice, I am bringing it with me, at least for an alarm, notepad, camera etc!This is the iphone for those of us who like pay-as-you-go and don't want to spend a fortune!It has a great camera, fast internet, mp3 player, television, radio, lots of games and downloadable apps. It is really pretty, and easy to use. Although I have sent a few texts and received calls, I haven't transferred my number over yet...but I LOVE this phone!I highly recommend it!!!", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "B.

Main problem, it doesn't charge. Charger/phone didn't work.BUT we have insurence.

The phone worked fine during sunlight but once I got in dark places with little heat the phone would freeze up and i would have to rub the phone to get it to work.
