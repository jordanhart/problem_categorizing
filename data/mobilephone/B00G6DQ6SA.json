I travelled to Colombia, popped in an old prepaid Comcel SIM card and it worked right away, I even enabled a data prepaid plan and I was able to surf the web and use applications like Tappsi, maps, Whatsup, Skype, etc. GPS applications with free maps work great without the need of celular signal and Waze works fine with the data plan, you can even share the internet to your regular phone or other devices using the hot-spot feature.It benefits from the Android operating system and for its price this is the best travel phone ever.Now if you want to use this as a primary personal phone, remember the price you are paying for it, it is not a Samsung Galaxy neither it is an iPhone, the processor is a bit slow and the camera is quite poor, so to put it in perspective it costs less than one fifth of the price of a galaxy or an iphone, so you get one fifth the processor power and one fifth the picture sharpness of the camera.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works Well!", "Author": "Silver_tea", "ReviewID": "R25CHSQU7UST0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not a top line phone...so don't expect an iPhone quality....however...I bought two for my daughters(teens) and it works nicely for them...this way if it becomes lost or damaged...I don't pay out of the wazooo to buy a new phone.

It was a bet and I lost. I did not put as many apps as I would like to and kept its use to the minimum. Despite of this, to my surprise, the screen gave out two days AFTER Amazon's return deadline. A perfectly timed highway robbery. And I don't know if it can still be repaired. Well, as it appears, this product is best before 33 days of use. Lessons learned. Never choose price over brand names. Remember, even if most products are already made in China, brand names will never risk their reputation. Even if you have to pay a little more, do so. Choose brands that have been tried and tested. And you will be safe.
