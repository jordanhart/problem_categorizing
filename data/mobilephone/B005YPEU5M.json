Dropped calls and reception was broken and filled with static. Touch screen didn't always move my contacts as it was supposed to. That was very irritating at times. Battery life was good and sound quality was great when the connection was good. I can only compare this to the Razr and it didn't stack up. I took it back.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super sensitive phon", "Author": "Roxad", "ReviewID": "R391BY1NPW7N10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Make sure you put the lock on your phone otherwise you will dial everyone.

I wanted the touchscreen, the Bluetooth, and the media player support.The GOOD:- size and weight of the phone are nice.- support for microSD cards.- bluetooth supportThe BAD:- The phone has a cheap, plastic feel to it.- The proprietary website browser does not save your homepage preference and only displays text and pictures. No multimedia support.- The phone's media player does not support the standard way of storing mp3 files on an sd card (artist\\album\\title format) but only works if you place ALL your mp3s in a certain directory.Less than one month after purchasing it new:- the touchscreen became intermittently non-responsive until it was not functional at all.- The charging port stopped working- Kyocera refused to honor the warranty because the charging port was damaged, though they would gladly repair the phone for $57.50. Needless to say, I now own an $80 paperweight.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "don't buy", "Author": "Tenesha L.

On the good side, shipping was fast and everything was in tact. On the downside, this phone is so light you can tell that it is cheaply made, but hey you get what you pay for.  It had a touchscreen, but I have flip phones that had better capabilities. Hence, I will be sending this back and stick with trusted brands like LG, Samsung, and even Motorola. No more off brands for me!", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005YPEU5M"}}
