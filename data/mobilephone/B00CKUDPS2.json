I agree with those reviews but I realized that there weren't any reviews whether the phone was really unlocked as described. But I took a risk. This phone came in a week, which was not so bad. When I was tracking this product, it said that it would come from FedEx but instead it came from UPS  (which is not really that much of a importance to me). I was very happy when it came. There were many, many features in the phone.Pros:\u00b7 Very (surprisingly) crisp, clear photos\u00b7 You can also record videos\u00b7 Games\u00b7 A Children's Corner (so that you won't have to worry about your child messing up your phone)\u00b7 Web (which is obvious)\u00b7 Word, PowerPoint, Excel\u00b7 Packaging was very good\u00b7 Was brand new\u00b7 More features (that I really didn't have much time of going through)Cons: \u00b7 PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED!!!  The main reason that I bought the Nokia Lumia 520 was because it was said to be unlocked. I contacted Amazon's customer service and they gave back the full amount that I payed and I didn't have to pay anything to return my phone. I'm a very loyal Amazon customer because I never had to give back anything and this is the first thing that I have to give back. But, anyway, it isn't Amazon's fault since they don't directly sell this item who I'm grateful that I got my money back.  I was very sad/disappointed when I found out that this phone is not unlocked (I went to a store to put in a son and they said that this phone is actually unlocked).  Overall, if you don't mind that it's locked than I highly recommend this wonderful Nokia Lumia 520 phone", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent phone, very cheap and comes fully unlocked", "Author": "Isaac C.", "ReviewID": "R1G4DF8GBAWHVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "definitely worth it compared to this phone.

Came fully unlocked, in English, wish all the accessories and a start up books! I'd been wanting a Lumia for some time now, after getting my Windows 8 laptop. I love the OS, but I know some people don't, so I'd advise you to go to Best Buy and test out Windows 8 to make sure you like the OS.

Here are the things I like:PROS:1. It's fast and fluid. It just works.2. It's cheap! Can't beat the price3. The screen is nice and the feel of the phone is great.4. It has an offline GPS mode (but there is a slight problem with this...see CONS section)CONS:1. The GPS is only free for local use. If you try using the offline free GPS in another country it will ask you to pay for a licensing fee. That's what happened to me when crossing back and forth from Canada and the USA.2. There is no led light or camera flash on this device. Makes it useless to shoot pictures with at night.3. The keyboard is CRAP! It is seriously terrible... I find that many users like myself end up hitting the comma button repeatedly instead of the space bar. I swear I'm pressing the space bar, but the comma always registers. Also the accuracy of the keyboard is terrible. It makes for an unpleasant experience at times..... I'm not the only one with this issue, as several of my friends have the same problem.Conclusion:Overall, although there are many shortcomings with this phone, it is still good considering the price. I don't think you'd be disappointed with it considering what you get for for the price. But, don't expect perfection, as this phone does fall short in many aspects.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great condition.", "Author": "Jane", "ReviewID": "R2O4X8HODA9C33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't know what to expect but item came in great condition.

This is my first smartphone so I am not able to compare it with androids or iphones, however, from my experience it is a excellent phone for the price! I have had no problems with the texting or phone calls and the internet has been fast with it's 4G speed. I love the phones design, and it has been fun personalizing my home screen and pinning my favorite apps!I am am using this phone through NET10 prepaid monthly cards. I looked into AT&Ts; GO phone plans, but found that I could get a better deal by switching to NET10 . All I had to do was buy a NET10 AT&T; compatible Micro sim card ($1 on amazon) ,this unlocked GSM phone, and a $40 or $50 net10 plan card to make it work. I have been really pleased with how well it has worked! If you use this phone with a plan like Net10, you do have to enter in some APN codes to get internet to work, but it if you Google the codes its pretty simple and the internet was up and running after I did that!So I would highly recommend this unlocked phone to anyone, especially if you are going the prepaid route because it's unlocked.Enjoy!!!", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good product", "Author": "JORGE OSCAR CRESCENTE", "ReviewID": "R2965A2N8GD7C0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good relation between  quality and price.
