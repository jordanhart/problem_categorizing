Devine", "ReviewID": "R1ZPN47BPFRRLE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone as long as you understand what you are getting.  It is a mid tier phone, and has the specs to match.  Where it stands out is as far as I have found the only dual sim phone with US T-Mobile compatibility.  I have TMo and ATT sims and can use 3G data on either account.  It is also compatible with European carries which makes it a great travel phone.  Please note this is the C2004 model only.It has one glaring weakness- it only has 4gb memory.  Once the OS is on and the standard apps you're not looking at much available memory.  Because Google Play won't let you download content to the SD, you can only stream because there is not enough memory to handle big media files.Overall it is snappy with good battery life.  The screen is nice but has poor viewing angles.  It has that funky shape the early Xperia phones had- its thicker on the ends that in the middle.If you have a TMo sim and are looking for a dual sim to travel, this is a must buy, or if you have a T-mo and ATT sim and want only one device this is great.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Dual-Sim phone for T-mobile and another GSM operator, with major flaw on app2SD though", "Author": "Zhen Master", "ReviewID": "R1OT3V2SXGCNMZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very nice set for my use: dual sim smartphone that works on T-mobile's AWS (1700/2100 band) network. No 4G, but T-mobile's HSPA+ is very fast (at about 10mbps+ download speed, so it is as good). I use the second SIM for an international wireless provider on GSM in China.The only major flaw is about the limited internal memory. Worse, one cannot use any app2sd applications to move apps to a microSD card. There is no way of doing it, and that's confirmed by Sony's technical staff. Very disappointing since the internal 2G will quickly be filled up after about 80 apps.Update May 2014: international data roaming issueT-mobile has a very nice international roaming service with its Simple Choice plan: free international data, usually at 2G speed. In China it may use China Unicom's 3G network. However this cellphone failed to get the data signal. Voice roaming is fine. I enabled international data roaming with T-mobile, enabled it on the phone, set up mobile network setting and APN; nothing worked. I then inserted the same T-mobile sim card into someone else's Galaxy 3; it recognized the data network right away. After long phone calls to T-mobile and Sony, I gave up.This also happened in Puerto Rico. It's a US territory but is considered by T-mobile as an international roaming zone. Unfortunately the data did not work in PR either.I concluded that this must be a design defect by Sony. If anyone's Xperia M C2004 works on international data roaming, please make sure to report here.

The default UI theme is rather attractive in its simplicity, and I haven\u2019t changed it yet (though I modified the \u201caccent\u201d color).The battery is removable and replaceable, and I\u2019m not sure how many phones at this feature level offer such an option.The only thing this phone lacks is 4G, which for me is not an issue as I don\u2019t really use data.But when I do, this phone supports 3G (HSPA) at the highest speed, and is able to do so anywhere on the US T-Mobile network as well as any European country.The battery duration is pretty good; with my extra-light usage (wifi off, little use overall) the phone runs about 10 days on a charge, with 2 SIM cards connected to the network. On days when I use the phone more, the screen consumption drains the battery quite a bit; a average user will probably need to recharge it every 3 days or so.The only disappointment (if minor) is that in order to use the FM radion, you have to plug in your headphones, or the radio just won\u2019t play anything at all (by design), so unless you plug in external self-powered speakers, there\u2019s no way to play the radio directly through the prone without using headphones or some other external device.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "my Best Phone", "Author": "Jorge Rondon", "ReviewID": "R2YXYUM2U6DLGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once again sony surprise me with the excellent products,in the other hand  the battery life is fantastic and the Phone Look executive", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good dual SIM phone", "Author": "E.

With this model you can get a prepaid local SIM card in one slot and your regular SIM in the second slot. Both are active at the same time. During a recent visit to US, I used ReadySim as the prepaid SIM. The C2004 is especially well suited to the T-Mobile network that ReadySim uses. Back in Denmark it reaches data speeds of 3G+ or H with my regular SIM. The phone works very well and is affordable.

I have used the Motorola Defy and the Samsung Galaxy S, both of which I rooted and applied the custom ROM, Cyanogenmod. Now I needed a dual-SIM phone because I have two T-Mobile lines for the two jobs I work. I have been using this phone for about a week now, and I must say that I like it a lot.The phone is light, fits nicely in the palm of my small hands, and does not slip despite being quite thin. It is quite sturdy as well, although I haven't dropped it yet! Call quality is very clear. I can clearly hear what is being said by the person on the other end of the line, and that person can also hear me quite well. There does not appear to be any distortions. Dual-SIM standby works quite well too. When there is a call on one SIM, the other SIM does not accept calls. There is an option to forward calls coming to the inactive SIM to the one in use, but I could not activate that feature - looks like it is a T-Mobile issue, and I am not going to pursue it. It serves my purpose quite well. Since this is the first time I am using a dual-SIM phone, I have to get used to making the calls through the correct SIM. The phone and messaging applications are quite adequate, and every time you make or receive a call or text, it says which SIM is being used, so you are always in the know. Quite neat.Wi-Fi is really easy to set up and the phone remembers all the settings quite well. The T-Mobile 4G network is fast enough for me where I live, and I have had no issues with it whatsoever. You can specify one SIM to be used with data, which suits me quite well. I have one line with unlimited data, and another prepaid line without any data.There is Android 4.2.2 on board, and the phone is quite smooth and snappy. I have installed the ADW Launcher on it, which is what I have been using for a while now, and I like it.I do not play games, so the built-in user-accessible 2GB of storage is enough for me. I have my 16GB micro-SD card installed, and the Walkman application is great for listening to music. There are some other apps by Sony and Google that I will never use, and I would have liked a way to uninstall them without rooting the phone (thereby voiding the warranty), but I guess I cannot do that. The 5MP camera with flash is also adequate for me.The screen is quite sharp and legible both indoors and outdoors. Brightness can be automatically adjusted to light conditions. Battery life has also been pretty good - I can get a full day and a half the way I use the phone.To sum it up, I did not have much choice when it came to reliable dual-SIM phones that support the T-Mobile 4G bands here in the USA. I had to choose between the Sony Xperia M Dual and the Huawei Ascend P6 Dual. I read all the reviews I could find and decided on the Sony handset. I must say that the phone perfectly fits my needs and I am very satisfied with it. I would recommend this phone to anyone with similar needs.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just cannot believe it", "Author": "Lemuel Chase", "ReviewID": "R1MVHZHPLWRE1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owing the Sony Xperia  M C2004 is like having a computer on you at all time .
