They work great individually and together. After examining my own needs and reading the reviews of others, I took a chance on this phone.  Reviews indicated it had a long battery life, good reception and initialized easily with a Cingular/AT&T; SIM card.  Yeah!  Set up was easy.  (Thank you!) Reception is surprisingly better than my old phone, a big plus. The speaker feature of this phone was required and the hands free function of a Bluetooth seemed like a nice bonus.  The Bluetooth has turned out better than expected.  It's easy to use with good transmission and reception.  It was a good choice for me.  Amazon has always been great.  Their secondary sales vendors have also proven to be consistently superb.

I'll use a real camera if I want to take a picture. What is more important to me is that it is a good quality phone, with great reception and sound.  Also it has a voice call feature that's easy to access and actually recognizes my voice and calls the number that I intended (unlike my Razr which always seems to have problems with this feature).  Thus I've actually backward upgraded to this phone.  Oh and it also has bluetooth, speakerphone, and mp3 ringtones capability, added plusses!  Want a good basic easy to use phone with no complaints?  Then get this.

I'm glad I did, because it's turned out to be a perfectly acceptable brand-new and unlocked cell phone.

Size is nice and compact, fits well into any pocket. The battery life is phenomenal and that is expected because its a 1000+ mAh for a very basic phone. The features are decent and the bluetooth pairs very well with my external bluetooth devices such as the Motorola speakerphone in my car. Menu and options are basic and quite easy to use. Screen resolution is so-so but then what do you expect from a phone at this price. Overall, even though I went back to my smartphone a few days later (only because of my dependency on its features) I highly recommend this phone to those who need only voice + text.

Knowing that the closest cell is about 4 miles away and signal strength in my residence is virtually nonexistent has reduced my dependence on mobile communications. I do like good audio quality and adequate signal strength away from home, and the V197 is capable of both. A week without recharging, and the ability to charge from one of my laptop's USB ports are nice bonuses (I have docking ports for the laptop on both the SUV and touring motorcycle). My netbook does my messaging, my Nikon camera and Samsung video recorder take care of pictures, so all I really need is a dependable cellphone, and the V197 is a more-than-adequate performer.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Doesn't Get Any Better At This Price", "Author": "Howard \"K. Howard\"", "ReviewID": "RSRWQ7T5Y274I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical when I ordered this phone. Almost seemed to good to be true, but I was pleasantly surprised. So much so that I ordered three more. One for my wife and two as gifts for this Christmas. All four phones arrived new, in a factory sealed Motorola box, as advertised. This phone feels solid, is well built and accepted an AT&T; SIM card without any problems. The new Motorola Bluetooth (H715), also ordered from Amazon, connected without any problems and the sound quality is very good. The battery life is good, a little shorter when using bluetooth, but still good. The volume is more than adequate, considering I am tone deaf. As other reviews have mentioned, the ONLY thing lacking is the speaker phone. It works, you can hear the other person but the speaker seems underpowered. It is still usable, but won't be your first choice. One of the things I like is NO antenna stub, considering it is a flip model. It fits well on a belt and is easily used with one hand. If you have kids and want them to have a phone but don't want to take out a second mortgage to buy it, this is the ticket.The other benefit of this phone is traveling. Being a quad band, you can take it almost anyplace in the world, buy a prepaid sim card at your destination country and you will save a fortune in roaming fees. Additionally, the cost of making and receiving calls, minute for minute will be measured in pennies, not dollars.Now, if you are wanting to use your cell phone to track the space shuttle, take photos, figure out Einsteins theory of relativity, video conference with someone in Siberia, make a fashion statement or listen to music all day long, you won't be happy with this phone. However, if you want to make quality calls, receive quality calls (with or without bluetooth), send and receive text messages, and do other basic things all mobile phones do, you will be very happy with this phone, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE ($42.99). I have had mobile phones since they began making them back in the late 1980's and for an unlocked phone with bluetooth capability, dollar for dollar, I don't think you can find anything better.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Bart C.

I wanted to get the same service (don't need a monthly plan) and I was looking at the phones available on the AT&T; site, but I wasn't really impressed with the phones there (the lower-priced ones didn't seem to have much actual phone time before recharging was needed).  So I checked Amazon and came across this one.I read all the reviews and was impressed by the comments.  I read the product description and the phone seemed to meet my needs.  But the question was: would a PAYG SIM card work on this one?  I knew that if I had a phone with a monthly AT&T; plan it would work on this phone, but info about PAYG SIMS didn't make it clear if they would also work.  I asked around on various forums, and folks said that it would.  I called AT&T; and got a foreign tech rep who talked at cross-purposes and was no help.  So I decided to take a chance and purchase this phone.  Joy of joys, the SIM card fit, the network was recognized and I've been able to make and receive calls, with my charges showing exactly as they should.  The only problem that I had was that my address book did not transfer over (must have been stored on the actual phone itself rather than the PAYG SIM card on my old phone), but that can be reconstructed.  The Motorola V197 gives its user the option of storing the address book on either the SIM or the phone.  If it's stored on the phone, then the user is also able to take advantage of voice-activated dialing, which is a nice feature, and a lot more information about the contact can be stored rather than just name and phone number.I haven't tested out all of its features, but one that I really like is the fact that it has a volume-control button the outside of the phone, so volume changes can be made while talking without pulling the phone away to make the adjustment.  There is no camera, which I sort of miss, just because I found that it came in handy every now and then, but it's not an essential feature nor was it a deal-breaker.  The product description on Amazon's page actually provides more facts about the phone than is included in its instruction book (oddly, there is no \"specifications\" page in the MotoManual giving the user the hard facts), so I'd recommend copying and pasting the Amazon product description for your future records.

It also has Bluetooth and voicedial, which we did not use (I like the capability, though: I use it all the time on my mobile in the USA).  If you just want a phone to talk on, this one's for you.  In Ireland and northern England reception/coverage was always at least equal to other members of our party.We use prepaid SIM chips, local for whatever country we are in, and just swap them out as we travel: they cost about [...] bucks/euros/pounds and come with that much prepaid credit: easy to recharge if more is needed, but we don't chat a lot, just calls for reservations and coordinating things, mostly.  Incoming calls are usually free with a local card, which allows use of long-distance callback services such as Tellestial offers for talking to the USA, which is convenient when we aren't in a WiFi area where we can use Skype.We have a Virgin chip we use in the UK, but had to buy a new SIM chip in a shop on arrival Ireland (Virgin does work there, but at much higher roaming rates.).  We have been to several countries, and I have usually bought SIM chips ahead of time on Ebay.
