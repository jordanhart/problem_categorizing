The phone worked flawlessly.  I used it as a MP3 player.  A camera.  A gps.  Loved it.  As for the GPS, I was surprised that it could locate me without using a data network.The phone is on the smallish side, but when traveling I don't need a full-sized phone.  That did have an advantage as it was one less bulky thing to deal with.What sucks is that I come back to the US, where you just can't buy a simm someplace and just use it.  You have to join a f'n network.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very small, even for petite fingers, otherwise good phone.", "Author": "MagnoliaSouth \"As soon go kindle fire with sn...", "ReviewID": "R25M46NQ3SN0ZG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before I get to it I'm not going to discuss the features here because they are all listed in the product information above.That said, we bought three of these phones because we are both upgrading to data plans/smart phones and we're planning a trip, later this year, to the UK. We didn't want to have to buy a smart phone now and an International one later, so this seemed like the logical solution. We use T-Mobile in the US.I was a little disappointed when I read the reviews. Much of what I wanted to know didn't exist, and so I thought I'd share them so you'll know.The first thing to know is that the phone is designed for Australia, but it does work in the US. There are a number of Australian apps that come preloaded on it.One thing that seemed relatively essential is what comes in the box. For whatever reason, it is not mentioned here, so here is what comes with it.*  Phone (obviously) that has about a 75% charge.*  Navigon maps of Australia and New Zealand are pre-loaded (or the leaflet in the box says it is, I've not yet figured out where they are, not that I need them).*  A charger cord that is native to Australia, but it also comes with a US adapter that works fine.*  A 2GB micro SD card.*  A micro SD card adapter.*  A quick start guide (there is NO full manual, but you can download the UK pdf; see the link in the comments of this review).*  White ear plugs.*  An Australian recycle-your-old-phone bag (totally useless here in the US).I don't much care for the way the contact list works (you have to type the entire name, which is an ancient technology), but maybe that's an Android issue. In any case, there are plenty of free Contact apps that you can use to replace it.Its worst problem is its size. I thought it sounded big enough, by the specs listed, but it isn't. I have relatively small fingers and even for me trying to type on it is a neat trick, at best. I highly recommend getting an inexpensive stylus, if you insist on buying it.If I could afford it, I would return these due their small size and typing issues, but because of the current administration of this country, I do not have that luxury. We will simply have to grin and bear it.Its good points are that it is fast, so long as you have an appropriately sized micro SD card and it's easy to use. It doesn't take long to figure out how to use it at all. Again, this was my first foray into the smart phone technology so for a newb it was easy. That says a lot.All in all it is a decent phone, except for its size.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Randoll", "ReviewID": "R1DZ1OZUWK1LYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent cellphone, very fast and cheaps, for the price is very good for my wife, it's small and ligth, with a good procesor", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "my wife loved it", "Author": "J.

Based on the reviews here I bought this Samsung model. I was a little concerned about the size of the phone since several reviewers complained that it was too small. It is small but I kind of like it that way. On screen typing isn't too bad, but I do hit the wrong key more frequently than on larger phones. I'll be using the phone mostly to make phone calls anyway.The default language was Spanish when I first booted up the phone, but that was easily changed. It connected with my home wi-fi with no problems. It also has blue tooth and GPS. It's running Android 2.3.6 with a bunch of built in apps. The processor is noticeably slower than my regular cell phone, but no surprise there. It's fast enough for my needs.I went to an AT&T; store and bought a $10 SIM card just to make sure the phone will actually work as a phone. No problem there either.I'll post an update when I get back from Scotland.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone not what was advertised.", "Author": "D. G.

The phone came in a brand new and sealed box. Not a refurbished or pre-owned unit. Thank God.  Besides the size, this inexpensive cellphone is packed with just about all the features one will find on a more expensive unit minus the balk. I just placed my TMobile SIM card in the slot and started calling right away. NO CONTRACT. COMPLETELY UNLOCKED. Buy as you go.  It was so easy for me to connect the WiFi to my network at home, boom, boom, boom I was already online, just about everything from my google account to my Skype seem to Sync automatically and effortlessly with just a few key strokes.
