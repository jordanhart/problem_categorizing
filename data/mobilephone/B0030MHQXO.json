{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very nice gadget", "Author": "Dispie", "ReviewID": "R1WE57POFYAD2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received mine in the end of December. A month is probably not enough to discover all bugs but so far I'm happy with the phone.First of all, it is really fast. The 1GHz processor does it's job.The screen resolution is high and the screen size is big enough to surf the web with comfort.HTC shell is something new to me (I used to have E-ten with Spb Mobile shell) but getting used to it.Cannot say that I'm impressed with the still picture quality (SE phones have better pictures with less Mpx) but video recording is relatively good. There is no button for shutter so you always have to click on the screen to take picture - not convenient.I need to charge my phone every second day - that definitely exceeded my expectations, taking into consideration fast processor and big hi-res screen.The screen uses almost full width of the body, which sometimes causes unexpected clicks when I grab the phone (slowly getting used to it). When browsing e-mails the shell has button \"reply to all\" on the left side and when you click it, it changes to \"send\". One time I grabbed the phone and it replied to all and sent an empty message to a huge distribution list. So keep it in mind and be careful ;) I hope there will be a way to protect it somehow.The phone is bigger than I expected - it's exactly the size of 12oz beer can (you can hide one behind the phone).The sound level and quality in conversations is excellent. Also, my Highlander hands-free connects very quickly with good sound level.So far I did not have chance to use built-in GPS. I don't expect anything special comparing to other similar phones.It does not have a stylus. If you turn the phone, full size keyboard is big enough but.. I think I will get a stylus. At least you need one, when you surf Internet.Overall - some little flaws, which I found so far, will not be enough to downgrade my 5 star rating. I really enjoy the phone and recommend it to others who is ready to spend [...] bucks on a gadget.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expectations exceeded", "Author": "Antonio Mart\u00ednez \"Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R1060SLIVBQCL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK! I bought this phone considering two main reasons:1.- I wanted a Widows mobile phone2.- I wanted a gigantic screen to surf the web, watch videos and pictures, etc.This phone runs Windows Mobile 6.5 with HTC Sense which is an excellent HTC Shell, brilliant, executive, serious, innovative, useful, customizable and extremely user friendly. First request has been fulfilled.This is the greatest screen you'll find... There's just 1 device that comes closer (Toshiba TG01) and it is 0.2 inches smaller (Toshiba 4.1\" / HD2 4.3\") So my second reason is clearly covered. Indeed it is bigger than what I thought and I am obviously happy about it.Extras: A LOT!!! The design is perfect, but device's pictures describes it better than my words, it is so elegant and I like it very much.Camera resolution is fine (not the best) but it does its job. Still pictures are very nice and video recording quality is also very good. I am very impressed about taking still pictures on dark environments beacuse it gets a highly brilliant and beautiful pictures. Its two led flash allows you to photograph almost anything on black dark environments (as long as it is closer enought to light it)The capacitive screen prevents unwanted touches from any other thing that is not your finger (or skin) and it has a proximity sensor so you won't click buttons with your face when talking on the phone. This proximity sensor turns off the screen when you place the phone on your ear and turns it back on when removed.Battery life is amazing considering 1GHz processor and extra giant screen, I get more than 24hrs of power listening to music, placing and receiving calls, sending and receiving SMS, MMS, surfing the web through WiFi, GPRS, EDGE or 3G (any available) and \"playing\" with GPS, google maps, Garmin, etc.It comes with an extremely addictive game (Teeter) that uses the built-in accelerometer to move a ball while you move the phone, the objective is to insert the ball in a green hole preventing the gray ones.It has a built-in connection with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Windows Live, so your contacts are always up-to-date with status, tweets, profile pictures and even birthdays! (it stores birthdays on the calendar and alerts you on the go)Microsoft has a very useful software \"MyPhone\" (not exclusive for this device but 4 all Windows Mobile phones) which allows you to sync contacts, calendar, pictures, text messages, music, documents, storage card contents and even location. This lets you change your device and by simply synchronizing with a couple of clicks, your new device will be exactly as the old one, and you don't even need a computer 'cause it stores the content on your Windows Live account. (I've heard about a lot of BB users who loses their contacts when updating the BB messenger) So this deserves a big \"Hurrah\" for Microsoft. I found it soooo useful and important.The stock manager allows you to keep track of your stocks, always up-to-date, it can even show graphics for 1 day behavior, 5 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years.Storage card is placed below the back cover and it is not below the battery, so you can change it while phone is still on. It supports up to 32 GB microSD HC.Applications included are very useful, I saw a review that talks about the simple calculator and this is wrong... it is not so simple, it has a simple calculator when holding the phone in a vertical position and you can get a scientific calculator if you turn your phone and hold it horizontal.The MP3 trimmer allows you to cut an MP3 file in a determinated position and save and extract of it to use it as a ringtone.Office Mobile includes OneNote where you can write using the keyboard or handwritting. (I also read a review that says that this phone won't let you handwrite to create a message), this is also wrong... you can turn on this function on the keyboard options while you are writting your message.WorldCard Mobile (found on tools) is an OCR recognition engine that lets you take a picture of a bussiness card and it recongnizes names, email, website, address, phones, etc and save it to a new contact so you don't have to write it manually.Remote Desktop Mobile lets you connect to any PC, the digital compass can be combined with google maps to get directions or orientate on unknown places and this HD2 can be configured as a WiFi router to use your mobile internet connection everywhere (GPRS, EDGE or 3G) so your laptop will be always online no matter where you are, it can connect to a network or bluetooth printer to print your documents on the go including Acrobat PDF documents. The Opera browser and even IE are flash compatible and you can navigate almost as if you are in front of your desktop PC.The performance for this device is impressive with its 1GHz processor and as if this is not enought out there are millions of software apps that can be installed and customize your phone covering all your needs.So, I can see no reasons why not to buy this monster. I hope that my review helps you decide what you want.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Windows Phones Make a Comeback", "Author": "diljs", "ReviewID": "RZCBKBA53SNHT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an avid user of smartphones, for years I've completely ignored a series of dull, uncreative phones running windows. While a variety of hardware form factors, some even technically superior to the competition, have come out, the software continued to look incredibly boring compared to the iPhone, Android, and even Blackberry. The main selling points consisted of \"It runs windows and has a start button like you're used to on a computer\" and \"We have Office and sync with Outlook!\". While these may have appealed to some business customers, the consistently shrinking market share of Windows phones demonstrated their lack of appeal to consumers as the recent smartphone boom hit.With the HD2 this trend may finally be coming to an end. In conjunction with HTCs beautiful Sense interface, some aggressive hardware, and some genuine innovations, the HD2 is a Windows phone I can actually use and recommend. Let's start with the pros and follow up with a few drawbacks.**Hardware**-The 1ghz Snapdragon processor coupled with 448mb of ram is blazing fast. This is the fastest speed in a phone currently available. The HD2 loads everything quickly, and can run multiple apps at the same time. You can feel how fast the phone runs by playing with it for a few minutes. Gone are the sluggish Windows Phones of old, constantly running out of memory and crashing. The HD2 is fast and has top notch hardware and you can feel it.-The screen is huge: 4.3 inches and stretching from corner to corner. The Resolution at 800x480 pixels means you'll see much more on that big screen than average. That means more room for icons and that sexy weather display on the main screen.-The HD2 supports 3g on T-mobile, including the upcoming higher speed 3g. This means the fastest downloads and best call quality available. Note: the phone does NOT have ATTs 3g bands and the 3g will not work if you're using it unlocked on ATT.-5mp camera with auto focus and 2 LEDs. 5mp is the highest we see on most phones, and the camera looks great. Having not 1 but 2 LEDs for flash seems a bit silly but works well. The phone even comes standard with a little flashlight app for a blindingly bright way to see in the dark.-Included 3.5mm jack - this is becoming standard on most phones, and it's great to see it on the HD2. This allows you to use standard headphones without an adapter when playing music or listening to the built in FM Radio.-Included wifi, bluetooth, and a hardware (real) GPS for turn by turn directions round out all the bells and whistles included in the phone.-Battery life is similar to most smartphones. You will easily get a day's use without having to charge, but most likely you'll have to plug it in at night.**Interface**-HTC Sense is what really makes the phone shine here. This part of the software is done by HTC, not Windows, and runs on top of standard Windows Mobile 6.5 professional. HTC Sense expands on the previous TouchFLO 3d interface and enhances the way customers interact with the phone. Sense creates the beautiful Today screen, animations for messages, social networking features. It also lets you interact with the phone in unique ways, such as pinching to zoom. Some of these features are so close to the iPhone that Apple has recently filed lawsuits against HTC.-The home screen is customizable, though not quite to the extent of Android phones. It lets you place a few apps on the screen, along with a beautiful standard weather app that detects your phone's location and shows the current time and weather in your city.-Touch is a much better experience on this phone than previous windows mobile phones. The screen is capacitive, meaning it uses touch instead of pressure. No awkward stylus or pushing is needed for the touch to work. The phone responds quickly and smoothly to any motions.-Basic phone features like placing a call or sending a text remain simple, with big buttons on the main screen to do so.-Typing on the touchscreen is a breeze due to the size of the screen allowing for a bigger keyboard. As someone who has often stuck to phones with hardware keyboards due to inaccurate screen keyboards, I found typing on the HD2 much easier than previous touchscreen keyboards, although still not as easy as using a hardware keyboard. The HD2 also includes the new SWYPE interface, which lets you type by dragging your fingers through all the letters of a word instead of tapping each one. SWYPE was surprisingly accurate in typing the correct word and will even learn new words once you type them manually.**Included Apps and Accessories**-This phone is being marketed as a media phone, and includes several media apps to demonstrate that. MobiTV lets you watch what is essentially Cable TV on your phone free for 30 days and then ten dollars a month after that. Blockbuster lets you rent or buy movies for your phone. Barnes and Noble eReader lets you purchase ebooks.-The phone comes with a huge 16gb MicroSD card out of the box. This is the biggest memory card available currently, and gives you plenty of room for pictures, videos, music, and apps. The best memory card pairs perfectly with the best processor and screen, and it's great that HTC did not hold back on this extra.-Full videos of Transformers 1 and 2 are preloaded on the memory card. These videos look great and show off the beautiful screen. Note the movies do take about 4gb of space on the memory card.-The phone comes with a gel skin in the box to protect the phone, which you would have to buy separately on most phones.**\u0010Drawbacks**-Price is the number one concern here. The phone is priced higher than competing smartphones. This price seems justified, however, due to the cutting edge hardware in the HD2. It also comes with some nice accessories you'd have to buy separately from other phones. Upgrade and new customer deals will certainly lower the cost for those buying from T-mobile.-The app store is another drawback. The good news is that the phone has one, the bad news is it's the smallest of ANY smartphone operating system. As of this review the Windows Marketplace carried less than 1,000 applications, compared to Android at 20,000 apps and iPhone at a staggering 150,000 apps. Even Blackberry, Palm, and Nokia carry more apps than Windows. You are also going to find significantly more paid than free applications for Windows Mobile apps. The Marketplace is simply far behind that of competing phones, which for a heavy app user will diminish the enjoyment of the HD2 by quite a bit.-Windows Mobile 7 upgradeability is still up in the air, but it currently looks like this phone will NOT be getting an upgrade when the new OS is released. The phone does not support some key hardware feature (front buttons) that WM7 requires, and therefore it is unlikely to be upgraded. The upcoming OS promises to be very exciting, and the fact that this beautiful phone will probably not receive the upgrade is disappointing.Overall this phone is fast, pretty, and offers top of the line features. The phone feels solid (and huge) in your hand, while the software is fast, works well and is fun to use. If the HD2 is any indicator, Windows Mobile may become a legitimate competitor in the smartphone market again. The phone seems to be selling very well, with T-mobile selling out almost everywhere the day the HD2 was released.  I'd recommend this phone as a viable alternative to Android and the iPhone.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "I really wanted to love this phone, but Windows ruined it for me", "Author": "HonestReviewer", "ReviewID": "RQ93CBHFXFN50", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I switched from Blackberry pearl to HD2 which I was really excited about, but Windows ruined it in many ways.P.S: I am not a mac fan-boy, in fact I hate apple products. All I own is a PC and a laptop running Windows 7, so this review is FAR FROM BIASED.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Con's:1> This phone has so much potential but windows seems to have locked lot of things like the home screen tabs, Registry settings, no Mp3 ringtones, videos on Opera browser, Task Manager options and so on. The problem is its not impossible, you can just play with registry and problem solved. But you have to download some applications to edit registry, and know what you are doing. Why not just give it to us, rather than making us all figure out?2>  You upgrade the device and you lose all the data and settings, I mean ALL. That's lame Microsoft, can't you just add a backup feature to your ActiveSync junk?3> Its not available for Win mobile 7 upgrade, which could have been amazing because I have head really good reviews about it. But HD2 doesn't meet the \"hardware requirements\" for Win mobile 7.4> You have to use both the hands for using this phone efficiently. Or have a large hand. Ex. The browser has address bar way on the top but navigation is way on the bottom, makes it difficult to use it with one hand.5> I have to click so many different places just to get my address book up. Which unfortunately I cant even add in my home screen tabs.6> THERE IS NO EXIT BUTTON FOR ANYTHING. If I click back or \"X\" on the top right corner it doesn't mean quit in Windows mobile 6.5. It mean minimize. I have to go to Task Manager every time to quit applications. Which drains my battery in case I forgot.7> The hardware is so powerful but Windows media player will not play most of the videos by default. I had to download some other freeware program, which got unistalled when I did an upgrade.8> When your battery is almost dead, it will shutdown the phone all together, so no access to contacts no access to time, alarm, message or directions. It doesn't let you run on really bare minimum required resources.9> I can't see the timing of a call placed or missed or received. I can't even see the clock when I am setting an alarm, I have to go back to main screen to check the time again.10> The sound quality is OK, maybe its just me because my pearl(8200) has a speaker and a WOOFER, which is way better than HD2's speaker.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pro's:Its really COOL. It looks very smart.The camera is super awesome. I have not owned a cellphone with this great of a camera.I like the feel of it, not heavy.After you get over the coolness part it all comes down to usability, where it severely lacks(at least compared to a blackberry).In conclusion, it could have been really better if they would have TESTED the OS before just shipping it out with this amazing phone. I am really dissapointed in HTC's decision to go with Windows mobile 6.5. When windows 7 was just around the corner( they could have struck a deal with Microsoft to support HD2 on the contract).", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "HD2 is pretty and fast, but windows ruined it.", "Author": "Andrew Singleton \"Singleweird\"", "ReviewID": "R2U8LKYZTTMGI2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I went from a Blackberry Bold 9700 to the HD2 and I didn't realize how different phones could be. The HD2 is FRIGGIN HUGE. It WILL NOT fit in your hand so that you can thumb type accurately. The screen is absolutely brilliant for watching movies and for most touchscreen jobs but it's halfway to being an ipad. HTC has designed its own interface to mask Windows Mobile called sense which works decently but once you need to change settings or set up an email account, windows mobile is horrendous. it you're not using gmail or hotmail (like a school or work email account) it needs you to type in all the specific info to retrieve your emails, like the outgoing and ingoing servers which most people don't know. the email tab shows you a nifty pile of papers, the top of which is the current email and you can flick to get to the next one, but then theres an inbox button and you're like, wait aren't i already there? its very confusing. threaded texting is barely that, and the messages are too spaced out to be able to read quickly. it also makes you tap a button to see all your messages, where you can usually see a list of messages without having to navigate any further. Tmobile version is packed with entertainment features which were good, namely transformers 1 and 2 are preloaded and look and sound AMAZING on the huge screen. internet browsing is flawless and very fast, and there are a few browsers you can download and figure which you like best. im returning this phone because the email feature on it really doesn't work for me. blackberry does email best, period. maybe i'll look into android phones, who knows. if you use email often, i wouldn't recommend a windows mobile phone.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great hardware, okay software", "Author": "Pete", "ReviewID": "R3VQ8MW62BNZHC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "----------------------------------------------------------------  I purchased this phone to get away from the poor selection available through my carrier. I found that this phone offers the best touchscreen hardware available on the market, and a great USB, 3.5 etc. Perfect for my needs. I have used Windows Mobile before so I was aware of what I was getting into.  I received the phone on time according to my shipping request, and it was intact and had everything included. Everything works great but  - Windows Mobile can run inconsistently. Sometimes okay, sometimes badly for many reasons. Not just memory issues, but strange freezes and crashes, but only every once in a while. Can be corrected with custom softare. However the HD2 has the best Windows Mobile experience of any phone anywhere. This is IT for Micrsoft mobile until Windows Mobile 7.  - Definitely need a case for this monolith of a phone/screen protector too.  - Somewhat difficult to find software unless you know where to look. There is no app store for Windows Mobile worthy of mention. You must scoure the net to find the best ( GetyTV, Core Player, Slacker, Morphgear and MUCH more ) I found that I could come up with a match for ALMOST any App that Palm, Android or IOS provided... If I looked hard enough! Lots of footwork.  - NOTE: If you know where to look you can upgrade software OS for the phone too with XDA Developers and other sites. There is even an Android upgrade in works, so you can get a better Windows Mobile experience or whole new Operating System entirely. This is The Big PLUS for this phone.  - You can do this with other phones, but this Windows Mobile handset, like many others with the 6.1 - 6.5 software are VERY open source and easily modifiable  - Also has a GREAT camera. It starts out poorly but with softare updates it can be upgraded to a higher capture quality and eliminate the \"pink spot\" too... has a macro lens for great close ups...  All in all this phone has succeeced in getting me what I wanted. A great high end hardware handset, with a good software experience and open ended, so you can modify down the road somewhat easily. I enjoy this phone but primarily because I already know Windows and computers and Smartphones and how they work, very well. Without that knowledge, Im not sure I could enjoy this phone to its fullest extent.------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Fernando L. Calderon", "ReviewID": "R2F33J3WOOYOQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third HTC phone and it's the third time I'm totally satisfied with HTC's products. My past ones were HTC Tilt, HTC Fuze and now this one, the HD2. As a technician I always look for many things and details and this phone, in my opinion, was carefully designed, feels durable, you know: metal parts, screws (instead of crappy plastic tabs), solid and well finished. Regarding performance it's very fast and responsive, the 1Ghz processor does its job handling the OS (WM 6.5), programs, music, pictures and video in a smooth and fast way. Handling pictures with this speed and multitouch feels very good (I must not forget to mention the big, bright and beautiful screen it has). I've put some movies (divx and xvid ones) and the video reproduction is perfect, even with subtitles. Sense 2.5, the HTC's graphical user interface is well designed, practical and customizable (search the web for it), works flawlessly and it's eye candy. Phone calls's sound quality is better in my opinion than my previous phone, GPS (I use Garmin) works very well, also wifi, bluetooth didn't use yet. I loke taking pictures with this phone because you can touch in the screen the object you want to make focus on, and works. Two leds for flash (and for flashlight or torch!) gives a good amount of light. Picture quality is enough for me.Good luck!", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "best windows mobile phone \"so far\"", "Author": "H. Sachan", "ReviewID": "R2ZYDOPZIU8SPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this phone a long time. I looked at everything in the market and the main reason to wait for this was the snapdragon processor (1 GHz) combined with the amazing screen resolution (480x800) and the operating system.I'm a longtime user of smart phones and you can say that I'm a heavy user. I typically have multiple email accounts, use GPS for occasional driving or just for walking tours during travel, WiFi regularly during international roaming and Skype on 3G/Wifi for calls. Plus watching some videos, listening to live internet radios and pod-casts as well as use it as a media player.All the websites provide the specs, so I'll get into the plusses and minuses of the phone and my experience with them.Plusses:+ great capacitive touch screen. Very responsive. 480x800 resolution for crystal clear colors and videos+ Included Transformer movies (1&2) do a great job showing off the screen and the processor power. It's just HD video without any lags or hazy-ness. Very impressive+ comes with 16GB with only movies on it so you have ample of room for other media.+ plays live audio and video flawlessly over 3G+ HTC Sense is amazing and does a great job of hiding those Microsoft screens which you rarely get to. All the apps like email, messaging etc look much better with  Sense.+ Comes with a great animated weather screen+ very slim though a little on the heavy side+ 5.0mp Camera comes with flash which is good for close  up photos.+ charges thru PC USP port as well and has an option to be connected as a hard-drive, which is much better and faster compared to the Media Sync feature+ good battery life, lasts up a day and a half with regular 3g usage and video watching+ can be used as a WiFi Router/Access Point.+ comes with FM when you plus the head set as an antenna+ Swype app (included) as a replacement for keyboard rocks.. much faster to type with that.Minuses:- Huge screen is a plus but then you can't keep it in your Jeans pocket as it might put strain on the screen or device- even though camera is  a 5.0 MP, some pictures do tend to be grainy due to low light- Skype hs removed its support for WinMo 6.5 but the older version of apps can be found on the internet- Doesn't come with the \"Wifi Router\" app which basically turns your phone into a Wifi Access Point.. So you can have many people connect to your phone thru wifi and the phone provides the internet thru 3G.- Microsoft says that it won't provide Windows Mobile 7 on this device which could be a  bummer since you might see new Windows Mobile 7 devices in next few months. I'm sure you can go to XDA developer website and get yourself a WM7 rom.Other Notes:o  This phone will only get 3G on the TMobile and you won't be use it with AT&T; or any other network, for that matter, in Europe as TMO  uses 1700 as one of the band which is not used any where else. Although the Aussie version of this phone will work on AT&T;o  The above is true only for 3G while GPRS and EDGE are quad band which will work everywhere in the world.I've been using this for few days now and am very impressed with it. Haven't found any deal breaker issue so far, but will keep you guys updated.*** After few weeks- Lot of issues with getting flash player to work seemlessly with the browsers. I ended up installing flash player, plash player 10, flash lite 3.1, windows .NET compact framework to make it work and then installed the latest Opera browse, opera mini browser, Skyfire browser only to find that Flash now works in Skyfire.- Many people have stopped supporting windows 6.5 and are prepping for Windows Mobile 7 so difficult to get it working on this device. (e.g. Adobe flash player and Skype)- Different browser have different zoom in / zoom out settings which is frustrating.-- The Opera browser which comes installed has the pinch in and pinch out (expand) to zoom in /out.-- Opera 10 (new download) has click zoom in and out.-- Skyfire has its own icon where you can click on + and --- IE also has click (tap the screen) and then a slider on the right side to zoo in and out.I'd like all the browsers to support pinch in and out or atleast a common method.- Very less applications on 6.5 marketplace, for example kids learning apps are not available easily (at all?). This is due to lack of marketplace when this launched to they are scattered everywhere. The problem might be addressed with the launch of Windows Mobile 7 marketplace.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Smartphone.

Everyone told me that windows phones are known to have the slowest reaction time(THAT'S SO NOT TRUE). HD2's are very fast. 1GHz processor def does that job. You can pretty much do anything you will ever think off.I'm a high school student, and phones are just my thing. The screen is big enough to watch a full High Definition movie without no frustration. You will love watching movies with very high resolution. The camera is just beautiful.5 megapixel color camera with Auto focus and Dual LED flashlight is amazing. You can capture pictures on the go with 5mp resolution.Its great. I can't forget the touch screen.The screen is so sensitive, you don't need to press the screen. The screen is a heat sensor(just like the Iphone). Now the only issue i might have with this phone is the battery. Me being on Facebook 24/7 could drain your battery. I will give you an example: Searching the web very often and texting on 100% brightness could literary drain your battery BIGG time.Like after few hours your battery will go down to about 14%. And I thought the issue was from my phone, but all HD2's batt are like that. I personally dislike the battery because i use the phone everywhere and its never in my pocket. I always hated taking notes in class, but my HD2 made funner. Having Office mobile on the go is a GREAT feature. I easily pull up Microsoft Word and take notes. The Phone is extremely \"HOT\". HD2 is a very attractive phone and I hate all these keyboard phones out there because they're Huge. Oh and you will get alot of compliments.things like this \"omg i like your phone, what kind is it\" ;). yup.

Though i never actually used an android phone at that time,  I read some negative things about the Windows 6.5 operating system relative to android. Because i always wanted an android phone, I just bought one with an andriod 2.2 OS for my mom, thinking it would be much easier to use than the HTC modified Windows os that the HD2 has(since she isn't too good with electronics). But, after comparing both phones side by side, i feel HTCs custom modification/navigation on top of the windows platform makes it very easy to use, and arguably easier to use than the android interface.  Also anything I was able to do on an android, i was able to do on the HD2.  I cant speak for windows 6.5 phones by other manufacures though, only ones by HTC. The only things i liked better about the android OS phone was the large library of free apps, that its more customizable, and the voice search feature.(u can talk in a search term on the net or w/any other program and it will find it). Regarding the battery life on the HD2, i found it wasn't great initially, but after about 10-15 full discharge/recharge cycles, it seems to have improved greatly.(it last about a day and a half w/moderate usage)So overall, i think this is a great phone and HTC did a excellent job making the the windows OS very user friendly. I now don't regret not getting an android for myself.

I called and was told that it was unlocked. Well, there are substantial differences between an HD2 branded by T-Mobile and the International version:- The radio inside the phone do not have the same frequencies for data services- The ROM (programing of the phone) has additional software and can make your life difficult and the phone fairly unstable. I know someone who has a T-Mobile branded HD2 and he has to reboot the phone every day.- If you need software updates for the phone and you are not a T-Mobile customer, good luck!I was thankfully able to return the phone. Nevertheless, I am still waiting for my money back.... Based on my conversation with the company, I am pretty positive that they know what they are doing: ripping people off! Shamed on Amazon who support them!!!I did end-up ordering my HTC HD2 from another company. It was $200 more but I received an International one.

I called T-mobile (my provider) and asked how much it would cost to cancel my contract, and upon finding out decided to stay with them. Until Apple and AT&T; stop acting like its East Germany by denying us real competition and choice, I am stuck with this provider.But I REALLY wanted a good phone. I misplaced my blackberry and, just a week later, missed a doctor's appointment. I bit the bullet and got this phone.I LOVE it. Now, I am a Mac guy. I run Macs at home, and definitely love Apple products. However, I was able to download a program called Missing Sync and this phone can now Sync with my iCal and my contacts no problem. Works great.Furthermore, if I attach the phone to my Mac as an external drive, the phone came with software that, when opened, looks like the iPhone store but has apps for non-apple smart phone (Android currently has the best non-iPhone apps... I am sure Windows will catch up). With this software I can sync to my iTunes library no problem, and get photos from iPhoto onto the phone.And the phone itself. Wow. The screen is amazing, the phone is quick, and I have great service. For the price (with ANOTHER 2 year contact... grrr.) was really good and I am very happy with the phone.Strongly recommend this phone instead of the iPhone if you with a provider other than ATT. Windows just needs to catch Droid regarding Apps. Then this will be a great competitor to the iPhone.Addenda added Aug. 2nd: Having lived with this phone for awhile, I wanted to add a disclaimer. I very much like the phone, and I enjoy T-Mobile service, and the hardware aspect is great. The software aspect, specifically what we are burdened with from Microsoft, is actually terrible. I have had the time to go through all the apps, and Microsoft's offerings aren't just slightly inferior to iPhone and Android, they are COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY inferior. It is stunning. The iPhone's app store is superior to the competition, by a great amount. Android is really only better if you are an immoral jerk (as there is plenty of \"adult\" material for that phone).

Although they are same, just the 3G bands totally differ on all 3 and some cosmetic changes and branding.While this was a great phone in 2010 when it was launched but the future seems bleak now.Please google \"Windows Mobile July 15\"Windows mobile 6.5 has reached end of its life, would no longer be supported by Microsoft, and no new apps would be allowed to be developed, in fact the app marketplace is going to get shut down by July 15, 2012, so you won't even be able to buy apps.Pros:1) Nice bar phone, which looked similar to IPhone 3G and worked similar with HTC Sense app.2) Windows Phone 6.5 was quite stable as it had gone through many releases.3) This phone has 1GHz processor, but not dual-core, good for a 2010 phone, but not great per today's new generation phones.Cons:********US BUYERS BEWARE**********1) HTC HD2 differs with the model number on its usage with different GSM provider for 3G internet services.If you are in US, please DO NOT BUY T8585 as it does *NOT* supports 3G for AT&T; and not even for T-Mobile. a)If you want to use it in US with T-Mobile, buy the T-Mobile HD2 b)If you want to use it in US with AT&T;, buy the HTC T9193, Telstra model.If you are in Europe, or going to use it outside US then it may make sense to check the 3G service frequencies before you make this purchase.I came to know this hard way after buying the phone, I had no way to use it on 3G network.It works for calling, but the 3G internet service, data service are not supported for US. I don't think anyone would buy this smart phone and not use it for internet, so it doesn't makes sense shelling out on this model, if you are in USA.2) PLEASE NOTE - the days of this phone are numbered now, newer version of android are device specific and are no longer open source, so you will not be able to flash this phone to an android.3) There have been successful flashes, but a lot many times, people ended up bricking their phones.4) After Android flashing, there have been lot of issues with call drops and connection dropping, those who have successfully flashed theirs still have issues, so it is really not a fully functional android device, and you will end up spending a lot of your time figuring out how to rid of those problems, and many are still not fully resolved.5) Too costly on price value point at this time, no worth left after mid of this year, 2012.I would not recommend a windows 7 phone, as the marketplace is almost non-existent, I guess we are now just left with 2 new platforms to focus on Android and Iphone.

Enough Said-Wish it had more internal memory-Lack of Accessories (This WAS T-mobile's counter to the iPhone, but that was over a year ago so companies stopped making Cases, Screen protectors, etc. With a good search you can still find accessories just not as many as newer model phones)-Battery life (Leaving your battery up to the phone to manage is a big mistake. Believe me, your battery WILL be less than 20% in  about 5 hours of usage.)To wrap it up. Do yourself A BIG FAVOR and go to the XDA Developer's site and read up on the HD2. It is a HIGHLY customizable phone with limitless options. You can put a fully working Android OS (The Latest Gingerbread Update) on your phone in less than 20 minutes. IF you do decide to keep Windows Mobile 6.5, there are many custom ROMS for it as well. There are many fixes out there to correct some bugs like the freezing and crashing that occurs in Windows Mobile 6.5. All you have to do is read, download, and install the corresponding .cab files. You can even flash it's predecessor, Windows 7, ROM on the HD2!! Don't second guess this phone it's $300 and it performs just as good as other phones on the market.

I closed my T-Mobile account down, switched to Sprint, and bought the HTC Evo, which runs on Android. Now the Evo is an amazing phone.

I am a Windows woman and did not want to change, and I wanted a large screen.  (My current PDA was 4\".)  I have always had a Windows PDA and a cell phone, but this is the first time I have found a phone to combine them.  I wanted to stay with Windows, (I organize my life with little Excel spreadsheets,) and thought I should wait for Win Phone 7, but then I decided that I just couldn't give up the File Explorer, so I decided to stay with WinMo 6.5.My husband found this unlocked phone for me here at Amazon.  It was expensive, (although I have been watching the price slide down a bit for months.)  When I evaluated the cost of data service from our provider for a year plus the cost of a smartphone, even extending my contract, I came out ahead with the HD2.  So, I am using it only through WiFi, although before I unchecked the auto option, it kept slipping into the \"E\" data mode and worked fine.I am very happy so far.  It took a few days to learn to type on the soft keyboard, but I am fine now.  The screen is beautiful, and even bigger than my old iPaq PDA.  That means I am not using some of the sexier apps, but I don't need that stuff.  I love the customization, Favorite People, etc, but there are some things I have not found a way to change.  (Some of the black backgrounds, for example.)  The camera seems really great to me, and I love sliding and flicking my way through the software.  I miss the ability to put my office docs into landscape mode, but that's about it.All in all, it's a good thing, but I imagine it will disappear now that Win Phone 7 is released.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "HD2 Review", "Author": "Guto", "ReviewID": "R3FPFYWN0C6RT9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Product is good.Issue: Sometimes I need to power off and power on (reset).Maybe a new System Operational or Firware version can solve that.

I wanted to give myself some time before I left a review to get a good feel for it.1st - If you are looking for a phone with apps, avoid this phone like the Black Death. You will not find any app's worth having.2nd - Windows Based phone are horrible. I've had 2 now and hated both of them. I should have gotten an Android or an iPhone. Windows is just not a good OS for a cell phone. It's clunky, buggy, frustrating. I keep thinking \"There should be a much easier way to do this\" but there's not. I have mp3's on my phone that I can't seem to get off the phone. The Active Sync program is worthless.3rd - The phone itself is good, I like it. If it just had some other OS.If you could replace the OS, buy this phone. If you want a phone with apps, please, PLEASE buy an Android or an iPhone. I promise you, you'll be happier.*** UPDATE ***Owned the phone for a year now and it is the worst phone I've ever used. It locks up ALL the time, I'm continuously having to pull the battery out to reset it. I've already had to get 1 replacement phone because the software locked up and not even the store could get it working again.Texting on the phone is VERY buggy. I use the Swipe feature all the time and it always finding the wrong words and takes me longer then just typing. The touch sensing is not as accurate as an iPhone.Dont buy this phone expecting to us apps because its a joke. No one makes apps for this thing. The only apps you'll find are cheesy crap you'll never buy.If you are REALLY looking for an Android phone or iPhone, just save yourself the headaches and spend the extra money. This is NOT an option you'll be happy with. I dont make many reviews but I felt so passionate about warning people about this phone that I had to.*** UPDATE #2 - 6/15/11 ***The phone has died. This is the 3rd HD2 I've been given by T-Mobile. I tried using the barcode reader, the phone locked in camera mode, I had to pull the battery out to reset the phone (Like I have to do every other day when it locks on SOMETHING).

I realize its a windows phone, (oh wait really fast, its frozen even more) and I realize its running a lot of apps, but still, its 2011, a phone shouldn't freeze and lag (and I have to shut the whole phone down, fifth time this week, or was it fifteen) and stall and freeze again, and international text freezes everything, and if you are surfing the web and a text comes in the whole phones locks up, the setup is mundane, the Windows marketplace is the Gigli of online Apps, absolutely $@@$^& horrendous.So here's my daily take on the HTC HD2...(wait before that let me tell you that text are coming in from last week sent in redirect back to my phone)phone is used, calls come in, phone freezes as I am texting, phone locks up, phone text people back to the phone, days after a text was sent to someone else and shows it sent again, it freezes, five days in realize its filled with more bugs then Kate Capeshaw's scene going through the tunnel in Temple of Doom. (ahhh its working)My Iphone rarely if ever froze up, when running several apps and cruising web and texting. Perhaps, like others have said, if I root it, it will work perfectly. (oh sheeesh, multiple text came in while sifting through my phone book and seems its frozen again, or lagging at best, or wait is it lagging because I'm tethering, or is it I have so many programs running, uh duh...a few text, a tether and ....)Well at any rate, with the amount of phones saturating the market, why bother with a windows phone in any way to have to deal with these hassles like trying to book last minute  on amazing concert seats and the screen freezes while making a phone call and having your credit card out to place the charge on screen and you're in a cab with five minutes to spare and it all...goes...straight...down...the...drain...Oh gosh, just picked phone up and its frozen, imagine that. Part of the screen shows an incoming text, the other the keypad for the phone......NO NO NO NO, what a hack job in a market with so many opportunities, that something this horrid, this pathetic and it truly is, was even allowed past R and D.......Bottom line: Don't call it a smart phone, because its anything but intelligent, slick, great looking and people ask about it in public, but convenient in this busy era??
