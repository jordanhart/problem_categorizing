I received the product and bought a simcard to use it during my stay, so I could be able to talk to my friends in the US as well as my family at home. I was pretty much happy with the phone, until the third day, that it didn't work. It was dead. First I thought it was the battery, so I returned to the hotel to charge it. Unfortunately it was not.So I began looking for a Nokia dealer to see what was wrong with it. So, during my vacation stay in NYC I finally found someone who told me the motherboard was broken, that the phone could not be repaired. I was desperate, since it's hard to find an unlocked phone! I could finally return it but cannot describe the frustration all this situation caused me.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first Windows Phone! Amazing experience!", "Author": "Joel Moreno \"Jo Black\"", "ReviewID": "R1WOLMPRJ2VJTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and it is gorgeous. The screen just blew me away and the OS is very fast and user friendly. This is the first time I try a Windows phone and I have to say that it's been a wonderful experience. From now on I'll just use Windows phone for my daily use. My next gadget will be Nokia Lumia 920. I just can't look foward for this phone to hit the market. Nokia designs the best and most beautiful phones and now they work with the best OS on the market. Well done, Nokia and Microsoft!Now, let's talk about Apps. I've read many comments of people talking about the ''lack of app'' on the Marketplace. I can tell my own experience. I come from Android and also I had a Apple iPhone 4S and the only App missing on the Marketplace (talking about me and the apps I use the most) are Instagram and OVO (and I've heard Instagram is comming soon to Windows Phones before this year ends). I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MSN, KiK, Viber, Badoo, SkyDrive, Tango, Skype,Youtube,Shazam, SoundHound, Netflix, IMDb, Evernote, ESPN, CNN, Univision,SkyMap, TuneIn Radio, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and Weather much more... Also the Nokia App (Nokia Maps, Drive, City Lens, Music, Trailers, Creative Studio, Counters, Soundtracker, Transit, Contacts Transfer, Camera Extras and much more). The Marketplace keeps growing. The integration of Facebook, twitter, MSN, LinkedIn and Foursquare in my Windows Phone is AMAZING! I can put comments and give ''likes'' directly from my phone due to the AMAZING integretion between those Apps and my phone. and I don't have to go to the Facebook or Twitter App to do that.I'm totally in love with my Nokia Lumia 900 and its amazing OS! I 100% recommend it! If you wanna be different, switch and go for it! Nokia Lumia phones the amazing experience!", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Sidney", "ReviewID": "R3ILYKTPSD57SO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was unbranded as stated by the seller and it worked right out of the box, shipping was fast.

The cell phone is that you are selling the Nokia Lumia 900 black color 16GB Unlocked, RM 823 (3G HSDPA 850/900/1900/2100) again. I was surprised to see that the box appears and open the Nokia model that sold me was Nokia Lumia 900 black color 16GB Unlocked, RM 808 from AT & T. It seems disrespectful of you to me that what you really are selling as vendors are offering, for a scam. Besides presenting the cell is a failure, it goes all the time and I have to be relighting again, sometimes the calls are cut without having finished speaking. The reception on calls if it is good, is heard clearly. Tell me how I can do to fix this problem.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but not best", "Author": "JJBenz", "ReviewID": "R2Y6TEQ8PM46CA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very good phone, not the best thought.
