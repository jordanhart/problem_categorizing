It doesn't have all the 'app' capabilities of a multimedia phone, but if you need a quad-band that can make calls, and keep up with an active person - this is it.The only thing US buyers need to be aware of is that it's English formatting is based off of British standards.  Therefore certain features, such as date format or spelling of certain words, will not be what Americans are used to.  Ex: when setting up the phone, you must manually enter the date & time.  The date format choices are DD/MM/YYYY or YYYY/MM/DD.

We had high hopes when we purchased this \"unlocked\" mobile phone through Amazon.com, however, upon receipt we soon realized it was only partially unlocked.  We spoke to AT&T; Customer Support over the phone, took it to our local AT&T; store, followed by taking it to a Best Buy Mobile store, and all three sources, and their multiple representatives all concluded the phone was not fully unlocked.  This is a UK based cell phone, and we are US based customers currently on the AT&T; network.  The phone is unlocked in the sense that we can make and receive phone calls without issue, but not fully unlocked in that the phone does not permit us to send or receive photo messages, nor can we connect to the internet with it.  When AT&T; and Best Buy Mobile Reps went into the menu settings of the phone, to where they needed to adjust the corresponding tower/network code to remedy these issues, the UK code was grayed out (0.0.00.0) and therefore unchangeable to a US one.  I then e-mailed Samsung USA and Samsung UK with no response.  AT&T; phone based customer support was unable to proceed with any step-by-step instructions, as this UK phone is not in their US database, which is why we then went to our local AT&T; store instead, per their request. When our local AT&T; store could not help us in any way, despite the best efforts of their entire in-store team, we then proceeded to Best Buy Mobile, who also tried vigilantly, without success to address this issue.  We also Googled this issue, and found a few other folks who had these same issues, but nobody seemed to be offering any real solutions.  On that note, we even posted our issue on Fixya.com, with no response of any kind.  Having exhausted our efforts, today I called Amazon.com who was kind enough to e-mail us the necessary information to begin our full-refund process.  It's just unfortunate we could not find a fix for this issue, as I am sure it's out there somewhere, as we would have liked to keep the phone.  None of the US phones currently for sale at our local AT&T; store or local Best Buy Mobile are said to be waterproof, as this one is, and all of their \"military grade\" phones are flip-phones, with minimal water resistance.If you do not care about being unable to send/receive photo messages, or connect to the internet, and just want a durable waterproof phone, this may be the phone for you.  There's a \"Samsung B2100 Review\" currently on YouTube, which I will attempt to link below, showing the phone fully submerged in a tank of water, receiving a phone call, and still working perfectly when they take it back out.  Oh, and it has a built-in flashlight too, just in case (no camera flash though).[...]", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for what it is", "Author": "Wes", "ReviewID": "RBDV54YQA1ZXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this phone isn't for everybody. But, that being said it definitely was the perfect phone for me. I was looking for quite a while for a phone that, on the inside, was nothing more than a phone (send & receive calls, send & receive text messages, and store numbers) and on the outside was durable enough to stand up to some healthy abuse. I haven't dropped it in a river or run over it with my truck, but I do shop work everyday and have dropped it, banged it against machinery, and my wife threw it at the dogs once, and it's still ticking just fine.I have read some reviews about it not being able to send media messages or access the internet if you're in the US. To me, that's fine. I haven't even tried to because I didn't care about that to begin with. So, if you're looking for a phone with some brains in it, you might want to look somewhere else. If you just want a phone that can take a good beating, this one is right for you. Above all, my best points of impression are:1) Screw Secured Battery Cover (regular snap-on ones are the first things to break otherwise)2) One-piece keypad cover (good for water resistance and reducing dust contamination)3) One-piece body (sliders and flip-phones will always break eventually, I don't care what they might say)4) A LED flashlight that could blind a grizzly bear (you never know when you'll need it)5) Small size (the only other one-piece phone I found similar to this was the even-more rugged $600 military spec. phone, and that sucker was around eight inches. This phone does fit into the fifth pocket of most blue jeans, by the way.)Other high points that I didn't expect, but have come to enjoy:1) FM Radio with the headphones acting as the antenna2) Music player3) SD micro card ready4) Loud speaker (for music and speaker phone)", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone, lots of features, and works on AT&T;'s network", "Author": "D.

I live on the coast, so a phone that is waterproof is particularly helpful. Bluetooth works great for transfer of photos to my computer and contacts between phones. The FM radio is nice too, although I have not used it too much, since it requires the headphones to be plugged in for reception. The multimedia player read the audio and video stored on my Micro SD card, and is intuitive enough to be able to play music by artist/album/genre/etc.I noticed a lot of concerns about getting multimedia messages (MMS) to work on this phone from other reviewers.

Do you want a sleek, sparkly little sliver of plastic with \"apps\" and a screen that does tricks when you poke it? If so, run. Run back to your cozy little Starbucks and...blog, or whatever it is you people do. This is a phone for men and hardy women. This is a phone with which you could bludgeon a wolverine. You do not text with this phone. You do not Tweet. You call people and tell them how it's going to be. True, you can do that with lots of phones--but with this one, you can do it while fording the turgid waters of the Nile. You can use its horrid little camera to record new and grotesque species in the depths of the Amazon Basin. You can make dinner reservations for two at that Hungarian place on 34th while galloping toward the airfield pursued by a mysterious hitman.

Henry's review for directions.The one thing I don't like is that you have to set the clock again every time you swap out the battery. That gets kind of annoying.6 MONTH UPDATE:Having now owned this phone for half a year, I stand fully behind my initial review. I moved to a different continent, and it welcomed the new SIM card with open arms--and I got the internet working here, too. I've capsized with this clipped to the straps of my kayak and watched most of my equipment ripped loose as the craft was scraped over partially-submerged trees by the torrent. When I caught and righted the kayak, the phone demurely informed me that I had a voicemail awaiting my leisure. Just last month, I hit a patch of black ice on my bicycle and the phone ground into the asphalt under me as I skidded from the crash. It came out in far better shape than I did, exhibiting only a slight scuff on the screen protector I made from packing tape.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tough, tough and ridiculously tough", "Author": "Arcadian", "ReviewID": "RORANDF0DXAXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these about a month ago.  One of them has worked flawlessly for the past 8 months, while the other failed within 3 days of normal use.  The defective one started turning on and off every 5 minutes or so, but thankfully Amazon took it back and gave me a refund.The phone is a work and play beast.  It really is water proof to 3 feet (tested it for just under 30 minutes, so as not to exceed the max rating).  I took pictures underwater at a hotel swimming pool.  The pics came out pretty good for a basic cellphone.  But really, the phone is intended as a work beast.  It takes a hell of a beating.  I've dropped it, stepped on it, kicked it a good distance while dropping it, froze it in water (for the lols) and regularly wash it with soap and water or even glass cleaner.  Perhaps, its only weakness is the little side cover for the charger port: it will take on water (according to the manual) if you forget to close it.THE SCREENIt's small, simple, basically designed for durability, so don't expect web surfing to be practical.  Also, it doesn't scratch easily, but if you put in in your pocket along with some keys, don't expect any miracles.THE KEYBOARDIt's rubbery, a bit hard to press at times, works fine for dialing up phone numbers, but texting can be frustrating.  On the other hand, it's practically unbreakable, waterproof, and washable.THE CASEIt's built for war.  It bounces like a hard rubber ball when dropped, and then it's ready for more abuse.THE FLASHLIGHTI love this thing.  It's always there when you need it most.  It has average brightness and does eat the battery pretty fast, but it's so handy that I could care less. There is one bad thing about the flashlight though: it's very easy to accidentally switch it on while talking on the phone.  After a couple of days, though, I got used to not pressing the light button, so no worries.THE EARPHONE PIECEIt's OK as long as it's kept properly aligned to one's ear, otherwise the volume can fade out a bit.  It is hard to hear in noisy environments, though.THE SPEAKERPHONEIt works quite well, sound quality and volume wise.  But because the feature is hidden when there are no active calls, I would expect most people to have trouble figuring out how to activate it, let alone realizing that it exists at all.  (If I remember correctly, It can only be activated during an active call by pressing the large navigation selection button.)THE BATTERYOn a single charge and without making/receiving calls at 77 degrees Fahrenheit, It will survive 5 to 6 days on standby.  Talk time is about 6 hours with a loss of roughly 17% to 25% per day of battery reserve which is what keeps the phone on standby.  If you fiddle with the settings or do texting, the LCD backlight and extra CPU activity with eat the battery pretty fast (2 to 3 hours).  (Worth noting: varying ambient temperatures will likely give different battery life results. Putting the phone in your pocket, for instance, may make the battery warmer resulting in almost triple the daily reserve loss. And yes, batteries of almost any kind drain faster as they get warmer.)RECEPTIONSeems to work wherever I go.  No connection drops, except when standing next to large metal structure and even that is rare.BLUETOOTHThe 'hands free', works flawlessly with my car's factory receiver is all I can really say.  I haven't really tried it with any other devices, though.THIS IS NOT A PRETTY PHONEIt's intended for situations that would kill an iphone instantly.  It really is tough and dependable, and for once I don't have to buy a stupid, overpriced protector or worry about some pretty looking phone falling or getting scratched.  On the other hand, it obviously won't run apps like an iphone, and it's is borderline terrible for texting, so be warned (not that I care for texting).", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Always reliable", "Author": "Charles Valenzuela \"cav2108\"", "ReviewID": "R1G2SCI6X2IQXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Always reliable.

Green", "ReviewID": "R2CH1OY5XMNH1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros of the Samsung B2100:1.  Waterproof:  I am a kayaker.  I put a 1.5\" X 2.5\" strip of adhesive backed Velcro permanently on the back of the Samsung B2100 battery panel.  I stick the phone to the deck of my kayak.  The phone has a large eyelet on the top of the phone which I attached a thin lanyard that I then fastened to medal ring attached to my kayak in case I accidentally drop the phone in the river.2.  Flashlight is bright:  I train for marathon kayak racing every other day and often finish paddling after dark.  This flashlight provides enough light for me to hike up a quarter mile trail through the woods to my house.3.  FM Radio is very clear:  I had been using a Sony TV/Weather/FM/AM Walkman SRF-M80V strapped to my arm when I work out at the local gym, but when I increase the resistance on the stepper or exercise cycle there is an accompanying increase static on the Sony Walkman radio; but with the Samsung B2100 phone's FM Radio there is no static and the signal is clear.  The Samsung B2100 radio doesn't significantly drain the battery.4.  I haven't experience any dropped calls, and found that the coverage is good in the quad-state area (Pennsylvania/New Jersey/New York/Delaware).5.  Battery life is good.Cons of the Samsung B2100:1.  I wanted the ringtone \"Chariots-of-Fire\" on this phone.  This ringtone is sold at AT&T; which is my phone's service provider.  I took the Samsung B2100 to AT&T; for their assistance.  Despite three separate visits lasting one hour each with two different AT&T; technicians, they were unable to connect to the Internet to download this ring tone for the AT&T; website, or from any other website.  Problem is that the Samsung B2100 was designed for United Kingdom Internet providers, and will not accept an Internet address which are over a few characters long from United States Internet providers, which means you can connect to a couple of short addresses like MSN or Google, however, if you need to go to a website with a longer Internet address, it comes up Internet address error.2.  It is an United Kingdom phone with no Samsung support in the U.S. - when I was unable to connect fully to Internet providers in the United States I first contacted Samsung International who referred me to Samsung U.S.A. who referred me to Samsung United Kingdom who referred me to AT&T; U.S.A. who then referred me back to Samsung U.S.A. resulting in no solution to my Internet connection problem.3.  The Samsung B2100 is a 3G/MPEG3 phone.  If you want the same phone in a 4G/MPEG4 phone suggest the newer version of this phone, the Samsung B2710, which is sold on amazon.co.uk [...] The Samsung B2710 looks identical to the Samsung B2100, but is a slightly bigger phone with larger battery, anti-scratch window, higher resolution screen, and a G4/MPEG4 phone; however the Samsung B2719 will cost you twice a much.4.  Although the Samsung B2100 is a rugged phone I like carrying it in a belt-clip carrying case, but I had to switch to a larger pouch since every time I returned it to the snug carrying case both the volume keys and the flashlight key would be depressed and the flashlight would go on, and the volume would go beep-beep-beep.  If you wait a couple of seconds before putting the phone into a carrying case, which allows the keyboard to then automatically lock, then you won't have this problem; but it is an annoyance to always to have to wait before put the phone back on your belt.  The keyboard lock only has an option to turn on or off, not an option to set the time before the keyboard locks.5.  I have heard that the screen scratches easily, but I prevented that problem by just putting a strip of 2\" clear packing tape on the screen which works fine if you put the tape on slowly at an angle pressing out the air bubbles.  Clear tape is inexpensive and can be replaced as often as needed.Notes:A.  The Samsung B2100 takes a removable SIM card, so it cannot be used phones that do not have a removable SIM card like the phones used by Verizon.B.  The phone package does not come with a SIM card (which you can get from your phone service provider).C.  Nor does the phone package come with a micro-SDHC card which you can purchase on line.  You only need an micro-SDHC if you want your phone numbers stored separately from the SIM card or if you want to store music to listen to with your ear phones.  A 2GB or 4GB micro-SDHC will work fine.D.  You can load up the micro-SDHC card from you computer, either by putting the micro-SDHC card into a USB connection on your computer, or downloading it directly to the phone from your computer, but you will need to purchase a data cable for a SAMSUNG phone.  A data cable does not come with the phone package, however, these data cables are inexpensive on the Internet.E.  The phone package comes with stereo ear plugs with an on-off mike for answering calls.F.  The phone package comes with an AC battery charger, but you will need to purchase a DC battery charge if you want to charge the phone's battery while in your car.F.  Although there are many cons I gave it a four star rating because this phone basically does what I need it to do which is to be able to make and receive calls while in the middle of a lake or river in my kayak without having to take an ordinary mobile phone out of a sealed carrying case, and also be able to use it this as an all-round phone on land.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted in a phone, when it works.", "Author": "JDavis", "ReviewID": "R1RB1KSFFP11UZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only use my cell phone for phone calls and basic texts, so this phone is perfect for those simple tasks.  I am not reviewing the email or web browser programs b/c I don't use these features.  I have never had a camera on my phone before so this is fun.  I bought a micro SD card with an SD adapter, so I am able to save the photos on my computer.At first I almost returned the phone right away.  It didn't work at all with my T-Mobile SIM card.  A message would show up on the screen: \"Insert SIM\".  I went to an AT&T; store to see if their SIM card would work with this brand, new, unlocked phone.  It didn't.  I then went to a T-Mobile store and asked them if they could deactivate my current SIM and activate an older, unactivated, Legacy SIM.  This one worked.Now I am in Australia and this phone is working fine with a Telstra SIM.Upon further research, I found that the Samsung B2100 phone only uses a 2G GSM network, which is possibly why it wouldn't work with T-Mobile's newer, 4G SIM cards (and w/ AT&T;??? - although it looks like some reviewers have had success using this phone with AT&T;).  It looks like Samsung just updated the B2100 with the new B2710, which uses a 3G GSM Network (GSM 850, GSM 900, GSM 1800, GSM 1900, 3G 900, 3G 2100 frequencies, according to [...].  Maybe this phone might be able to support the newer 4G SIM cards from T-Mobile and AT&T;?  That would be nice.As for now, I have given the B2100 five stars because it is able to do everything I want it to do with the carriers I currently use in the USA and Australia.Update - 21 Mar 2011 - Three stars instead of five.Phone calls drop or SIM ends up not registering, very regularly unfortunately.  I get the message \"Insert SIM\" and then have to turn the phone off and on a few times before it registers.  It has become extremely annoying, enough so that I have to give up on the phone and I plan on returning it once I return to the USA.  I am really bummed about this.  I will have to save my money and buy the updated 3G version (B2710) when it comes down in price.Update - 21 June 2011 - upgrade to 4 starsSince I have returned to USA, phone has been working fine with my T-mobile SIM (the older style, Legacy SIM).  Therefore, even thought it didn't perform well in Australia, I'll keep this B2100 after all (I just hope it works in other countries).", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone hater LOVES this phone", "Author": "Marilyn K.

When I inserted my T-mobile SIM card, the screen refused to go past the \"B2100\" screen and simply flashed that image, go blank, and then flash it again, as if the phone were trying to restart but couldn't.  I couldn't even turn off that phone at that point without taking out the battery.  I have newer version of the T-Mobile SIM card so I thought that might have been the issue (some reviewers were saying that the phone works if you transfer your acct to an older version of the T-Mobile SIM card).  And it worked perfectly fine with my boyfriend's AT&T; SIM.  Anyway, long story short, I reordered the phone from a different seller and it works perfectly fine!  So I agree with many of the other reviewers.  When this phone works, it's amazing.  When it doesn't, it can be really frustrating and take a huge chunk out of your time just trying to resolve the issue.  It's really a gamble if you receive a working phone or not.  Luckily, I got one that worked on the second try without having to change my SIM card.So other than that issue, the phone is perfect for my lifestyle.  I'm extremely clumsy with my phones (dropping them in paint, out of moving vehicles, the works) and I only need to make calls and to text.  This phone does just that and more.  I haven't had any trouble with muffled speakers (because of the waterproof seal) or even dropped calls.  Texting works perfectly fine. The LED light on it is SUPER bright and just awesome when you can't get your hands on a flashlight.  It also has an FM feature which I thought I wouldn't use but is actually really fun.  Plus the battery lasts for a week or so.  I've left my phone on for 3 days straight now and it's still at full bars (but that's with MINIMUM usage).  It has all the standard features including organizer with calender, alarm, etc etc. One minor thing is that sometimes when I'm making calls, I'll hear my own voice from my phone, but it'll be delayed which is really distracting.  But most times, everything is clear.Overall, a great basic phone with awesome durability.

The so called warranty is pretty lame also, hopefully this won't turn into an $80 paper weight.Updated July 2 2011A few more months have passed now and I no longer use the samsung B2100, after repeated complaints from persons on the other end of the line that my voice was muffled, far away or just could not hear me. One person even said I needed to trow the phone away.  In addition the power charger started tripping the GFI outlet where its plugged in when the phone was charging.The goods news if there is any is that I was starting to like the phone despite the tiny number font it does have some nice features like call block.Read the Amazon phone warranty closely, you have to pay shipping both ways and repairs can take 3 weeks or more so you better have a spare.  I am a big fan of Amazon but like I said earlier the Warranty is lame.Second update July13 2011I decided to contact amazon by phone regardy the warranty on the B2100 to see if i could possibly get it repaired and see what it would cost for the shipping. To my pleasant surprise Amazon's rep came back on the phone after having me on hold for a couple minutes to tell me they would give me a full refund and emailed a ups shipping label.Needless to say Amazon is the best to me.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid well constructed phone but is it \"waterproof\"?", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R1QAQO8L7IBWMO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What comes in the box:BatteryAC adapterPhoneNo DC adapterNo charging dockConstructionThis is solid phone with rubber protected buttons, and a sealed battery compartment.  I just needed a solid phone that would withstand bumps and drops.  I also wanted a \"Waterproof phone\" for when I go to the beach.  One peculiar comment in the instruction manual is that this is \"Water-resistant\" and not intended to be submersible. The flashlight function works very well and is a nice addition for a survival phone (when camping, for example).The lens is not sealed but I doubt it will be cracked.UseThe menu system, because it's an international phone is not as intuitive.  For example, the Bluetooth options are in the Applications section.  The menus are customizable.The screen is clear and bright.  The display of pictures is less than optimal.  The image quality when exported is actually quite respectable.Battery life is very good, especially if you don't use the backlit keys, screen and flashlight excessively.Sound quality is good for the caller and the recipient.  Once paired with the Bluetooth headset, the sound and reception are clear.The FM radio is a nice touch but only works with the plug-in headphones.  It's great for when you're out and about but carrying headphones is not optimal for practical use on a daily basis.Extra helpful features include a calculator, stopwatch, timer, calendar, memo pad, and camcorder/camera.OverallOverall, this is a solid phone.

The phone is fairly simple to operate as theres not much to operate. Its ruggedly built and weather proofing was in the front of the designers from its appearance. Quality of the calls started degrading after a few short months.I wouldnt recomend this phone, I dont believe the companies story about blaming Amazon for the poor quality. Im suspicious of any company selling a product but neglects to point out that something as basic to a phones function of VM is locked out (even though the service is provided by the phone service I purchased) is probably low enough to point the finger at someone else decrying \"its not my fault its the other guys\".Addendum: Hassle Free Cell Phones contacted me via email regarding my poor review.

So I got this phone because my old clamshell Samsung was too old.  I've had this phone for close to a year and it's still performing like it did on day one.  I also got this phone because it uses a simcard and is unlocked so that I cold use it internationally in my travels, but I haven't been able to stick in one place long enough to warrant buying a different simcard.  Plus, the only thing with that is that everytime you take the battery out the time and date reset.  It's a good 4.5\" long, 0.7\" deep and 2\" wide at the buttons, which seems a bit unwieldy but the curved corners make it look and feel a bit smaller.  I was considering getting the bigger and newer version, but I'm definitely glad I got this smaller one or else I fear the bigger one wouldn't've in my pocket as comfortably.I've dropped countless times on dirt, asphalt, carpet, and in my kitchen without any scratches on the screen, although the plastic sides have some marks from our history together.  The screen has gotten dull from me not keeping a screen protector on it while I carry it in my pocket.  I haven't dropped it into water yet, and I don't plan on testing it, but I've talked on it in the rain without needing to worry about it.  The locking battery compartment is a bit annoying, but it's to keep the sealing o-ring seated properly.I've used this phone with oil and dirt on m hands, and that junk just doesn't stick to it for some reason.

This is a sturdy phone, yet not actually not too bulky. I did have trouble opening the back to place the battery and sim card in, but that was due to  the tight sealing to protect the phones battery from water  damage, and it gives me comfort that  even if the back accidentally does get unlocked its not going to  fall open. I do want to say i was very skeptical about buying a bar phone, as I am not a big fan of them, but this is a really cool phone.* Sound quality is great, not the  best but still  slightly above average* graphics are pretty nice, nothing like an iPhone but still good, I would say decent graphics* take pictures and video, I  must add the picture editing on the phone is immense. I have owned at least six  phones in the last 2 years, and this is by far the  best when it comes to photo editing. I still have not fully checked it all out.* nice selection of languages I counted ten, one of which is English(The Queen's English mind you) and the other nine eastern European languages. it  does not  come in French or Spanish but you still can type in Spanish and French.* ringtones: It has a nice selection of ringtones, you  should be able to find one  you like. the new text message ringtone however cannot be changed, or at least I have not found a way to do so.* it has an incredible flashlight that has already come in handy many times, do not point at face as it is really bright.* Battery life is great, average lifespan I experience is on average 3 days I have only needed to charge it 2-3 times in the two weeks  I have owned it.  theres so much more, but I do want to note a couple things1. this is an international phone, it is not fully unlocked, if you are in the united states (AT&T; or T moble) you will only be able to  make calls and text normal messages,  but  honestly that is only reason you need a cell phone, so I do NOT see that as a minus2. charger: this phone will most likely not be united States Plug-in capable, but do not fear, these  wonderful people at  Hasslefree will include an adapter that should work for the Americans. HOwever if it does not,  Just go to your nearest Wal-Mart, they carry  chargers that will work, I paid US$9 for  ONN brand charger it was cool came  with  a cool blue light to let me know it works, you are still getting  a great deal on the phone, so  a little  bit more shouldn't be a problem3. The manual: yes there is a strong  chance your manual  will come in  Bulgarian, or Russian, But  you are most  likely buying this phone new, and that is out of the  sellers power of control, you can easily find an english translation here:  [...] <--spoiler alert this one is in english.4. this is a heavy duty phone, the main reason I  bought it, it is waterproof, but this does not mean to  go swimming with it all the time, it has a rugged  shell but this does not mean  you throw it on the ground stomp on it and run it over with you jeep.  its ruggedness and waterproofness is there as a precaution NOT AS A CHALLENGE.(note: do not go deep sea diving as it will not hold up to the pressure. enjoy this phone with much responsibly. in short this is a great phone, with  some downsides But they do  not really effect the overall greatness of it.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Unlocked", "Author": "Clari Gilbert", "ReviewID": "R12QSJN4U2NV2R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my husband who likes simple things, we are in the Caribbean so we he needed a quad to ensure that it works and of course it worked perfectly with the local phone company.
