Kim", "ReviewID": "R1A7OMWJD107W2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for over a year and a half, I've had to have it replaced twice already.  The first time the outer display stopped working.  All three of the phones do this thing where the phone crashes out of nowhere, which gets really annoying when I'm in the middle of writing a text  message.  Also, the camera button is on the outside, where it takes pictures  by itself, usually in my pocket.  Sometimes I can't hear the person on the other side, or they can't hear me.  This phone has way too many issues.  On the bright side, the operating system is easy to use.  Also the timer is cool and so is the fact that you can set multiple alarms.  The settings are preset so you cannot set them up on your own.  The phone overall just has way too many problems though.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "My phone!", "Author": "Manga Addict \"Li\"", "ReviewID": "R2D9EF7US1SRI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone last month and it is a really good phone.

The camera viewfinder is barely visible because it is 4:3 ratio and it is like an inch from corner to corner. The ringtones are cheesy and my motorola E815 is so much better. the camera is only VGA (.3 megapixels) versus 1.3 on the E815.Its a good looking average phone though. I do warn you that it's not Black and grey its light blue and a little bit darker than navy blue.______________\\\\  //Peace out____,,,\\\\//____________\\\\\\--_-\\____________\\___\\\\/", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung t319 TMO to Go Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZPXX9Z54L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000H1WRSA"}}
