So I switched That new phone's information  to the spare phone I purchased. So I am outone phone already. The second phone that I had originally set up I found that it will not go to contact names that I try and get to. I have to scroll down to get to what ever name I need to call or text. Now that I am over my 30 day sellers warrenty I can't send them back. Ship date on the mailing envelope is 1/26/2011. Phones were ordered on 12/31/2010. At this point with very little time to set up and try out before warrenty was up. I am not happy with 2 out of three phones not working.

For several days, I left phone messages and sent emails to this seller. Finally I received an email back with an RMA# to return my item. I originally purchased the EnV2 LG cellphone that was described as refurbished MINT Condition. When I received the phone and contacted Verizon Wireless to activate the unit, the MEIN had been previously assigned to another account since 2009...and it was associated with a Samsung Reality. I called Verizon's technical support dept; then I stopped in at a Verizon location. No one could help me since the phone was already assigned to someone else. I then emailed OEM Shop again and requested a call back from a manager. Still to this day (2 weeks later), no one from OEM shop has called me back.

Didn't want a smart phone, just a simple phone to call and text.  The last one worked great for over five years until it simply wouldn't hold a charge any more, even with a new battery.  Since the phone is an old model, I hard a difficult time finding one that was brand new (I didn't want to buy a used phone).  But, after months of searching, I FINALLY saw one advertised as new.  It was the ONLY phone like this that I found that was advertised as new--not refurbished--but never used.  But it was too good to be true.  As soon as I rec'd it, I could tell that it was a used phone.  The seller had stuck some stupid clear plastic over the screen and other places that are typically covered with that peel-off protective plastic coating that comes on new phones.  It was flimsy, cheap plastic coating that looked like it had been peeled off another phone and stuck onto the phone I just purchased.  Also, the phone was not in an LG phone box and it didn't come with a manual or anything else.  To make matters worse, I wasn't able to transfer my contacts, even though Verizon assured me I could, either by their cloud technology or by taking it into one of their retail store.  No luck with the cloud so I took it into a Verizon store, but they were unable to transfer my contacts, so I had to manually re-enter hundreds of contacts from my old phone to the \"new\" phone (newly acquired, anyway). I should have known better than to believe an unused phone of an old model would suddenly appear.  I paid a new phone price for an old, used phone.  Cosmetically it looks new, but the keys stick and I keep getting weird messages like \"acquiring application info.\"  Probably the seller didn't completely remove all the application bits before selling it to me.  But it works, I'm familiar with it, and I don't have time to send it back and shop around for a new phone.  I needed a phone bec. my old one was dying fast and I don't have a landline.  I got ripped off, but don't have time to return it to the seller and can't be without a phone.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "RFFR", "ReviewID": "R2S524G3U10SHN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is very good for talk and text.

Their service plans are too expensive for my budget now, so I'm phone shopping for something more affordable.As for the actual phone: The full keyboard is my favorite feature. I text often, so having a keyboard that allowed me to do so quickly and easily is handy. The buttons aren't too close together despite the size of the phone, which isn't necessarily thin but is small. The buttons on the front are large, so dialing on the front pad is also easy. I must say this phone is durable as hell - I've dropped it more times than I can remember, and the front and interior screens never broke. The paint chipped around the edges, but that's no big deal. I've also spilled water and tea on it several times, and there's no heavy water damage. The buttons do stick from time to time, which is mainly only annoying on the exterior face since the OK button won't unlock the front buttons to dial sometimes (and that's why I love having the interior keyboard!) The interior keys do stick, too. I find it funnier than annoying- I'll be texting and suddenly I have a string of three to six N's or C's in the middle of a word. Those issues are all ware-and-tear problems. Considering I've had this phone for over three years and it stills works, I'd say it's a good phone.I don't use the phone for more than texting, picture msg and calling, so its internet features are lost on me (it was too expensive anyway). I do like that you can download certain free apps like song recognition. I used that one a lot. I couldn't use the music player since the phone isn't compatible with my computer, so I have no comments for that feature. Picture quality is fair for having no zoom. Video works quite well also, but only takes 30 second clips. SD card capable, which is awesome since the internal memory isn't large.My biggest problem with the phone is the battery life. I've read reviews for other phones and people say they get several days of battery life - that's never happened with this phone. From the day I bought it (at the Verison store), I've had to charge it every day. On standby (no texting, calling or anything) it MIGHT stretch to a day and a half now. The bar meter never accurately estimates battery life. One minute it says I have three bars, fifteen minutes later it say one bar, five minutes later it goes back to three bars. I have to plug it into the charger whenever I make a call longer than ten minutes depending when I last charged it. It's annoying, but I usually don't sit down to lengthy phone calls unless I'm home anyway. Might cause more problems for others, but it's something I've learned to deal with.Overall, I like this phone. I really am sad I must switch now.Make this a gsm model!", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didnt work.", "Author": "Jamie Reitz", "ReviewID": "R365FX1J8945EC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Recieved the phone 2 days later than expected, i wouldnt stay powered on took it to verizon wireless and they saidIt was the battery pins not touching.

Worthless devices for music and media, unless you want to buy them from verizon.  They are a good texting phone when they work, but as long as we have had them they randomly shut themselves off- while you are texting, when you close them, sitting in your pocket etc.  Looking at problems others had had with them online, it appears LG had issues with the battery contacts on these phones, and never really fixed them. You move, bend, or bump them and the power goes off.  Not handy.  When we brought them in to Verizon they claimed a firmware update would fix them- it did not.  We are switching  to T-Mobile for better reception in our area in any case, and I am tired of Verizon going from \"new every two\", to a $100 discount, to a $30 \"credit\" for a two year contract, while they add a BS \"upgrade\" fee for you to switch to a smart phone so they can sell you more junk you do not need.  \"Share everything\" appears to cost more than anything else as far as family plans go. Those are Verizon issues, in any case after these ENV 2s I would be hesitant to buy any LG phone.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "SIMPLE AND USER FRIENDLY", "Author": "LESLIE POE", "ReviewID": "R1IR7MPCW3UYPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PURCHASED IT FOR MY AUNT FOR MOTHERS DAY AND SHE LOVES.
