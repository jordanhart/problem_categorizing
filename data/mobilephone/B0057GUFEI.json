So just subtract $99 from the price you pay for a TML w 1200 minutes to get what you paying for this fabulous little phone under this offer -- $10.I bought two more LG 800G's just this week from this vendor because this is one of the best cell phones ever offered by TracFone.  Now I have four LG 800G's -- one for myself, one for my wife, and one for each of my daughters. I also purchase a Motorola EX124G TML, but I sent it back to TracFone.  In my opinion the LG 800G is a much better value.These LG 800G's under this offer are all Software version 10d (S/W V10d) which is why they are discounted with triple minutes.  What you get are new double-minute phones with a pin to convert to a triple minute for life with 1200 minutes.TracFone is phasing into a later version LG 800G with software version 10e (S/W V10e). But you can only get the newer 10e version at Net10 - without triple minutes (in fact, not even double minutes.)[EDIT 18 Dec 2011:  All new phones now being shipped are versions S/WV10e]Some early users of the V10d LG 800G's reported having text message issues.  I never had any issues with text messages, but the real kicker is that if you do, TracFone will replace your version 10d with a newer version 10e for free  - and your TML and all you minutes transfer -- You can't lose.If you are new to the LG 800G, I suggest you frequent the Turk Forum for clues on how to use all the many features of this jewel, as the documentation that comes with the phone is very skimpy.

But,in this age of gadgets, I must admit that I like the extras. It's just easier to deal with, the touch screen that is. I like using a cell phone for my morning alarm also and found several of the ringtones very pleasing to awaken to(I set three morning alarms).I was a little nervous about the triple minutes for life actually coming through. So when I activated the phone I asked the rep if he could tell. He said yes, spent a lot of time with his supervisor, said it was only double minutes and gave me a number to call to \"get the triple minutes\" since it's not a TracFone promo. When I called the number they said, as I thought, that it was in the phone and if I got 1200 minutes it was triple. I still didn't want to wait to find out that is was not the case, there's only a ninety day warranty and a 7 day return, so I purchased the $10, 30 minute deal online. Sure enough I got 90 minutes.When I tried to add the 40 bonus minutes for July from the TracFone Saving Book I only receive 10 minutes. I called  so they gave me 40 minutes. I ended up with a bonus of 50.I probably should have mentioned first that this is an incredible deal: A double minutes for life card with a year of service and 800 minutes is the same price, $119, but without the phone! If you purchased a 450 and 120 minute deal you'd have 1140 minutes with the dmfl phone and that would cost you $120 plus tax, no phone.I already have an MP3 player but I can put the same sdhc card in the phone and have my music. I have good camera, a DSLR, but sometimes it's overkill, this has a 2mp camera and video. The touch screen makes the calculator easy to use. The virtual QWERTY keyboard is great for texting, though I wish it was a little more responsive, and maybe I can do something about that in the touch calibration.OK, I just realized the calculator can be switched to scientific with cos,sin,tan,log,etc; it shifts between radians and degrees. I work with algebra and trigonometry with kids so there's another plus.I've only had it for a day. Maybe I'll change my mind or find things I don't like. But, for now I really like it.UPDATE: I've had this phone for about six weeks and I like it even more as I become more dependent on the features. Still no problems with texting. Seemed at first that the touch was not responsive but I guess it was just me because now it's fine.I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA THAT USUALLY HAS NO CELL PHONE SERVICE. This phone has limited service but I can still use it at home in a pinch; we've learned to depend on the land lines and I use it mostly for when I travel. Yesterday I got a text with it under my pillow.My daughter looked at some pictures I took with it and thought they were good. Great pics of rainbows and sunrise. Can't compare to a \"real\" camera but does the trick in a pinch.I WAS USING IT FOR THE STOPWATCH WHILE POWER WALKING AND THREW IT IN A MUD PUDDLE; WATCHED THE BUBBLES COME UP, FISHED IT OUT, LET IT DRY AND IT STILL WORKS.

But, upon trying to activate it online I got a message saying there was a problem with activation and that I had to call Tracfone.Turns out, Tracfone said that the 800G won't work in my area and they sent me a replacement--unfortunately, an LG501G--which has those pesky very tiny little buttons which I was trying to avoid.  However, at least I DID get the 1200 minutes, 1-year activation and am told that I will be getting the triple minutes for life, even with the new phone (haven't tested this by buying minutes, yet).I'd encourage potential buyers to call Tracfone and make sure the LG800g will work in your area, but then, most folks do not live as far in the boonies as we do!The LG501g is ok but will likely end up being given to my middle-schooler, who does not mind the tiny buttons; my search for a phone continues!", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much better than expected", "Author": "Sheryl", "ReviewID": "RNM28J1HTR5OD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that this phone has proven to be much better than expected.  I had, for years, used the Tracfone Motorola 376W and was, basically, content with it (although I preferred my earlier version...the 370 for sound quality...I got the 376 because it had Bluetooth). The reason I bought this phone was two-fold:  1) I wanted to upgrade the phone, primarily, because a new technological version was available and I love new toys; and 2) the cost of this phone was (here on Amazon, at least,...w/triple minutes and 1200 minutes to start) pretty much the same as just purchasing a year card (400 minutes) with dmfl (therefore, 800 minutes from Tracfone).  Additionally, I found a 300 minute bonus code on-line so I got 1500 minutes total and a new phone for the price of 400-800 minutes!This phone is, for the most part, fairly simple to use.  To prevent any problems with downloads, I did upgrade the memory.There was a problem at first:  the battery wouldn't give a full charge...so I dealt w/ TF on their Facebook page and within 4 days had a new battery in my phone.  The new battery is doing quite well.  The phone has been on, in standby (and an occasional use on my part) for four days and the battery is still fully charged.There were some things I didn't know how to do...again I went to the Facebook page...responses were, for the most part, immediate...including late at night and during the week-end.  Frankly, they're easier to deal with on FB than on the phone.I have done minimal texting (no one I know really does it...we prefer to speak to each other) but have not had any problems in sending or receiving.  I have downloaded 2 browsers to the phone (Opera Mini and Bolt)and they have proven to be much better than the browser TF gives. I also have bookmarked FB on all 3 browsers and get in easily.I wanted to verify the TMFL...since I purchased the phone via a seller here on Amazon...back to the FB page and they verified, in writing, that I had TMFL.The sound quality is great. I wanted a loud ring tone...it took a while to figure it out and no one at TF knew how to make it louder.  Finally, for a really loud tone, one you can even hear in its case in a briefcase or bag, choose the outdoor mode.Now, if you're expecting an Iphone or a Blackberry or...this is not the phone for you...But, if you want a phone that's contemporary, does, basically, everything that the others do but at a much lower price, then this is the phone for you.  Although the proverb says \"you get what you paid for\"...I think I did much better than expected and, in the long run, I'm extremely happy.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Value", "Author": "TedMar3", "ReviewID": "RBC1W7R40O13Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, what a great deal this Tracfone is. Seller quickly shipped the phone and everything received was as advertised. I was able to activate the phone within 10 minutes. Instructions provided by the seller were perfect - just be sure to read the instructions that are taped to the outside of the Tracfone package. Problems with activation and phone setup by others are caused by not reading and following the instructions. Follow these instructions step by step and the process is simple. Step#1 - Plug the phone into the charger and activate the phone with the Tracfone Red Activation Card. I had to wait a few minutes for my phone to be activated and get my new phone number. Do not go on to step#2, adding airtime, until your phone is activated. Step#2 - You need to add airtime using the 15 digit PIN number that is in the instructions that were taped to the phone package. When I tried to add the 50 bonus minutes for Sept. from the TracFone Saving Book it wouldn't take it. After activation and adding my 1200 minutes I called Tracfone and they gave me 50 minutes when I gave them the code from the TracFone Saving Book. I ended up with a bonus of 50, so I got 1200+50+20 that came with the phone, for a total of 1270 minutes.Wow, I got the LG800g with one year of service and 1200 minutes, all for $109. The price of the LG800g bought separately ($49), plus the cost of one year of service and only double minutes ($99) equals almost $150. So for only $109 you get the phone, one year of service, TRIPLE minutes for life, and a great phone. This is by far the best Tracfone ever offered, and I've had a lot of them over the years.Picked up the 3X screen protectors, and picked up a newly offered gel case for the LG800g at E-v-o-l-u-c-e-l-l (take the dashes out and do a google search for it) for less than $10.Service with this phone is the same as the Samsung I have on AT&T; GSM network in my area, very good reception inside my home. Would highly recommend the phone bundle and the seller for providing such good service and instructions.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A \"smart enough 4 me Phone\"", "Author": "JerseyTomato", "ReviewID": "R17VC618CAUPW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS:  Easy to use, excellent reception, touch screen works great, easy text messaging, subtile ring tones right on the phone, pleasant alarm clock with an easy reset.  Screen \"locks\" to keep your face from dialing (just touch to unlock.) Charge, with light use, lasts on standby for at least a week probably a day or two longer.  Triple minutes.  I've had it since October and it's been rock solid reliable.CONS:  Porting the number from the Tfone website didn't work this time around (has in past).  Went to their Facebook page rather than face the rumored horror of calling them for assistance.  It all worked out with number and minutes ported.  More of a hiccup than a true CON.TIPS:  Use Facebook wall if TF website doesn't activate the phone.  Buy gel skin cover (you'll want one), sim card and screen protector (if you want them from Amazon when you order so you just get everything at once.  The screen protector sticky does not interfere with the touch ability of the screen. Buy the Year activation card w/ 400 minutes on Amazon (mine was $79). Search the web for bonus codes that give you additional minutes.  Add the card to the phone via the TFone website (rather than the phone) so that you have a second chance if the code you enter is no longer valid.  On the website you can just try another code.REVIEWSure, I want an iPhone, but the truth of the matter is, I have no real use for most of it's features.  I drive to work in 12 minutes so no watching tv or reading books on the train.  I'm over forty so my eyes wouldn't like it if I tried.  I don't have time to play games, or Facebook with friends, sort my phone contacts into lists and then teleconference with them.  I actually have a job and this sadly eats up so much time I might otherwise use for these activities.  If I start wanting to trade stocks from my phone, well, just shoot me now. What I wanted was a phone that was more useful, easier to use but without all the fancy stuff for which I secretly would love to have the time or the need, but do not.  This phone is perfect.What I needed to replace my old, still reliable clamshell LG was a phone that made it easy to text message, make calls with decent reception, store numbers and maybe take a picture on the fly if I happen to see Jim Morrison/Michael Jackson dressed as Elvis in the ladies restroom. (A girl can dream!)  The LG800G does all these things easily and without a hiccup.  So simply that you may not even need to read the directions, which is always a plus.  I've been pleased with the ease of text messaging in particular, since the key/buttons on phones with slide out keyboards remind me of the keys on those early TI calculators.  You know the ones where the number would register twice by mistake and make you start the whole problem over again?I've had no problems with the touch screen, although a friend just bought an LG800 for her mother and the mother seemed to have difficulties with it.  I'm not sure if it was the phone or not though, as the woman seems resistant to change.  Still, she bought hers in a backwater K-mart and I ordered mine from the Tracfone website. There is touch calibration on the phone and everything has worked smoothly for me.  I can text my niece so when she turns her phone on in front of her pals, there is a message waiting for her --apparently important these days-- and do it reliably and without fuss.Those who say the phone is a slippery little dude are correct.  Save yourself the trouble of having to wait and order one of the gel skins to cover the back when you buy the phone.  Mine fit perfectly with a bit of shoe-horning and has much improved the bulk and hand feel of the phone.  I also got a screen protector to fit and a 4Gig sim card in case I decide to store more data.  The phone also takes (probably) grainy video and the storage seemed cheap and sensible to have.  You never know when you'll need to film that tornato for the Weather Channel!Since I had an existing Tracfone  I wanted to port my number and the outstanding minutes to the new phone.  When I made the initial switch from Virgin Mobile to Tfone I did this quite easily via the TF website.  This time it was more difficult since the website seemed unresponsive.  They launched a site re-design during the period I was trying to activate, and I suspect this was the problem.  Luckily some wonderful soul in these reviews had mentioned Facebook and so I went that route rather than risk calling.  It did work eventually but took several days, mostly due to the fact that I wasn't on my computer for an extended period, so I couldn't sinc with one of the service reps.  Once I did I was activated in minutes and new minutes added tripled as promised.  If you mostly text, say 10-15 messages a week, 1200 minutes will last you to the end of time.  Don't know about web usage.My experience with this phone and Tracfone as a company has been great. That being said, I've never had to call them.  I like this phone a lot.  If you want to have a \"not-quite smarty phone,\" this could be it.  Early versions of this phone seemed to have problems, which have been ironed out from what I can tell.  Still, I might resist the temptation to pluck that dusty one off the rack in a dimly lit Radio Shack or shabby K-mart as it might be one of the older ones.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "Brie", "ReviewID": "R1ES1IBNH89STY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a senior citizen who was skeptical of upgrading to a touch screen cell phone.

After I got the phone, it seemed to me that I was using minutes faster than usual.  I wasn't paying close attention, so it took me a few months to realize that the phone was deducting 3 units for every minute I talked on the phone, as well as 1.2 units for every text message.  I called the company, and after spending about an hour and a half entering codes unsuccessfully into the phone, they sent me a new one.  I asked about the minutes I had lost, and was initially told that nothing could be done, and then that I should ask about it once I received the new phone.  When I received the replacement phone, I called and again asked about my lost minutes - they activated the phone and told me there was nothing they could for me.  I asked to speak to a manager, and after I had been on hold for 20 or 30 minutes, to my surprise a manager did pick up.  (Until that moment I didn't believe that Tracfone managers existed - I was fully expecting to be disconnected or left on hold forever.)  He told me that because the old phone was now inactivated, they could not retrieve records to determine how many calls I had made, and therefore would not refund my minutes - even though they were the ones who had refused to address my complaint until after the new phone was activated!  Eventually after some arguing, he gave me back some minutes - a little less than 1/3 of what I had lost.  Total time spent on the second call:  another 1 1/2 hours.As a result of this experience, I was not especially interested in spending extra money to buy airtime from a phone company that had ripped me off.  However, in general Tracfone provides very inexpensive service with policies that are more generous than those of other prepaid cell phone companies. I have used them for years without previous problems, so I decided to stick with them.  I bought this phone (my third of this model since July!) because at the price of a 1-year card, the phone was essentially free, and the triple minutes would allow me to pay the minimum for airtime in the future.  The phone came with a label taped to the outside of the box with a very unofficial-looking PIN code on it, and I was a little worried that it wouldn't work.  However, I activated the phone and the PIN code worked just fine, giving me the 1200 minutes and 1-year subscription.  This is a great deal for this phone, and I highly recommend it.  Just watch when you get it to make sure it's deducting the correct number of minutes per call!Also note:  if you buy a one-year subscription from the Tracfone web site, they offer you the chance to buy additional minutes and/or add a second year.  Currently, if you own a triple-minute phone, you can buy 400 minutes for $25 (of course, on this phone that turns out to be 1200 minutes), and a second year's subscription for $50.  This means that you can get a second year of service at a $25 discount from the first.  I don't know if this works when buying air time from the phone, but I know that users of double-minute phones are not offered anything like as good a deal.  Adding airtime with a PIN code did not allow me to buy the extra time.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "My mom couldn't be happier!", "Author": "A.D.", "ReviewID": "RBPA43SWAJJP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mom is not into gadgets at all, but when she saw how fun my iPhone was, she wanted to trade-up her ancient candybar-style Nokia for something a little \"cooler.\"  Granted, she hardly uses her cell phone in the first place and thought an iPhone would be too much for her, so after quite a bit of research, I discovered that this LG 800G would be a nice \"step up\" for her, especially since she didn't want a 2-year-contract with one of the bigger mobile companies.This 3rd party seller has one of the last batches of \"Triple Minutes for Life\" phones...I think Tracfone themselves is only offering \"Double Minutes for Life\", so this is a really great deal.  Upon activation I tested the bonus feature by adding a 30-Minute card, and sure enough, the phone was credited with 90 minutes instead.  Plus, the phone already comes with 1200 minutes and a year of activation.  What an awesome deal!Remember, this phone is NOT an iPhone by any stretch of the imagination, but it does a good job of mimicking one for the casual phone user just looking for an upgrade.  It's not as touch-sensitive as an iPhone either, but my mom is fine with that, she's too busy playing music and watching videos of her grandchildren on it.

I read the reviews on this LG800G and at first did not go for it because of some of the negative comments.  The phone arrived priorty Mail 5 days after I ordered it.  Inside the box was the familiar Tracfone package and the LG800G life time triple minute phone inside.  Also a sheet of paper explaining how to add the minutes and the pin number for the minutes on the same sheet of paper.  Activating the phone first online was easy(phone comes with 20 minutes), then adding the 400 minute 1 year (1200 after tripling) minutes using the tracfone online site also worked fine and i got 1220 minutes and 425 days of service.  This is the best way to deal with Tracfone...add minutes online.  My main gripe is the touch screen.  First it feels like frosted plastic.  Second it is not as senstative to touch as I hoped for.  I have an Ipod 4th generation and so I am spoiled.  I put a screen protector on it as soon as i could because it just seems very \"scratchable\".  I was concerned about accidental  Internet \"browsing\" but I was able to move the Icon for that off the main screen.  Also I tried the browser very breifly and it was just .5 unit for under the minute i was connected.  It gave me a warning I was about to go online and gave me the option to back out.  I did not go any further with that until I find the manual for the phone that is suppose to be somewhere on the Tracfone Website.  The Manual that comes with the phone (English and Spanish) is not bad for basic use but not enough for all the options. It doesnt tell you want happens after you hit the browser Icon...It will be trial and error as your minutes get used up. Text message was .3 unit and seems fine.  I have not talked on it yet but dont expect that to be any less than what I am accustomed to with my older Tracfone. This LG800G phone is ok but don't expect good touch experience. I wanted the ablilty to occasionally get on the web to check email and that is why i upgraded to this level. I liked the design of the Tracfone T404G slide out keyboard but was concerned about the many accidental browser button mishaps reported in the reviews...no touch screen to compalin about with that phone...so I did not get it...mabye I should have gotten it?  There is my remorse.  I am going to keep the LG 800G phone anyway.  I did not order a USB Cable because I have so many cables I thought i would have one that fits...WRong!  LG cable needed for this phone.  There is a $2.5O  cable on Amazon that I just orded today...includes shipping.  If you don't have the cable you can't connect the phone to your PC to put things on the micro sd card ( you need to buy that too)...it sits under the battery inside the phone...that would be a hassle to remove it everytime you wanted to add or delete MP3 songes or whatever to the card ( and mabye lose all yur settings you made on the phone)...so you will need the cable.  The 1200 one year minute deal is great  so I am happy with that.  Tracfone is still in my opinion a good way to go for people who want mobile phone use at the lowest possible cost.

I recently inadvertently washed the phone, so that killed it, and I ordered another to replace it.  Arrived in two days, was easy to transfer over my number/minutes/time.  Love it.  Best deal on a cell phone anywhere. Where else can you get a full year of cell phone service and the phone for $85 including shipping.  The 1200 minutes that came with it are more than enough for me for an entire year.I have also purchased one for another family member.  These were originally bought as an upgrade to another Tracfone model, so I called them and they transferred over the number, the minutes from the old phone, and I got the triple minutes added to it with no problem.  Actually the triple minute deal was the incentive to upgrade.  Very pleased with how the Customer service worked out, and pleased with the performance of the phone.  I have used it coast to coast in addition to my 'home' area and it has never failed to work well. The voice quality is excellent, loud compared to my old phone, which is a plus.Everyone should understand that every company now mostly uses Customer Service people from another country.  You have be understanding of the communication difficulties that exist.  They really do want to help you!The phone works great and the interfaces are clearly understandable.  I use it basically as a voice phone--I don't text much, but do I love being able to check my email/stock quotes/weather and only use a minute or two of airtime each time doing that.  This is a much better plan for a 'light' user than a contract phone.  Since the minutes rollover I have something like over 3000 minutes built up . .which means I could prob use it more and not worry about running out before my expiration date next year.  I can certainly see how it is that Consumer Reports has rated Tracfone as the #1 Company for quality/service among all the prepaid carriers.I downloaded the Opera 4.4 browser for the mobile web and it works flawlessly each time.  Much better than the mobile web browser that came with the phone.  The pre-loaded apps for calculator, music player, etc clearly are a notch above what I had been accustomed to with the old phone which was a Motorola flip phone.Even the little cell phone camera in it is ok . sufficient if you get in a bind, but of course no way comparable to the digital SLR that I normally use.  But who said it was that good anyway?I highly recommend this product to anyone who is not obsessed with using a contract phone plan!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "finally an up to date phone", "Author": "lynn", "ReviewID": "R2ZTE4GAZP8W98", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had tracfone service for about 10 years.

It does everything I need (except GPS) for a real bargain price!This phone is a GSM type (uses SIM card).  With tracfone, that means it is \"Single Click.\"  That means, just 1 price even if you're roaming.  The other type of phone (CDMA) can pick up more towers so might have better reception but charges double for roaming.  Also, GSM tracfone phones are eligible for triple minutes, while CDMA can only get double.  My phone came with an AT&T; SIM.I paired my phone with my 2012 RAV4's Bluetooth, and it works seamlessly.  Very nice for this price.While the LG800G can't play Android apps, it does use Java apps.  I haven't tested extensively, but I was able to install and run Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and Super Mario Planet.  They seem to run fine, although the touchscreen's virtual keypad is difficult to use quickly for gaming.  Google Maps wouldn't work because it needs GPS support, which this phone lacks.As for the title of my review, one can receive extra minutes beyond the 1200 that are included.  To do this, activate the phone on Tracfone's website.  DO NOT enter your PIN during activation (the PIN is included with the phone on a piece of 8.5 x 11 paper).  Tracfone will give you 60 days and 20 minutes free for activating the phone.  Browse the tracfone site to Airtime -> Pay As You Go.  This will bring you to the page where you buy additional minutes, but don't buy any.  Special promo codes are also displayed here.  With luck, you will see a code for extra minutes when you activate a 400 minutes, 1 year card (the included PIN is 400 minutes, tripled = 1200 minutes).  This works with the included PIN, so remember the code.Now click the Add Airtime button on the site and select Add Card Online.  Here, you enter the PIN that came with the phone and there is also a line to enter the promo code.  Complete the transaction, and you get the promo minutes on top of the  1200 plus the extra 20 minutes for activating.  Currently, the promo I see is for 200 minutes (there have been 250 minute promos in the past).  With this deal, you get 1420 minutes that are good for 425 days! (The 60 days for activating are added to the 365 days from your PIN).I can't guarantee that the promo will still be there when you activate your phone, but it's worth a try.Good luck and enjoy your new phone.

This is an upgrade from an LG600G phone with double minutes that I have. My main purpose in getting this phone was because of the triple minutes for life offer with 1200 minutes included. Since a 1 year, 400 minute card would cost me a little more that what I paid for this offer, It was a no brainer for me. It was like getting a free phone. I always seemed to run out of minutes before the year was up so having the triple minutes will help out in that respect. This phone came from Shopcelldeals and included a piece of paper with a code that provided 1200 minutes (with triple minutes). I did not have the horror experiences as described by other reviewers but there was a small issue in getting the phone activated. Previously, when I would activate a tracFone, I would just go on their website and enter a few pieces of information and it would get activated. However, with this phone, I waited a couple of days but the phone was still not showing on the screen as activated. Just for the heck of it, I went back on TracFone's website and into my account where I found a message that I need to click on a link that took me to another page where I had to enter a series of codes into my phone. After entering 5 sets of these codes and was accepted, my phone was finally activated. It was a little bit of a pain but I did get it figured out. Also, I had already bought a 1 year, 400 minute card a week before I bought this phone, so after a few weeks, I went into my tracfone account and entered the numbers from the card and it added 1200 minutes, so at least I know my phone is a true triple minutes phone.I also got the cookie style soft case and the screen protector. The touch screen is a nice feature and the screen protector doesn't really interfere with the sensitivity of the touch feature although, as one reviewer mentioned, it sometimes takes a few presses in just the right spot to trigger it. One small minus is the fact that when you are talking on the phone, it will go into a \"lock\" mode. For instance, if you are calling the doctors office and their phone system is asking you to hit 1 for this and 2 for that, you first have to press the unlock button for a couple of seconds, then the keypad button, then you can make your selection. This is a little bothersome but only takes a few seconds to do this. I guess this feature is designed that way so your face isn't inadvertently pressing on the keypad and causing a problem. The screen is larger than my LG600G, which is nice. I haven't used nor do I need to use all of the features this phone has to offer. Getting on the internet is only ok. I'm sure it's not like using a smart phone but you can get on to access some things but I have had problems accessing some websites. Sometimes I get an error message saying the web page is too large and then it kicks me offline. Other sites load fine. Some pages are larger than what I can see on the screen so I have to scroll right and left to read everything. Sometimes, when I try to scroll, I end up touching the screen by mistake in a way that reduces the font size, usually to the point where I can't read the print. So I tap the screen a few times and the fonts become normal size again and I'm back to where I started. There doesn't seem to be a happy medium and it sometimes becomes too frustrating so I try to avoid using the phome for the internet unless it's absolutely necessary.One thing I discovered (but many readers may already know this) is when applying different ringtones to different people in your contact list, make sure you include the area code with the phone number, even if they are in the same area code you are in. When I originally entered my phone contacts, I just entered the 7 digit number for people locally. I then tried to apply a ringtone to one of those people but when they called me, the default ringtone would sound off and I couldn't figure out why the ringtone I wanted to use wasn't ringing. I called tracFone but they weren't any help. They had no idea why the new ringtone wasn't working. Then, one day I noticed when I received a call from that person, it would show the area code and the little light went on in my head. When I edited the phone number to include the area code, the new ringtone worked.A couple of other features I haven't used but plan to are the voice recorder and you can also download and play music, which is nice. I have taken one photo and the quality of the photo was good but I never really used that feature in any cell phone that I have owned. All in all, this was a nice upgrade for me and would recommend this phone.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "a trick to improve the touch precision", "Author": "hawk999 \"Gohawks\"", "ReviewID": "R17QQ0SWPD9JDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter has been using this phone for 6 months, and she loves it. So we decided to upgrade to this phone from our clamshell phones at the end of holiday season. We have been tracfone users over 6 years, with this new phone, our experience with the company is more satisfactory. It was very easy to transfer both my wife and my numbers to the new phone by calling customer service center. With promotion code, we have a new phone with 1400 min and 425 days. As the touch function, it is not as responsive as my ipod touch, which is expected. But it is good enough to me. I also have a 4g microSD card loaded with my favorite songs and audiobooks in the phone, so I can enjoy the music or audiobooks on the go. The voice recorder is another function I used a lot. I can record lectures in a big auditorium, even though the quality is not great, but it is good enough to me. All in all, a great deal.update on 02/11/2012:After using the LG800G for over a month, my family have fallen into the love with this little phone. However, the accuracy of the touch screen is really not very impressive. I had to use a ballpen or a stylus to key in a message. Somehow, I found out a trick to improve the touch precision recently: to calibrate the touch screen using the tip of a sharp pencil or ballpen, do not use your finger. When you are calibrating with the pencil, try the best to make the blue dot match the red dot. Then you will find the accuracy of typing is dramatically improved. All three phones of my family have been calibrated in this way, and my daughter is really excited with the new typing experience with re-calibrated phone.

I will post an update after I've had it awhile.  But here goes with what I've got on it so far.The phone is smaller than I expected which actually works out for me as my \"normal\" purse is actually a wristlet which is about the size of your standard small camera case.  The phone fits in the cell phone pouch which will save me from having to come up with something else to carry it in as the usual belt clip phone case is not an option for me.  I will repeat what other reviewers have said and say that you HAVE to buy a screen protector.  I scratched mine the first day and I have no idea as to how it happened.  I sent the seller, shopcelldeals, an email thru Amazon regarding the 1200 min./1 yr service and received a quick reply which answered my question.  An additional note on this, Tracfone currently has a promo code [89901 if memory serves] for the \"1 yr service/400 minutes\" pin number/\"card\" you get with the phone.  End result is 1400 MINUTES instead of the 1200 you would normally get.The biggest hassle I've had so far is getting the minutes and service from my old Tracfone transfered onto the new one.

The max memory this phone can hold is 4 gigs. I bought Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC  Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging) and it works just peachy after I formatted it. It would *not* work before the format, and you will need a computer with a microSD card reader to do the formatting! If your card is incompatible/wrong format, the phone will let you know by displaying a tiny crossed out memory card logo on the top of the screen. For those wondering, the proper format for this phone is FAT(File-Allocation-Table).The coverage in my area sucks. Not this phone's fault, and I am not docking stars for that. Do your homework and find out if it will work in your area before buying.Lastly, if you do buy this phone, keep your old number. The phone number provided gets calls/texts/pictures *all* the time from people I don't know. It is quite amusing, but not all people would think so.UPDATE #3: The Tracphone site *sometimes* has an option for 250 bonus minutes(promo code needed) when you add the one year card subscription(this phone comes with that exact card, how nice!). So if you set up your minutes online, make sure to hunt down that promo code when adding your minutes!", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "ShopCellDeals is GREAT!", "Author": "Cedric V Snyder", "ReviewID": "R10HCF8S8P1PK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The vendor, ShopCellDeals, not only has great prices on Tracfone products, but also they are MOST PROFESSIONAL in their dealings.

(Tracfone)I purchased this phone in early July to carry as an emergency phone and for traveling. It's my first touchscreen phone, so I had no experience with high end phones to compare it to. My main interest was having an inexpensive no contract phone that would support texting, and serve as a backup to my landline. This phone is perfect in that regard. I'm not using it for web access, so I can't speak to that function.Online activation went without any problems, and it worked well on a trip to Michigan this summer. The 1 year service with triple minutes is going to be exactly what I needed for my usage. When the phone arrived and I was setting it up, my husband got really interested in it and ordered one for himself. Both phones have good call clarity, and hold a charge for about a week if powered on 24/7.If you're looking for an economical cellphone and dislike contracts, this is a great option.Update: July 2013It's been a full year since I purchased this phone, still operates as well as last summer.

If you are looking for a full-featured smartphone with lots of apps, this is not for you.  However, if you are looking for a great value in a phone that goes beyond the basics, then this may be what you want.I was shopping for an mp3 player to help minimize the crushing boredom of exercise when I stumbled on the LG800G.  For several years I have relied on Tracfone for my mobile communications.  Unlike many people, I spend little time talking on the phone, and keep my cell phone off except when it will serve my interests to have it on.  Pay-as-you-go with Tracfone has offered an economical way to have a cell phone.  I had figured on spending $40 to $50 for a basic mp3 player, so I saw this and figured that for an extra $50 I could get the phone with a year of service and more minutes than I was likely to use in a year, so it seemed like a deal.Of particular interest to me was the potential for going on the internet. I wanted to be able to process credit cards away from my office. I knew that this was not compatible with any of the credit card readers which are available for iphones and android devices, but figured that I could handle credit cards manually through a virtual terminal as I do now. With a fair amount of experimentation, I have been able to do that even though the credit card processor I use is not optimized for mobile devices and the LG800G screen is quite small. It takes about 10 minutes start to finish to log on and enter the charge information, but it is possible.  To accomplish this, I downloaded Opera Mini to use as the browser; it seems to be the best browser compatible with the phone.The camera is marginal, but better than nothing.  Do not buy this for the claimed ability to record video.The mp3 function is, I suppose, what one would expect from a cheap mp3 player. The sound quality is not great, but is that due to the phone or the bargain price ear buds I'm using (Panasonic RPHJE120)? Probably a combination.Documentation for this phone is poor. Plan on spending time online searching for answers to basic questions, such as the details how to add a memory card (you must carefully pry up a latch on an open space next to the sim card). And speaking of memory, it is limited to 4GB; a good deal on one of these is the Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC.Activation online was easy--less than 5 minutes. The seller provided good instructions to activate with the year of service and triple minutes.Within 5 minutes of activating service I started receiving spam text messages, and was swamped with these. In the process of deleting these I inadvertently opened some, resulting in the loss of several minutes of pre-paid time. I called Tracfone and was issued a new phone number which, so far, is not on the spammers screens. Dealing with Tracfone customer service was frustrating as has become typical of all companies which have sent this important function overseas; people who speak limited English and are required to stick to written scripts may be cheap for Tracfone, but do not engender customer loyalty.The on/off button is designed to ensure you will not accidentally turn the phone on or off. However, it takes a real effort to hit the button just right with enough force, so you may think you turned it off only to find that it remained on and the battery needs to be recharged before you can use it.If you need to be constantly online or speaking on the phone, the Tracfone concept probably will not be right for you. If you need to handle lots of credit card transactions over a cell phone you probably should get an iphone or android a device and a card reader. But if you will infrequently process a credit card payment and will not be spending a lot of time talking or using the phone to go online, this gives you an opportunity to have a phone for a year at a cost comparable to what many people spend for one month of cell phone service.It is tempting to give this a score of 3 rather than the 4 I awarded. So many of the features are weak when compared to smartphones. But for those whose needs are met by a half-wit phone this gives great value.

I don't do a lot of calls, but I do get some texts. The LG800 phone is more friendly to me than my BlackBerry, which I gave away.I had a BlackBerry on Verizon and no one here in Keene NH gets decent phone service 'all around town' -- service is spotty and there are good areas, but my house was in a dark zone.

I have only used about 300 minutes worth of time in about two months.If you need a lot of customer service and hand-holding and a nice storefront, or must have an iPhone, stay with AT&T; or Verizon. Trac-Fone's weak spot is their lack of accessible customer service. However, there is a large online community where you can get help and advice. To me, I'm good with TF.If your usage is low, TracFone is a good way to go. At some point, high-usage of per-minute time will exceed the cost benefit. I'm nowhere near that.I am saving a LOT of money, compared to Verizon. It'd be the same for any 'contract' cell carrier. And if I did have a high-usage month with my TF, I can always buy a minutes card and reload it, easily.

Very few times have I had to call tracfone's tech support, and... well... what can you expect.Anyway, so with my previous tracfone, I've had no issues with service, actually I've had excellent service coverage, even in some remote places (I travel a lot). So, I ordered this phone, expecting the same.The phone came very quickly (thus the two stars), and it is a good phone (thus the two stars). I was able to register the phone, get the triple minutes for life (as per the instructions that came on the white piece of paper), and I even tried it, made phone calls, sent some texts, and thought I was set.I played around with the phone a bit, set the morning alarm, the tune I wanted for the ring tone, and even found two games on the phone that I can play while waiting for my oil change. I was very excited, and couldn't wait to get my phone numbers transferred over so I can send everyone my new phone number.The next morning (today), I drove to work, only to discover that the phone had no service at only two miles past my house, and no service at all at my place of work. I went on the tracfone website, put in a problem ticket, got a ticket number, then patiently waited. Nothing happened. I went back to the website a few hours later, put in my ticket number, only to receive a message saying the problem is not resolved, and to call their 800 number. Reluctantly, during my break (since I didn't have cell phone service, I had to use my work phone), I called the number. After being on hold for 10 minutes (there went my break), I was informed that this cell phone does not have the capability to offer service where my work is located, even though I have service in my home (two miles away). I questioned this this since my old cell phone has no such issues, and they said that my old cell has technology that can get service in that area, but that this phone does not have the same technology, and thus, I am unable to use it in that area.I was very saddened by this, and after leaving work, about a block away, my phone beeped to tell me I had 8 texts waiting to be read, that I couldn't get at work.I decided to drive around town, and see where I do and do not have service, and I couldn't believe how sporadic it is. The service on that phone is extremely limited, and if you are in a small town, then forget it, you'll have service in only half the town, and if you're rural, then even worse. While tracfone's general coverage is excellent, the coverage with this phone sucks.The only reason I'm not returning it is because of the hassle, I'm not even sure I can return it. So I decided that it's my official home phone (since it works inside my house), until the minutes are used up. However, I dug out my old cell phone, and will be getting additional minutes for that one instead.I decided to look at it this way.

The Verizon phone was part of a family plan, but with a change in the plan the cost for my simple flip-phone went from $10/month up to $35. Since I was only using about 100 minutes per month and very rarely text, that was way too much to pay. So after much research, I got this combo deal which came with the phone (software version V10e) and a 400 minute / 1 year service card. With triple minutes it comes out to 1200 minutes. Shopcelldeals even threw a pink and a black silicone skin for the phone, and I got it 3 days after I ordered it (it was shipped via USPS Priority).When I activated the phone online it gave me 60 days of service and 20 minutes to test it out. When I activated the 400 minute card I also entered a promo code that I found prominently shown on Tracfone's website, and that gave me 250 more minutes. So for about $85 including shipping, I got a pretty nice phone, 14 months of service, and 1450 minutes. That works out to just over $7/month or 1/5 the cost of Verizon!I called Tracfone's support breifly to ask them how I would go about porting my old number, and they were helpful and told me what I needed to gather together before calling back or doing it online. The next day, which was Saturday, I entered the information online and within 2 hours had a text that my number had been ported, even though they said they'd have to send me a new SIM card to complete the port. A quick call from my landline confirmed that it had in fact worked.I'm upgrading from a simple flip-phone, and would have preferred another flip phone, but this deal was just too good to pass up. I use an iPod Touch for most smart-phone type features (texting, email, calendar, GPS, facebook, etc). So I didn't need all those features on my phone. The only thing that I wanted a touch-screen phone for was to have a qwerty keyboard for occasional texting.The phone seems to work really well. People I've called told me they thought I was calling from a landline. It does lose service sometimes and tell me Emergency Calls Only, but then service will be back a minute or so later. Like I say, I'm way out here in an area they don't even claim to have service (they say they have no service for my whole zip code), so it is better than expected. The phone uses AT&T; towers, and in my area that is the best option, even though Tracfone's site shows CDMA as having better coverage.So far, the only complaints I have with the phone are:1. The on-screen QWERTY keyboard is only available when composing a text. Try adding a contact and you're back to the alphanumeric keypad.2. The screen takes a little getting used to. I find it is a little hard to hit the right buttons especially when scrolling through contacts, etc. It isn't bad, but not quite as nice as my iPod Touch.3. When you're on a call and need to enter other numbers it takes a few seconds to get back to a keypad. That can be a bit annoying if you're used to a flip-phone.4. The top button instantly unlocks the phone, whereas the other buttons require you to hold the unlock button for a second. Don't know how likely it is, but if you bump the top button and then the send button twice, you'd end up butt-calling the last person.I bought this package because it was cheaper than just buying a 1 year/400 minute card and figured if the phone was really bad I could always pick up another model and transfer my number and minutes over.

Could not find a thing wrong with anything on this order or phone. For less than $110 and no contract, I received the LG800 phone, battery, charger, 400 minutes on activation, Triple Minutes Renewal for Life of Phone, 4 GB Scandisk Memory chip, Micro USB Data Transfer Cable, Non-Slip Rubber Gel protective outer skin, and Clear LCD Screen Protective Cover Shields !!!  But wait, there was even more bonus minutes to be had !!!After inserting the memory chip and inserting the battery, I charged the phone for a few minutes. I put on the protective screen cover, and nudged the phone into the rubber non-slip protective gel skin. Download and transfer of music files and photos from my laptop was a snap using the Micro USB Data transfer cable. After deciding to terminate my 5 year old wireless plan with AT&T;, I put in a request with TracFone and my old number from AT&T; was ported in almost overnight, on the weekend !!!Now, adding the minutes was the fun part. The package comes with 400 minutes... x Triple Minutes which equates to 1,200 minutes ! But I took this one step further, and searched online to locate TracFone airtime minutes promo codes. I jotted down a few to try, then went to Tracfone's website to add minutes to my phone. First you enter the code for your 400 minutes, then in the promo code field Tracfone provides, you enter one of their bonus minute codes. Within 5 minutes, my LG800 chirped out a notice that I had just added, not 1200, not 1350, but 1560 minutes to my now activated phone !!! How awesome of a deal is that ??!Since then this phone has worked flawlessly for me, for calls, texting, and even some web browsing (though that's limited). Sound is great on this phone and music is as good as an MP3. The smaller size is perfect, as it fits in my pockets with ease, and does not crack if you happen to sit on it, but the LCD Touchscreen is big enough for anything but watching movies.Only slight negatives I could find are TracFone's call center requires some extra patience when speaking to their tech support. The web browser should be upgraded if you want the best mobile web experience, and the APPs available to this phone are not the same as those for IPADs or IPhones. Screen reaction is a micro tad slower than typical Droid and IPad phones. The camera does not have built-in flash or the top of the line resolution, even though the videos and pics I took look pretty decent to me.All in all, a terrific deal for those looking to escape from a 1 or 2 year contract, and upgrade from their basic \"Dumb\" phone, or those who don't need the expensive features and options included on the Ipads, Iphones, and Androids.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "customer service exceeding expectation", "Author": "Joanne", "ReviewID": "R21BWNH0T4MTPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the phone more than one year ago.

I got this phone with at&t; sim and version V10e software from shopcelldeals on ebay (excellent seller).  Phone was delivered promptly and came in sealed retail plastic blister pack.I bought this phone for its large screen for Google Maps.  After some searching got Google Maps installed as trusted app but the map is not touch enabled so I must use  keypad for navigation that consumes 1/2\" screen space at bottom.  Ran Google maps with traffic (slow) and even 360 streetview (very slow); before moving map, I turn traffic off then back on; numeric commands 1/2/3/7 work well.Installed Opera Mini 7 and also 4 as trusted browser apps.  Opera Mini 7 is slow to boot and much less responsive than 4  but is more convenient, e.g. has password manager.  I got the old browser icon off the desktop but couldn't get icons on the desktop for Opera Mini or Google Maps.  Neither Opera Mini nor Google Maps have terminated unexpectedly, as they did on my prior phone which had insufficient storage.It is difficult to use automated phone services which require keypad tones because the phone keeps locking and sometimes I have to re-boot phone to get tones generated. The phone also tended to generate tones that are long in duration, not recognized by my automated service.  Maybe in a later software version these defects will be corrected.  I also don't like having to use two hands to push the power switch on edge of cell phone (to unlock screen or to turn off/on phone); the power switch also requires a precise push.I still make mistakes performing the correct touch screen motions, e.g. I have to apply firm pressure to scroll through my contacts;  too little and the screen won't move; if I accidentedly release my finger too soon the phone will present a contact for viewing or dial the number.  Alternatively, I can use the red scroll bar on the right but I have to make sure I touch the exact correct spot.  It is like learning to play a finicky musical instrument but first I have to discover how to play it.It still sometimes takes me a moment to realize the exit button isn't on the touch screen, that I have to press the physical middle button at the bottom of the phone.

Neither of them uses a great deal of minutes, so 1200 minutes a year is good enough.  The cost for a year of service and 1200 minutes is less than $150.  That is less than three months service on their old plans.The battery life is amazing for such an inexpensive phone.  It uses some really intelligent power management to preserve the charge.I would buy a silicone cover for the phone.  It is not as sturdy as a $400 phone.

This is just a theory, but it did work for me. Once my minutes and number were transferred, I then activated my new Tracfone, and my number/minutes were now on the new phone. Also BE SURE to let the rep know that you have a seperate number (Taped to outside of phone package) This is crucial so that the rep can add the 1200 free minutes to your new phone.

I am trying to set up my voice-mail on my new Tracfone, and it is not working.  I have suggested that perhaps this particular phone has a defect and may need to be replaced - but they keep telling me that all is fine - however after 2 hours today and 1 hour last week, 5 different cust. service reps, and almost an hour worth of wasted minutes calling my voice mail to see if it is finally working - still not working.  I press the numbers on the dial keys, and voice mail doesn't acknowledge them - a defect right???  I am now on my \"4th higher up tech.\" level after each lower tech must spend over 30 minutes going through \"protocol\" reading off a script the entire time - repeating scripted words over and over and never having the vocabulary to answer any questions/concerns off their notes.  This is ridiculous and VERY frustrating.  I was originally really excited about this phone; but now I am hoping that I can easily return it through Amazon for a full refund. Note:  I was unaware that calling voice mail to retrieve messages uses paid minute time.  This is a negative thing in my opinion.  It takes a minimum of 1 minute to call in to voice mail and then more minutes wasted as it always takes you through prompts each and every time - then add any minutes that the message left may be - if your friends/family leave long messages, the paid minutes can go quite quickly - one phone call leaving instructions can be 5 minutes or more.In addition to the faulty voice mail other negatives include:It takes a long time for the phone to turn on.  I chose tracfone because I mostly want a cel phone for emergencies and coordinating with friends when at large events/places such as Disneyland etc.  However, the phone takes so long to turn on, that if I was in an emergency, it would not be effective.The screen takes a lot of pressure to scroll/access functions.There is a secure/lock feature that can be turned off for the main phone, but not for dialing out calls - including calling voice mail.  According to 5 different service techs., this feature cannot be removed/turned off and is part of the phone.  This is especially annoying when calling voice mail since it locks up the screen every 3-5 seconds;  makes it challenging to follow the prompts because in between every prompt, the screen locks and then it hangs up because I can't push the numbers in time since the screen is locked - UGH!Customer service is HORRIBLE!  Nice people, but inefficient with all their processes and forced limited scripts.  Still on hold while I write this as I am being transferred FINALLY to a manager after talking to: Redilyn, Sweetie, Charity, Chad (a woman), Erning and Elbisa (each spelled out their names for me)......I will include an update if this issue ever gets resolved.  In the meantime, I have wasted over 50 minutes of my pre-paid time calling voice mail as directed over and over and over and over again and several hours of my time talking with customer service reps and being put on hold as I am transferred to different levels of \"higher tech support\".I am not satisfied with this product and cannot recommend it to anyone.  I am jealous of the reviewers who have had no problems and love their phone.  I may just have a lemon, but if this is the case, it is way too hard to get it replaced.  I would not risk it again.

I was wondering how smooth this new phone would activate with my old number, transfer my minutes and add the 400x3=1200 minutes to my balance.

I have not tried to add more minutes since, so I don't know if the triple minutes for life is still working but so far this has exceeded my expectations.I love the phone as well, coming from the Moto W376g phone. After manually typing in my 50 contacts! I realized they are both Bluetooth and was able to connect them!Pros,I can rapidly scroll through the contacts on the touch screen, unlike the W376g.Useful calender feature with alarms, i actually use this.Aded a 4Gb microSD card and can connect to my PC. Loaded a bunch of music and it is a decent music player for my car. I plug the 3.5mm into my radio AUX port.Calls sound good.Much better camera than the Moto W376g, but not nearly as good as an iphone or Android.Poor video capability, but it can at least do it.Functional web browsing (I run BOLT for my browser not the built in one, it only connects when it has to to save balance).Easy to load Java apps from my PC, this is only possible when you add the microSD card.Snapping a photo and sending in an email was more obvious then the W376g.

I had a Tracfone flip phone with double minutes for life prior to upgrading, which worked fine for me, but realized I could buy this phone with triple minutes for life for less than buying a one year, 400 minute card (that would be doubled).  I was a little hesitant after reading some of the more negative reviews, but finally decided to try it.  I'm so happy that I did - I absolutely love it!  The only thing I really dislike so far is the screen lock feature that comes on constantly.  The phone has a setup feature that looks like it will allow you to turn if off, but it doesn't work.  As soon as the phone is answered, the screen lock comes on. In order to turn on the speaker phone (which I like to do in the car), I have to turn off the screen lock first.  Very inconvenient while you're driving.  Other than that, I really love this phone.  The camera is much better quality than my previous phone and it has many other great features.

Well decided to buy it because for 90 bucks this is a great deal which cannot be compared with any other service provider for an use-and-throw phone. Also ordered the 4GB external memory for the phone which was easy to insert in the back of the phone.About the phone-activation: I choose to do it online instead of calling their helpline. Made a quick profile and continued to do the activation by entering the serial number on their website (tracfone.com). Easy steps to follow and goes with out a glitch. After entering my serial number, I chose to continue entering my Tracfone minutes pin. It automatically verifies and shows that I have triple minutes for life. So it worked flawlessly. The only problem I had was when it asked me to switch-off and switch-on my phone to confirm the activation in my phone: My phone still said \"activation required\". I tried again and still the same. But, I choose to continue the steps online and when I finished all the steps, my phone automatically switched-off and turned-on to show that its been activated. Everything was over in a couple of minutes - better than waiting on the helpline.About the phone: Great phone. Nice features. Okay camera. Poor video. Poor speakerphone with noise but doesn't matter to me. Good contact information and profile settings. Bluetooth works great. Okay touch screen -  a bit passive but very good for the price of the phone. Keypad is like that of a regular phone but works flawlessly with touch. The unlock issue  reported by others is not a flaw. By default, it is set to autolock at every 10 seconds which can be changed to 20 or 30 or 60 or never. Also the top-right key locks/unlocks just by pressing it which is very convenient. The web-browser is more like an unusable feature - I am not too worried, just bought it for the minutes.Costs: I was surprised that this phone showed I had 1220 minutes and 425 days to use it instead of 1200 min and 365 days. Well, it's all good! The bad part is it costs 30 seconds (or 0.5 min) for texting.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG800G", "Author": "JOHN SMITH ivvi", "ReviewID": "R1ZV9DK2S85XDI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "RECEIVED THE 1200 MINUTES.

I removed the mini sd card from my verizon phone and put it in the lg and it was able to read the music and photo files.  Then I just hooked up the two phones via bluetooth and transfered my contacts from the verizon phone to the tracfone phone.  April verizon gets turned off and now more contracts.  I only use 200 minutes a month and so this will work great for me.  A co-worker suggested the tracfone because in this area he delivers news papers in rural areas and needs service on his phone and this is the only phone that works in many areas in his route.  The only negetive I have at this time is the screen locks up when calling voice mail and you have to unlock it to enter password.  other reviewers might have an answer for this so I'll double check.  I did use a pencil to calibrate the top screen and I haven't had any issues with touch accuracy.  There is a handwriting feature that allows you to text by writing the letters which is nice at times.  the Qwerty keyboard is accessible to text message but when adding contacts I couldn't find the option but you can go to handwritten mode and that is better then tapping the number keys 2-4 times to get the letter you want.

I also have an LG Optimus V that has a month to month pay as you go 300 minutes & unlimited text/web for $35. plan with Virgin. I realized that barely 20-30 minutes were being used each month, and really I just let my daughter take the phone when she would go out. (She's 11 and is most likely responsible for the fact that the touchscreen on that Optimus has dead spots.Either that, or the phone tried to commit suicide by jumping off a table or something, because I don't think those touchscreens just go dead like that)  Anyway, I liked having the touchscreen, but felt the price was a bit much to pay each month for someone who doesn't talk/browse online much.  Enter the LG800g. I think that these 1200 minutes should last me quite a while, so long as I don't use the browser too much. That browser does indeed seem quite slow in comparison to my other LG, and that in turn will eat up the minutes. Mainly I wanted something I could text with using a keyboard, and that's when I found the neat little handwriting to text feature.  My monthly contract phone broke, and since I'm not due for an upgrade I have been using my original phone with that service, which is from 2009 and has no keyboard. Typing a text on that is a nightmare.So, it was either keep paying $35. a month and wasting the minutes/data , keep taking 10 minutes to type out a text using a phone keypad or go ahead and pay one price for alot of minutes that will actually roll over month to month with this 800g. So far, I'm quite pleased. The only thing that needs improvement is the browser, but who can really complain at these prices?I don't think I mentioned in the video that the 1200 minutes are actually good for 1 year. I like that because otherwise you may end up wasting unused minutes at the end of the month(as in my OpV phone) or at the end of 3 months, depending on what amount of service time comes with the minutes you buy. I've seen minutes as low as 60 for $9.99 (which are then tripled with this phone to 180) and they come with 1 month to use them. They also sell more minutes such as 90 with 90 days of service. There is also a 1 year of service card that comes with some minutes-400 I think-that can be bought for close to $100.00. TracFone also seems to run specials and offers bonus minutes through promo codes from time to time. So, assuming I made it through my entire year with these 1200 minutes, I would then buy either a minutes pack with at least 90 days of service time, or go ahead and get the 1 year of service again, knowing that my minutes will automatically triple.The phone also came with 10 minutes to begin with, before I called to activate my bonus minutes package, and it must have had 90 days of service as well, because after everything was up and running I saw 1209.5 minutes and 455 days of service remaining, so you actually are getting more than is advertised. Again, I got mine through QVC for the same price (plus 3 yr square trade w/ accidental damage/handling for $21.00) so I am not sure if that was the reason I got the extra service days. I'll skim through the reviews and see if others mention that.

I've been a Tracfone custome for nearly a year and wanted to upgrade from double minutes to a triple minutes phone. The touch screen, though not flawless, is exceptionally good for a phone this price. I was worried when I first received the phone because the packaging says \"DOUBLE MINUTES\" so I'm already thinking to send the phone back. But this LG800G has the latest software version so when you input the pin taped to the underside of the packaging, you get the 1200 minutes using the 400 minute card. I then bought a 30 miute card and received the 30 minutes plus 60 bonus minutes. So don't worry too much if the package says double minutes. Just follow the instructions. If you are trasferring a number, you can do it durng the initial set up. The signal is as good as what I had with the LG420. Voice is very clear. It even recognizes script for messaging. I've only had this phone for a week, but so far, I'm very happy with it.@ years and I have had to replace the battery. But they're cheap (under $5) and its still going strong.

Guess what - the key pad locks up within 5 seconds. I call my voice mail and usually delete before the msg is over but the key pad is locked and I cannot delete. Its a very precise control that you hold the unlock button a few seconds.

I have it set on Press Any Key to answer but I must be a Fat Finger bc it does not work well. Just missed a call from a friend in Africa and I am not returning that call.Another issue is that the back plate does not stay on. I went to the Dollar store and bought a case and when I pull out the phone the back plate flies out. I have yet to try out the camera, web browser bc I cannot even answer the voice or text option.I have never heard the text msg notification even when its in my pocket.

I'm in my 40's and wanted something more technologically advanced.  I read all of the instructions on the packaging and because I had previous experience with Tracfone, I also had a one year card already purchased and ready to go at activation. I transferred my old phone number to the new phone -which also transferred the minutes I had left on the old phone and my previously set up voicemail-(called during early afternoon hours)& my triple minutes were added within 20 minutes or so.  This phone has an incredible amount of features and I am still learning how to use them all.  The camera is not the best in low light situations and takes ok pictures but you can edit them, which I was surprized and pleased to learn. Playing with the phone for awhile will teach you a lot.  For instance, I was irritated with the fact that I kept accidentally hitting the internet browser until I discovered that you can hide it and this will no longer be a problem.  I had problems with my e-mail fitting on the screen, so I have since given up on trying to check my e-mail with it.  But there are lots of other things that I use it for, successfully.  Texting on the querty keyboard is awesome!  I really sucked at texting before and now I can keep up with most people, in conversation.  I liked this phone so much that I broke down and bought one for my 11 yr old son who had been begging me for a phone, ad-nauseum.  It enables me to keep in touch with him while I'm at work without disturbing anyone else, and now he teaches me about things I didn't know about the phone.  This phone would have received 5 stars from me except for 2 things:  Both my son and I have noticed that the phone will shut itself off and then turn itself back on, sometimes.... usually when we are texting fast and furiously. It doesn't happen all the time, just sometimes.  The second thing is the autolock feature that locks the phone up and you have to press it all the time to do anything with the touchscreen.  My son told me you can disable it by going to menu/settings/phone/autolock -and select never.  (However, you may want this feature on in your pocket or purse so you don't accidentally dial people).  Bottom line.....this is a great phone for the money.  I paid 29.00 for mine and 19.99 for my son's triple minute phone.  The year card is best for start up since you may lose track of time and it's a pain to remember to renew the time as well as the minutes..... and it would have been very expensive to buy a 200.00 phone and pay a monthly bill.  Oh, and one more thing... I live in a rural area and commute 54 miles to work one way, and I get service 99% of the time.

It is a well made phone for a GREAT price!UPDATE: I noticed the signal strength in my area on the LG800 was much worse than the cheaper Kyocera I replaced.

I have since ordered a LG505c CDMA phone to replace it.

Tracfone has been a perfect phone for this level of use. 1 year service is around $100 and you can roll over unused minutes year to year. The minutes do not expire as long as the service is extended before the expiration date. I purchased a LG800G phone to replace an 6 year old phone that stopped working. I purchased the phone without the 1 year service, and will be purchasing 1 year service separately. I somehow did not see this listing when I was shopping and now kicking myself as this is a better deal.\u2714 To transfer the old number and minutes--------------------------------------------1. Before activating and transferring the old phone number and left over minutes, the new phone needs to be charged.2. You can activate the phone on-line (if you have an on-line account with Tracfone AND if your old phone is operational). To do so go to Tracfone home page and choose \"Activate Phone\" link at the top of the home screen, and then selecting \"Transfer my number and service from one TracFone to another\". Since the old phone was not working I called the service representative 1-800-867-7183.3. To do the transfer you will need the IMEI number (also known as the serial number) of the old phone, the SIM card number of the old phone, and the old phone number. You will also need the serial number of the new phone which is printed on your activation card.4. I had no issues getting full credit for all the old minutes. To activate the phone the operator had to give me five long series of numbers and even though the call center was in India I had no trouble understanding the accent and found the operator pleasant and easy to work with. The first procedure she performed gave me credit for half of the minutes on the old phone, and then without me having to ask she said she needed to do several more steps to get me the balance of minutes. I had to turn off and turn on the phone twice to see minutes added in two steps.5. The software version I received on the phone purchased in February 2013 is V10e. The older version of the software had problems (specifically version V10d).You can check what version of the software you have by clicking on a blue square with 4 dots on the main screen. Then tapping on the following: Settings - Phone - scroll down to Information - Device Information - S/W version.If you have V10e or later you are all set. If you have V10d you have an older problematic version and should upgrade.I went to LG web site, found support page, and entered 800G. I found a page where there are steps to install software that performs an upgrade for the the phone. The instructions say \"If your phone needs to upgrade, the \"Start Updating \" button will be enabled.I did not test this because my phone is on the latest version already, but I wanted to see if LG had a page for updates and I found it. Amazon does not allow posting of external URL, but you can find it by going to LG web site and adding this \"/us/support-mobile/lg-LG800G\" to the home page URL.\u2714 What I like about the phone------------------------------------------1. I found the touch screen to be responsive, although it requires a little more pressure than the touch screens of my Android devices2. The screen is bright and easy to see. The phone size is 4\" (length) by 2.25\" (width) by 0.375\" (thickness). Screen size 1.75\" (width) by 2.25\" (length). 3\" diameter. It weighs 3.1 oz.3. This phone will be used by someone whose vision is not very good, and I was pleasantly surprised by many font size choices and how well the font scaled up without losing the usability of the menus and prompts.I am attaching a collage of five photos (which can be found by following customer photos link under the main photo). Photo #1 shows font options, Photo #2 shows a screen with font size set to medium size, Photo #3 shows a screen with large font.4. The price of this phone is hard to beat. This phone provided triple minutes for the life of the phone. That means when combined with 1 year service/400 minutes it is 1200 minutes for $90 (current price on Amazon including shipping), which is 7.5 cents per minute. Or for someone who uses a phone less than 400 minutes a year (which is the case in our family), then it is $7.50 a month for the security of having an emergency phone.5. The phone has a small set of useful apps: a calculator, a notepad, an mp3 player, and few others. Using these apps does not use minutes. If you use the browser then the minutes are used as soon as you connect and stop when you disconnect.6. A charging connector is a standard micro USB connector. I have been able to charge this phone using my own cables, so if you already have a car charger or an external battery that uses a standard USB connector you don't need to buy anything special to use it them with this phone. The charging port on LG800G is on the left side of the phone and is covered by a small panel which you need to lift up and turn 90 degrees to expose the connector.\u2714 Customization I have made---------------------------------------(1) I increased the screen time out. This is done by hitting a blue squares with 4 dots (also known as the Menu icon) and then selecting 'Settings'. From the 'Settings' screen select 'Phone' and then 'Auto-lock'. You can choose a time between 10 sec and 60 sections or 'Never'. If you select 'Never' the screen will dim but will not lock. The downside of 'Never' that if something in your purse accidentally presses on the screen you could be dialling or starting up a browser without meaning to do so.(2) I removed the browser from the main screen to the apps bar (so it would not be hit accidentally start using minutes). And added \"Profiles\" to the main screen, which allows to change the phone into silent or flight mode quickly.(3) I populated the contacts, and then added several numbers to the speed dial. Once the speed dial is set you will be able to access it by clicking the phone icon on the main screen, and then hold down the number of your speed dial. Speed dial #1 is your voice mail. Note that when you access your voice mail you get charged minutes. Speed dials also appear as individual buttons on the screen on the second page. To get to the second page you need to swipe your finger across the main screen right to left.(4) I changed the font of the display. This option is accessible by hitting the Menu icon, then 'Settings', then 'Display', then 'Font'.(5) I changed the ring tone. To get to this setting you need to go to the second page of Settings. Start with Menu, then Settings, then slide your finger right to left to flip the page, select 'My stuff', then 'Sounds'. The phone comes with 12 choices for rings tones.(6) You can activate and deactivate sounds by using the volume button. To do so you need to press and hold the lower portion of the volume button. You will get a brief message on the screen \"Silent activated\". If you press it again you will deactivate silence and get \"Silent deactivated\" message.\u2714 ADDING SD MEMORY CARD-------------------------------------The phone is operational without adding an SD memory card. The phone comes with some (relatively small) amount of internal memory. Information about your contacts, calendar, tasks & notes are stored in internal memory. If you are planning to take photos or videos, or listen to music, you should add an SD memory card. Note that your contacts, calendar, and tasks will continue to be stored the internal memory. I purchased this SD memory Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter.1. SD memory card slot is located under the battery. This means that you first need to remove the cover by sliding it down. The first time I had to remove the cover it was a bit difficult, as the cover is very slippery and has no groves to hang on to. I finally was able to do it by using the grippy material used to open cans. Photo #4 shows me removing the battery cover. The grippy material generated enough friction that the cover finally slid off. After removing the cover, you need to remove the battery.2. The memory card slot is on the left side of the white SIM card. The gold bars on the card should face down towards the gold bars on the phone. The memory card goes under a metal holder. You need to lift the metal holder, place the memory card, and then lower the card holder, and push it down until it snaps in place. Note that lifting the holder for the first time requires some force. I used a tiny screwdriver to give me leverage to push it up. Photo #5 shows the holder in up position, so you can see what you need to do to insert the memory card.3. After the memory card is in place, you need to replace the battery and the phone cover, and power up the phone.4. Now, you need to set your default memory to external, and tell the camera, the video recorder, and the voice recorder to use the external memory rather than the internal memory like before.5. To set the default memory:- Tap the following sequence MENU - Settings - Phone - Memory Info - Primary storage settings- Tap on External memory (red check will appear)- There will be a FORMAT button at the bottom of the screen, tap on it- The phone will ask for a security code, enter 0000. Once you enter the security code, OK button will appear on the bottom of the screen. Click ok. Format takes about 1 second.6. To set the camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizontal position, as you turn you will see camera control setting appear on the screen.- Tap the gear icon which is on the lower left side of the screen.- The memory setting is on the second screen of camera settings, so you need to tap the slider on the right hand side (it will say 1/3, first page out of three) once you tap it will change to 2/3.- On the top row you will see a square called 'select storage'. By default it will look like a cell phone, once you tap it will look like a memory card.- Hit OK to save your change7. To change the video camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizon position, as you turn the camera controls will appear- Tap the gear looking icon on the bottom left- Now you need to switch from camera to video, which is done by sliding your finger from camera to video camera icon on the right hand side slider- If you do it correctly, you will see a red button appear where the video camera is. If you do it incorrectly, you will take a photo. It took me a few tries to get the pressure and location of where my finger slides correctly.- The storage setting is on the second page of the video camera, so you need to page down on the slider by tapping on 1/2.- Tap on 'Select storage' icon, and make sure you see a memory card, rather than the cell phone icon.- Click OK to save your change8. To change the voice recorder- Voice recorder is on the second page of Settings. To get there select Menu - slide you finger right to left to page - tap on Voice recorder.- The top option is 'Storage', tap on it to change cell phone icon to memory card icon.- Click ok to save your changeOverall, the phone feels nice, the screen is easy to read, when I made a few \"test\" phone calls I was told that I sound very clear. Other than that I am quite pleased with this phone. Note that this is NOT a full featured smart phone like Android smart phones or iPhone, but it a very cost efficient way to have an emergency phone which can do a bit more than just phone calls.Ali Julia reviewUpdate 3/9/2013: My original review stated that the thing that I like least about the phone is that its speaker phone is not loud enough to hear well without putting the phone next to your ear. However, since then I discovered that there is a setting which turns on the speaker phone, and with the setting on the phone functions well as a speaker phone. To turn on the speaker phone press on \"speaker\" icon, this icon will appear when you are connected to the other side on the bottom of the screen that is displayed when you are talking on the phone.  To turn it off, click on the \"speaker\" icon again.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tracfone LG 800G with 1200 minutes and Triple Minutes for Life", "Author": "ctmanderly", "ReviewID": "RXIWHTVPLMR4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had previously been Tracfone customers for a number of years and liked it very much.  When we wanted to upgrade our phones, both my husband and I have them, we found this one.  We were delighted to find phones with the 1200 minutes & Triple Minutes for Life already included. With the price of the phone including 1200 minutes and the Triple Minutes for Life, it was like getting the phone for free!  Knowing we would continue to use Tracfone, buying a years minutes at a time was a no-brainer for us.  The phone itself has not been all we could hope for, it didn't get as strong a signal in our area as our old Tracfone did, and the touch sensitivity was not the best. However, it was an upgrade over our earlier phones and after we learned how to turn off some of the features we didn't need, it did work better for us .  Since we don't use the camera, or the web on it, we use it basically as a phone, it was a terrific buy for us for the price with the minutes and the triple minutes for life features included.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly happy", "Author": "Mark S.

I only have two issues with the phone. The first is that it locks up too quickly. I appreciate the person who noted that it's easier to touch the on/off button rather than the unlock button to unlock the phone. The second issue is that the on button does not always function. For example, I'll turn off the phone when I'm in a movie theater but then often struggle to get the phone to turn back on. I generally find that if I can't turn the phone on right then after pressing on several times, if I wait another 10-15 minutes, I can then turn the phone on.

It took me three hours (they actually offered me FIVE minutes back to my plan after I spent 180+ minutes calling from my phone) and three phone calls to transfer my service to this new phone because of the horrible broken English customer service. I am soo terrified of speaking with Tracfone customer service I feel like trashing this phone: with over 250 service days and thousands of minutes, losing all my contacts, and having to re-network everything linked to my current number.I liked Tracfone with the LG500 because I never used their customer service or had issues with the phone.

The fact that it also came with 1200 TracFone minutes was the icing on the cake. 450 minutes cost about $80.

They have upgraded their website lately to make it much, much more user friendly. I added the 1200 minutes during this process without any issue. They gave me a bonus 20 minutes and additional 60 days of service for completing the activation on-line. The phone works great, the features are nice, and the Bluetooth works real well!

If you have realistic expectations, this phone is great.Sound is clear in my location, but my son has same phone within the same zip code and has reception issues within his all-metal mobile home (it may be the metal, or some unknown radio wave interference- don't know). Speaker is loud and clear. Volume can actually be set too loud, so this is a good phone for us old folks who have trouble hearing our phones. Display is bright (adjustable) and font size customizable.Included ringtones are pretty good, I feel no need to download new ones. USB cable would have to be purchased separately, as would extra memory card if you want to use internet extensively. . Display backgrounds are also nice, or you can display your own photos. Included games are lame, but if you want games they are a download away.Price was my main criterion. My 450 minute/month Verizon contract cost me $50-$60 a month, texts 20 cents each. I expect to cut that bill in half with triple minutes.I use a phone to make calls, mostly, but this is a very user-friendly phone for texting.Texts cost one half minute each, a bargain. Haven't tried texting photos yet, they might be more. (?) Text can be entered on phone keyboard, QWERTY keyboard, or handwriting. I have not found a way to set preference for this feature; it seems that mode choice must be made each time you use it. Keyboards and dialpads are electronically generated; there is no physical keyboard, which leaves plenty of room for display.The menu is fairly intuitive and easy to navigate. Touch sensitivity can be calibrated- you don't have to adjust to the phone, it will adjust to you. How cool is that? I have found it necessary to be careful to hold 'end' button down firmly to end phone calls.My favorite feature is the automatic lock, which can be set from 10 to 60 seconds, or off if you want. Phone can be answered in lock mode, but it prevents accidental browsing, redials, etc. This also shuts down display, which saves battery. The battery lasts forever. I charge for 10 minutes once or twice a week, having used 600 minutes in a month.You can assign different ringtones to your contacts, as well as assign their photo to incoming calls. This is a common feature, but not found on some inexpensive phones.Photos are decent quality, but again, get the USB cable (inexpensive on Amazon) if you want to save them to computer. The phone also does video with audio. I haven't used this much, but it seems you can call this feature up quickly to capture the moment.Alarm works well. Still trying to figure out the calendar, which is a little laborious to use- maybe it's me.Your remaining minutes and days are displayed continuously. You can set up an account to buy more minutes from the phone, which must be done before you run out, for some reason.Manual is a bit brief, but online help is available, and Tracfone provides an interactive tutorial if you need it. Setting up the phone was easy and fast with Tracfone.Phone is a bit slippery, so I also purchased Wireless Central Gel Case, which fits perfectly and adds protection and grip.

I've only had one problem with it and that was when my voicemail wasn't registering button presses. No problem, I just had to do a reset by powering down, removing the battery & sim card for a minute then putting it back together. It only happened once so it was no big deal.The shipping was lightning fast and the phone itself is great. Since it has an open face sometimes it will call people automatically or go into browser mode if you're not carefull. For example, if you shove it in a tight pocket your movements may start pushing buttons so I suggest you get a case if you're on the move a lot.The cover flies off easily if you drop it so I recommend buying a skin cover to fix that issue. I've dropped it tons of times (without any protection) and it still works fine so durability is excellent.The seller included a piece of paper with clear instructions on how to install the 1200 minutes (it's actually 400 minutes but with triple minutes the total you get is 1200.) Also, I spent about 2 minutes online and found a code for 250 bonus minutes.In regards to Tracfone service, I've been with them for years and am very happy. Nice, clear reception and they buy minutes in bulk from the large companies such as Verizon so it's not a generic program you're getting here. I also bought a 1500 minute card from tracfone's website and found a code for 50 free minutes. So in the end I got a total of 6000 minutes for $285 which equates to 4.7 cents per minute.

If you're using tracfone long-term, it's a worthwhile investment. This phone's issues have a lot more to do with usability. The touch screen is laggy and imprecise, at best. It is apparent in many aspects of the design that insufficient time, money, or effort were invested. For instance, although you can use a keyboard to text people, you have to use the old 9-key input method to add a contact to your phone. The device is loaded with this little inconveniences which, although not the end of the world, make it frustrating to use. Another example: I am a male with what I perceive to be ordinary-size fingers and good hand-eye coordination. But I have immense trouble typing with the keyboard. It's a gamble every time whether the phone will recognize the letter I pressed or the one next to it, or whether it will respond at all. Similarly, when I click to start writing a text, cancel sending a text, answer a call, wake the phone up, anything, the phone has a substantial delay before responding. And sometimes it just doesn't respond. So a good portion of the time, I'll press a button for the phone to do something, see that nothing is happening, and press again right as the phone does the initial task, only for it to recognize the second pressing and go off on another entirely unintended task.Long story short, I am glad I have this phone. The triple minutes are great. But if the triple minutes were ever available on literally any other device, I would recommend avoiding this phone.

We live only an hour's drive from the shipping location, and each phone was received via Priority Mail the next business day after ordering. We've had about eight tracfones in the last ten years and had (mostly minor) issues with all of them until the LG800g.  These are easier to use, easier to read the displays, and provide great sound quality for calls. By the time we had entered our contacts list, we were very comfortable with the touch-screen tactile feel.A silicon/rubber type cover or case will make the phone more secure in your hand. The LG800g is light and sleek/slick, and it's easily dropped if not in a snug cover.  It can only handle a 4 gig micro SD memory card, which Amazon had for $3.98.  We probably won't use the MP3 capability, and will text only occasionally, but we both find the virtual QWERTY touchscreen keyboard very user-friendly.  For us, web-browsing is a low priority since we find the tablet and net-book easier to see and use.  But we have both given browsing a try, and feel it is adequate for a non-smart cell-phone.At the $99.50 price in effect as of mid-July, you get the phone, a year's service, 1200 minutes, plus 200 bonus minutes from promo code 44811 or 83844 (I forget which one worked) In effect, you get the phone and triple-minutes-for-life for the same price as the year of service would normally cost.

It seems to have longer talk time than the spec claims but that may be related to my usage pattern.  Down side is it goes through the airport type x-ray machine daily and that seems to lock it up?

Another negative is that the phone only seems to be able to use a 4GB sdhc memory (4 is the smallest I had), and will NOT talk to an 8, or 16gb card (I tried several and several brands no luck).  To me the biggest negative is no 24hr clock mode.

I was happy with my very simple Motorola but was starting to use more and more minutes and was considering switching to Net 10, a Tracfone-owned company that is for people who use more minutes than the average Tracfone costumer.  Anyways, I stumbled onto this phone with the triple minutes for life and new that that was a deal for me!  So, I read lots of reviews and they all seem to be very good, and the phone seemed like it'd be a good match for me.  I use my phone for calling (imagine that!) and texting, nothing more, really.  And I didn't want a qwerty keyboard, I was familiar with pressing the buttons on my motorola multiple times for texting purposes. So, I went for it.  And, I must say, this phone has made me very happy!!  I got my 1200 minutes, plus an extra 250 free minutes after googling tracfone bonus codes.  The phone is very easy to use-I don't particularly like reading instructional manuals!  The touchscreen works very well, the \"buttons\" on the screen are bigger than average phone buttons, for those of us with fat fingers.  Also, my mom, who can't see much without her reading glasses can actually see the numbers on the \"dialpad\" without putting on her glasses.  So, I just ordered a phone for her, too!  This is an awesome deal, considering that the 1 year 400 minute card costs $100 at Walmart.  So, the phone with a gel back and a car phone charger was a $101.40, and I'll give her a screen protector from me since they come as a 3-pack.  So, a win-win situation!  If you're worried about whether the phone will work in your area, go to Tracfone's website and put in your area code and they'll give you a list of the phones that will work where you live.  I live in the boondocks of Northcentral Wisconsin and the phone works great!

Brunner", "ReviewID": "R2X6ZHWH5BW2WQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using a very dependable Blackberry for about 14 yrs, the same one. Worked great. There are three of us bundled on a family plan and we decided it was time to end the expensive contract.We first bought a Samsung Proclaim with the air time from HSN. Without notification, they canceled the order stating they could not fill all the orders.We then bought the same phone on Amazon and have been trying to work with that for just about a month.I personally don't like it and no one was able to use much of the phone without a capacitive stylus. I ordered the stylus on Amazon, that order was lost in the mail.With only a week left to buy my phone, I read the reviews for this LG800 phone.I had little issue transferring my old number via the computer. Activating it was another story.I waited 12 hours and decided to call for help. I got an automated answering system that had me go through numerous codes of nearly 200 some letters to input into the phone. It did work after a very frustrating time with the machine not accepting my voice prompts. I have only made a couple of calls so far and not at all impressed with the speaker phone, which is what I use exclusively. It starts to break up at about 50% volume and gets worse.The phone looks and feels nice. I liked the features, what I could understand of them. The case leaves a lot to be desired.I will be missing the blackberry for sure. I may have to find another phone however.No evaluation is being given for many of the phone funtions. I am just reviewing the issues I had getting service and using the speaker phone.I would not recommend this for anyone that does not have a house phone with speaker phone options, which I would higly recommend be used, to activate the new phone.Update: 9/18/12I received a second phone and upgraded my rating to 3 stars. I asked for a replacement phone just to see if the loud speaker worked any better. I found they are good up to 3-4 bars. Not so great after that and IMO, the weak link in the phone.An inexpensive capacitive stylus does wonders.When I activated the first phone, I had to enter at least two hundred digits. The second was much easier, except, I was not able to transfer the account by the web site as the minute balance did not match and I would have lost a few hundred. When I did activate, the web site offered another 200 minutes, which the representative did add to the phone.The case that comes with it, not so good. However, I used an I-pod case I bought earier in the year. That works super! It hangs lower on the waist, and looks great.Have to see if I can locate that information in my files.Lots of nice features on this phone. I have left it on standby for about a week so far. Still has a full charge. My Blackberry would have been dead in two days.update 12/23/2012The original phone no longer held a charge and became difficult to turn on. A replacement phone was received in 3 days. To activate the new phone, I had to call Tracphone about 5 times until I was able to reach someone. In the process, I had to again input well over 100 digits of code. I then found the woman put the wrong phone number in the phone. I did not find that out until I needed the phone and was not able to receive any calls.When I called back to straighten that out, I was then told I had double minutes for life, instead of triple minutes. Still working on that issue.Sure was a lot easier dealing with problems via ATT. Thankfully I still have a land line to use to get this phone to work.I found that keeping the phone set to airtime info did not allow me to bump the broswer and waist minutes by mistake.A nice phone when it works properly.I do miss not being able to input more information such as addresses, extensions and names etc., for each entry.update: 12/23/12  Five or so hours later, I still can not use the phone. My original phone number was not transferred to the replacement, reconditioned phone. Now on my 4th tracphone rep and hours later, not so thrilled to have to wait another 3-5 days for yet another SIM car so I can get my original phone number reinstated. One rep I had to hang up on due to very poor phone connection, that after 15 minutes attempting to work with that person.I never had problems like this with ATT.

Nice touch-screen interface. Unfortunately, the upside of this phone is outweighed by problems with texting. In an area deemed by Tracfone as \"the best area for reception,\" the phone began to receive duplicate text messages (hundreds of them) that rendered the phone useless for in/out texting. It is unclear what causes the problem, but possibly texts long enough to trigger splitting them into two. This problem can go on for days and recurs often. Tracfone customer service was unable to fix the problem, after many hours spent on the phone with them. When they \"elevate\" the call to a specialist who has better capability to provide a solution, the specialist must call back according to an appointment time, which they missed by three hours. After rescheduling, they never called again, and claimed to have no record of the elevation. We attempted to resolve this in three four-plus-hour phone sessions with Tracfone, to no avail. And they never offered or agreed to replace the phone when I suggested that as a solution.Not usually one to complain, but fair warning: This appears to be a problem with this model, since our simple Samsung slider never had these problems. Bought three for the family -- one has had no problems (short texter in a different zip code), one has occasional problems, and the third one (nothing but problems) from the \"best area\" zip code seems to have finally stopped duplicating and will now allow accumulated texts through after driving out of the zip code. Go figure.Update to review: Son went to college and immediately began to experience the same text problems (used in an \"excellent coverage\" zone). Spent another 3+ hours with Tracfone customer service (in addition to the 12+ logged hours trying to fix the same problem with my daughter's phone at college - didn't get fixed - and they insisted they had no record of our previous calls, until I read back the transcripts from those calls - long story, but yes I had the whole thing). Tracfone finally agreed to replace our phones but refused to replace my son's with a triple-minute since their system showed him as only having double minutes, instead sending a reconditioned phone that is not even on the list for our zip code. And just today, my daughter began having the same multiple-receipt of same texts again. Such a frustrating experience. Be wary; weigh how dependable you want the phone to be, and verify upon activation that you will indeed receive 3x minutes when you add minutes, or you may be very disappointed.

I got the 1200 minutes right after I bought the phone along with bonus minute from a promotional code. I was told that the triple minute feature was on the phone. I already had a tracfone so I had my service transferred. They had trouble transferring my service. I kept calling the technical support 800 number and the recording kept telling me about the high volume of calls coming in and hanging up on me. After a few days they finally transferred the service, and everything was fine until now. I hadn't purchased anymore airtime until today, December 30, so I haven't had another opportunity to deal with tracfone since I bought the phone. But today I bought a 120 minute card to use with the promocode they sent me (66836) that's supposed to give you 300 bonus minutes if you add 120 minutes before December 31. I added the minutes and the promocode and it gave me 120 and 300 bonus minutes. No triple minutes, not even double minutes, just the 120 minutes that I bought plus the bonus. I called Tracfone tech support (800 867 7183) and the tech said that this is a double minute phone, there is no triple minute deal. I told her that it was being sold on Amazon with a triple minute deal and that the seller is still selling it today, and after putting me on hold, she told me that seller on Amazon is a scam; that I bought the phone at my own risk because I didn't buy from tracfone's website. I asked her why tracfone was servicing a phone that was sold by a fraudulent dealer and she said that if you have one of their phones they will service it. Well I asked to speak with her supervisor because Tracfone activated my phone and confirmed the triple minute deal when my phone was in the 7 day warranty, and they added the 1200 minutes, just like the seller promised. She connected me to a Keisha, who I later found out was in South America, who confirmed that the phone was in fact a triple minute phone, that this was not a scam and after telling me to meddle with the code entry mode on the phone and asking me what my airtime balance was, told me that this amount was precisely what was supposed to be on there, and that their information said that the 120 minutes was in fact tripled. I told her that I already had 451 minutes on my phone and that there are only 871 now, and that they only added the 120 plus the bonus, they didn't triple the 120 minutes or they would have added 360 plus the bonus. She said that they could not give me anymore minutes because it said that there were 120 minutes added and that they were tripled. I asked her if she can see how many minutes I already had, she said no. I asked her if she can see how many I bought and how many I've used, she said no. I told her that I have the text message they just sent me saying that they adding 120 minutes plus the bonus. She said that the text message only reflects how much you bought not how much they are adding. I told her that every text I have gotten before, even on the old tracfone that I had for three years, reflected the total amount they were adding. I asked if there was someone else who knows what is going on with my phone because it didn't make sense that the service I am getting is from their company and the information being sent to my phone says that they're only adding 120 minutes with the bonus, and the balance that they have uploaded to my phone only added up the 120 minutes plus the bonus, and yet their system says they tripled the 120 minutes and gave me the bonus. She got off the phone for a few minutes and came back and told me that she has spoken with her supervisor and that they have already given me all the minutes, \"they cannot and will not give me any more minutes\", and they will not check on how many minutes I already had because they cannot give me anymore minutes. I asked her for her title, and she said she was not permitted to give me her title (when she answered the phone she claimed to be the manager), I asked if she had some sort of operator number, she told me it was 48602. I asked why she was not allowed to tell me her title if she was a Tracfone employee. She said she was allowed to give her name and customer service number but not her title, and that they were not going to give me anymore minutes.

Sales reps. read from scripts.  Don't dare to ask them a question...they don't even come close to answering it.  They then go back to reading their script; all the while your \"minutes\" are being deleted as they stick you on hold forever!  Second phone had the wrong activation code; when \"corrected\" by them, 3000 min. went 'poof' and so did initial activation.  Phone was now dead, phone number was ported to someone else (had it for yrs.) and a $99.00 phone card was useless.  Signal was OK at best for me.  I was assured they went off of all major towers and would not have a problem.  Went online to read about customer satisfaction w/TracFone after the fact.  Sorry I didn't do that 1st...expensive lesson learned.  The phones are not the issue.  Customer service located in different countries w/non-native English speakers reading off scripts IS the problem.  No bias or offense meant...I work w/many individuals tht are bi-lingual.  So...I was initially out $320. I went back to my original cell phone carrier groveling and they refunded some money to me and ALL of my rollover min. that were lost, plus they kept me OFF CONTRACT. I don't know how but they even got the lost #  back...said phone wasn't totally out of min. so they ported it back.  The store where phones/cards were purchased took the phones back (thank god!) because their sales people were stuck for 1 hr. talking to 3 foreign reps. wasting min. as well.  Unfortunately, I did have to \"eat the 2-$99.00 cards\" even though 1 didn't even register at all due to faulty activation codes. I was told by store to file a complaint w/TracFone's parent company.

I called Tracfone (was on hold for full 1/2 hour and then spoke to someone I could barely understand) and was told this has nothing to do with Tracfone and I need to contact the seller and complain.***Update:  After much time researching, I did discover that the random white piece of paper taped to the outside of the box that said nothing but, \"PIN\" and a number, was a number I was supposed to use to claim the minutes. I had NO idea -- there are no instructions or labeling or even the slightest hint about what that number is for.  For anyone stuck in my situation, go to the Tracfone website, select \"add minutes\", and enter that PIN number taped to the outside of your box.  The Tracfone representative I talked to had no idea about the minutes and apparently had never heard of such a thing, and there is nothing in the Amazon product description, either. I wasted a great deal of time and effort, and my daughter went for a week unable to use her Christmas present, because of this glaring lack of communication.It also took me about six attempts to even get the phone registered.  First there was a call, then I tried to open a trip ticket on Tracfone, but when I entered the serial number of the phone it refused the ticket and said \"that phone is pending, try again in 5 minutes\".  Kept trying that for a few days. Finally called again and was cut off.  Called yet again and finally got a roboperson who gave me about long strings of numbers to enter.  The phone was at least connected at that point. But the phone only had ten minutes and it was a total mystery how we would get the 1200 minutes.The reason we got a simple Tracfone was to avoid the complications of adding another line to our Verizon account.  There has been nothing simple about getting this phone up and running, however.  I blame both the seller's mystifying lack of communication and Tracfone.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time...", "Author": "Richard A. Tait", "ReviewID": "R1LPNKSKSUTG8F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this device at Walgreen's with the NET10 (aka Tracfone) Unlimited service. At first it was the best thing since sliced bread and I would have bee more than happy to to have come on here and give it 5 stars. It worked well and had many features, and of course it was dirt cheap. Touch screen for less than $50 bucks! Who could complain, right? Well, sit back, because I'm going to do so now.After you buy this phone to set it up you must either log into NET10's site or call their 1-800 number from ANOTHER phone. Waste of time. Oh...and if you buy the phone after hours forget the latter option. They will be closed. And yes, after hours includes weekends.The phone uses resistive touch technology. That means that the screen is soft and actually depresses when you touch it. That makes selecting an item difficult at times and requires numerous touches, even though the phone will vibrate or make a sound telling you that it has received input. If the item you are trying to select is close to the edge of the screen, forget it. Try to drag the view away from the edge or get a stylus. Your finger will be useless.Browsing the internet on this thing is a nightmare. Of course the browser is as basic as it gets and is as slow as cold lava. Most web pages will have too much content and when that happens you are told, but then instead of just aborting the process, it also kicks you offline and you go back to your splash screen! This requires you to restart the browser, yet again. One solution to this is to disable browsing with images. Open each image one at a time (by touching the icon, preferably with your stylus), refreshing the page after each image has been viewed. Be sure to make the resolution as small as possible when opening images because ONE large image can also render you in the original situation as well. Opening more than one at a time MAY render you in the original situation.The service was 30 days unlimited, which for the most part it is, but NET10/Tracfone has this annoying habit of giving you 50,000 minutes and counting down from that EVERY TIME you use the phone. No month has 50,000 minutes in it, so that's fine, but seeing how many minutes are deducted before or after EVERY action (including receiving and sending texts) is a waste of time. There is no ability to call or text overseas with this service.The sign of things to come came a month after I got it. I got wet in the rain one day and the phone (although it was in my pocket the entire time and was not exposed to direct wetting) stopped working. It eventually came back on by itself. about a month after that one day I was sending a text to a friend of mine and it just hung up and reset itself. And it kept restarting and shutting down for hours on end. I could not get it to stop. I eventually just threw it away. I don't miss it. (Well...I do miss the \"Good Morning\" ringtone that used to be my alarm! It really sets the morning out on the right foot and will be guaranteed to have you humming or singing it ALL day. Heck, even friends will join in. Now that I'm back home I will install it on my own phone for sure!) I replaced the 800G with another NET10 phone because I figured I had the number already so I might as well just continue with it since I only had a week left in the US. All I had to do was swap the chip and I would be good, right? Not with NET10/Tracfone. The old SIM was useless. To get back my number I had to log into the website and move my old account to the new phone. A Fairly simple task, but unnecessary in today's world.In short, I don't like this phone and I don't like NET10/Tracfone. I plan to throw away the other phone I bought (itself was garbage on an entirely different level) and never look back. You get what you pay for in this phone/service. But my advice is for the potential buyer to wait a few more weeks, save up the extra money and buy a proper phone. Get one with capacitive touch technology (like an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy) and find a better service provider. Please.
