{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad at all!", "Author": "A_TiffyFit \"Book Devourer\"", "ReviewID": "R1AI2YSB98ZMQN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this phone on the Black Friday deal at Wal*Mart...for the most part, I am really pleased. It took some getting used to a touch screen phone, but the included stylus is a great way to help initiate you into the touchscreen model. (Hint, that upper right thing is NOT an antenna. Pull it fully out and it's your stylus!)The websurfing leaves much to be desired. You can't download a lot of free apps that I was hoping for. Unlimited text, web, and talk in the UNITED STATES ONLY. I can't text my friends in Canada, although you can get a calling plan to call them for fairly cheap (3 cents a minute, $10 to start with). The radio feature is kinda fun for when I need it, and you can store mp3s on there (although without a card, not all that much!).The camera is 3.0mp and takes a decent picture for a phone. The camcorder is also pretty decent and picks up sound well. All in all, this was well worth the amount I paid on Black Friday and the $50 a month it costs for the unlimited plan (including tax). Not so sure I would say that if I hadn't gotten it for so cheap! ($35 for the phone alone)", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returning this item...", "Author": "NightSister", "ReviewID": "R1SJV0L3TGWBI6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The touch screen leaves much to be desired. I have to try 2-6 times just to unlock the phone. Texting is very frustrating on this model and I'm really underwhelmed by the features.I have only used this phone for 2 days, but I can quickly tell its not the phone for me.**Update**I have adjusted to the touch screen, but I am still very disappointed with the programing of this phone. After using it 2 months I still give it 2/5 stars as a review.The voice quality is worse than any other pre-paid phone I've used. Often conversations are whisper quite while others are blaring loud. My friends and family are tired of me asking them to repeat themselves in conversations. Web browsing is possible, but sluggish and frustrating. It works in a pinch but don't expect to find what you are looking for in under 8 minutes.The tilt-sensing function is very inaccurate and only available when texting. Calling someone from your phone book is much more complicated then it needs to be; I should be able to accomplish this with no more then 4 buttons/touches. The screen-locking feature kicks in at random times, in the middle of texting or inputting data, what's with that? Can it not tell I'm actively using the phone..The basic tools are lacking. The calendar is a disappointment but the calculator can add correctly and the voice recorder records, sort of. The camera is 'okay' but sending pictures in MMS is difficult and tedious.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A keeper.", "Author": "Jennifer Cole", "ReviewID": "R2O941PIAP0LNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has way better signal than my old phone. Now I see bars everywhere, even inside the buildings normally you can't get any signal from. It's small and easy to use. I don't have any problem with the features. This really helps lower my phone bill. I got $45 unlimited calling, texting and web browsing. When I said unlimited, I mean unlimited. I talk, text and go on internet all day long, and it's still $45 a month. I've never been happier.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "very pleased", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R38US22YN0PATM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the phone it is a very nice looking phone and has a lot of stuff on it that I will be using.

And Net10's service department messes up every time you ask for help they make things worse.  They take over an hour to anwser your call and then either hang up on you or put you at the end of the line to speak with a supervisor who did not fix the problem but charged my credit card a second time for the same month.  DO NOT US NET10 PHONES OR SERVICES.  The don't know what they are doing.
