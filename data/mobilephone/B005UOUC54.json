{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fine for basic phone service", "Author": "SteveF", "ReviewID": "R285QWOXDBG9M8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If all you need is occasional basic phone service including text messaging, the Tracfone T330G is perfectly adequate.  Its chief advantage is economy.  There is no contract.  You purchase airtime in advance according to your needs.  Perhaps the most economical option is 60 minutes (doubled) and 90 days for $19.99, which works out to under $7 per month.  Many other options are available.As for additional features, the T330G also has a camera and it comes with Bluetooth capability.  Its main drawback is its telephone-type keypad, which is too frustrating to use for frequent entering of text.  Trying to send a text message is an exercise in patience and frustration.The phone does offer mobile web service, but this feature is so lame as to be nearly useless.  Even if you have a need merely to check your email throughout the day, consider an upgraded cell phone, one with a QWERTY keypad or touchscreen.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bargain", "Author": "David L.

It is attractive looking, easy to use, and fits just about any pocket. It is not for the heavy phone user who does a lot of texting or web surfing. There is no contract, no obligation. The $20 card that provides 120 minutes in 90 days is fine for my purposes. Any unused minutes carry over. I use mine as an MP3 player; had to buy a special cable to connect ear buds, but it works fine and has nice sound. If you bought this just to use as a music player, it would still be a bargain. Highly recommended for the budget-conscious phone user who just wants to carry a phone in case it's needed and wants to avoid contracts and big monthly bills.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Order this only if you love T-Mobile signal", "Author": "Seraphim", "ReviewID": "RA69YGHTCA5CZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This model ships with a T-Mobile sim. If you have signal problems with T-Mobile where you live, like I do, then you are out of luck and will have to live with poor and unreliable reception.I have previously had a nightmerish 1-year contract with T-Mobile which I ram from at the very first opportunity due to signal issues. It's no fun having a cell phone that you can not rely on to be able to make or recieve a call during emergencies. The reviews told me that tracfone uses either T-Mobile or ATT and that they will switch the SIM if I have signal issues.It was a mistake on my part to rely on that. I got the phone and immediately noticed the same signal issues that I was oh so familiar with. I called up Tracfone customer service rep. After 54 minutes on the phone, troubleshooting different things, I was informed that \"Our system's coverage map shows that you should have 'good' coverage so we won't be able to switch your sim\". They, however, kindly offered me to troubleshoot my phone.It's as if anybody is supposed to believe T-Mobile's own coverage map.For the single digit price - I guess an unreliable phone is better than nothing. But beware if you need any sort of signal reliability.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone!", "Author": "Brittany D", "ReviewID": "R3DDHAQKSKGJ7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok so I switched from H2O to Tracfone because I was sick of getting collections calls that were NOT for me. I had changed my number multiple times and every time I would get daily collections calls for other people. They were recordings so I couldn't speak to someone to remove my number.So I just activated my phone yesterday and it works great! I'm glad I chose this phone because I've had a samsung slider phone before and loved it. This phone is no different. This phone (in my area) uses AT&T;'s network----yay! This is a GSM phone so it will either be on ATT's network or T-mobile's network for you. AT&T; has great service here. I love how tracfone's phones have the minute balance and service days right on the home screen. How convenient! The only gripe I have with this phone (and I presume ALL tracfone's phones) is you can't change the menu to get rid of the 'browser' menu which takes you directly to the mobile browser. I haven't hit it yet but I know eventually I will (accidentally)... But other than that this is a very well built, solid, great sounding phone. Call quality is clear with minimal issues and I was able to set up voicemail in a snap.This phone only comes with 20 starter minutes and 60 days of service. So you need to buy more minutes either online here at amazon or walmart where you can get direct delivery to your email of the pin code for your minutes to be input into your phone or via online at tracfone's website. This is a double minutes for life phone which means you buy 30 minutes, you get 60. It does NOT double your service days though. Just the minutes. So if you buy 1000 minutes you get 2000 minutes automatically.The phone takes nice clear crisp photos. I was surprised. I expected a tracfone to have a crappy camera. Not this one. This is as good as my last samsung slider. So I'm very pleased. I hope to have this phone for a long time.EDIT: ok the camera sucks. I looked at the pics on my computer and they are very blurry. Too bad. I was in love with this phone, but I guess it's not really all that necessary to have a good camera in a phone. :)", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tracfone and Samsung t330g  Great Deal", "Author": "P.G, \"PGXI\"", "ReviewID": "R1I8C7BQ6ZB3LA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this phone is perfect for basic cell phone use good quality, better than expected. tracfone offers the best prepaid plans so you can have affordable cell service. this was a great purchase thanks amazonpurchase through shopcelldeals there shipping was fast and no surprises just a great deal I would recommend this phone", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "An Amazing Bargain That Would Have Cost $10,000 Just 15 Years Ago", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R49R3H0G008C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am astonished that some people are complaining about this $7 (postpaid) giveaway. The Samsung T330G is so cheap that it might as well be free. I don't even use it as a phone, except for calling 911, which costs nothing (it doesn't have to be activated to do that.) I use the T330G to record videos, take pictures, record audio, play games, tell time, set an alarm, and do about a thousand other neat tricks. Instructions are sorely lacking for this slick gadget, so learning how to use it can be aggravating. You will need to surf the Net for better instructions than are included. To recap, for $7 postpaid you get an emergency (911) phone, camera, voice recorder, camcorder, game machine, music player, image editor, calendar, alarm, clock, calculator, and many other gizmos built into one. I keep a T330G in each car and have a few laying around the house. BUY IT, IT COSTS A WHOPPING $7 COUNTING SHIPPING! What else can you buy for $7 that is so much fun? This gadget would have cost $10,000 just 15 years ago. Like all cell phones, the Samsung T330G is somewhat fragile, so use care when handling it.

I then tested that the phone could make and receive calls using my ported number, which it did. After that I used GV to port the number from the cell ($20 fee) which only took 24 hours.
