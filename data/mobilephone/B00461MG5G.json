I have used the this version of the Curve before and I loved the keyboard and the ease of use. Its a great little phone to have. The phone came to me with the charger, the battery, and the battery cover. Everything looked in great condition. The phone itself looked new actually. I saw no scratches anywhere on the equipment.The problem is the battery cover that the phone came with did not fit the phone. Now I know the company sells alot of these phones resale, but you would think they would at least make sure the battery cover fit the phone before sending them out. I'm sure there are people who have an old phone with a battery cover they could use but I don't, nor do I want to shop around to find one that fits. This should have been taken care of when they sold me the phone.I gave this 3 stars because the product did not come with all the correct equipment that was usable. I will also be leaving feedback on the seller's page as well. This is in no way a review telling you not to buy the phone. You may get a phone with the correct back or you may have one laying around. This is just a warning.
