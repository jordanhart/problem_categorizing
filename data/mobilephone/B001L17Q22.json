Specifically, it supports UMTS over the 2100 MHz band only, not 850 or 1900 MHz for AT&T;, nor 1700 MHz for T-Mobile USA.As an alternative, consider getting the AT&T; branded C905a, even if you are buying the phone for full price without contract.  This phone is identical, except that:* It has the additional support for AT&T;'s 3G network (850 and 1900 MHz in addition to 2100 MHz)* As shipped, it contains AT&T; branded firmware.* It is SIM-locked to AT&T.;The latter two issues are however easily fixable through debranding and unlocking.  For instance, visit the DavinciTeam or WotanServer web sites.  Once debranded, you have the best of both worlds: Original Sony Ericsson firmware (with support for WiFi, MS Exchange, standard IMAP/POP3, SIP, YouTube, and so on) and North American compatible 3G.Likewise, if you are a T-Mobile customer, there is a forthcoming version of this phone for T-Mobile (with UMTS over 1700 MHz); the model number is \"CS8\".  However, if you can't wait and are OK with 2G/GSM/EDGE only coverage, then the C905i would be a very decent choice.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with an O.K. phone built in", "Author": "SF Guy", "ReviewID": "R1BQNJA86PFGTH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With this device, I believe Sony Ericsson has reach the logical conclusion of the \"race for the better camera phone.\"  Other devices already exceed 8 megapixels, but why bother?  the files sizes are already huge and no one really appreciates files this large being sent to them.  All of my complaints about this device are about it's cellphone capabilities...  Thus, i tell friends this is a great camera with an OK phone built in...Advantages:  beautiful photos and nice video.  Plenty of storage for both on the device.  the phone's processor is quick and the phone displays the pictures nicely.disadvantages:  awkward phone keys (hard to push;  horrible to text if you are used to buttons and/or QWERTY);  the SE interface for downloading to your PC is awkward at best.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Gabriel Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R425GHPXCSYEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent cellphone.
