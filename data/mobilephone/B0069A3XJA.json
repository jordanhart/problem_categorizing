Pfister", "ReviewID": "R23MUO1QSFF325", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The plastic on this phone feels like something from a kids toy.  It does work as a phone and the buttons are fine, I just had a hard time navigating the menu and the instruction book was not very informative.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It is something that is good as a temporary phone if your main one breaks, but I would not recommend it for long term use.  But I did find it neat that you could put two sim cards in it.  Definitely a neat idea.  I decided to keep mine just in case my current 4 year old Nokia Music Xpress decides to bite the dust.  Might be a good phone for someone who tends to lose or break their phones often, at least you won't lose a lot of money!", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0069A3XJA"}}
