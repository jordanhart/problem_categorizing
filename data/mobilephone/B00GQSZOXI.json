I upgradedfrom the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and let me tell you, the LG Flex blows the Note 3 out of the water! It's easier to hold, fits a larger screen in the same body size, easier to view (no glare) and beautifulmatte-like display, not as much bloatware, snappier, longer battery life, noticeably faster, better speakerphone, more customizable, and the list goes on and on. Just wish it had SD Card support, but with 32gb of internal storage I think I can get by. This design is very innovative and it justworks...its a no brainer bc it fits smoothly in your hands and curves along your face when talking on it. This phone is all about comfort and ease of use. Finally the Note 3 has some serious competition. I'mgoing to hold on to this phone for years. When I text on this phone I'm just like \"ahh, what a relief!\" Its such a joy to use to compared to all other phones...it's one of those things you can't reallyunderstand until you try it.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "After all.....", "Author": "T. Hortobagyi", "ReviewID": "R2KZDSJUKLX6LA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I have had!Yeah well, at least to me. I have read and watched so many videos about how the screen quality is not as sharp as others (even from LG) but to me, it is perfect. The light matte to the screen is nice, it feels more sophisticated and expensive. While everyone has the new Ferrari, you have the new Rolls. Of course a new Ferrari is nice, and so is a nice, sharp, crisp screen, even-so, I don't always like being shouted at by my images, just shown nicely. (The screen quality is REALLY not bad, I have just heard way to much about it....and I love Rolls-Royce.) The burn-in I have noticed though, and quite frequently, but it does go away everytime pretty quicky.I have had so many Android phones...The battery life on here is no joke. It really will last you well through your day and you night. I charge mine once every other day.The screen is not as curved as it shows in some of these pics however.The back really does heal itself...! I noticed it got a scratch on the upper back from hitting something in my (back pocket as that is the best place to keep it) and I just watched hoping it would go away like they say. It did, with a small amount of rubbing with my finger and the heat from the sun, but it went away. I then got cocky and scratched the back with a dime -in a small area- and even with varrying pressure, all the scratches went away, amazing.Honestly, the phone is great and all with its super multi-tasking capabilities (you can run multi-window, 2 QSlide apps, and slide aside all at the same time!) but I really love how it feels in your hand. It feels like you are holding a piece of glass. I love that. It feels expensive.I've had mine for a month now and have had a lot of people point it out and want to bend it (never let them even though it safely can), it turns heads if that's some extra you are going for.The SNote I miss, but mostly because of the stylus. If this phone had a stylus this would be better IMO. I am going to buy one of those pin-point ones they sell on here.Enjoy!", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "wodrfuul", "Author": "caponata giuseppe", "ReviewID": "R38FQNBRJ08WN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yeah well, at least to me.

The device i receive looked new and beautiful. The problem began when I tried to connect to the Internet through different carriers. At first, I didn't realize there was a problem. I was just sure the problem is the carrier. So during the week and a half I went through 4 different carriers, I had to pay $200 for accounts activation, and all the carriers told me the same thing  -  THE PHONE IS DEFECTIVE.I bought it a week and a half ago from the company above and during this time they've managed to change the company name (from HeavyDuty Electronics TO  Mobile Front) and to lower the price, for the reason that all the devices are damaged.(I bought my device at $ 673.99 ).Imagine that - I bought my self a new smartphone, paid full price, and can't connect to the internet!When i complained to the company that the phone don't work i got an Email from them saying because i bought it for use in the USA, there's might be problems with 4G LTE.The problem is they didn't tell you that when you buy, and the problem is not only with 4G LTE - YOU HAVE NO INTERNET AT ALL!!!So if you want to save yourselfes time and money don't buy from this company!!", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "3G dont work for me.

The features on this phone is mind blowing. The voice clarity out smarts Note 3. The software is very user friendly and has so many features. The display is bit fuzzy, but considering the size of the phone and the curved display, it is not a very big issue. The display is pretty bright is sunlight. The buttons and IR blaster is behind the phone and they are easily accessible.The CPU is fast and it is the same as Note 3 if not better. I really like the quick access menu and the customizable home keys.I would highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "normally never submit a review but this thing awesome, 55 years old finally a cell phone that works", "Author": "William R.

LG's slogan\ufffd \"life's good\" really holds up to it,especially with the massive battery(it last FOREVER) I'm an AT&T; employee and so I did a ridiculous amount of thought about what phone to get next, boy am I happy I went with the Flex over Note 3 or HTC 1. (You wouldn't believe how many Samsung phones I see that are messed up and my warrenty center has to replace) I've come to realize that yes LG sells less phones but the customers that do have LG are extremely happy. Quality over quantity! I was so happy with my LG G Flex that I got my girlfriend the LG G 2. I recommend ether the LG G Flex or the LG G 2 to anyone, dont be a sheep and get a Samsung or iPhone, your the one that has to use the phone get the product that is actually quality", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG G Flex is not a Note", "Author": "pltsg", "ReviewID": "RS74BOUN9Z4YZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Display good, love curve design, battery life great, chip set, apps run smooth.
