It has the look performance & feel of a $500 phone for only $200. Probably the only concern is the small internal memory but you can put in a microsd & root it (both android & sony are open source so its completely easy) & then you can install apps on the memory to preserve the internal memory. I also liked that it came with almost no bloatware for me to remove. My only concern is its featherlight feels like nothing is in my hand(or pocket when not holding it) so I'll be sure to get a case for when I inevitably drop it.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "good price and quality", "Author": "Oleg Gritskov", "ReviewID": "R286OE1M84KECA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good quality, phone works perfect, has a long battery life, comfort Sony virtual keyboard, non-sliding plastic like rubber when you touch it, size the same as iPhone 5, android work fast and smooth, fast 3d graphic chip", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT", "Author": "Ana K.", "ReviewID": "RWGJELBQBTV06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ITs soooo gorgeous , perfect , but the sim card is MICRO SIM , i love it.

It is light and easy to carry. Fits just right in my hand.What I hate about the device is it's hardware materials, the back cover feels fragile and cheap.Camera captures decent images in daylight and in low light situations.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best upgrade alternative", "Author": "M. Rogers", "ReviewID": "R3BLYZ3YRD0JTT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the option to buy the Z model from my current phone company but it was closer to $600. In comparison to that model, by going with this one I missed out on a few options but not major ones. It has a front-facing camera and does everything else I need it to without being bulky. The regular camera seems to be lower megapixels than I'm used to but the phone's photo editing options pretty much make up for it. I love the ease of customizing screens and notifications. I had to get a micro SIM card to fit in the phone so it delayed me using it until I could get to my phone company's store but the card was free so it wasn't a major setback. The Xperia app that downloads once you connect the phone to a computer allows for a lot of options, including transferring contacts from your old phone so I did not lose anything. The battery life is a little shorter than I would prefer but there are battery-saving options that are pretty effective. I would definitely recommend this phone as a cheaper alternative to upgrading through a phone company!", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good enough for me..", "Author": "Jorge Alvarado", "ReviewID": "R3MDHXZ1WODEZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally going to rate this phone at 3 stars due to the inability to move apps to the sd card (Like every other phone).. But I rarely come across any memory problems.. The front facing camera is really bad, But I have no use for it so it would mean just as much to me as if it weren't there.. The rear camera is decent.. But again, I'm not a huge fan of taking pictures.. Another problem would be that MOST of the time, Their is a menu strip (Home button, Back button, Running apps button) that don't go away using certain apps..", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone though", "Author": "Philo Bwabwa", "ReviewID": "R2ZK6JX59WJPKP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love this phone, but the front camera is just horrible. nothing good comes out of it...Still it is a very nice. I also noticed that the battery doesn't last that long, which is unfortunate.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone, good price", "Author": "midmich", "ReviewID": "RDMY5Z2TUXQZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace my Xperia X8, which had become painfully inadequate for today's apps. My new Xperia M actually cost less than what I paid three years ago for my X8, and is a vastly superior product in almost every respect. It came pre-loaded with Android 4.3, by the way.When I received this phone, it had an issue with the Google Play store. I could connect (via wi-fi) and select apps to download, but it could not download them (I got an error message). Rebooting the phone did not solve the problem. I quickly \"googled\" this issue, and found the solution on a user forum. I had to connect the phone to my PC, install the Sony PC Companion software, and use the \"repair my phone\" function. It took about 15 minutes to download and install the phone software, after which everything has been working perfectly. Not a huge deal for an experienced user, but it could be a deal breaker for the less experienced.I really enjoy the new OS and how fast and responsive this phone is. It looks very nice and is very well built, although the plastic and glass used are really thin, and therefore I think it must be handled with care. In terms of size, it has basically the same length and thickness as an iPhone 5, is about 1 mm wider, and weighs the same (actually, 0.6 grams more!).As other owners wrote, the available internal memory is limited (2.05 GB), but it is adequate for my needs. I can always add/delete apps whenever needed.I added a 32GB micro SD card to store media and data files. Beware that without rooting the phone (which I do not intend to do) apps can only be installed in the phone's internal memory.Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and I recommend this product, although with the reserve I explained about the Google Play store issue.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mixed feelings!", "Author": "Brandon A. Mikel \"absurdist\"", "ReviewID": "R1MJLNI94RSHBY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone does its job decently enough, but the fact that I bought a 32 GB memory card for it and I can't use it to save apps really puts it down a few pegs. I can use it for music (not for the Walkman app that comes pre-loaded) and for other apps that keep data aside from their executables. Other than that it's a fine cheap phone that works for me just fine over in New Zealand. I've had it for about two months now and it's holding up in all other capacities.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Oswaldo Cova", "ReviewID": "R3N1PY47KIGLB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this phone! just the better relation between price and quality! it works perfectly in Venezuela! i recommend it!", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "very nice and handy phone", "Author": "Ken M.", "ReviewID": "R164TFDQISNL3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so cool and good to use, the price is just enough for this phone, totally satisfied.sony it is.. :)", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product, Great Seller.", "Author": "Katherine Bresee", "ReviewID": "R1XF1TCWUGF69M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seller shipped incredibly fast!

I've traveled all over Asia with it and it never skips a beat. Not a huge fan of the purple, but I leave it with my daughter when I come back to the States and she loves purple. The touchscreen works well, especially for a guy like me with big fingers. Some phones I fond cumbersome to use, but this one was great.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "very good value", "Author": "K. Ryan", "ReviewID": "R1X1WPQ72BSBC9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not only lots cheaper than an Iphone or unlocked Galaxy s5, but cheaper than an Ipod Touch!I'm not a heavy cell phone user, but I found that while traveling I wanted more functionality than my old flip phone offered, so I bought the Xperia M as a \"starter\" smart phone.My needs were really more for a highly-portable tablet computer than for a cellphone, and I think that the Xperia M will serve well in that role.  I do have simple voice/text service on it--I migrated a prepaid T-Mobile account to it, which required only moving the account from the old, standard-size SIM to a micro card (the local T-Mobile store did it for free)--and I look forward to using it in Europe with a prepaid SIM to be acquired when I get there--a key feature of this phone for me was its multi-band capability.  I was looking for a device that could be a more sophisticated MP3 player than the one I have, that could take decent pictures, be a GPS, and provide wifi connectivity on the go--basically, an Ipod touch with better value and that I could use for occasional phone calls--and this phone does all that.  FM radio is a nice bonus, and seems to work fine.  I don't watch movies or TV on little devices like this so I won't comment on that functionality.Hardware Notes:responsivebuild quality gooduses standard micro USB cablesharp readable screen, bright enough to view outdoorscontrols good, especially camerareally compact and lightmedia storage works fine with a not-super-fast SD card (one I had lying around)(app installation on the old SD card wasn't tested)battery life not really tested thus farSoftware Notes:Android version is stable so far--no hangs to datenot too badly cluttered up with pre-installed apps, but some stuff I don't want isn't deletablepretty simple interface and options navigationgood utilities, including power management optionsneeds a good way to back up to a Mac--that function in Mac bridge doesn't work (along with several other functions--be prepared to improvise to get Mac data onto the phone, unless you already use the Google cloud for all your personal information)The Sony mac bridge software (I can't comment on the Windows version) is not very good--get Android File Transfer.  Music, pictures, and videos are easy to move to/from the phone even using the Sony utilities (although the Mac bridge is slow), but it's a little tricky to move e-books to the phone. It's probably easier for ITunes users, but I am not an ITunes fan.  Since my e-books are all loaded into the Calibre e-book manager on my Mac, I finally ended up using Calibre's ability to act as a server (hint:  turn off your Mac firewall), which worked, but is a little complicated.  There's also a (not free) client utility available that is supposed to interface with the Calibre library that might be simpler than the Calibre server option.  Again, if you read Google or ITunes books you won't have as many hoops to jump through.  I was surprised to find that reading a book on such a small screen is not terrible.I have used the Office Suite only for reading pdfs so far, but it's nice to know that it's there just in case I need to read a Word doc or something.I'm still shopping for GPS software that will do a decent job without a data connection, so I can navigate without a cell phone data connection without depending on saved maps.  I've done some simple tests for walking navigation using MyTracks and found that GPS-only performance was good, so I'm hopeful that more complex navigation is also possible.Since these phones are more popular in Asia than the US, model-specific accessories (e.g. cases) aren't as common as for more popular models, but the good news is that Asian accessories are cheap, if a little bit slow to acquire:  I ordered some cases through Amazon that were scheduled to take 4-6 weeks to arrive, but I actually received them much more quickly.Probably not the phone for serious cell phone connoisseurs, but a capable bargain for less phone-centric buyers.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it.", "Author": "Nguyen Q Vinh", "ReviewID": "R1TB2E7P7INDG6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Form, fit, function, & look - everything is good.

We needed a cheap option and it seemed like a good choice for the price.
