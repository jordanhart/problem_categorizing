The front scratched very easily and when I went to use the camera the picture was really bad.  Discovered the lens was shattered, the phone had never been dropped. Because the 30 day warranty had been expired a few days they refused to repair or replace the phone.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone.  I have a Motorola flip phone for about 4 years, dropped it many times and it still works perfectly, camera and all.  I plan on going back to the Motorola and returning this to AT&T.;", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Its a shame", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3K0LNQRY611TT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the phone to my friend , phone is excelent but... if you want to change the language to spanish is imposible it s a shame.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003ARSPE8"}}
