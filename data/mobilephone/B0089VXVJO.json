{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Be Careful!", "Author": "S. Wood", "ReviewID": "R2G1V42YBQMLX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!  First, the phone is great. I ordered the version with 32GB of internal memory (reduced to 25.5GB after subtracting all the standard features that run by default).  I also purchased a SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A external card (giving me an extra 59.45GB despite the statement in the User Manual that only cards up to 32GB could be used). One reviewer said he had to format his card but mine just worked automatically. The Quick Guide was in Romanian but you can get the full User Manual in English by doing a Google search for \"GT-I9300 User Manual.\"  The included external charger has international electrical prongs but my seller included a US converter so that I could plug it in here.  The original converter did not work and they sent me another one.  The phone can also be charged by connecting it to the computer using the supplied USB cable.  When charging, phones can draw at a maximum of 500mA (milliamps) from a standard USB port but can draw at 1000mA (one amp) from the standard Samsung charger.  I also got a second charger Samsung OEM 1.0A Original Home Wall AC Travel Charger Adapter + USB 2.0 Data Sync Connect Transfer Charge Cable because in addition to charging my phone faster while I am at home, this also supplied another USB to Micro USB cable (albeit a very short one) that can be used to connect the phone to my home computer for other reasons, so I can keep one cable at home and one at work.  There were a number of complaints from people who thought they had received knockoffs of this charger instead of the actual OEM so I went through the sellers and picked one that had \"Fulfillment By Amazon,\" in the (perhaps vain) hope that this would provide some sort of quality assurance, even though it doubled the price (still 1/3 of the price listed on Samsung's website).  Samsung also sells a charger that is only 700mA so make sure you don't order that one.  I also purchased this case Acase Samsung Galaxy S3 Case - Superleggera PRO Dual Layer Protection (Black/Black) (Fits AT&T;, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon) which fits like a glove, keeps all the external controls accessible, and appears quite adequate to protect the phone if dropped.  Finally, I went with this screen protector [Ultimate Clear Plus] Samsung Galaxy S3 Rearth Ringbo Screen Protector for [Sprint At&t; T-Mobile Verizon US Cellular Unlocked i9300 3G GSM] Cover Film [2 PACK], which also seems to work well.  I've seen some complaints that the plastic sheets are smaller than the screen but (a) this is because the screen is beveled at the edges, (b) it only leaves about 1/8 inch on each side, and (c) much of that is covered by the case anyway. (By the way, the International version of the Galaxy S3 can only be used on GSM networks, such as AT&T;, Cingular, and T-Mobile, and not on CDMA networks, such as Verizon, Sprint, Alltel, and US Cellular.  Also, the International version has a more advanced processor: a quad-core vs. the dual-core for the US versions, but that doesn't seem to have an impact on the speed of most things you'll do on the phone (see the speed comparison tests on YouTube).  This might change when more apps are written to take advantage of the quad-core, the primary benefit being in the area of multitasking.  The quad-core does not currently support the 4G used in the United States, but there has been word that sometime in 2012 Samsung will release an unlocked International LTE version that does. If you need 4G and you don't want to wait you might take a look at this one Samsung Galaxy SIII S3 SGH-I747 Blue AT&T; 4G LTE Unlocked Cell Phone No Contract No Warranty - AT&T; Logos [Carrier Retail Packaging], which also has only 16GB of internal memory.  The US version also has 2GB of RAM vs 1GB for the International version, apparently because the additional RAM is necessary for 4G, but the International version has a Wolfson DAC (digital-to-analog converter) for superior audio, while the DAC in the US versions is not as celebrated.) OK, enough of that.The problem was that the first time I ordered this phone I received instead the one with 16GB of internal memory, and the seller (New Generation Products, AKA Cell GSM) threw a 16GB external card into the box.  Now, I had paid $90 more for this than the 16GB version was going for on Amazon and the 16GB external card that they included is available on Amazon for $10.69.  Anybody want that deal?I contacted the seller and they said that they were very sorry about my misunderstanding and that perhaps I should have asked them whether the 32GB was with or without an external card.  I pointed out that the description they had running that very day said \"This Brand New Samsung Galaxy S III 32GB Internal memory phone comes in Original box with all Original accessories in the box.\"  They replied \"32GB Internal memory does not necessarly means 32GB Memory on the motherboard, since 16GB card also means internal, external would be if you connect USB to it and have memory on USB.\"But, they said I could return it as long as the phone was unused and in \"Brand New Condition.\"  Fortunately as soon as I spotted the 16GB external card I went no further and the phone was still in brand new condition.  I wonder how many people purchased from this seller and did not discover the issue until well after the phone was no longer in brand new condition.I then sent inquiries to some other sellers, asking if the 32GB was on the \"main circuit board.\"  The person at FGS Trading said that he would have \"somebody from the electronic dept advise\" but never got back to me.  I ended up ordering from Addicted To Phones and received the correct phone in a reasonable amount of time.Fortunately, New Generation Products issued a credit card refund immediately upon receiving the phone back and I am wiser, if $10 (the cost of returning the phone) poorer.  If you are ordering the 32GB version I recommend sending an email to the seller before purchasing, explicitly asking if the 32GB is on the main circuit board (and also, if the charger will have international electrical prongs, whether a US converter will be included).  Where Amazon.com is while this type of thing is going on I don't know.POSTSCRIPT:After posting the above I received a contrite phone call from New Generation Products (Cell GSM), grieved that they had neglected to reimburse me for the cost of returning the phone and wishing to do so in order to optimize my consumer experience.  They sent me a check to cover my return shipping cost in full, and requested somewhat urgently that I delete my review because it was hurting their sales.  It then occurred to me where Amazon is while this type of thing is going on.  In addition to whatever private action they take, by allowing reviews like this to bring such activity to light they enable the marketplace to supply an appropriate remedy, from which other sellers can then draw a lesson.  Furthermore, I would have been protected by the Amazon \"A-to-Z Guarantee\" since I contacted the seller about returning the phone within a week of receiving it.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOT 32GB INTERNAL MEMORY", "Author": "Ignacio", "ReviewID": "R2YJYBXD321CDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is really ok.I recived it on time as informed, and its included external charger for international electrical.The problem is that I ordered the version with 32GB of internal memory like the title of the product said \"Samsung Galaxy S III S3 GT-i9300 32GB Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone - International Version, No warranty (Pebble Blue)\" but instead I recieved the one with 16GB of internal memory with an extra 16GB microsd external memory.The worst part of all is that I had the precaution and wrote an email to New Generation Products before buying the phone to be sure that it was 32GB internal memory, and they gave me false information.

The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier);SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you wont never come back, impossible.OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower.BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM;GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success;CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference.S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull.USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :)APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users.

It deserves 10 stars. It worth every penny (unlike the expensive iPhone5 made by crApple)Screen: This phone has overpassed EVERY expectatives. It has a beautiful screen... once you see the vivid colors on the SuperAmoled HD Screen you dont want anything else: retina display looks ugly beside SGS3 screen colors.Camera: It has good frontal and back cameras without the redish color of the cheappy iPhone5 camera.Software: I think that quality is more relevant than quantity. It's true that Applestore has a lot of apps, but the really usefull apps are also available in android, so I think that an open alternative like android is a far better option. Also is noticeable that SGS3 has the well known Google maps, so you wont be an iLost in a twisted \"Inception-like\" crApple maps app. Google users won't be insulted by the company's CEO asking them to use another app instead the preinstalled app.Batery life: The SGS3 battery last a whole day even with intensive online use and processor demanding apps (ie games).Processor: This version has a quad-core processor that runs every app I've tested very smoothly. This quad-core processor has overpassed the iPhone 5 in the most demanding benchmarksMemory: If you have a phone with 32GB internal memory probably you won't ever need an external memory card, however you can always put a 64GB micrSD card (the user manual indicates that only cards up to 32GB could be used, but my 64GB card has been working great). Additionally I don't know exactly why, but when I registered my S3 at my free dropbox account, I received aditional 48 GB of cloud storage.Sharing: An open platform (ie android) allows you to share your files in many ways: across a standard micro usb cable or by bluetooth file transfering and even by S-Beam: an amazingly fast file-sharing mode which allows to share big files extraordinarily fast without cables (over WiFi direct).Compatibility: in the improbable case you get run out of battery charge you can always ask a friend for a standard microUSB charger and simply plug it on any usb port to charge your smartphone. That simple, not worrying about incompatible cables or plugs.Before samsung there wasn't really any outstanding smartphone: SGS3 doesn't fade the screen if you're staring at it because SGS3 \"watch\" your eyes and if you are staring at your phone, it's screen will stay on. That is a smart feature :) Another smart feature: if you have a contact on your screen and you rise the phone near your ear, your smartphone will dial the contact: THAT is a smart feature.If you were an iPhone user... you will LOVE the SGS3 even more if you try it.

Excellent phone, but you already know that or you would not be here wanting to purchase one.Now I want to concentrate on my purchasing experience. After reading a couple of horror stories where buyers  received a 16GB phone plus 16GB microsd card instead of 32GB internal memory ... and the seller trying to convince one of the buyers that a microsd card is considered internal (LOL), I was very skeptical to make my purchase. I read all the reviews, and one reviewer in the comments section said he received the proper phone from Transformersandgsmphones. I implore you to not only read the reviews but also the \"comments\" link at the bottom of reviews where reviewers respond to questions.I took another reviewer's advice and sent a message to all the Amazon re-sellers asking about the phone and memory. There were several re-sellers and Transformersandgsmphones were the last on my list since they have shipping charges, while the others do not, and I wasn't too keen on that. They were, however, the first to respond (within 15 minutes). Only one other re-seller responded which came the following day. What impressed me about Transformersandgsmphones apart from their quick response was the content of that response, and I quote verbatim \"Confirmed 32GB internal and not 16GB phone plus 16GB microsd\". What more proof do I want than that? They went on to say that they include a US adapter for the wall charger, and to top that they left a number so I could contact them if I had any more questions about the phone. This was more than enough reassurance for me to pay their $4.99 shipping and have a peace of mind.Next came the shipping. I made the purchase via Amazon in the night and the following morning the phone was shipped, then the following day the phone arrived, considerably earlier than the estimated delivery date.The phone is everything it was hyped up to be, and my purchasing experience was simply awesome. So take my advice - if you are looking to purchase this phone, invariably you should pay the extra $4.99 shipping charge, and get the peace of mind I got by purchasing it from Transformersandgsmphones via Amazon.
