{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent so far", "Author": "clearday", "ReviewID": "R18C0FZMMQ29E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This seems to be an excellent product.  It's dual core, so it does seem faster than our Samsung Galaxy, yet it can do everything the Samsung can do, plus.  It also comes with 2 batteries, so you have a backup battery you can pop in.  You can charge the device in your car outlet as well as home outlet.  The screen is easily scratched (no gorilla glass here), so I purchased a plastic cover for it, even though it comes with a protective case.  You can purchase a microchip for extra memory, though I haven't had to do that yet.  It is a dual sim, which is awesome when you need phone service, or even 3G.  We will get 3G service when we travel in Europe so we can be connected to the internet virtually anywhere we go. =)  I have dropped the Samsung while out hiking so many times and it's incredibly tough, I can vouch for that. Once it landed directly on a rock and wasn't the least bit phased.  I take great pains not to drop this one as it might not hold up to that test.  I would say they need a catchy name like Samsung.Many weeks post purchase this product has continued to be a great value.  I love that you can add memory and that there's a back up battery.Now it has been months post purchase I'm even more impressed with this device. While it isn't configured for Skype, Magic Jack works wonderfully on it and therefore phone calls can be made local or long distance wherever there's adequate internet service for free.  There is a second battery though I've never had to use it as the one fully charged battery, even with constant use lasts all day.It still can't play Netflix, but I have stored many downloadable movies on it.  Also, with each new update it is coming closer and closer to playing Netflix as well.Sorry I can't answer all questions related to this product.  I do think for the average non-techie user (like me) it's an amazing value.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the money!", "Author": "Ugunda Sanders", "ReviewID": "R1HV23TPMRR2QV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm going to give a detailed review of this phone, but for those who may be reading this but don't want to read a long drawn out review, I  have had this phone for two weeks, and so far its been GREAT. Let me say first, I would have given a 5 star rating, but as I stated, its only been 2 weeks, so there's plenty of time for things to go wrong. Moving on, I was pleased to find that this phone has a screen protector installed already. I purchased a package of screen protectors but now I don't need them. As stated in the product description, the phone comes with a spare battery, (2) battery covers (one with a leather flip cover), (1) wall charger with detachable usb cable and headphones. The wall unit is for European electrical outlets, so I can't use it, but the usb cable plugs in to any USA wall unit that you already have. The earphones are cheap, but actually sound pretty good. The CPU is dual core and super-fast. The resolution is better than I expected. The rear camera is pretty good. Its listed as 8MP but I would say its more like 5MP. The front camera will do for skype and things like that as long as the area is well lit. Hardly any internal storage, but I popped in the 32MB MicroSD card from my old phone and it works fine. Works well on T-Mobile. I have to use 2G Edge Data speed when wifi isn't available but that's not the phone's fault. T-Mobile 3G 2100MHZ coverage hasn't reached my area yet. Overall, its hardtop beat this much phone for the price (I paid $149.48 shipping included)! I took the phone out of the box, charged it, popped in my SIM and SD and its been smooth sailing. I have almost 150 apps installed and so far, ITS ALL GOOD! Hope this helps someone as the other reviews were quite helpful to me!", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVER", "Author": "Lyndsey Y Spooner", "ReviewID": "R1DM5K458OM4LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people leaving anything less than a perfect 5* review for this phone, I've noticed don't know what they're talking about. I bought this N9770 black Star (generic Note 2) and I absolutely LOVE IT. Of all the phones I've ever owned (I work at ATT so I've owned quite I few including iphones, HTC models from past 3 years and the real note 1 & 2). The back and menu button light up a light ultraviolet purple that looks amazing, it has incredible battery life that outlasts a day and makes it so you don't have to charge until bed time. It runs on android 4.0 and for those of you that don't know much about that, or what it means I can tell you this is my favorite version because its the smoothest without any force closing. Whereas Android 2.3 is slow and sluggish and 4.1 up does nothing but force close and CONSTANTLY freeze. I hate 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 and if you look it up under Google you'll see all the known issues with those versions and how 4.0 is by far the most successful which is what this phone has. Apps that try to run in the background get closed without you having to go in yourself to close them. So you don't have to worry about ads constantly popping up, data being wasted etc. You can block callers you don't want to annoy you you can download any and all Google apps because this phone is so advanced it has no restrictions like htc has on a lot of its models, and LG as well. You can set up fingerprint or face lock as well, which is an AWESOME feature to lock your phone so only you can access it. It's unlocked, so you can use it with Straight Talk, Net 10, ATT etc. And it's way easy to set up. When I ordered this phone I actually got instructions included on how to set it up. Only gel cases for the note 2 fit, or hard and flip cases designed specifically for the Star N9770 which can be found on eBay and Amazon only basically. Totally worth it though! I've had nothing but compliments on this phone and a girlfriend of mine who has the note 2 made by Samsung actually straight up told me my phones smoother! Seeing as how it was also a fraction of the price, well, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PHONE. Best purchase you will ever make, guaranteed, or I'll by yours from you!", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "this seller fastest shipping i ever experienced, AWESOME!", "Author": "ajosephine", "ReviewID": "R3W4L1B8GVP1W1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I order it on 4/16 @my door 4/20. Doesnt get better than that!Been watching & reading reviews on this phone since 9/2012. My first one I ordered in March 2013, NOT FROM THIS SELLER.  Sadly I had to return it but then I found this seller. I love this phone which is why I re ordered. Former galaxy nut and this phone works very close to a galaxy product.Videos, great, front camera sliding pics I LOVE IT. The back camera I havent used as of yet. Pre loaded apps all work well. THIS PHONE HAS A SETTING MANY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT.RECORD YOUR CALLS, no app to download and risk slowing down phone or damage. Its in the phone settings. Not many ppl record there calls but i needed to for a specific reason. Had app on my previous galaxy phone and it caused many problems.I cant say enough good about this phone. Purchase a protective cover and cases I have the slip in case and book like case. If you drop it, it probably will damage it. So avoid the heartbreak with a case. Awesome phone AWESOME SELLER. It works with GO PHONE W/AT&T.; If you cant get ur phone to 3g and mms wont send or recieve. Dont call at&t; cus no tutorial for this phone and they cant help you. Just go into your settings. under data usage click more, access point names, click on Cingular 410,THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO CHANGE IS (MMS PORT) it should be set to 80, then save. Reboot and send mms. if still doesnt work do exactly same thing. When you click on Cingular 410, scroll to bottom look for APN enable/disable.

But when I turned it on it was different but it depends on which slot you put your sim card in. The only thing I wish this from had a task manager app like my other phone so I could just hit end on whatever is running but on this phone you have to go to settings hit apps hit running and stop what's running that's to much work.

My Note has 1 Gb but I can install 20 times more applications than on this model.  I understand that the bloatware that is already installed on the phone reduces the amount of available memory for downloaded apps but still when installing memory seems to go down faster than it should.GPS: is shaky at best, works sometimes, doesn't at others, in general I would say acceptable.For the price, great phone but if like me you like to install lots of stuff (I have 230 apps installed on my Note), stay away from this one.  If on the other hand you're happy with 20-30 apps, than great phone.Used it in Canada, China and France with local SIMs from these countries, picked up all the configuration automatically without a glitch.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "works very well", "Author": "Natalie", "ReviewID": "R3D5ES1XTXP1KV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The item arrived before the listed date, and came in excellent condition. i am still in the testing and evaluation stage, and will update this information as time goes by.here are some of my findings. I was pleasantly surprised to open the box and discover an additional case with screen cover. this gave the phone some screen protection while not adding any significant weight. the phone is exactly what was described on the website. in addition to the power button, the home button located at the lower front of the screen  also wakes up the screen, depending on the user, this can get squeezed while in a purse or pocket and will wake up the phone or even remained in a depressed position, depending on where the phone is lodged, if one is using WiFi or any internet access, the battery will barely make it through the day, however with telephone calls and running a few apps, one may get a little more 36 hours before recharging. when running apps such as games, the area just under the camera becomes very hot, this is not the battery but I believe that the CPU is located in that area. I have not yet measured the temperature differential between normal use and apps (games) usage, but it is significant enough to be felt with bare hands.In conclusion, the unit works well.

I was able to connect my laptop to the hotspot on this phone without having to root it. I tried rooting it and it all went dead immediately. The whole reason why i needed to achieve root is because of the need to delete bloatware...unnecessary apps. I live in the 78520, i bought this phone to give it a try with a gsm carrier. I went to a local store and inserted Net10, T-mobile, H2O, Simple Mobile, and Telcel America sim cards. All of these gave my phone great signal but only picked up \"E\" as internet(2G aka EDGE). I decided to give Simple Mobile a try for a month and i edited the apns to simple data. No problem with picture messaging but the internet speeds are rather slow.

It randomly changes ring tones - seemingly whenever it 'feels' like it because I can't for the life of me figure out what I might have done between hanging up from one phone call and the next incoming call when all I did was hit the disconnect button. It did this to me on day one - I should have sent it back then - now I'm stuck with a loony brick. Every time I rebooted it I'd get yet one more different ring tone - and maybe one or two changes down the road a few days later. This thing is psychotic. Its taken lately to telling me there is no sim card in slot 2 - yeah - I already knew that bozo! My contacts list has disappeared from view. So now when someone on my contacts list calls me I get their number but the phone does not give me the contact name. When I try a transfer from the sim card to 'contacts' it tells me there are duplicates and it cannot process my request.

I really wanted the new galaxy but I hate contracts and did not want to fork out a lot of money just for phone.  The phone came with two batteries.  I have only had it 3 days and have used it heavily without having to charge it.  I will probably need to charge about every 4 days.  I hope the batteries last.Update 2 months later after use.  Still very happy with the phone.  Battery last longer when after using it you click power button to turn off screen.  Phone gets hot if you are playing games on it.  I was playing a game then got a phone call the heat was pretty annoying.Not sure if I have my contacts setup correctly but when I try to text someone it gives me invalid recipient.
