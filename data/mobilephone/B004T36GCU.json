However, I upgrade my phones often as I am a techie and have to have the latest phone/tablet, etc. Here is my detailed review, and I hope that it will help you make a good decision if you need a great smartphone at this great price!Pros:- Very clear and easy to read 4.3\" screen.- Outstanding colors with clear and vivid screen.- 2.2 Android allowed me to save many installed apps on my SD External card. (Cannot do this anymore after OS 3.0 and higher).- Great camera - I took many high quality pictures and many were better than my regular camera.- Music Player (stock) is very good. Sound could be louder, however, a good set of headphones fixed this and the sound is good with the headset.- Got 4g on the Internet Data.- WiFi came in clear and fast.- Overall a easy to use and good sized 4.3\" phone and it is a little heavy, yet still comfortable to hold with big enough screen.- Built in FM Radio. This is one of my favorite features!- Good memory and this phone was fast and peppy for me.- Excellent Internal storage space. **Also many apps that I installed I was able to move onto my External SD card because the OS in this phone is 2.2. After OS 3.0 and above, apps cannot be moved onto the SD card, so this is a plus for this phone.Cons:- Do not like that the back has two separate compartments for battery and Sim card, memory card, a hassle to open this up, but I got used to it.- HEAVY PHONE for it's size!- Phone kind of thick (at least by today's standards).In spite of the cons, I still give it a 4.6 as it is a good phone even for today!Also, I am a techie and know a lot about Android devices that is smartphones and tablets, so if you have any questions, please ask me in the comment section.Hope that this review has been helpful to you and thank you for reading it.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall excellent phone", "Author": "Boiler98", "ReviewID": "R32855APTXXNON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I am very pleased with this phone. I purchased an HTC phone because I had the HTC Incredible and loved it and I wanted to stay with the same user interface. The only reason I purchased a new phone is that I am leaving Verizon and going to Straight Talk and they require a GSM phone.There have been some reviews indicating that this phone does not work with prepaid carriers but my experience setting this up with Straight Talk has been flawless. You just need to make sure that you purchase an ATT SIM card from Straight Talk's website (Straight Talk uses ATT's towers for this and most other phones). And overall I am also very pleased with Straight Talk both on price and coverage.I have also read some reviews, both on Amazon and other websites, that indicate the HTC Inspire has poor reception. At first I thought the same thing. But then I realized that the antenna for this phone is actually part of the SIM card cover. I don't know why they did this but if you are having reception issues make sure that the SIM card cover (bottom of phone) is securely and tightly fitted onto the phone. In addition you may need to clean the 2 copper electrodes on the cover and the phone to ensure that you have a good connection.The only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 star is that the manufacturer's box that this phone came in was not in new condition. It had been opened and not handled with care. I assume they have to open the box to \"unlock\" it from ATT but the box looks to be a year old and dropped a few times. In addition the 8GB SD card was not included as advertised. Not a huge deal for me since they only cost $6 and I had already planned to buy a 16 GB but I wanted to mention this.Overall I am very pleased with my HTC Inspire. Amazon had excellent and fast delivery as always (fulfilled by Amazon). I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for an unlocked GSM phone for use with Straight Talk or other potential prepaid (better value) services.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Juan Jose Chamorro", "ReviewID": "R3HRCG0R8WGSE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THe Phones Works Excelent, great speed, the cam get really great quality...

I have not used it except under Cyanogen so other users may have a different experience.  One note on the seller, it's really slow to ship.  The site said it's in stock but it took over a week to ship it, even though I ordered next day delivery.WARNING TO T-MOBILE USERS: YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS PHONE.  It does not have the hardware to support T-Mobile's 3G / 4G service.  That means you're stuck with EDGE (2G) which is slower than dialup modems.  You will not like it!

A nice and bright flash that doesn't make photos too saturated. The speakers are great, I can play music, set it to really loud and hear it from the other side of my house. I wouldn't recommend it though, and would suggest a pair of headphones to go along with it.Cons - The battery life is nothin compared to other phones I have had. I get 24 hours out of it at the cost of 75% of the battery. (When in doubt, charge it!) The phone stock from AT&T;, still uses Froyo as its firmware, which is about a year old and unheard of for a phone like this that is above average, especially given the fact it is one of the nicest phones from AT&T; that runs Android.Protip, if you ever need to remove the battery, do it from behind the volume rocker.

I am very happy with this phone for reasons others have mentioned.There are only a few downsides:1. battery door design is poor;  difficult for most folks to  open.2. battery is probably undersized for the stock ROM and for high speed data.  I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.  I lose about 1%/hour battery when the phone is allowed to sleep.  But if you are running the stock ROM, gaming, or facebooking all day you'll want to keep a charger with you.3. I'd prefer the volume and power buttons stuck up a bit higher with a more positive feel.Be aware that just because a phone is unlocked and usable on any GSM network it doesn't necessarily mean you will get high-speed data on all services.

This is an AT&T; Branded phone (AT&T; logo on casing and AT&T; Splash screen at boot), but it is unlocked.  I popped my international SIM into the device and it worked like a charm.  I would have appreciated mention of the AT&T; \"branding\" in the product description.I am not sure this device is \"new\", as described.  It came in a generic AT&T; box and there were some very minor blemishes on the casing.  This was not a big deal and after I put my protective case on, I can't even see them...  not that they were that bad to begin with.  I do, however, think this device is refurbished rather than new.Otherwise, the device is awesome.  It's fast, has a great display and does everything I need it to.  This is my first \"droid\" and after coming from an iPhone 3GS, I am not disappointed and don't miss the iPhone in the slightest.  I've read reviews about the battery life on this device, and they are correct.  The battery life is not great, but honestly no worse than my iPhone.  Unlike my iPhone, the battery is replaceable and I purchased a second for back-up.  Having removable and expandable SD storage is great.In the box was the phone, battery, quick-start guide, a USB cable and USB power adapter.  No headphones, but the headphones from my old iPhone (and current Blackberry) work in this device just fine.Overall, happy with my purchase and would recommend.  5 stars for the function and speed of device, price and Amazon service, but only 4 stars for the entire experience (AT&T; branding / likely refurb).", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "htc Inspire 4G", "Author": "Harry S", "ReviewID": "R1HJFRKGX1IINJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the htc Inspire 4G phone early March 2012.

Jensen", "ReviewID": "R1OV3UEWWE9F1I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my HTC Inspire for almost two years now, and for the most part, I like it very much.  The layout is user-friendly--it's easy to get from the main menu to apps to the phone features, and it allows you to pick your favorite apps for the main menu.  I can listen to Pandora or FM radio while doing other things.  The touchscreen is about as good as you can expect for a phone; there's only so much room you have to hit each key, and there are arrow keys that allow you to weave through emails or text messages.  The online features allow for four windows to be opened at once, and it's easy to navigate and use the finger-pinch movement to zoom in or out of a page.  When opening a video, the video automatically fills the page--no zooming in required.  The clock is big and bold; it shows the weather...most things that are typical of a good smartphone.A few downsides that I hope are fixed on newer models--the battery cover is a PAIN to remove.  I've actually hurt myself trying to get this thing off, and had to watch a YouTube tutorial to figure it out (take a fingernail or sharp object and carefully shimmy it into the corner NEXT TO the indention--be careful or you can hurt yourself!).  The battery is so-so--you have to charge it every night but sometimes the battery will last great all day and then others, it's down to yellow before dinner, and there are no more programs running on it than any other day.  The SIM card has to be in the case just-so and has a tendency to slip out of position from time-to-time.  Not a big problem--just something to be aware of.  And sometimes when typing online, the keyboard will pop up and the online screem will move in such a position that I can't see what I'm typing (this is especially bad with email).

I don't use the htc sense anymore but the launcher and I never had this problem anymore. The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...- An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory. This is something that really bother me because I have the phone for more or less 1 or 2 month and the phone memory is already half full and my SD card is almost empty and there is nothing I can do about that! Also, the fact that you have to move each application manually from the phone memory to the SD card each time you download an application is annoying too... it should be automatic!!!If you can deal with this issues then the phone is fine.

I am a contractor and my big problem with the HTC Inspire was that I ran it out of power in about 8 or 9 hours - and my day normally last 10 to 12 hours. Great phone, but no battery life. The Inspire (that I bought 2 weeks ago) has been was great, but the battery wasn't quite keeping up with my battery requirements. My first thought was about purchasing and then job-swapping out the batteries, but the difficult-opening side cover made it become 'Plan Z'. So I had to find - and did find a solution. See recommendations.RECOMMENDATION: I got the PowerSkin Protective Case with Built-in Battery for HTC Desire HD/Inspire 4G - Black from thru AMAZON and put it directly on my HTC Inspire. In addition there aren't many batteries on the after-market that looked to significantly extend the phone's power out to a full day. This powerskin has already made itself worth the price, because it is currently noon and I have ran it out of power, but it took 17 hours. Realistically I will have to charge it daily, but I was already doing that with my work radio and garmin GPS (oh yeah - there is an android app for that for 99 cents) so it's not as big an inconvenience since I do that by force of habit. If this works out and if I can find the decent radio app for the phone that talks well to my work's relay tower then I may be able to only carry just one electronic 'tool'.6-16-2012 Update.

Because of this the tethering and a couple other apps are locked down unless you have a at&t; account to unlock the features with. I'm sure there is a way around this but have not found it yet. It was already unlocked out of the box. I was easily able to upgrade it to 2.3(gingerbread)from 2.2 using the HTC sync software. The ui take some getting used to if your used to a vanilla android ui and can be frustrating at times. I removed most of the widgets from the home screen except for the clock and turned off background sync off on most of the apps. After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good. The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well. It had good audio quality when playing or streaming music. The phone is pretty snappy even when running apps that are in the background. Unlike other reviewers I haven't had trouble removing the doors for access to the sim card or the battery. These doors are used for the wifi and cell service antennas so they need to be on when in use. It has good picture quality for a phone it is sensitive to movement when taking the pictures. It has a dual flash which also works great for the built in flashlight app. It has a fm radio tuner built in but it uses the ear buds as a antenna so you can't listen to the radio with bluetooth headphones. There are quite a few features that are part of the sense ui, there is also some issues for those that are not used to it. The features are too many too list but can be found on the HTC website. The 3G works on the at&t; network just fine. One of the drawbacks with this phone is that the battery slides into a slot so you cannot use those extended batteries that come with a different backpiece like you can with other phones. It also makes the battery slightly a pain to get out as you have to slap the phone against your hand to get the battery to slide out.

Although it's bigger than the average, it's stylish, really beautiful, and the huge screen is awesome. Apart from that, its graphical user interface, HTC Sense, is the best have seen in many smartphones, including Motorolas, Iphones and Blackberrys.Apart from all this, as the sound quality is extremely important to me, this topic deserves a special mention. Although the quality of its speaker is not really impressive, the quality of the sound is the best of the best when listening with earphones and turning on the Dolby Mobile option. It's simply fantastic. Ah, did you know that only 4 smartphones include the Dolby technology, and one of them is the HTC Inspire?About the internet, the navigation speed is also remarkable. It's much faster than the Blackberry Torch, and as it comes with Flash, you won't notice any difference with looking at web pages in a laptop / desktop PC.If you are hesitating between this phone and the Blackberry Torch, let me tell you my own experience: just the day I got my HTC Inspire, my sister received a brand new Blackberry Torch, and I have been comparing them both ever since. The only thing that is better in the Torch is the quality of the screen (it seems that the pixel density is higher in the Torch), but in the rest the HTC Inspire beat it up.Thus I highly recommend this phone, definitely you will never regret.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best phone by far!!", "Author": "Just a gyrl", "ReviewID": "R2HOIY4G51HAAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 5 months, and it is by far the best phone I have ever had. I have owned a very many phones over a period of 17 years. Not only did I fall in love with android, but I fell in love with HTC. I was a little leary about getting a phone I knew nothing about, but I trusted my at&t; sales rep and bought it. I have had almost no problems with it. I have way to many pictures and text messages on it and it causes it to freeze up sometimes but not much(which can be expected with so much space taken up). I usually just restart it and it is fine. Every so often I go through and delete things to give it a little bit of a break lol. I have never loved a phone as much as I love this one. I have dropped it on my ceramic tile in my kitchen and bathroom and it didn't even have so much as a scratch on it. I also dropped it on my concrete steps in my garage and again nothing happened to it. I have to say if you are going to get a smart phone (or any phone for that matter) this is the one to get. It has an 8MP camera which is awesome and the color is so vibrant I can hardly stand looking or using anyone else's phone. I have to say this phone has me spoiled. When it comes time to upgrade I will get another HTC phone. Also if you lose your phone you can download an app called android lost from your computer to your phone. It will send you the last messages sent and received, phone calls, take a picture from your phone, send crazy loud \"help me I'm lost\" messages (the phone can be on silent and it still plays it loud), you can set the phone to lock up and notify you if a different sim card is inserted, and many more great things to find your phone. On top of all those things it gives you a gps location within 7 meters of where your phone is. Trust me it works. My phone was stolen and I used this app and it had an arrow directly on the house where the phone was.

Also, after that reset, I never was able to load Google Play again, leaving me with the old android market app. I have three acquaintences with the same phone; two of which are just as unsatisfied (so 75% of the people I know, including myself, are totally regretting having made the purchase).

In general, I really like it.  The contact import (via Bluetooth) went really well and it was easy to use straight out of the box.  It is a lot faster than the 3GS that I replaced.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is some of the adjustments I wanted to make took time.  For example, the software added Facebook-based birthdays to the calendar and I didn't want that.  And I didn't want a notification for every email.  In all of these cases, a Google search eventually taught how to modify the system but it took time.  I find Apple's approach to settings to be more intuitive.As for the battery, it took time for me to learn that turning off auto-sync gives you LOTS of extra battery life.  But rather than a having a general fetch email option, one hits the gmail application, the menu and the refresh option (with auto-sync disabled) to fetch email on your command.  Again, somewhat less intuitive than what I was used too.I cannot verify if the phone was fully unlocked because I transferred an AT&T; SIM card.  I can tell you that I got a couple of messages from AT&T; asking that if I now have a 4G phone, I should contact them regarding a 4G plan.

Finally someone responded via email. They tried to get me a new phone but then said they didn't have one,so I returned it and still waiting for my refund. :(", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC Inspire", "Author": "Jessie", "ReviewID": "R19P3AYBW6XEPH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone. 5 stars there. It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone. With that said, there are a few minor things that I have no doubt HTC will be able to upgrade in the future.-Sometimes, when I attempt to type a new url in the browser, instead of the \"enter\" triangle-shaped button, it gives me the refresh button and i literally cannot go to the new website. But this isn't every time.-Occasionally, some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen). The ones I normally see are stars and the only way to delete them is to rid of the app itself.-For some reason, although I have all of my contacts from facebook on my phone, many of their profile pictures wont show up beside their name or pop up when they call. This isn't really a big deal to me but for some people it could be, I suppose.-And of course....the battery life is pretty terrible. I've gone an entire day without touching it and come back at the end of the day and its in the yellow. I have the auto updates turned off and kill programs and it remains to drain, but for what this phone is capable of, I really am impressed. We are in the primal stages of this insane technology, folks.-Sometimes having multiple programs running can in fact cause the phone to freeze and the only solution is to remove the battery. Easier said then done if you have a hard plastic case like I did, until I had to remove it so many times to get to the battery.- My internet occasionally just stops working, no matter if I'm at my rural house or in the city where I work. I have at&t; by the way. There is a slight chance it's the provider....not sure.-The camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself. But on occasion the pictures will simply turn out blurry for 7-10 shots before they return to normal clarity. I have yet to figure out this reason.-Removing the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone. So if this happens to you, don't panic.-Finally, there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand. But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers. By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring. I wish I knew which apps caused it. =(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the \"smart\" world. The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too. And there are many handy things this device is capable of despite the kinks, and I look forward to what HTC and Android will have for us in the future.", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "T-mobile MMS Beware", "Author": "Xuvi", "ReviewID": "ROBXK7VHDIU8Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "not a bad phone.expect hassle from T-mobile mms and internet package.

I had an itouch but never had a real smart phone before. I do not like contract phones so I purchased this unlocked refurbished condition. Its been 3 months now and no problems as of yet.As far as looks are concerned, I dont think it has anything spectacular in that. For most of the HTCs, their big screen is the only attractive thing about it. Touch interface is very impressive although it freezes for a couple of seconds once in a month. Android app store is superb. Had android 2.3(gingerbread on it) so thats a big plus. You can definitely feel the difference if you have used 2.1 previously.No complaints about battery life. I can generally carry on a full day without going below 20% battery. But ofcourse this depends on your battery usage. I have a moderate usage.It froze once completely. That it is to say it wasnt working at all. But it came back to normal after safe reboot (power + up volume) Then I realized it had happened because of incompatible apps. Some of the apps are not meant for android 2.3 and if you try to force them on this one, it may end up freezing your phone.Camera is great. Its 8MP autofocus (its not just on paper, it does it really well and quickly) My friends say iphone gets better pictures with 5MP but I dont think so. Its definitely at par with iphone for photo quality if not better than it. You will miss the front camera a lot though if you are avid user of video chatting clients.In short, as far as system stability and interface, it still needs improvement to compete with iphone. But its very cost effective as compared to iphone($230 unlocked as compared to $600 for iphone) I liked the big screen that doesnt compromise on its battery life. I like the customization capability of android over the iOS.

It would not let me use letters 'a', 'w', 'e', or the numbers '1' and '2'.I contacted amazon because I wanted them to send me a new phone. Of course I would have returned the one that I had. They didn't give me the option to exchange. Only to keep it or return it for my money back. The UPS guy came by each time that I wasn't home which made it hard to return it. Now I'm stuck with this phone that I don't very much like because it does not work properly.If the phone worked at its best ability, it would be an okay phone. It doesn't have a front facing camera which is difficult and the damn thing shuts off when it wants to. I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from Amazon.

The 8mp camera is amazing BUT I wasn't aware I would need an SD card just to take a picture so I have to go and buy one now because I used to save pictures to my phone. That's alright though. Didn't take too long to set up, it's already synced up to my emails and social networking accounts. The friend stream feature is very cool because it shows facebook and twitter (and whatever else you have) all in one feed. The weather feature is neat because it has this cool hd movement to go with whatever the weather is like (the little things always impress me). The android market changes to google play if you add your google+ account but it is still basically the android market with a different look. One thing I was disappointed in was the app \"Vine\" is not compatible with this phone and I really wanted that app but oh well, it still has a lot of the popular android apps. The screen is big and is pretty much HD (I don't know if HD was in the specs) it's got a great sleek look to it.

Calling for support, I was told to remove the battery and that it would need repair. When I received the phone back in the mail, there were no details about the repair and no instructions. Now, the phone had to be reactivated, but that process failed even though I tried numerous times. Unbeknownst to me, the motherboard was replaced in the phone and the device now had a new MEID/serial number, which was not in the . Six months later, the company still has not gotten around to putting that new number in their network database so that I can activate it.I wasted $300 on HTC for a phone that has no possibility of ever working again because of a technicality in their limited warranty repair service. HTC handed off this disaster to me with the claim that they took care of their responsibility to the buyer under warranty -- though, obviously their policy of repair with new MEID is responsible.This is not a one-time thing or a rant from me, one unsatisfied customer. Numerous of their CSRs have told me this is a very common problem they get phone calls about every day. They refuse to send me a phone which can be activated right away.Thus, I will never, ever buy another HTC phone (for instance, I had to buy yet another phone to be able to have service again and though an HTC phone was at a lower sales price, I chose to get a Samsung instead of throwing my money away with HTC).

But I will likely look for another phone because of an issue with bad reception.My house is in an area where cell signals are not very strong.  I found that I could get a signal of about 3 bars on the Inspire if I put the phone near a window.  The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.  After some experimentation, I found that I could hold the phone near the top of the case and the signal would be usable.  The minute I cupped my hand around the back of the phone, as you would when talking on the phone, the signal would drop significantly.  The user's guide describes the GSM antenna as being in the bottom cover that covers the sim slot.  If you can learn to hold this phone only near the top of the case, it will work.  Personally, I'm not satisfied with a phone that is that picky about where I hold it.For the more adventurous who consider rooting their phone and trying to upgrade the Android OS, this is not a phone to choose.

They charged me $48.99 for a restocking fee on an item that came to me abused and used (but sold new):Item: HTC A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3G Support, 8 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, and GPS--(Black)  Quantity: 1  ASIN: B004T36GCU  Reason for refund: Customer return  Here's the breakdown of your refund for this item:  Item Refund: $244.95  Shipping Refund: $3.99  Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($48.99)First of all, do not be fooled by the Customer uploaded images showing a brand spanking new Inspire 4G in an AT&T; box.  Both of the phones which were shipped to me were shipped in tattered boxes and you could tell they had been sitting in filthy conditions. They both were in AT&T; boxes, but they each had problems. The fancy looking paperwork that is one of the images is non-existent.  You get the HTC Inspire, Lithium Ion Battery, AC Charger, Micro-USB sync cable and a Quickstart Guide.  No 8GB MicroSD card even though the boxes list them as part of the contents.  NEW?  Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card. I uploaded my own customer photos to go along with this review.  Please click on the Customer Uploaded photos to view my pictures.The first seller I will review is iCellPhones.  This order was fulfilled by Amazon, which is the only way I would ever purchase an item that reaches the $200 mark.  The phone was shipped and came in on time.  When I received the box, I immediately noticed that it didn't look shiny like the photos that were uploaded by sayed mohammed.  The box was dull, and was taped haphazardly.  On the outside of the box was a listing of the package contents.  As I opened the box, I noticed everything there except the 8GB MicroSD card. Every item was sealed in the package and I began to get everything in order so that my son could receive a fully charged and operation phone on Christmas Day.  I noticed immediately that the micro USB sync cable was a generic one, and although it worked, I was a bit perturbed that I paid a \"NEW\" phone price and received generic and missing contents. (See customer uploaded photos for proof) Unfortunately, the phone never worked properly.  I couldn't get a signal anywhere in my house, 9 times out of 10 I would dial a number and it would immediately hang up. I began browsing forums and found that some Inspires had terrible reception and the only way to fix it was to solder wires, or dial *#*#4636#*#* and change from WCDMA preferred to GSM only or blah blah. I also noticed that the SIM cover doubled as an antenna and the 'gold' contacts for the antenna actually looked as though they had peeled completely off.  (I uploaded photos for proof of this as well) Instead of trying to void the phone, and by the time I fully tested it, it was too late and I had to order another phone on Amazon on December 24th for next day delivery.  Unfortunately, I couldn't just exchange the phone because Amazon fulfilled the order, but it was sold through iCellPhones...there was no option, so I had to fork out another $229 for another phone before receiving the refund on this phone.The second seller I will review is BytesofDeals.  Again, Amazon came through flawlessly.  I've never had an issue with their fulfillment and although this phone was sold by BytesofDeals, it was fulfilled by Amazon...PEACE OF MIND!. The phone would arrive on December 26th.  The box for this phone was in much better shape.  I thought I had a winner, but my hopes were soon dashed when I opened the box and found again...no 8GB MicroSD card and this time...the battery was in worse than used shape, it was completely abused.  (See customer images for proof)  Luckily I still had the battery from the previous seller and had not sent the other phone back and I was able to take comparative photos for this review. Unfortunately for my son, this phone had the same issues as the last one.  Super Low to non-existent reception.  I am comparing this phone's reception to a Samsung Galaxy SIII, an iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and a Motorola Bravo (his old phone).  All of these phones are owned by us on the same AT&T; phone plan.  They can all make calls that this HTC Inspire 4G fails on every time. Just google Inspire 4G reception problems and you will see what I am talking about.  I ended up taking this second phone to AT&T; and having them set me up again with a new SIM card.  It was of no help.  Same issues.  I gave up and am returning both phones as I type this.As a side note, I can't prove it, but it appears to me that these phones are refurbished.  When comparing the two phones side by side, I noticed that one of the phones has a void sticker over one screw underneath the side cover. Both of the other exposed screws are silver. On the other phone, there are no \"void\" stickers on any of the screws and the sticker that has the IMEI number appears to have been removed at one time.  There is one black screw and 2 silver screws.  These appear to be amateur refurb jobs.I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone.  Even with Amazon fulfilling the orders, you'll still be out money.  I am so thankful that Amazon will refund the money but I have to drive to UPS, ship these back with the pre-printed shipping labels and then wait for them to receive them.  They say after 2 days they will refund the money.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone decided to shut off each time it went into hibernate", "Author": "Meghan R Reckart", "ReviewID": "R3J3EIT1Q00NI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We have had this phone for almost two months and the phone has decided to power off each time it goes into hibernate.

It wasn't, far from it.  It's badly refurbished, probably by a hobbyist.I also have an Inspire that I bought new from AT&T; almost two years ago with none of the following problems, so I also have an originally purchased unit to compare to.  The orderinstant(USA) unit has a broken SD card memory slot that doesn't eject cards, you have to dig it out with a fingernail or screwdriver.  The area of the SD card slot was already scratched up from the previous owner digging the card out, obviously from the same problem.  The back camera is not mounted centered behind the lens glass, partly obstructed by the lens frame of the back cover.  There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.  The centers of the torx case screws are stripped out so you can never take the phone apart again.  The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.  The wall charger isn't the correct one - the wall wart is correct but the cable is different and charges much slower than my original - both wart and cable are branded HTC but the cable is somehow different (it is longer than my original).  The top mounted power on/off button requires a large amount of force to push it in to get the phone to see the button press.There was a 12 volt car charger adapter in the box, which was not ever included in a new shrink-wrapped box.  Somehow this fell into the box, but was not listed in the seller's listing.Luckily the rest of the hardware works normally, the battery is fine, and the screen is perfect.  If this was listed as a refurb with associated price the problems would have been acceptable.  Being listed as new with that associated price makes this...  deceitful.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "T.

I have had this phone for two years now. I have been very happy with it as well. About a year ago, mine broke while working (I'm a firefighter/paramedic, and I forgot to take it out of my pocket prior to going on a call), and I did not have a second thought about buying the same one again. The phone comes with the standard smartphone options, such as wifi, gps, 4g & 4g support as well.The phone has a great stock ROM that is one of the best for Android based phones. The ROM is well put together with the appropriate options for the common user. Most Android apps work for this ROM as well, although the stock ROM was unable to run Google Chrome.The battery life is about standard for a smart phone, and does seem to require to be charged twice a day for the amount I use my phone. I should note I use my phone as my morning newspaper and read the news for about an hour every morning, and I also use it for my job, looking up medical information and extrication manuals for rare cars (hybrids, ect). So it gets pretty heavy use, and two charges a day when I am in my vehicle or at my desk seems to work out well. If you play games, it will drain the battery very quickly, though.The phone comes with an 8 megapixel camera, wish is good for casual photography. I wouldn't recommend it for any serious photography, but it works good for taking pictures of my family, pets, ect. I also use it to document certain things in my job, such as car accident photos, or during fire investigation.The GPS does leave something to be desired, as I often cannot get a signal. I am unsure if this is due to the phone itself, or the function of the satellites and where I live.The HTC Inspire is a good media phone. It can play CPU hungry games, although it does quickly drain the battery and the phone does get hot while playing anything more graphically intense then Angry Birds. The phone comes with an 8gb sd card for storage of photos, games, music, ect. This can be replaced with a larger sd card, up to 32gb, which is great if you use your phone as an MP3 player as I do.The Inspire is not without faults, but it is a great phone, and can be easily modified through rooting as well. I would recommend the phone for anyone from casual user up to those that love their gadgets.

Volume down was sticky and didn't always register properly. Dealt with it for two weeks and definitely couldn't live with it for another 1.2 years.-Called AT&T; - got a replacement.Inspire #3: Major antenna issues. Misses about 50% of the calls it is supposed to recieve. The AT&T; tower is about 1 mile from my house - on a mountain, and I'm directly line-of-sight to it. Sometimes the phone will show zero bars. Sometimes full bars. Sometimes it just misses a call. Yes, the back cover is on - and it was the same one from the previous two, which never missed a call.Thinking this issue was software-related, I flashed to Cyanogenmod and installed a new radio. And despite completely replacing the phone's original ROM, the problem persisted. Still missed about 50% of the calls. I wound up using a SIP provider with free incoming calls, routed missed calls to Google Voice, which then rang the SIP client on my phone. Needless to say, about 4 out of 10 calls I recieve wind up coming through the VoIP line - which means it missed the original call. The funny thing? VoIP rings over 3G, which means the phone just has an issue with calls - not data.So, after dealing with three HTC Inspire phones, they are truly terrible, poorly-manufactured devices. I will never buy an HTC product again. I've given them three chances, and they've failed on every single one.Never again, HTC.

Ellis", "ReviewID": "RDMCDUQO46GVY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was excited to try an Android phone when I got this, but I've had too many problems with it to give a good review. The first thing I noticed is that the battery life is terrible. This phone doesn't last through the day without charging, and it gets worse the longer you own it. I've had it for a little over a year now, and I can't use it even for something simple--like reading on the Kindle app--without it going dead after about 30 minutes' use. This is after shutting down Wi-Fi, changing the connection settings to preserve battery life, and keeping the screen dimmer than I prefer. Forget connecting to Wi-Fi, as you'll get about 5 minutes with that. A friend who was having the same problem with her Inspire suggested I download a task killer to save on battery, which I did. Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of. This is all just frustrating. The reception is also garbage. My husband and I are both on AT&T;, and his iPhone works in many places this phone doesn't. Thus, it's not the network; it's the phone. Also, ever since they sent a software update (just a short while after I bought this lemon) I've had trouble with texting. Whenever I try to hit the back button to correct a typing mistake, it kicks me out of my text and pulls up a screen for deleting text strings, forcing me to quit the text function altogether, exit and reopen the program to finish my message. Makes texting a drag. Lastly, this phone freezes up regularly. I mean freezing as in the thing gets stuck trying to complete a task, and I can't even shut it down with the power button. I have to pull off the side cover to reset it. Overall, this is a terrible phone.

It was not charging up and I called up HTC and they asked me to send my device for repair. Now when I talked to the customer service they asked me the date of purchase and said that although the date of manufacturing is already passed out of warranty (it was May 2011), you will still have the warranty because you purchased the device on July 2011 from ATnT store. This is the way it should be. The warranty should start from the date of purchase rather than the actual manufacturing date when HTC sold the device to ATnT.First they requested to submit the proof of purchase. I faxed them (they don't have a facility where I can just scan and email them which is a very big pain because you don't know if at all they received the fax until somebody confirms it). After 2 days customer care person said that they received the proof of purcahse (my ATnT bill with date). They also confirmed that my phone is in the warranty and I can send in my phone.I sent my phone and after 3 days of the delivery confirmation, I got an update that my device is out of warranty. When I called them, they said that they have all the proof but they have to submit it to repair department and repair department will give me a call In 5 to 10 days (now see this, before sending the phone they said that complete process will take just 2 weeks right from sending the device to receiving it after repair).So even after discussing with 2 different customer care executives, now again I am waiting for the repair department call and again I have to repeat myself to convince them that device is in warranty. What a pathetic service? First of all their phone died in just 14 months and now they are not even readily accepting it to repair in warranty? It is showing that I have to pay whopping 180 bucks to get my phone repaired. This is absolutely frustrating.I used to love HTC phones, I even liked HTC One X but now I will never go with HTC again. Problems can happen with any phone but at least they should acknowledge that and accept the liability readily rather than making their customers go running around and explaining that their phone is in warranty.UPDATE:- After arguing with the customer care executive for 15-20 minutes and asking him to talk to his supervisor, finally I got my phone repaired without any charge.

Well apparently this phone was made solely for the Americans because it does not support the 2100 WCDMA frequency in Germany/Europe.  This alone makes this phone obsolete.

The point of this phone is a 4G UPGRADE to the HTC Desire HD A9191 Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, Touchscreen--International Version with No Warranty (Black).Cons:This phone is a Single core Qualcomm Snapdragon S2 running at 1.00 GHz (For those of you that don't know; GHz is a limited view on how fast a processor is in the same family...for example the Snapdragon 800 2.3 GHz is faster than the Snapdragon 600 1.9 GHz)which is quite disappointing in terms of game play due to its outdated Adreno 205 graphics. It has 768 MB of RAM, the more RAM; The more stuff you can do at one time [Multiple Tabs on the Internet, Playing a game while talking, having 30 apps open, etc.]. BEWARE: THIS PHONE HAS NO OFFICIAL SUPPORT ANYMORE; that's right- after 2.3.5, no more Android Versions. One last thing- this phone has a 1280 x 720 pixel display, and on a 4.3 inch display it's not that sharp.What we know:Slow phone without any supportPros:This phone is actually quite cheap these days, and serves as a beginner phone. Even though this phone has an S2, it's on par with a lower-end dual core, and most games run well. The camera is decent, but the flash is a true champion, with two LEDs that are visible from at least half a mile away. Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A budget phone with 4G capability for those who need a 4G experience and don't expect this phone to handle everything you throw at it.My Experiences (Chronological Order):Asphalt 6 starting to lag severelyHome Screen Freezing and lagging116 Seconds to boot upNice photosGood flashlightNoise-Canceling works little-bitFast Wi-Fi recieverVery fast 4GI hope this helps your decision  -Jayanth Annadurai____Note:_____(Unlocking the Bootloader[Go to HTCdev.com and follow the instructions with other devices] significantly increases performance about 20%, however game stability, such as Where's my Water 2, is severely reduced)", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "problems with this product", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R1J4ASBV2EE785", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about a year ago.

I was told I could not deactivate it because it was hard wired into the phone. A factory reset did not fix this problem. When I complained to tech support they offerred to replace the phone. Since the problem was with factory installed software I did not see how this was a fix. Their software was functioning as malware and they could not fix it. I got no where. I am getting the same poorly operating phone as a replacement. Do not buy this phone.
