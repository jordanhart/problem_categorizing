{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Maybe should have ordered one at a time...", "Author": "Curious World", "ReviewID": "R3J1YDXRDPJVP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We ordered 2 of these phones, phone described as \"like new\".  Perhaps my idea of \"like new\" differs from someone else's view.  One of the phones had dents and scratches (as if it had never been in a phone case).  I contacted the seller with the intention to send the phone back.  They were helpful and responded quickly.  We were going to send the phone back, but decided at the last minute to keep it (still was a good deal for what we paid for the 2 phones). I think the seller should be clear that only one of the phones is \"like new\" whenever you order more than one.  Also, neither phone was unlocked as stated in the description.  My husband had to unlock the phones (pain in the rear).  The \"like new\" phone had an updated operating system, while the scratched and dented phone had an older operating system.  Just make sure you understand what you're getting when you order, and maybe do 2 seperate orders when ordering more than one phone.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "very very very disappointing buy", "Author": "Shawn Rolle", "ReviewID": "R2305GZ2N6JZJ5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worse of the worse buy ever. The phone I got was nothing as described. It was sooooooo banged up that I could hardly reconize it at first. It did not come unlocked,network was blocked as though the provider thinks that it is stoten or something. I just cann't believe that something like this is being sold.
