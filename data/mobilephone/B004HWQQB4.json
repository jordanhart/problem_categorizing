A Phone first, a GPS nav system second, and the capability to use  the web and apps a distant third. Battery was disappointing, would only hold a charge for 2 days (I do not use the phone phone that much), so I installed a new battery ($8) and it is now useable for 5 days between charges. Was disappointed with Big City Communications (store I bought the phone from) in that they listed the phone as \"Brand New\", but it was not... phone was immaculate..... but had 238 contacts in its memory, the micro SD card was missing, display box was crushed and had scotch tape holding it together, battery had visible wear indicators on it. Big City insisted it was brand new, too much effort to return and search for a new one, so I kept it, have  been very happy with the Garminfone.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent price for excellent product", "Author": "Nacho", "ReviewID": "R2LWYHN9OAD6XL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's one of the best cellphones i've ever seen.
