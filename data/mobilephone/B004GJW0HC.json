Not a 3rd party seller.I received an unopened box, unlocked, unbranded body logo, t-mobile load screen version. Initial language was German.I am currently using this phone in the US -- At&t.; Cellular data and MMS did not work out of the box. You will need to download Samsung's 'Network Profile' app from the Marketplace --> Samsung Zone.At&t; uses 850 and 1900 MHz for 3G data. Samsung Omnia 7 has 900, 1900 and 2100 3G. Despite the lack of 850 MHz, I am able to receive 3G data (3g/3g+ --Will not show H--) in certain areas.  I am able to toggle between 2g (edge) and 3g (HSDPA).Also, remember to update your OS version through Zune. Out of the box, it did not have the latest available NoDo update (7.0.7392.0). I went from OS version 7.0.7004.0  to 7.0.7008.0 to 7.0.7392.0. To check your version: Settings --> about --> more infoBy the way, battery life is unbelievable. 12+ hours easily! This is with 3g, Google mail push, 1+ hour web browsing, casual texting and moderate use of music player.11/01: If you have an unbranded, t-mobile load screen version, you may now update to Mango via Zune.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone but not Perfect", "Author": "nguyen tran", "ReviewID": "R3JN4T63WVHUEA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First impression, Windows 7 is pretty similar to Iphone but it gives users a little more freedom. Everything must be done through Zune software which is kind of a nuisance. Once a facebook account is set up, everything is synced to the phone contact. The phone GPS will not work without internet! There's no equalizer and the sound quality is not impressive (worse than my Nokia N85) The screen is simply amazing (trust me, it's really amazing). Personally, I think the screen is about the right size, not too small nor too big. The device has no problem playing back 720p video clips. Market place is not as good as Apple but I think it's okay. Who wants thousands of applications on his phone? There's no memory expansion lot so make sure you can live with 8gb memory (6.99 gb available) Wifi connection is very easy to set up (basically, there's no set up necessary, just type in the passwords, and that's it). The phone quickly connects to a network when wifi is on (less than 10 seconds). The device only need around 20-30 seconds to power up which is impressive. The battery lasts around 4 days with slight use (a few brief phone calls, a few text message, half an hour surfing web with wifi, playing back a few 720p videos ...) One last thing, the 5mp camera takes great pictures and if you're not a professional photographer, you would be pleased with the photos quality.Overall, if you want something different from Iphone or Android, the windows 7 is a pretty okay alternative.

With its thin profile and large 4in screen make this a first choice. I have had the HTC HD7 and Dell Venue Pro Windows phones for a few months and this is by far the best and a little faster than the other devices.As for the mobile service, I've noticed that for T-mobile users, this version will not support 3G, you will have to find the T-mobile European version if you want 3G or 3G+ as for AT&T; users, everything works fine but depends on the area you live in to get a 3G option on the device. Maybe there are some hacks that I need to discover to unlock that option of T-mobile.The camera is on of the best with a ton of options and features to choose from and speakers are great and loud without any distortion or crackling.

The good side of being Orange Branded is the pretty Orange-theme, much better than any other theme available.I'm using the BoxWave Samsung Omnia 7 GT-i8700 DuoSuit (Jet Black) and it's a perfect match, so you can keep your valuable phone safe and without scraths.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "love the phone!", "Author": "kmh963", "ReviewID": "R1VO8R9HR4PLMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone replaced a samsung galaxy s, which took an unsheduled swim.

I came from using the Nokia e71, which was a great solid phone. This is my first touchscreen phone so I am extra careful with it to not drop or bump it. The metal backing is nice and feels solid, but it is also so smooth that it is slippery. I like the OS but there are some things that I am used to from the Nokia phone that I wish was found in the Windows OS. The volume when making calls can be louder and wished it was, otherwise the phone's ring and alerts are loud. Wish there was a outside notification light. And wish there was a GPS function, just using bing maps is not a good substitute. And I find that the connectivity of the antenna is not as strong as the one from my Nokia e71. The phone has no external branding but the boot screen is tmobile. when i am on internet explorer and press the search button it brings me to a google page in german, i wish it was in english.

After browsing the net I was a bit concerned about additional storage. There were a lot of complains about SD cards on WP7.

Instructions I followed are from this site [...]All the accessories for the phone are good and live up to their expectation.The only downside of this phone is battery.

It exudes quality and is definitely a step up from the Samsung Focus. However, I did not have the greatest luck getting this going.First off, the phone is branded Orange (from the UK) and you get all the Orange apps and splash screen. (I thought I was buying an unbranded phone). Once I downloaded the network setting app from the marketplace I was able to set it for ATT at which point I got all the ATT apps as well as the Orange apps. Hmm. This was getting kind of crowded.Signal strength was fine and I was able to get 3G. The phone was running an old software release and I was able to update it a couple of times (but not to the latest version).I used the Windows Phone Connector for the Mac and it would not reliably connect. In fact, I got it to connect only twice in about 20 attempts. Other Windows 7 phones have had no such problem, so I have no idea why I couldn't get it to connect reliably.Given that you can get a Samsung Focus for $350 w/o contract from AT&T;, I don't think it is that great a deal anymore, particularly given the set up issues I experienced and the fact that it only runs on one of AT&T;'s 3G bands.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GSM Quad Band (850/900/1,800/1,900MHz), 3G 900/1,900/2,100MHz (HSUPA 5.6Mbps, HSDPA 7.2Mbps )\n122.4 x 64.2 x 10.99mm, Display: 16M WVGA SUPER AMOLED, 4.0\"\nCamera Resolution: 5 Megapixel with 4x Digital zoom, LED Flash, and Auto Focus.
