I only had the phone 4 months when the main screen when.  They would happily honored the warrantee but I all pictures would be lost.  There doesn't seem to be a way to save or retrieve the pictures.  I can't believe there isn't a way to get them back out w/o the main screen working. But that is what I have been told by both Motorola and Sprint.  I haven't given the phone up because the pictures I had were from a trip I waited 24 years to take. AND I'm holding out hope as I climb the chain of command.  It still works as a phone accept I can't add any new numbers or people to it.  Now it's been 6 more months and the hinge is broken too.  I'm going to go back to my old phone (i530) which still works after 5 years.  I only up graded because I decided it was time.  Boy, was I wrong.

I left feedback stating that the earpiece didn't work and within an hour someone from the company had called me. They explained they were sorry and offered to ship me out another phone at no charge. All I had to do was return the defective phone in the enclosed postage paid package. Within two days I had received the replacement phone and it looks new and works perfectly! I highly recommend buying from this seller since they are very concerned with service after the sale. Thanks again for the great customer service!Purchased from:  Extreme Discounts L.
