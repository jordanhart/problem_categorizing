{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what was needed.", "Author": "MaryGold511", "ReviewID": "R2VR8KOKYS6OOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My elderly mother had recently had a mild stroke. I began to look at alert necklaces in case she were to fall. We also expected a full recovery which meant she would be driving again. The medical alerts had a limited range and involved a monthly subscription. A number of posts on forums recommended the Just5 phone instead.After reviewing the phone's features and discussing it with my mother, we decided to order the phone. Since she already uses T-Mobile, it was simple to transfer the sim card to the new phone after it arrived. Transferring the sim card took care of her phone book and setting up the rest of the settings was fairly simple.She really likes the phone! She's able to hear it well. It is hearing aid compatible and she wears hearing aids. She likes the locking feature so she can slip the phone into her purse or pocket without fear of buttons being pushed. The icons are large enough to be easily seen and meaningful enough to be easily understood. She likes the large buttons, the ease of use, and that she can push a \"person\" button and it will speed dial my cell.  We left the SOS button on the default setting of 911 so she knows that if she has a real emergency she only has to push that button.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice for the elderly", "Author": "R.

The emergency feature is not all that it can be.", "Author": "H. Wasti", "ReviewID": "RPCXXTXWX8EEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent product that fills a very important and unmet market need -- cell phones for the elderly. The buttons are large and easy to use by arthritic fingers and failing eyes. The phone calling out key-presses is a nice touch and useful for those with vision problems. The volume is loud enough for use by people who are hard of hearing.The emergency call button is the best feature of this phone, though what it does it is not documented in detail anywhere. I will try to rectify that here.You have to set up the emergency feature by entering up to 5 phone numbers. The emergency mode is activated by pressing and holding the emergency button for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, the phone starts making a loud wailing sound indicating that it has started the emergency sequence. The sound is loud enough to attract attention if you are in a public or semi-public place or even if you are at home and unable to yell for help. The sound also alerts the user that the button pressed has been recognized and the phone is working on getting someone on the phone.The phone first sends a SMS message to all 5 phone numbers stating \"I'm having an emergency, please answer!\" It then dials the 5 numbers in the order of priority until someone picks up. This is where the plan runs into problems. What happens if no one picks up and the call goes to voice mail? In my testing, some times the phone detected that the call had gone to voice mail and moved on to calling the next number. Most times the phone interpreted the voice mail as someone having picked up at the other end . At this point, the phone stopped wailing and connected the call.That means, all you can count on the emergency button to do is sound an alarm that may attract attention, send out 5 SMS messages and make one phone call. It MAY call other numbers, but you can not COUNT on it.The phone does have one other problem: Non-existent documentation. The entire documentation is quite literally one sheet of paper with large text and pictures that tells you to hit the up/down button to enter settings or phonebook. This is what you get with the phone and this is all that is available for download from the manufacturer's website. You are on your own after that. It is not hard to figure out the settings for someone who is tech savvy, but impossible to handle for a typical elderly person who barely feel comfortable retrieving their voice mail. If you are not tech savvy yourself, or can not call upon a tech savvy person to set it up for you, you will not be able to customize the phone (volume, ringer tone, phone book etc) or use the emergency feature.The FM radio and LED flashlight may be nice for some, but I found them to be a distraction.All in all, it is a great product. I initially deducted one star because of the documentation and because of the limitations of the emergency calling, but am eventually giving it 5 stars because this is a product that truly deserves 5 stars.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "JUST5 J509", "Author": "Owhatagoosiam", "ReviewID": "R3MNZ1HESM5I7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not designed to work with AT&T; Go Phone, but JUST provided an easy solution for transitioning to T-Mobile for their \"Pay as you go\" plan, which is almost the same as AT&T.;Color is unimportant.

I added it to our AT&T; family plan. It has worked out better than I expected for her and for us. She is able to answer calls easily and can hear callers well. We get good reception and the battery life is pretty good.I like the one button speed dial. I just keep the list for her next to the phone and she just pushes one button to call a family member or friend.Two observations: The green and red markings for the answer (or OK) and hangup buttons is not as obvious as shown in the pictures, at least on the white phone that I have. The other observations is the power button is the hangup (red) key. It is a bit confusing for her to have the hangup key also be the power \"on\" key for the phone. Just saying, if the green turned it on and the red turned it off that would make more sense to her.I know the FM radio seems a little strange... but after the tornados hit Alabama in April 2011 and we were (as were most people in north Alabama) out of power for 5 days, I am glad it has that feature.

Hitting more than one button at one time is a thing of the past.  Screen character size is also great for poor vision.Setting up the phone isn't too bad, although the menu button is a little touchy going directly to phone book if you're not dead center on the button.Inputting phone numbers is a little tedious - although being given the choice between saving to the phone or the sim card is nice.. a button for BOTH would be even more handy. I have yet to set up the voicemail because the carrier (red pocket mobile) is awful on customer service and has not responded to my questions via email yet.. and their on line chat has never been available when I wanted to ask a question.  They have yet to provide instructions on voicemail set up and access.The Just 5 people have been outstanding for customer service both before and after the sale.Red Pocket.. not so much.Where we live, no cell company has provided what I would consider a viable connectivity service until we got this phone.  What used to be one or two bars (if that) is now almost always 4 bars.What I'm not wild about is the icons.  The buttons are certainly big enough to use text for ON and OFF, SEND and END.  The menu button, in my opinion could say menu instead of a weird icon, and for the few menu options, just the text would be plenty.. no clunky icons taking up space.Personally, I do not like icons at all.. icons are for people that cannot read.I had considered also getting these phones for my elderly parents, who have thus far not gotten a cell phone of any kind.For them, icons would be totally meaningless and telling them red or green icons for answering or hanging up the phone would have them just retire the phone instantly.Also, one of the features I really wanted on a cell phone was to have it sound like an actual phone.  The customer service folks assured me that one of the 6 provided tones did sound like a phone.  Well, I don't know where they grew up or what their phones sounded like but that item on my wish list for a new phone did not happen.  There's one that's much more high pitched, has the beginnings of what a land line phone used to sound like (the timing mostly) but has variations that are border line annoying.Battery life is good.  I haven't found a use for the flashlight beyond letting the cat chase the beam around the floor but it works well.  The radio works.We have not set up the emergency numbers or tested the big red button.. reports of how loud it is by other reviewers has convinced me that, without a turn off alarm feature, this is not something I just want to test.We wanted a phone.. to just be a phone, with big enough buttons for hubby's monster mitts and large enough font on the screen for me to see.  If it didn't have text capabilities, my feelings would not be hurt in the least.Had the phone had text instead of icons and a ring tone that sounds like a land line phone, this review would have been 5 stars instead of 4.Good show just 5 - I await the CP11 to come to the US to get a second one.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "CAUTION: Replacement Batteries Difficult To Find", "Author": "Instructor Too", "ReviewID": "RQOMD02S0XCHC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATED REVIEW:--- Initially we wrote that we could NOT find a replacement battery for our Just5 cell phone. We are amending this commentary to report that we could find a replacement battery, but availability appears to be restricted to just one source. Please read on:Our Just5 battery failed to hold a charge after a year and a half of owning the phone, and we could not find a replacement battery for the \"Just5 J509\" cell phone despite looking on Amazon and by searching far and wide on the Internet. Without replacement batteries, the \"Just5\" cell phone is a throw-a-way cell phone only suitable for contaminating landfills.The battery of the \"Just5\" cell phone is removable, and as a \"consumable item\", battery replacements should be readily available as they are for cell phone batteries from other companies, but apparently Just5 is using a proprietary battery that is restricted in design and  availability. Even retail sellers of the \"Just5\" phones that we found listed on the \"Just5\" website could not sell us a battery.We were only able to find a replacement battery by going to the \"Just5\" website and then calling the \"customer service\" number listed that connects to what appears to be a \"virtual office\" answering service in Las Vegas, Nevada. The \"customer service\" person could not find replacement batteries listed for sale on their computer, but they took our phone number and said they would forward our request for information to another \"Just5\" department.Later in the day we received a phone call from a number that did not show a caller I.D. on our phone. The person on the phone said they were from \"Just5\" and that they could sell us a replacement battery for our Just5 phone. We gave them a credit card number and after a few days we had the new battery delivered by mail.There are many good reviews for the \"Just5 J509\" cell phone, but a buyer must consider that if the \"Just5\" company goes out of business, there may not replacement batteries available for these phones. From what we've been able to discover, the \"Just5\" owner can only find replacement batteries by going to the Just5 website and calling \"Just5\" customer service.Our \"one star\" rating for the phone reflects our opinion that keeping the phone in operation might be difficult or impossible if replacement battery availability remains as restricted as it is currently.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what it's marketed to be", "Author": "Alfonso Limas", "ReviewID": "R178VX20KPCN2I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my hard-of-hearing mother.
