The one I ordered is a version GT-I8190L and my wifes is a GT-I8190. Hers came in UK english and with an adapter for its charger to fit US outlets, mine came in Spanish and its charger required no adapter, both were easily changed to US english. Besides the L at the end of mine and an american type charger I can tell no difference between the 2 phones. We started on Straight Talk which requires creating a new APN for correct functionality, I found the settings to put in it with a google search. We then both changed to my dads business ATT plan and the default cingular APN that comes on the phones works with this network. The phone does not do 4g but does some kind of H speed which I think is like 3.5 g and it has been fast enough for me to watch my IP cameras. For the money currently I can not think of a better smart phone. Would buy again.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect Fit", "Author": "brianshale", "ReviewID": "R20K9P8T2BS76O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great features in small package. perfect smartphone for small hands. only gripe is that you have to remove the battery to access the SD card.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wrong phone sent", "Author": "Joe Lacy", "ReviewID": "R2XH76HFAC1VX2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was sent a I8190L phone instead of a I8190.
