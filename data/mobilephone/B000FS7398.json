The menus are very responsive and the display is crystal clear and very high definition and more colors. The \"free\" RAZR that came with my plan is still sitting in the box -- doesn't compare.I have added 1GB of memory using SD micro flash.  So can definitely be used as a mp3 player.  But you would need to get a NOKIA -> headphone adapter plug from third party vendor. Or you can use speaker on the phone in a pinch.The camera takes great pictures as long as the lighting conditions are good. The menus have many options for customizing the phone (though some of these options are somewhat hidden from the casual user further down the menu tree).The speaker independent voice recognition seems to pull up the correct name most of the time or give several to choose from in some cases.I really like the flip phone button that opens the phone, so you can open it with one hand. It works very reliably and the spring has the right tension.The keypad is lit and easy to see in darkness.  Due to the high contrast and brightness of the display it seems to consume some battery power. On standby the phone can be on for many days if not used, otherwise you would need to charge every other day if you use features that keeps the display turned on for long periods of time (editing notes/organizer etc.).Some nice features:-Todo lists-Notes-Calendar-Various kinds of reminders (with reminders that can be set before the event)-The next item on your calendar today can be shown on the main screen on the bottom.-MP3 player / w/equalizer-Radio (need to use headphones (which also works as antenna))-Black almost rubber-like finish for easy grip and does not scratch easily.-Simple and userfriendly menus and keypad (the phone I purchased was not branded so did not have any of the preprogrammed \"buy ringtones/wallpaper\" buttons etc.-Great voice quality-Sych phone numbers/appointments via bluetooth/IrDA/cableHighly recomended!~!", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nokia 6131, Overall Great Phone", "Author": "MacUser \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "RY5WN1JEK0DQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, so the nokia 6131 I must say is a phone that I like to call a \"sleeper.\"  It does not look like much, but when You go to use it, it is a different story.  First off, the camera is very cool.  I have had some issues using it in low light situations, the pics become grainy, but over all it is very cool.  The push button flip works just as you would expect it too.  In regards to computer compatibility, I am a heavy Mac User.  According to Apple, this phone was not suppose to be compatible, but that was an easy fiix.  Allowing syncing of all my contact info. and calanders.  In regards to the menus, they very responsive, and very quick. The internal and external display are extreamly high quality, and very crisp.  For bluetooth compatability, I have had no issues.  I previously owned a RAZR and for bluetooth options, this phone blows my old razr out of the water.  You have the option of uploading new themes (which are easy to find or make) you can upload ringtones, pics, what ever.  And the data transfer is much quicker then my RAZR. I would highly recommend this phone to any user.  It is by far the best phone that I have used.Pros:  High res. screens, quickness of menus, BT, Camera, push button flip, speaker is loud.Cons: Unlocked from Europe comes with bulky euro charger (not a big deal.)  And the only thing that I would say is that the battery life is somthing to be desired.  I use BT allot and I end up having to charge my phone every one to two days.", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Ovidiu Predescu", "ReviewID": "R2NKRTCUQX9C9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great everyday use phone. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the newer Nokia phones, like integrated WiFi (with VoIP integration) and GPS, but it does very well what is designed to do. I use this phone with T-Mobile with their unlimited Internet plan (using EDGE).Pros:The build quality and materials chosen are top notch. The plastic cover doesn't look and feel cheap, like many other (some expensive) phones out there. I like the fine leathery touch of the battery cover, which provides a good grip of the phone in the hand.The internal screen is large, with plenty of pixels and colors. Most of the apps look very well. With Google Maps for example it's very easy to read and discern the details.The phone' sound quality is superb. The earpiece is very clear, and the microphone and voice processing hardware inside the phone makes the other side hear you clearly. The loudspeaker is fairly good too, although I'm not using it very often.The Bluetooth software stack is perfectly compatible. My car's Bluetooth implementation is very picky and works only a handful of selected phones. The Nokia 6131 phone is not listed as a compatible phone for BMW M3, but it works just fine with it, while the fancier and more expensive Nokia N80ie phone does not.The included radio is pretty cool when you're bored, although it requires the included proprietary headset to work (it uses it as antena).Google Maps and GMail work excellent on this phone. They don't come with the device, but they're just a download away from Google.The phone's camera does a fairly decent job with well lit shots. It also takes videos, which is pretty cool for a phone. Just don't expect the camera to replace your point and shoot or DSLR.The ability to use MP3s as regular ring tones is a huge bonus. No more buying ridiculously expensive ring tones from your phone company, when you already own the music. Just take the song you want, edit out a 30 second portion of it that is suitable as a ring tone, convert it to MP3 and upload it on your phone. You could assign different ring tones to different people, so you can recognize who's calling you.The phone now has MacOS X compatibility, with the latest 10.4.9 release. It synchronizes your address book over Bluetooth without any problems, including the people's pictures. When somebody calls you, his/her picture appears on the external display. The picture is scaled up however, making it look a bit ugly. I guess Apple needs to allow for higher resolution pictures to be set in AddressBook.Cons:As many other Nokia phones, the phone cannot use a regular headset, it only works with the proprietary Nokia headset. This is understandable, as the headset is stereo, and doubles as an antenna. It would be nice however to have an extra plug for regular headsets.The package does not include a MicroSD card. Not too bad, they are quite cheap, but you should be aware of this if you decide to buy the phone.The camera shutter button is on a side, and it's very easy to press it accidentally while the phone is in your pocket.Setting up T-mobile Internet on the phone could be a pain. You could find instructions online by googling a bit, but it's not the same smooth \"just works\" experience as on the N80ie.--Overall, I think this a great phone for everyday use. It is replacing an aging Motorola phone, and so far it's been a refreshing change.

Roberts", "ReviewID": "R27BM351HA0DUP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've used the Nokia 6131 phone for 2 months, it has a great feature set and I initially thought it'd be a good phone - beware of reviews posted after only a few days of use.Battery life is abysmal.  With bluetooth, etc. enabled, initially I was getting about 1.5 days of useful life.  After 2 months, with bluetooth disabled and all power saving features set the phone won't last 24 hrs between charges.The phone will not work with a dead battery even when plugged into the charger.  You must wait until the battery has sufficient charge before the phone can be used.  And charge time is slow - charging while driving 45 min daily did not get or keep the phone fully charged.  You'll need to plug it in to the charger every night.Unlike other phones this phone does not charge when connected via the USB cable.  And the USB cable is proprietary - you cannot use a standard mini-USB.The Nokia-proprietary stereo headset left earbud stopped working after 2 weeks.  The radio and mp3 player do not support a bluetooth headset (mine is mono - not sure if a stereo bluetooth headset would work).  So for me, no NPR or audiobook MP3s on the bluetooth headset.The lid of the phone presses the \"0\" button when very little pressure is applied.  Take it out of your pocket and you'll have to clear the \"000000000\"'s before dialing.  Oh yeah - those 0's also took your phone out of its power-saving sleep mode and consumed valuable battery life while you were not using it.The flip-button is neat but I handed my phone to a friend to call home, didn't tell him about the button and when he opened it without the button - crack, the cheap-o latch broke.  It should have been designed to work ok for the button-uninitiated.I've had great success with other Nokia phones but this one is a failure.

I thought she was exaggerating but she got so sick of it that she ditched it in favour of my older nokia. Just yesterday I decided I'd try out the 6131 for myself, because I'm partial to new gadgets.I started the day on a fully charged battery. By 1pm, after a total of about 30/40 minutes of phone calls and about 5 or 6 SMS messages sent and received, along with about 10 minutes of playing Sudoku, the battery was showing as down to a quarter of its full life. I need my phone all day, so I promptly switched back to my Sony Ericsson K750i.The *appalling* battery life of this phone renders it almost unusable as a day to day phone. I'm surprised this phone ever got released into production by Nokia. Generally I'm a Nokia fan- I like their user interfaces, although I am a bit less gone on their phone design in general. But this particular model is a failure in my opinion.Other bugbears about the phone:No micro SD card included as standard. Just seems a bit cheap to me.Camera button on the side of the phone is easily activated when the phone is in your pocket, draining the battery even more quickly.Non-intuitive interface at times, e.g. when sending messages you have to scroll down 3 items to access your contacts.

It's true that the device devours the battery - make sure you're prepared to charge it every night, or buy a second battery.  My favorite feature of this phone is that you can set it to vibrate and ring at the same time - probably sucks up more of the battery life, but I'm less likely to miss a call this way.

I've been using Nokia 6230 for a while and the best feature I loved in it was editable Voice Tags so whle driving you just press a button on your Bluetooth device, say a name from your Contact List (previously recorded by yourself), phone recognising your voice and dialing desired party. Very convinient. But this Nokia 6131 comes with prerecorded names tags for every contact you're entering which is not good because it doesn't work in you case. Different voice and prononciation so most of all times you're getting someone else instead by calling it's name into the Bluetooth. I can't understand what was the idea to do this.The other thing(was described in previous reviews) is a battery which doesn't stay longer than 2 days and needs to be recharged.The idea of Nokia 6131 is amazing, beautiful design and etc. I think Nokia has to recall this product for repair those 2 items.", "Date": "November 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, stylish & easy to use!", "Author": "Lucy Pemberton", "ReviewID": "R1GC3HFB3DNM85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.  I love this phone so much that I'm on my third one!  No there was nothing wrong with the previous two other than they went for a swim in the ocean - I work on a boat so it's a hazard of the job!  I have always liked Nokia for their ease of use, and rarely have I had to pick up the manual to find a function on the phone.  I digressed slightly with a 'hand-me-down' Sony Ericsson for a couple of years which simply wouldn't break - although I hated the layout of the menu and functions I didn't want to spend unneccessary money on a new phone.  I eventually managed to wear out the keypad on it and that was a good enough excuse to return to my first love - the Nokia!I will say that the only downside to this phone is the robustness - or lack of - of the exterior finish.  I have had problems with the matt black finish delaminating & often the first thing to get damaged is the mini screen - which gets  scratched very easily.  If you can handle your phone being anything other than pristine - which face it - they all become after a few months then you will be extremely happy with this stylish, compact and generally cool phone.The other bonus about this particular version is the relatively good price for an unlocked phone - which if you are familiar with then you will understand.

This phone does not disappoint.  I sent back my Motorola slvr which I originally ordered and exchanged it for this one, no regrets.First off the 'soft-touch' paint feels great in you hands and the leathery touch on the back helps you to grip the phone batter.  It certainly does feel like better quality materials in your hands.  The flip-to-open button works nice. I've never seen that on a phone before and it's damn handy.The keypad is nice and big and it's so easy to dial and text.  The nice big display screen helps with that too.The menus and interface itself is great.  It's simple and pleasant to use, which is the main reason I switched from the Motorola.  Some of the options are unusually further down the list then most other phone menus but I got around that quick.  Voice reception and signal are great and the ring volume and speaker are plenty loud enough.The camera is a little grainy in low light, but otherwise fine, you can assign your images to you contacts or wallpaper.  This phone is very customizable.The camera button is on the outside and can be accidentally pushed, though to be honest you need to have a lot of stuff tightly packet in your pocket for that to happen.

I already had the Nokia stereo headset needed for the FM radio for my 6102i and it works perfectly on the 6131. I transferred about 150 mbs of music via bluetooth to the phone from my PC. Works great. I can listen over the speaker or listen by bluetooth or headset. Speaking of bluetooth, this phone has  no problem pairing up with bluetooth devices. Speakerphone is great for phone calls as well when not using bluetooth.Edge technology is plenty fast for internet browsing.

I'm very happy with the phone - Nokia is the best cellular device manufacturer in my mind. Sound is great and the flip works awesome. However my experience with Ace was terrible. The phone came with a mal-functioning charger and missing the Micro SD card. My whole interaction with them was a fiasco. If possible find another vendor! Here are my pros and cons for the phone:Pros:1. Great sound and user interface2. High quality materials - looks and feels robust3. Large buttons4. High quality screen5. Blue tooth works greatCons:1. Side camera button keeps being pushed mistakengly - turning the camera on when I don't really want it on.
