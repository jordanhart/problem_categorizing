{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lovely phone that doesn't break the bank", "Author": "Jacqui V.", "ReviewID": "R29WH8QNY87U4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of using my iPhone 4, I decided it was time for an upgrade. And yes, I actually consider the Blue Life One to be an upgrade over my outdated, small-screened iPhone 4! Here's why:UNLOCKED:- This phone doesn't lock you in to a certain carrier. You have the choice of any GSM carrier. In the USA, that means either AT&T; or T-Mobile (or those who use their cell towers, such a Straight Talk, Solavei, etc). Thanks to the switch to unlocked phones, I'm paying ninety a month on a prepaid, no contract plan which offers UNLIMITED voice, text and data. Oh, and that's for TWO phones. Yes. Two phones for $90/mo unlimited everything. Can't beat it.LARGE SCREEN:- The screen is so much larger than my old iPhone! It's large without being ridiculous to hold.- The display is beautiful! The colours are vivid without being overly saturated. My husband even likes the colours on my Blu phone better than his Note II. The iPhone 4 was too dull, Note II is too saturated, but the Life One found the perfect balance that pleases the eye.DESIGN:- This phone is gorgeous. It has a sleek, high-end look to it. Slim, easy to fit in your pocket (although it is a bit long).- Lighter than the Note II but it's nearly identical in size.- Despite being on the lighter side of the scale, it gives you the impression that it's a solid phone that won't break easily (though time will tell on that one).BATTERY:- One of the things I always HATED about my iPhone was the poor battery life, and no ability to swap the battery if it got low. Now, I don't have to worry about that! Just buy a couple of spare batteries plus a wall charger and you'll never have to plug your phone in again. Just pop off the back cover and swap the dead battery for a fresh one. Farewell to my dozen iPhone chargers!CAMERA:- This phone takes some surprisingly gorgeous pictures with it's 13 MP rear-facing camera. It comes with several shooting options, as well as built-in effects and editing tools. Beautiful!- The 5MP front-facing camera makes video calls much more enjoyable! There's a lot more detail now than there was on my old iPhone.FUNCTIONALITY:- The Blue Life One actually has the ability to recognize when I'm speaking on the phone. Meaning, it doesn't BUZZZZ my skull and DIINGG my eardrums every time I get a text while on the phone (like my iPhone always did - Man, was that irritating!).- More customization options than iOS while still remaining user-friendly.- All of my favourite apps are still available through Google Play, so I don't have to miss out on anything following the switch from Apple.DUAL SIM:- If you tend to travel overseas, having that spare SIM card slot comes in handy. Or, maybe you like using two different carriers (AT&T; and T-Mobile) in order to get the best cell phone coverage while you drive across the country. In that case, you need dual SIM capability. Or, maybe you want just one phone to use two separate numbers (i.e. personal number and work number). Just use two different SIM cards and you can use two different numbers on the same phone. Spiffy.STORAGE SPACE:- Comes with 16GB of built-in storage. Not bad for a phone that's under three hundred bucks. But what's even nicer...- You can buy additional storage space, up to 64GB worth. That's 64GB + 16GB = 80GB of storage! This is something the iPhone just can't do. No comparison at all.PRICE:- An unlocked phone with a vivid 5\" screen and 13 MP camera for under $300... and it still plays graphic-intensive games and multi-tasks without lag? I'm proud of this bargain I found!DRAWBACKS:- The screen is actually 720p instead of 1080p. Upon close comparison to my husband's Note II, the screen does lack a bit of the crispness that his has. But on its own, it's not something you'd notice.- The back is quite slippery. If you tend to have a hard time hanging onto your phone, you might want to use the included silicone bumper.- No LTE. For me, HSPA+ speeds are perfect and seem just as fast as my husband's LTE (we're both using AT&T;'s network). HSPA+ is basically 4G. There's an interesting debate about 3G versus 4G and whether 4G actually exists... but I digress.- Minimal choices in accessories. If you're an accessory junkie, you may want to wait until more manufacturers start making accessories for Blu phones. The more people invest in Blu, the more accessories we'll start seeing become available. They're out there now but take quite a bit of hunting to track down.- 1GB RAM. I haven't noticed any performance issues, but maybe someone with a serious gaming habit would. What I do know is, this phone handles GT Racing 2 without a hitch, even with other programs running in the background. If you need more processing power, look at the new Blu Life Pure.- The speaker is pretty weak. It's also located on the back of the device, so if you set it down on its back, the speaker is easily muffled. I find this is a non-issue for me, since I rarely rely on phone speakers anyway.OVERALL IMPRESSION:- Should I get the latest iPhone? Or maybe a Samsung Galaxy S4? LG G2? This was a no-brainer for me. The Blue Life One is half the price of other \"flagship\" phones that are out there right now, while still getting the job done with flair.Well done, Blu. Keep this up and you just might have a customer for life. Especially now that you're coming out with the Blu Life Pure...", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well-built, functional, and true 3G telephone", "Author": "Craig Buchanan", "ReviewID": "R374V636XLDJ9L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Positives:* 13-Mpx camera is nice* The carrier-signal indicator is informative--E for Edge (2G) service, H+ for HSPA+ (3G) service; white triangles that indicate data up/down; red R for roaming; magnifying glass for searching for service* Good sound quality* Headphones are good quality; uses a kink-free, ribbon-format cable* The Micro-USB cable seats solidly in the telephones bottom edge; cable is a kink-free, ribbon-format* Bluetooth paired easily with my 2010 E92 BMWNeutrals:* Technical-support inquiries are usually answered in 48 hours* The manufacture will not assist in unlocking the baseband or 'rooting' the deviceNegatives:* Does not contain a LTE radio (true 4G), which would be nice* The back of the telephone is a flexible plasticT-Mobile:* Supports T-Mobile 3G (HSPA+) in areas where the towers has been modified to include the 1900MHz band (Minneapolis/St. Paul area); otherwise the data service is 2G (Duluth; Grand Marais; hwy 35 north of 494)Android:* The telephone uses a 'standard' version of Androdi.

Clear screen, easy to use and I have small hands so having a 5 inch screen was a little scary for me but I wanted it bad. I now can not imagine living life without it. I have been through phone after phone in my life and so much so that my friends/family/husband all laugh at me. I don't care now because they can all be jealous of my phone and how they wish they had one too! Mine came with a case that Blu included in the package and a screen protector as well. The cord should be longer in my opinion even though its cool because its a kink free type flat cord :) sweet! but I wish it would have been a 5-6 foot cord because yes I love to play around on the phone even while its charging (bad yes I know). The removable battery is awesome and it also has lots of ringtone options and alert tones by far the biggest selection I have ever seen on a phone and it had a little light that blinks that lets you know of a new text/call inc...That little light also stay's lite when you are charging it its red and when its fully charged it turns green :) The camera on both sides are awesome~ takes time playing around with it to get it to the right settings though but I found putting it in Night Mode setting makes for the best looking pictures. If your thinking about getting this phone and are worried because its not a \"name brand phone\" DO NOT WORRY I can assure you it ROCKS!!!! I should know being the cell phone crazy queen apparently according to my family lol (who now wishes they had one of their own lol).

It definitely took some getting used to but once I got used to the phone, it was great for me. What I DO NOT like about this phone is the warranty, and the warranty options from this company. There is only a 1 year warranty and the outside warranties are not that great. Hopefully this phone will continue to do its job. Also, the battery life stinks. Whatever they describe on the website as far as battery life is either a lie, or only for people who use this phone only to talk and NEVER open any apps or text.

My first impressions are awesome!  I will edit this post after I have used it more, but so far it is screaming fast, easy to use.  Just a warning, it does NOT  come with a silicone case as shown on the YouTube video and the company does not yet have any other accessories (including extra batteries!) available.  Also, be aware it comes in an 'a' version and an 'i' version. I'm not sure what the difference is but I think it refers to which country it is meant to be sold in-USA or India??  Also, it will,only accept regular SIM cards, so if you have a micro or nano you will need an adapter", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, from a tech snob", "Author": "momo_lainy333", "ReviewID": "R15FRRFVK2HVW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Holy cow am I impressed with this phone! I'm a pretty big tech snob, I like the customization of android, I like to root my phones and I hate hate hate bloatware (such as what samsung and LG load up their flagships with) and all the being said I adore this phone. When I first heard of these cheap, unlocked android running, lots of options phones I thought it was too good to be true, and it would end up being like those phones you get in walmart for $50 but this blew me out of the water. It has gesture controls, I was easily able to load it up with a bunch of APK customizations pulled from 4.4, it comes preloaded with a TON of ringtones and the camera is BETTER than my old LG Optimus G Pros (which I LOVED until the screen crashed). The size and weight of the phone are just perfect, not too heavy not too light. The screen is bright and crisp and responds well, the headphones are fantastic, and they look great, BTW Blu i like the ribbon wiring :P, i just overall really like this phone! My only beef is not even really with the phone, I use AT&T; and have data, and when they put the SIM card in it didnt auto retrieve the APN (access point name) to let me use that data so I had to manually find and enter in the data to be able to use any data on the phone, not too hard but a little aggrivating (especially if you are tech illiterate, i am not so its not an issue but i know a lot of people who dont even know the meaning of sim card so....)Anyhoo!  Pros: no bloatware, great price, comes with a lot of accessories, screen is crisp and clear, call quality is awesome, android 4.2 is just new enough to still have shinecons: having to manually enter APNs to use your data, not a lot of 3rd party accessories specific to the phoneoverall it competes with my LG  G Pro, my brothers samsung GS3 and my hubbys Samsung galaxy mega.

Having upgraded from a Blu Vivo 4.3 the first thing I noticed was the size and the quality of the screen.  When outdoors with this phone I can read it with my sunglasses on. This makes it worth the money in my book. The dual sim functionality is awesome as I am using it with Optus in Australia and 2degrees in New Zealand. both roam internationally fine on AT&T; in the USA. The supplied earbuds I gave away as I much prefer using Marshall Minors. Look them up you will too. The 13MP camera is fantastic but took a little learning and tinkering, but then again what doesn't? The phone comes with 16GB on board memory which you can expand to 32GB via microSD.. I suggest you do this.I do agree with other comments that Blu should supply a second battery and also a silicone case of some kind. but it is a new(ish) phone so I expect they will be available soon.This phone is a great device and I recommend it highly.

From other reviewers this may not be true depending on who the seller is (in my case the seller was BLUTEKUSA).  I've been using it on T-mobile with consistent 4G speeds and experienced no issues (I'm in a refarmed area).  The phone can do everything that I need without the price tag of the S4, HTC one, or even Nexus 5 (when I factored in tax and shipping the Nexus 5 ballooned to $400, still a good deal, just more than I needed or wanted to spend.)I wanted to try android without spending the money for a premium phone while still getting the true experience. The phone looks and feels like a premium device and often gets mistaken for an S3 or S4.  The 5 inch screen is bright and clear, and I have had no issues with lag.  I don't play video games on my phone so I can't comment on the quality for big gamers,  I use the phone for web browsing, email, and work, for my needs there is little to no difference between this and my fiance's S4.

I own a Droid 2 and an iPhone 3GS, so I will use those as comparisons.  Even an Iphone has annoying things, and I think the Blu has about the same ratio of good to bad.  In other words, this phone is great.  You have no logical reason not to buy it, unless the things I list are completely unacceptable.  Here it is, the good, the bad the ugly after 5 days of use:Good:* Gorgeous display.  Really.  People drool.  Don't let any of it fall on the phone.* Removable battery.  This is important.  Trust me on that.* Accepts 32 GB micro SD.  This gives you an easy way to transfer files if you don't have a computer handy.  Also huge storage.* Takes beautiful pictures.  Very high resolution with good color, etc.* Nice design that feels relatively sturdy, except for the thin plastic back.* Comes with a charcoal gray case that clips over the back and a screen protector sheet* Includes charger and headphones - both have tangle-resistant flat cords* Cell signal seems strong - not sure about 3G or 4G because I currently have voice only plan* The phone is fast and has not crashed yet, in 5 days of use* Battery use is acceptable, and seems like it will make it through a normal day's use* It says it has gorilla glass, which is nice, because it is easy to drop if you use it one-handed (reaching across the screen with your thumb is a challenge) - I think I am going to drill two small holes through the clip-on case and loop a piece of string through it that I can hook a finger through.Bad:* OK speaker, but not quite as loud as an iPhone 3GS or Droid2  - makes it hard to use speakerphone in a car* The WIFI is not quite as strong as the iPhone or Droid - OK, but not great* The back of the phone is thin plastic - probably the same thickness as the Droid 2, but since it is so big, it feels like it could start to break down after a lot of opening the phone* It has an FM radio, but it uses your earphones as an antenna, and the connection to the headphones keeps cutting out so that the reception is lost - minor annoyance unless you are getting this for the radio* It includes a SIM card management app, but it says \"not installed\" when you open it.  WT-?* The Sim card app is important because only the manufacturer's app can give you full management of the second SIM - The second sim still works, and you can turn it on or off and choose which things you want to use it for (sweet)* The volume is right across from the unlock button, so I keep adjusting the volume when I unlock itI would buy this phone again, and I am recommending it to all my friends.  This is a great phone.  There is no good reason I can see to spend three times as much for an unlocked no-contract Samsung.  I love it.

This phone is really a good cell phone. I started out trying to use it with Wal-Mart family plan. It would drop almost every phone call and I thought I had made a $250 mistake. They are using the T-Mobile towers and I must not have one anywhere close to where I live. So I thought I would try one other thing and try Straight Talk out and see if the cell phone would work with them.  Easy to set up and I knew they used Verizon towers. I used the AT&T; sim card that came in the packet. After getting the APN set up this phone worked like a charm. Its clear screen and fast moving made it nice to use. Calls are clear and sound is loud enough that it makes music sound darn good even without ear buds. I did install a sound booster to make sure sounds are loud enough for this old guy to hear.  The only thing that has me bothered is the battery. I am not use to charging phone during the day. With heavy use be prepared to charge the cell phone during the day. My old phone I would charge overnight and it was good to go all day and most of the night. I have installed a battery saver and an app killer which has helped out a lot. Before I go to bed the cell phone is down to about 35% left on the battery.  With all this said I am giving it 5 stars due to it has performed very well. The camera is great and the pictures are super clear. I put a 32 GB SD card in and loaded about 100 songs on it and it has made a good MP2 player as well. I put the setting below for the Straight Talk APN settings. Some people say they can\u2019t receive pictures with text or send them.

I have been using it for about a month and overall I am very pleased with the phone. I won't bore you with repeating all the good things about the phone but rather focus on the little issues that I find could be better.1. Weak WiFi - My office desk is about 20 feet from the WiFi router, separated by a couple of drywalls. At most times I get 2-3 bars on the phone and using apps like 'WiFi Analyzer' I see that the signal strengths I get are around -65dBm. I noticed the low bars at home as well and compared the results with an iPhone (no apps to give specific signal strength) and a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Using the same app with the phones sitting right next to each other the difference is about 15-20 dBm in favor of the Samsung. This area could use some work on BLU's part. At times I will lose total WiFi connectivity if I step away too far (even at home).2. Touchy buttons - The backlit menu, home and back keys sometimes don't behave. At times when I touch them, they won't do a thing and at other times it will register a single touch as multiple touches.3. Processor - At times I like to play a very processor and memory intensive racing game called \"Real Racing 3\". Even though this app is installed on the internal storage the load times are horrendous and lag is clearly visible. This game normally has great graphics but this phone will not render them properly (does a B+ job).Other than the main issues listed above I have nothing but praise for this device. Camera, Dual Sim, Screen size all are great features to have especially at the phenomenal price. And since these issues don't affect my daily use of the phone as much, I am giving it 4 stars.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better Than Expected", "Author": "Bean", "ReviewID": "R4935XNU87YK3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the BLU Life One for approximately 2 months now and I'm more than satisfied.  The large screen makes viewing photos or reading emails great, and the user interface is easy to figure out.  I did have a couple of bumps along the way, mainly due to the fact that my service provider had never encountered this type of phone before so their system didn't recognize it.  The main issues encountered were with receiving MMS texts and connecting to the Internet while away from the house/WIFI.  Both of these issues were quickly resolved, however, by manually entering the provider information into my settings and rebooting the phone.The speed of the phone is great.  Pages load fast, moving between programs is no problem, and the speakers provide great volume.  I also like the fact that when you power up the phone, it doesn't have loud, obnoxious introductory music like previous phones I've had.  I know this is minor, but it bugged the hell out of me when I would power up a previous phone on a plane and scare small children.The battery life on the phone is great, even with heavy usage.  I had to charge my previous phone, an HTC, almost every day.  This phone only needs to be charged every 3-4 days.  As a bonus, charging is super fast!I've read that others were disappointed in the camera/video quality.  However, I've noticed little to no difference from this phone and previous phones I've had.The biggest downside to this phone is the color.  The Home, Back, and System buttons are hard to see since they are only backlighted, not actual buttons, and the phone is white.  However, once you get used to it, you know where they are, and they do light up as soon as the area is touched.  If they come in other colors, I'd choose any one over white due to this.Overall I think this phone is a great alternative to an iPhone.  I've had numerous people think it was an iPhone, and a couple people have become converts when I told them what I paid.  I recommend this phone without hesitation for anyone looking for a quality, phone with all the bells and whistles at an affordable price.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!

They recommend that you store all pictures and data on a memory card so that the internal memory can be used for apps.I have Consumer Cellular as a carrier so I just popped in my sim card and the phone and GPS worked great right away. I had to call for help to set up mobile data though. The tech at Consumer Cellular had never heard of this phone and they didn't have a protocol in their system for it but I told him that it was almost identical to the Galaxy S4 and those settings ended up working perfectly.I compared this phone to a coworker's Galaxy and there really are no visible differences. He was seriously impressed and is looking into switching plans as soon as his contract expires. Just FYI, my husband and I pay $70 (including taxes) a month for two phones with 1000 shared minutes, unlimited texts and 500MG data. We have wifi at home and at work so that is totally sufficient for us. So happy this phone worked out!

It has a great display, bright and sharp.  Nice heft in the hand with the aluminum edge and buttons, great build quality.  Doesn't seem to attract fingerprints as much as other phones, the BLU Studio 5.0 S is a fingerprint magnet!It is my first white phone, the black looks great but I wanted to be different.  Maybe that is what makes it seem so expensive, I don't know.  It is one great looking phone.Pros:Looks great, feels greatQuick and snappy, quick easy setup.Battery, at this point I can make it all day on a charge with average use.Good call quality.Lots of extras included, case, screen protector, headset.Has Smart Gestures, nice upscale feature.Cons:The capacitive buttons on the white phone are very hard to see in a normal to brightly lite area.No extras available for BLU at least in the US.  The case it comes with barely fits.The capacitive buttons are too far apart.Very few cons on this specific phone.  I have several cons for BLU phones in general, things I don't like.  The back button is on the right like Samsung, I personally prefer it on the left as I tend to use my left hand more when using the phone.  The LG G2 allows you to change the buttons to nearly any configurations, more phones should start doing that.The usb port on many, dare I say most BLU phones are on the top, not the best location if you ask me.  The Life One is one of the few with the port on the bottom, HOWEVER it is backwards compared to any phone I have ever had.  The wide side of the plug faces front and in any other device I have had the wide side faces the back.  This means that you can not use any usb charging dock at least I have not found one with that configuration or an option to change how the plug faces.All in all I think the Life One is one great phone and anyone should be happy with it.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "BLU", "Author": "Jazel Roland", "ReviewID": "R2ZDHTOPFK8S8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone if you do not want to spend so much money on a Samsung galaxy, however although the camera is 13MP, the quality of the pictures are still not as good as the Samsung Galaxy phone.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic unlocked Android Phone.", "Author": "Dave Chatterjee", "ReviewID": "RB8ISYW2JWSFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First , this phone is big.

There are some issues, but with an extra battery and some care, this phone is GREAT value and a recommended buy.So, some pros and cons....Build Quality- Excellent:Superb, handles scratches and falls with ease. It looks like a Samsung S4 and most people think that's what it is.Accessories - None from Blue, buy on ebay if you can find them:The box accessories are very limited. Here's where Blu USA need to get their act together. Accessories from them are non-existent to hard to get. There is a solution though: as Blu is also sold in India under the Micromax brand, I was able to search on ebay for the Micromax A210 (same model as Life One) and get some accessories sent relatively cheaply. This includes a much-needed spare battery for around $15 with shipping. I also bought a cover for the phone for around $6. All were made for the A210.  Blue should include a spare battery in the box and get rid of a very frustrating experience for Blu owners as well as empowering more after-market accessory availability in the US, at least on ebay.Battery life - Fair to Poor:Fair, but Wifi and Bluetooth use drain the battery. In all, with 2 SIMs running without wifi and/or bluetooth, you'll get about 10 hours. WIth 1 SIM running, you'll get 12 hours. With bluetooth and/or wifi, you'll get less than 8 hours. From Androids battery analysis, its the screen that chews up most of the power though, so Blu need to check that. So an extra battery definitely comes in handy although at $15, thats almost 10% of the phone price at current Amazon pricing of $217 on Prime for the phone. It takes 3-4 hours to charge the battery. Poor battery life is a feature of most smartphones though, so Blu is not alone.OS -- good, but some app pain:As Blu dont issue upgrades to the OS once the phone is shipped from factory (they say they do, but they dont), you'll be stuck with Android 4.2.1. The only issue I have with Blu's OS 4.2.1 implementation is that you cannot shift app screens around, so that if you want to move all the apps gathered at the last swipe screen to say the second swipe screen (there are only 4 screens for apps), you cant do them all together (Samsung allow it) but have to move each app individually, a major pain.Onboard memory & MicroSD cards -- good, but mSD issues:The memory is generous, but you'll need a microSD card. Beware though that saving large videos to the SD card corrupts the file integrity so any apps stored on the mSD card will be lost, as will the videos and any other pictures. The phone comes up with an error message. Best to remove the videos from the card to a PC as soon as possible. Its a pain, but you'll save your memories. The mSD corruption is a phone issue, not a mSD issue: I tried good quality mSD cards and they all experienced corruption on the Blu.Roaming & dual SIM - excellent, best feature:Fantastic: the ability the choice which SIM to use for calls or to do this automatically is great. Best feature of the phone. The multiple 3G/4G frequencies are a huge boost especially if you are on T-mobile USA which primarily uses 1900 Mhz for 3G/4G. The 2100 Mhz 3G/4G is superb for Europe, Asia and Africa where these frequencies predominate. In all, the phone will have seamless 3G/4G globally, a huge feature.Camera - excellent, but mSD issue a concern.Love the camera. Great autofocus and burst shot. Videos very good, but beware long videos being saved onto mSD slot as you may lose the video!Screen - excellent:Love the screen. Good even in sunlight.Overall Impression:Looks like a Samsung, acts better than a Samsung at 1/3 the price.BUY IT!", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Extreme value for the money", "Author": "Bruce 'Corelogik' Jenner \"Tech Minion\"", "ReviewID": "R2XTSIJOJZETIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone and use it on Straight Talk.

(The phone lets you choose which disk, internal, phone or sd card to write to as primary so you can choose where to store your media, apps, music etc.)Bad:The second sim slot always showing an error if empty every time you reboot the phone is a bit annoying, but minor since the notification can be swiped away and ignored once booted up.Overall the only real complaints I have with this phone are more a function of the Straight Talk service that the phone itself. Straight Talk handles it's APN settings in a somewhat Schizophrenic way, they post on their site the settings you need to use based on phone type and phone number, but the list they post is incomplete.

While I was at Walmart today getting it activated through straight talk, I compared the size difference between this & the S4 & S5. I didn't really pay attention to screen size difference, but the phone as a whole is just a tad longer than the Galaxies. Also a bit wider too, but I think that's what makes it feel so durable. It also has the metal surrounding the edges just like a Galaxy. I think I literally bought the knock off of an S4/S5 & its worth every penny.

There is a screen auto dim built in that dims the screen to 50% after a very short time, like less than 10 seconds.  When reading something on the phone, this can be annoying.  I reached out to the manufacturer on this, and it's not configurable, although they say it may be in future.2.  The power button (right side) and volume rocker (left side) should be offset.  Because of the size, you have to brace against the opposite side when using these buttons, so invariably power off when you meant to adjust volume or adjust volume when you meant to power off.Beyond those, it's perfect.

One problem I have encountered so far is that static electricity seems to impact it's performance. I listen to audible books when I walk to work, and when I keep the phone, while listening, in my trouser pockets, the sound breaks off very frequently. Initially I thought the problem was with the headphones or the part where you insert them into the phone. Hence changed the headphones but kept having the same problem. Eventually I discovered one way to avoid that problem, which as to carry the phone somewhere where it doesn't get exposed to friction with fabrics (like inside trouser pockets).

There are many other reviews that covered that extensively.This review is intended to address some concerns mentioned by other reviews if you are on the fence about purchasing this phone (I was on that situation and had some doubts after reading many reviews). But I bought the Blu Life One (Gray) anyway and here is the outcome:First, a list of possible show stoppers that I saw in other reviews together with my personal experience related to those problems/issues:1. Very weak Wi-Fi antenna: if this issue, which was mentioned on several reviews, had been accurate, it would have been a deal breaker for me as I am usually at home or in the office, with a 45-minutes commute in between the two. So I use Wi-Fi most of the day. The Wi-Fi antenna is actually pretty decent. I can be 20-30 feet away from the wireless router with a wall in between us and still get a pretty good signal (good enough for video streaming for example - definitely very good for web-browsing). I compared the Wi-Fi reception to a Samsung Galaxy SII (my previous phone) and I found them to be very similar actually (the Samsung Galaxy is a flagship phone and it costs $600 when it firsts comes out). The only difference that I noticed is in the number of bars that show the signal strength on the upper right corner of the screen (notifications bar). Sometimes the Galaxy would show three bars while the Blu Life One would show only two bars, etc. However, the actual speed/quality of video I used for testing purposes was similar with no lagging. I tested the same HD video clip from YouTube on both phones to compare and had similar results. Wi-Fi is a pretty tricky issue because it depends on what router you have, what channel you set it to broadcast, how many other routers are in the area (I live in a New York City apartment so usually there are 12-15 other wireless routers in range which is the reason why I consider 30 feet away to be \"normal signal strength\")2. Screen auto-dims: I don't have that issue although I have seen it in some of the YouTube reviews when the phone first came out. I know that Blu customizes the Jelly Bean version of Android and they either corrected this problem with later builds or some models never had that problem. I own the Gray version with Custom build BLU_L120_V08_GENERICO3 which is dated 2014-01-11. Perhaps previous versions of the customized Android OS were different. There is a TIMEOUT shortcut in the \"pull-down\" Settings (when you pull down the notification bar and click on the Settings icon) and three different lengths can be set for time-outs (which is when the screen goes to sleep). There is also a customization option under Settings/Display/Sleep that allows for 15 Seconds, 30 Seconds and 1-2-5-10-30 minutes. The second option (the one where you select the length of time) overrides the TIMEOUT shortcut. Meaning that even if you set TIMEOUT to long, if you set 15 seconds in Settings/Display/Sleep the phone goes to sleep after 15 seconds. But this is exactly how Android is designed to work and no different than other Android devices I own or had in the past (Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, Acer Iconia, Samsung Galaxy phones, LG phones, etc.)3. Buttons under the screen are hard to see in the White version of the Blu Life One: it's true. The problem is that Blu designed the Menu, Back and Option buttons (cut-outs more than buttons since they are not physical buttons but touch-responsive) simply too thin for the back-light to be noticeable enough. I compared those buttons with the counterparts from the Samsung Galaxy SII and the icons/cut outs that represent each one of those three functions are much wider/bigger, making the back-light much more visible. This is by the way the reason why I decided on the gray color phone after watching a video review of the white version on YouTube where you couldn't see the buttons at all. On the gray version, you can minimally see the buttons but on the white version you can't because the back-light is white also so the combination of size and color of the back-light makes it impossible to see. This was an oversight from the designers but once your fingers \"learn\" where the buttons are located, you can press them without looking at them as it is not too hard to memorize their location. If you absolutely need to see the buttons every time, then I recommend the gray version.4. It doesn't come with KitKat flavor of Android (the latest version): this is true as of 6/10/2014; there is no update to the Android version yet. However, it is very likely that Blu will have an update in the future. But even if that doesn't happen, this is still a great phone and Jelly Bean works really well in general and with this particular phone (I have Jelly Bean in 3-4 different devices and I have no complains about it). In fact, I heard complains about KitKat like not being able to move App data to the memory card, something that it is very useful when you have many Apps and the 1GB of RAM memory starts getting full...Other observations:1. Warranty: the phone doesn't come with a warranty sheet/policy or even a mention of it on the instruction manual which is pretty minimal too (warranty explanation doesn't come inside the box) which made me think at first that there is no warranty whatsoever and if anything happens to the phone you are on your own. I contacted Blu and they sent me a PDF via email that explains the policy: 1 year parts - 6 months battery - 6 months accessories. Of course nothing is covered if you damage it due to improper use but that's standard with any phone manufacturer.2. Customer Service: it's pretty bad. They take 2-3 days to answer a question via email and they usually half answer it. For example, I asked them about the warranty and how much would it cost to repair a broken/damaged screen (which is never covered by any warranty) in the same email. They responded about the policy but forgot to attach the actual document explaining it (even though they said: \"please find attached\" and they didn't say anything about the screen repair. So I emailed them a few more times and finally they sent the attachment and told me that it costs $145 to repair the screen for the white version. It is my guess that the reps are not there full time. They use names like A.C. and R.C. and either they are business people or engineers responding whenever they can, or they are not properly trained customer service reps. Their written English is perfect so this is no overseas operation (they are probably in Miami where the company is based). The not so great customer service is somewhat expected of a company the size of Blu - basically they are a start-up in the mobile industry (they don't have the budget of Samsung/HTC/Motorola, etc. for customer service, marketing, etc. etc.). But customer service does exist and if you ever need to send your phone in for a repair it will happen (though it may take a few weeks until you see your phone back, who knows)Things I liked about this phone (there is a lot to like...):1. Screen: the phone has a very sharp 5 inches screen. Forget what the resolution nerds and marketing teams going after your hard earned money tell you. 300dpi is as detailed a resolution as the human eye is trained to see. This phone has 296dpi (approx.) so it is right there. Today some phones are made with screen resolutions that are actually higher than 50 inches TVs were two years ago (on a 5 inches screen).  That is to make you think that it is better than older models. But there is a point where you just can't see the difference. And Blu Life One is right there at the edge of where you can't tell the difference anymore. All I can tell you is that when I watched Planet Earth on HD from YouTube, what I saw is as good as it gets.2. Cameras: both of them are really good. The front camera at 5 Megapixels is superb. Quality of Skype calls and even the occasional \"selfie\" pictures are simply outstanding. I use the back camera (13 Megapixels) to photograph receipts for tax purposes with an App called Expense Manager and the receipts look as good as in real life (very detailed). Landscapes look very sharp too.3. Antennas: Wi-Fi, GPS, and HDSP+ on T-Mobile all work fine and fast (fast Wi-Fi, fast Mobile Data, GPS gets your location fast). Don't even mind not having 4G LTD. It's plenty fast.4.  Dual SIM: nice if you travel to other countries for work/vacation and want to use a local service.5. Construction: Blu Life One looks and feel very solid and stylish with no flaws other than the buttons that are hard to see in the white version (volume button, power button, headphone jack, USB port all are where they should be and they work very well). The case that it comes with is very nice and not bulky at all. It doesn't provide great protection so if you are likely to drop your phone (I know I am) I would suggest to get an armor or hybrid case, or at least a plastic/silicone case (anything will be more protective than the case that it comes with, but it will add more bulk too and perhaps they will be less stylish).A couple of things I disliked (or at least I didn't understand the thinking of the peeps at Blu):1. Customized version of Android. Why? Why? Why? Here the Blu folks had a great opportunity to use a plain Vanilla (original Android version without modifications) and join the ranks of Nexus or Moto G-E-X phones but did not take that chance. The modifications aren't many but none of them are necessary (the camera has a different user interface for example but the stock Android interface is just fine. Under \"Display\" they have an option for \"Theme\" which allows you to choose between Default (blue), Mint, Mocha and Raspberry. That changes the colors of all the buttons, navigation, etc. but there is no need to include an option like this. However, in the customized version of Android they omitted a few very useful features. For example, HTC and Samsung phones with Jelly Bean 4.1 and older have an option to output audio via the micro USB port. I use that in my car because with one cable you can both charge the phone and play music via the Aux input of your car (provided that you have the right cable). This is better than using Bluetooth for example because all you have to do is plug in the phone and it automatically goes into \"Dock\" mode and sends the music to the car stereo. This is similar to how the iPhone works when docked. So while the alterations by Blu weren't many, it is annoying that they added useless things like color options for the menus while they subtracted useful features of Android. I always resented carriers like Verizon who customizes the OS to be able to sell you more things and block you from using third party services, etc. So here you have a company (Blu) that builds \"unlocked cell phones\" but they monkey with the OS without a real need to do so. That's almost tragic, as they had an opportunity to be the kings of unlocked, untouched, un-customized devices which would have put them in a very unique position compared to the other phones which unfortunately need to be customized for each carrier (because the carriers demand that).2. Headphones come included, which is very nice. However, I can't use iPhone headphones with the Blu Life One. I have no idea why. The jacks look very similar in size (with three white lines on the metal prong) but for some reason when I plug in the headphones that came with the phone, there is a little icon that appears on the notification bar and phone calls/Skype calls go through the headphones. However, when I plug in the iPhone's headphones nothing happens and the calls go to the Phone's speakers. I haven't experimented with other headphones but if the Blu Life One only works with the Blu headphones that come with it, that's an issue (headphones always break sooner or later). I'll update the review if I find that the Life One actually works with third party headphones other than the iPhone's.3. As mentioned above, Customer Service at Blu is an after-thought. I imagine Blu being a company with some very smart/geeky engineers who speak Spanish (they name their own software modification: \"GENERICO\") who started the company and still run it (if you look at the Life One reviews on YouTube actually made by Blu Products, you'll see what I am talking about. These folks probably really get excited about Specs (how fast the processor is, how many Gigs of memory, etc. etc.) but they probably don't really put much attention to user experience (hence the buttons you can't see), customer service (it's like going to the dentist - painful) or getting deals in place with third party accessory makers (top dogs like Otterbox don't make cases for Blu phones, the iPhone headphones don't work with Blue phones, etc. etc.)Conclusion:If you think that the Blu Life One costs only $215 (at the time of this review), it is easy to overcome some of the very minor annoyances (they are really very minor and I have never seen a phone that was actually perfect, they all have a couple of annoyances - even the $600-$800 Samsung Galaxies and iPhones do). If you actually compare it with other phones in the $200-$250 range (thinking of you Moto G) it is easy to determine that the Blu Life One is the clear winner. In fact, the Life One puts a good fight against industry heavy-weights like the Samsung Galaxy S4-S5 or the HTC One - M7-M8 at basically 1/3 of those flagship phone's price. Since phones don't last more than 1-2 years anyway because they become obsolete or their screen breaks when you drop them or they slow down due to software issues, I don't see any reason to spend $600-$800 on a phone when you can get the Blu Life One for $215. It's simply the best your money can buy at this price point. I find it very hard to justify spending $600-$800 because in all honesty, the Moto X, the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the iPhone 5S are not that much better. They are some folks that have very particular needs like NFC - Near Field Communication, Application developers who want to experiment with Flagship phones that are very popular, etc. They may want to spend $600-$800 for a phone. For the rest of us mortals, the Blu Life One does the job and it does it fast and with style at a fraction of the price. For that achievement, Blu deserves all the credit.If after reading this review, you have any questions about the Blu Life One, please let me know and I'll try to respond (if I know the answer) when I have a chance.

The data cable that is currently included with the phone is defective!The first time I tried to charge the phone the cable seemed to not fit properly. The cable head would wobble in the phone's port and the charge notification would go on and off with the slightest vibration (especially if I tried to charge it in the car). At first I thought it was a problem with the phone's port. I then tried to connect the phone to my laptop. I got a notification that the device driver wasn't installed properly, which is something that rarely occurs with today's devices.After removing and reconnecting the cable about 4 to 5 times I finally got it to connect properly. The phone's memory became accessible, but not the SD card memory (I had a third party 16gb card installed). Again I thought it was an issue with the phone, so I started searching it up on the internet. I found another review on Amazon stating that the factory cable was too large for the phone and possibly damaging the connector port. I immediately unplugged the cable, and sure enough I noticed tiny flakes scraping off the inside of the port.I then borrowed my friend's Galaxy S3 cable (Micro USB, same size) and tried it. It fit perfectly, connected the phone to my laptop on one try, AND displayed both internal and SD card storage with no issues. This confirmed that the factory cable was indeed defective and/or poorly designed to begin with. I have contacted Amazon regarding the issue. They issued me a partial refund, which I found acceptable, but I am not sure whether the seller is addressing the issue yet.. As of this moment I am still using the borrowed S3 cable. If it continues to work I will get one of these cables myself to use with the phone.Apart from the above issue, the phone has worked pretty well so far. Build quality is average. The device feels solid on a whole but the side buttons are a little soft and easy to press accidentally. The display is gorgeous and voice quality is decent. Straight Talk's 3G fluctuates between 1.6 and 3.0 mbps DL and a 1 mbps UL. I've not taken enough photos to comment on the quality yet. There is an issue with sending photo attachments via MMS, but after looking it up I decided that may be related to my particular SIM card and/or Straight Talk's proxy servers. I may follow up with a more detailed review in the future.Summary: Issues with included factory cable. Either contact the seller before purchasing or hold off buying until they fix the issue. Phone is otherwise decent and a good bargain for the price.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Is that a Samsung", "Author": "HAPPYGOLUCKY", "ReviewID": "R1YI4SA4ZLYB8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whenever someone sees my phone they ask if it is a Galaxy.

Let me tell you the real situation about the blu phones. The decent quality, 2 sim cards, good prices, good specs for a budget phone and TERRIBLE SUPPORT OR NO SUPPORT AT ALL. THINK twice before buy anything from BLU PRODUCTS COMPANY.Short story - you bought the BLU phone and its working with no issues - you very LUCKY !! start playing lottery $) and be happy BLU PRODUCTS owner.Long story - you bought the BLU phone and you have some issues (DOA, headphone jack broken, black pixels on the screen, short battery life, Android is always low on memory, ECHO on microphone .. screen clicking by itself ...etc ) - welcome to HELL !!If you still have refund or replacement period = you lucky again. Otherwise - YOU JUST WAISTED 200$-300$ from your wallet. If you want to find the truth $) be my guest = read the whole story = IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME AND PAIN !!!First off I had 4 Smartphone's. (3 had issues)2012 1st Blu Studio 5.3 - black dots, bad design of case - the screen was visible detached from system board. = sent for replacement.2012 2nd Blu Studio 5.3 - first half year great phone for its money. (270$) great battery life - 4-5 days with 5.3 screen = very happy. until the headphone jack stopped working normally - some hiss sound with tapping when you plug the headphones. no more movies or private conversations on the go ... Tried to fix it... went to couple stores for repair - the verdict unfixable ... Give it away to my neighbors to use it as GPS on his car.Tried to contact BLU Products for warranty repair - welcome to some BLU marry-go-round - \"please contact distributor\" and distributor replays ... since its out of 30 days from the day of purchase - \"please contact BLU products\" I did wrote around 30 yes its 30 !!!!! emails ... trying to resolve this issue ... still no help.Hmm ... I am still trying to find the truth $) and some service . I did find the email of CEO of BLU Products ... and sent to him all my correspondence with the supervisors from BLU and Vendor stamped by dates ... in one huge email .... just to be relieved of this whole nonsense and terrible customer support.2013 3rd BLU STUDIO 2 - To be honest I was surprised when I got answer from him directly . Very delicate and nicely written letter with apology and offer to get new model of BLU STUDIO 5.3 Smartphone !!! free of charge. OMG all this emails .. looking for help finally paid off... HAPPY END ???? NO WAY only half story ...When I got new Smartphone BLU Studio 5.3 II. It worked nicely for couple weeks than ... its start failing APART.Here are list of issues with BLU smarphone1) Clicking by itself ... and the screen is not responsive a lot of times (even when I did factory reset and as test did capture couple pictures ... it happened again and again)enjoy the terrible unknown feature by BLU products smartphone .... clicking by itself randomly ... can happen 1 time in a week or 5 times during the DAY !!![...][...][...]2) Low RAM ... Even with couple applications since its only 512 mb of ram its freezing and shutting down apps . A lot of freezing with GPS on and map from Google with data connection on and Bluetooth on. Especially when trying to play music on background ... its start freezing and shutting down applications by itself.3) Very low battery life ... the original BLU were holding up to 4-5 days of active use ... this one ... less than a DAY. (I did charging now 2 times a day)4)Echo - a lot of complains from my coworkers and friends .So I did start warranty service on this \"gift\" from CEO of BLU PRODUCTS. I was out of states for work... So it took me a several weeks to send for repair/ replacement.I was assured multiply times that if issues (the main one - clicking on the screen by itself) will be confirmed - they will replace it with new model.But in real life ...another 20 emails ... no real help ... only promises to resolve the issue and make me happy. they tried to charge me 80$ for replacing wet ?? system board .. and finally sent back pretty much same unit with replaced screen, system board and same defective battery ... nice job....and for defective battery I was given advice - \"to buy the new one \" since  6 hours battery life (even when not using) is basically good battery life according to BLU customer support.2013 4th BLU STUDIO 2 - So for now I did give it to friend as present. with explanation - no obligation from me.... and if something will happen to this phone ??? I don't care and don`t do anything Real to help with this wonderful Smartphone. Lesson learned from BLU PRODUCTS support. $) Good luck.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$269.00", "Features": "Life One comes with an exceptional build quality and luxurious design\nThe Packaging includes: 1 Headset ;1 Battery ;1 Charger ;1 Data cable; 1 User manual; 1 Stereo headset; 1 Screen protector;   1 Protective silicone case", "Name": "BLU Life One L120 Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with 5.0-inch IPS HD Display, Quad-Core 1.2GHz Processor, Android 4.2 JB, , 4G HSPA+ up to 42Mbps, 13MP Camera, and Micro SD Slot", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411JVq6VsnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F9BFIMA"}}
