Kelly", "ReviewID": "R1T6AXMSJFTMAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone back in April 2010 after reading numerous reviews saying how great it was. When I went to my local AT&T; store I didn't hesitate in purchasing it for my upgrade. By June I was regretting my decision all together. It drops calls, I end up with mysterious voice mails and no missed calls, I don't receive all my texts, its really rather useless for me to even use, but I'm stuck with it until I can afford a new one. Overall, I do like the size, weight, and design. However, I hate the operating system and the fact that you cannot remove any of the applications from the menu. They are all built in and require purchase. Also, the internet is horrible I get \"unexpected failure\" any time I try to do anything with it. Overall its a horrible phone. I will never purchase another Samsung phone again.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not recommended", "Author": "StillWaters", "ReviewID": "R23XQ2IBX967ID", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I liked this phone because it has a nice design, it's a smartphone, and it has a touch display. For a while it was fine, but then I figured out that it has the worst navigation if you are trying to go online. It displays the buttons as tiny and you can't touch them to click on links. Very frustrating and makes the phone not worth the price right there. It is also difficult to text, and even after callibrating, it makes errors when typing. Sometimes the screen would freeze and I would not be able to unlock it, and sometimes when dialing a number or typing a text, you would press one button and another one would be pressed (if you pressed a 2, the 1 would go). After having it for about a year and a half, it started doing this all the time, and I was no longer able to type in numbers or text at all. The only way I could make a phone call was to look someone up in my address book and press the bottom call button. The screen did not work at all, so if I wanted to call someone not on  my list, I was out of luck. I ended up buying a cheap phone just to replace this one until my next upgrade.Also, it has a set of screensavers built in and you can't change them or delete them. They randomly display. One of the pictures is of a bunch of flowers and a butterfly. My boyfriend also owned this phone, and it's kind of stupid that he has no choice but to have a girly butterfly picture on his screensaver, and no way to change it.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sucks waste of money", "Author": "Essie Carlson", "ReviewID": "R2VRZY4SPZ5JMK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sucks works better if you get it at AT&T; waste of time money and I wouldn't get it works better from AT&T;", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst phone I have used ever", "Author": "ambu", "ReviewID": "R1ZQYXC3QRIALQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the touchscreen is NOT at all friendly...it often drops the call.

This phone is SO simple and user friendly, I bought my 75 yr old mom the SAME PHONE at the same time I bought mine.  I taught her to TEXT on it (something she has NEVER done before) and we txt all the time!  She knows how to take photos, how to access the menus, everything.  And she doesn't even own a computer!  So SERIOUSLY, how HARD could it be to use???The awesome thing about txting ability is, you can either use the keyboard, OR, you can draw on the screen with your FINGERNAIL and WRITE the letters on the screen! You CANNOT do that on a smart phone as they only recognize TOUCH with a finger.  Too cool!There are UMPTEEN WAYS to access features on here, so if one is easier than another for you, you just choose which one you like best.  Such as: there is an awesome touch screen pull out menu that gives you all kinds of instant features like volume, time, alarm, etc. AND there is a scroll photo fast find address w/ picture id that I love, for all the people frequently called.The camera is a 3.0 megapixil WITH flash, AND you can change the lighting to whatever setting you are in: daylight, incandescent, florescent, etc.  AND it does video and shares it!  I confess to never having figured out the zoom on it, tho.  I'm sure there is a way, just never figured it out, and the guys at ATT were not particulary helpful.Mythic is and isn't a smartphone.  IF you use the internet constantly, you should really get something like the Samsung Captivate which my hubby has and he LOVES IT!  I simply don't do that much internet surfing, so chose a phone for mom and I that we didn't automatically have to pay the $25. a month internet activation fee.  I have a limited data pkg that allows me access to facebook, email and whatever for ten bucks a month.Again, I don't know what on earth these other people were trying to do with their phone, but if my 75 yr ol mom can handle it and loves it, I think it's pretty darn simple.  I am sick that I ruined mine, but I know where I can purchase another!!", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poop with a battery stuck in it.", "Author": "Heath", "ReviewID": "R28ZVLA4MMKGYO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is the worst phone ever! It drops calls, completely skips calls and I get voicemails later. It would tell me I had a text and I would click read and it would glitch and go back to the lock screen. The screen is probably the weakest thing ever. It has scratches a;ll over it, and I took good care of it. It's not overstuffed with files, and it's slow! SLOW! It sucks. I'm upgrading to a samsung infuse 4g as soon as possible!", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Stars For Me", "Author": "AliMarJo", "ReviewID": "R23CJ8G9J6V5NQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If I could rate this and give it no stars, I absolutely would. This phone has to be the junkiest phone that I've ever owned. It drops calls a lot, I do not get all of my incoming calls, but end up with voicemails sometimes days later, and switching inbetween call waiting is a nightmare. I do not get all of my text messages. I also hate that if I set my alarm clock on it, wake up before the alarm goes off and turn the alarm off (the \"alarm icon\" disappears when I turn it off, so I know that I've successfully selected \"off\"), it still proceeds to go off at the initial set time The quality of the vidoes and photos are horrible (not that I use the phone for that, but still). Lastly, when I'm on the internet whether it be browsing or on facebook, I always get \"unexpected error\" as well as \"failure\" messages over and over again, and sometimes I cannot post what I was initially trying to post at all. It's very aggrevating. I'll be glad when I can afford to get another phone. For anyone wondering, it is not the service provider's problem, nor is it a \"low bar\" issue. My husband and I both have AT&T; but he has a different phone, and never has any problems with it.

I like how it is thin and lightweight [for the most part]. The mythic is just like all the other samsung phones as far as the operating system, menu setup, homepage ect. The only difference,  mythic is all touch screen and no qwerty keyboard. If you have previously had a samsung phone in the past and did not like it or is looking for something different, then this is not the phone for you.However, if you do like samsung's phones this is just like all the rest.Here is my \"review\" of some of the features this phone offers: (Out of 10)Camera: 1  -Its a cell phone camera what do you expectCalibration: 6.5  - Sometimes messes up, but you can recalibrate it anytimeBattery Life: 8  - As far as phones go this is pretty goodTouch Screen(In General)-4.5  - Has some delay, do not expect it to be as responsive as apple phones*Operating System: 8", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery not good", "Author": "CindyLunsford", "ReviewID": "RHQGWUB88N2GG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the phone.

It is not heavy or too big or too small.The device has some serious problems that makes you not buy it.The first problem is the touchpad. It is not comfortable at all. You have to push hard to make an action.The second problem is the operating system. It is not Android. It is a special OS designed for AT&T.; So you can not find proper applications easily.The third problem is the internal memory. The internal memory is too small, and you need to get a SD card to take pictures and movies.The fourth problem is WIFI.

I am very disappointed and will not ever buy from this seller again or recommend them.  The restocking fee for this phone was as much as I paid for it so it's not worth sending it back for a refund....it would end up costing me more than I spent in the first place.

You need to press the screen really hard to get the 'correct' thing done. Otherwise, it will stay dumb! I used to have iPhone before for 2 years, and I got this one only to get rid of dataplan (as I was not using dataplan much). This phone doesn't need to have dataplan and that's the only good thing about this phone.Other things like crystal clear home screens which change every time the phone is in locked position, makes it look something interesting. But that is not any convenient feature I was looking for!I had hard time in adding contacts or notes. Searching contacts by scrolling is very challenging and you need to get used to some 'special skills'.Overall, I am going to use this only to make calls and nothing else. This phone is not good at all for texting or even surfing internet (If you take 3G plan, you can use internet in this phone). Browsing is something terrible to do in this phone.If you are looking for browsing (3G) feature along with calling and texting, this is not a good phone.I am using it only for voice calls and I am going to dump it in future.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as good as Samsung Eternity", "Author": "Roger A. Wolf \"Alyn\"", "ReviewID": "R3M76T6LM2XYRC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought a Samsung Mythic as an upgrade to my Samsung Eternity. I'm glad I kept the Eternity as it is a better phone in all respects. I recently switched my AT@T Sim card back to the Eternity and couldn't be happier. The only thing lacking on the Eternity is speed dialing which I can get along without. See other reviews on the Mythic to understand the undesirable bugs that have to be dealt with in everyday use of the Mythic. Below is my previous review of the Eternity, old reliable. Not sure if you can find one of them anymore, but would certainly be worth a search if you are in the market for one of the better feature phones ever made.The wife and I obtained two of these Samsung Eternity cell phones brand new on an AT@T contract over 5 years ago. They have been one of the better investments we have ever made. Mine is still rock solid. Hers finally died; probably from old age and constant use. We have tried other phones before and since with none of them comparing to the Eternity. Keep in mind that we have no desire for smartphone technology or use. This is probably one of the better basic cell phones out there. It is the right size, wonderful touch screen, great ergonomics, with wonderful clarity coming and going. The 3 meg camera produces astonishingly good photos. I can only attribute that to what must be an above average lens. Everything works correctly for our purposes. I really like the way I get the large QWERTY virtual keyboard when I turn the phone horizontally for texting. I do find it somewhat difficult to text on any touch screen, but find that this one works better than most. It has that slight vibration feedback on every key stroke. It fits quite well in a belt case. About the only negative I have is that the speaker phone can produce some distortion especially if the volume is turned up too loud. Every time we think about upgrading to smartphones we decline because of the overpriced data charges, larger size, and complexity. Besides, we would rather use a second device with a larger screen such as our Samsung tablets for wi-fi internet away from home. We are even thinking about purchasing two more Eternities used or refurbished to hold in reserve. They are that good.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "unfriendly eye candy", "Author": "Miami", "ReviewID": "R479MMV1TDY0Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because it did not require a data plan and it certainly was new and flashy.Given the features it offers it could be satisfactory as a very good looking toy. Maybe it is a kid's phone. However, as an adult I found the tactile qualities very disappointing. The durability of the materials used is questionable. I never seemed to get it out of my pocket and answered before it would go to answer. The screen can not be seen except on dark moonless nights. The battery life is hard to judge given it will die with no notice.I found its method of doing things unnecessarily complex and very user unfriendly. This is the only cell phone I have owned that I could never get used to.Within two months I went back to wonderful old Razor V3 and have celebrated each day of its goneness.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible, even for picky people", "Author": "Amanda C", "ReviewID": "R29CHKJ2DHPR1T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really hate this phone. I've had it for nearly 4 years and I'm finally getting an upgrade. (Now, I didn't have a data plan so I never used this phone for surfing the web. All I used it for was alarms, calling, and texting.)Calls: It drops calls like no other, even when it says I have five bars of reception. It will tell me I have a voicemail, but it won't tell me I got a call beforehand. Sometimes it won't tell me I have a voicemail until the next day! The voicemail also doesn't have a timestamp on it - when you see the voicemail icon on the pop up box (the only good thing about this phone), it just says the current time and date, not the time/date the voicemail was received. The speakerphone is okay, but the ear speaker is really quiet. Most times I have to plug my other ear to hear the other person. Switching between calls using call waiting is clunky and doesn't always work.Texting: This is mainly what I use the phone for. The keyboard is not great. I only ever type on the sideways keyboard because I never got the typing with the numbers thing. If you type a message and want to delete half of it, you have to repeatedly TAP TAP TAP TAP on the backspace button to delete the message letter by letter, because if you hold it down for more than 2 seconds, it deletes the WHOLE message. Pain in the arse. The backspace is right above the OK button, which is right above the SEND button after it switches to the send screen. This results in trying to delete a word, but your finger slips and hits the OK button, which switches the screen and sends the half-written text. Also, the character limit is ridiculously short. Most of the time I end up sending my friends 2 messages instead of one because my text was 'too long'. It also doesn't tell you how many characters you have left - it just says '2295' at the top left corner and counts down, which is useless because it only seems to like sending 190ish characters at a time. Also, deleting texts after the phone's memory is full takes FOREVER. There it NO autocorrect either. It's called T9 predictive text, which acts kind of like autocorrect, but it makes typing about three times slower because it has to think about what you might mean. Keyboard also freezes all the time.Battery: The battery life itself is fine. I normally charge the phone every four or five days. But the problem I have with it is when the battery bar shows two bars left, it won't last more than an hour. Then it will BUZZ like a freaking angry hornet every five seconds, which is TERRIBLE when you're talking on the phone. When it's charging from the AC adapter (which hardly stays in the phone's plug, by the way), the screen will blink on and it will beep when the battery is full. Not useful when you plug it in before bed and it wakes you up in the middle of the night with a beep and a bright screen by your bed side.Screen savers: YOU CAN'T CHANGE THEM. At all. There are about 8 of them that it cycles through every time you unlock the phone. It has some nice abstract ones, a sunset over a bridge, some fireworks, but then it has a butterfly on a flower. I don't really mind, but I can imagine if a guy had this phone he would be frustrated with that picture popping up every so often. And it really bothers me that you CAN'T CHANGE THEM OR DELETE THEM.THE ONLY GOOD THINGS:Multiple alarmsShortcuts you can put on the home screen for a new text or Bluetootha Pop-up box that takes you directly to new messages, missed calls, or voicemailYou CAN get picture messagesYou can type with your fingernail or a pencil (though I always have to type with my fingernails since the keyboard sucks)Just get a different phone.
