I mean, if you're the kind of person who is obsessed with the latest greatest uber-tech, you're not gonna be satisfied with something that isn't riding the bleeding edge.  But I got this for my kid, because I'd gone the cheapo route last time we had an upgrade with AT&T;, and those freebie phones were just not cutting it, they were barely even functional anymore...and then just when we were anticipating an upgrade for them in December, and I'd promised them that, AT&T; went and changed our upgrade cycle to 24 months, making us wait until MAY to get new phones.  I wasn't gonna let AT&T; make a liar out of me, so I came to Amazon in search of something that will hold them over....well, I'm not even sure I'm going to upgrade in May now, because I might let the lines go off-contract and look for a better provider.  My son loves this phone, granted it's only been a few weeks and sometimes problems show up later, but so far so good.Stuff I really like:Memory is upgradeable via SD Card.I was concerned we might have to order a mini-Sim since my boy had the oldschool bigger chip, but went to the AT&T; store and they used a thing that looked like a stapler to punch his SIM to the smaller size, quick easy and free fix.The color is nice.So far performance seems great.Price was reasonable.Other stuff worth mentioning:  You get 3 screens to put your desktop shortcuts for apps on.  Some phones have more.  3 is enough for us, but your mileage may vary.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "love htc", "Author": "michelle", "ReviewID": "R34YZKDWTJQDXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i never have any problems with this phone had htc for over 2 years i love it more than a iphone", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Battery Life", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "R4HYCOM6TFBS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having the Galaxy S2, this phone is a dream. I was always worried about the battery not making it thru the day. The operating system on this phone (ICS) is more stable than the Gingerbread which used to freeze up often. The first one of these I bought had a problem accepting my sim card right away. I got it to work but it was intermittent. I ordered another phone and initiated a return easily thru Amazon.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1QM0NZ36ZLXCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I've ever owned.

The Moto G was and still is the best sub 200$ phone and it's specs beat this phone by a long shot . The moto G has a quad core processor and the average person might say \" so what \" but the thing is it makes a huge difference over a dual core processor  when it comes to games and graphics heavy websites and such . Not only that when you buy a product which has anything to do with Google you will be gurenteed the latest version of android which the moto G has . Trust me when I say this skip this phone and go with the moto G you will not be sorry ,", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BUE4DL2"}}
