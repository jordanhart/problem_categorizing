The zoom could be better and there is no flash. I do not think the camera option is very user friendly but I am happy with all of the other features. I am not sure if the blue tooth systems needs to be updated but the music titles are not displayed on the connected device as they are with other playable items.

I am with T-Mobile and it works fine and totally unlocked with this service provider. Also works with an AT&T; sim card. So far, so good. Only complaint with the phone, and I think it's with all the Optimus One phones, is that the touch sensitivity can't be adjusted. I dropped a transmission/xfer case from a truck on my hand while working alone in a garage (never trust an imported transmission jack!) and with blood and grease all over both hands by the time I got my phone out, tapping, hitting swiping, etc. on the screen keyboard to unlock it yielded nothing. I had to go dig-out my old RAZR, put this sim in it, restart to be able to call someone for help. Don't trust this to work in an emergency or with wet fingers or shaky hands. The touch sensitivity isn't high enough and for some, it's too high.All in all a fantastic phone for the value and it was shipped really fast and worked perfect when it arrived (as should be expected of a new phone).", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG P500 Optimus One", "Author": "YhwhKhai", "ReviewID": "RG0ZL9SR6NE1W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone through a third party here on Amazon called \"Yellow Deals\" and they shipped this phone to me pretty quickly. Communication with them was excellent and I have no complaints with them whatsoever.After owning several Windows OS phones and an Apple device, I decided to try my first Android device after reading how people swore by them. The LG P500 was my first android powered device and I took a chance knowing it ran on a meager 2.2 OS. I opened the box, charged the phone and then decided to begin exploring the phone.  Within 15 min. of exploration, I noticed that the touch screen lagged a bit and did not recognize the sd card slot at all. Now this was a total bomber because the internal memory on this phone is horrible and you would need external memory in order to download all of the excellent android apps that exist. After doing research I learned which apps I wanted to download and know that they would need tons of space to run properly.  I tried everything but nothing worked. I removed the card and replaced it several times but nothing worked.  First I thought the sd card that was shipped with the phone was faulty, so I gave the phone the benefit of the doubt. So I tried a spanking new 32 gig sd card and the phone didn't recognize that sd card either.  I knew I had to ship this phone back the next day. I was so disappointed. I then contacted \"Yellow Deals\", who got back to me right away.  I packed the phone back up and went through the process of returning the item.  I contacted Amazon - who also got back to me right away, and emailed me further instructions for shipping back the item.  I emailed Yellow Deals the delivery confirmation # and they issued me a full refund while the phone was still in transit to them. Now tell me, how COOL IS THAT?I thought of getting a replacement, but it was a good thing the seller didn't have any more in stock. I read on several sites that the 2.2 OS was upgradeable to 2.3, but when I downloaded the LG software update tool it stated that the phone already had the latest firmware. Another bomber! This phone is old by android standards and wasn't going to get anymore upgrades for it. I'm not experienced enough to jump through hoops with this phone. This is also not a US branded phone and therefore have no real warranty attached to it in the US if something goes wrong months later.  Another commenter said when his phone failed he learned the phone was covered by warranty in another country and it wasn't worth the hassle. So if this is correct, I dodged a huge bullet.Even though I wasn't able to get any use from this phone, Yellow Deals made this experience totally stress free. I haven't given up on getting my first android and after doing more research, my next phone will have a 2.3(Gingerbread) minimum operating system that will be upgradeable to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I learned that many Ericsson phones have 2.3 OS and an easy update to 4.0. I plan to use the refunded money to apply towards a better phone with a better and faster OS.Please use my experience with this phone to at least start your first android experience with a better phone than this one. Spend a few extra bucks and save the stress.  When your sd card slot fails, you are basically stuck with a slow lemon, pathetic 2.2 OS and finding yourself deleting your important apps in order to perform simple functions.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005LWZLWE"}}
