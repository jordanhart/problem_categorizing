{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Vlas", "ReviewID": "RNJ9YSF4JQBBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone 1 week ago and so far had only pleasant experience. Great camera with a lot of options,friendly interface and so far so on. windows mobile is a great software that basically allows you to have the mini computer in your pocket. The only negative side of it is that it has too many options. It is great to just copy movies from the home computer and watch them on the phone without downloading extra codecs. Sound is perfect! W-HD - nothing sounds better! sometimes it takes me a while to figure out how to do what want to be done. the name 'Smartphone'speakes for itself.. :) But once you figure everything out the phone basically becomes your best friend!Suggestions:Do not use any build in Verizon programs such as VZ Navigator. 1.99 a day and 7.99 a week - this is just ridiculous! Especially when you can download any navigators online for free and use them for free..!another thing is the battery... I was really disappointed when the battery lived less than 1 day, but after reading several forums I realized how to make it work longer. First of all, when you just purchased the phone let it die completely, then let it charge the whole night. in the morning unplug the phone, and take the battery off. let it sit for a couple minutes and then plug the battery in and charge it for additional 30 minutes.. Also do not forget turn off useless Verizones programs - they eat the battery because of non stop Internet access. Afte 3 days I still have 20% left of the battery..The phone works great if you know how to use it!", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not at all spectacular - but at least it still makes phone calls", "Author": "Rocky Mountain Auto Security \"CEA Certified A...", "ReviewID": "RTZ67VAZYD482", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I traded in my Blackberry for one of these a little over 1 year ago.  I was very excited to find out it ran and edited office documents.  I also wanted a phone I could tether to my laptop while i was out in the field.After about 2 months, it started freezing up, the text entry was not putting in the spaces between words (so when i type \"How is you're day?\" it came out \"howisyou'reday?\"), and eventually stopped sending and receiving messages.  I found out there was a firmware update available for it, and figured this may fix the problem.I went home to download the update.  That was easy.  Then I went to backup my phone.  Holy cow...  The computer i was using didn't have a full version of Outlook, and without a full version of Outlook (not outlook express) you CANNOT back up your contacts.  After finding my office disc and added Outlook to my suite, I finally got my phone backed up.  The firmware update process after that took quite some time, however it was automatic, so I didn't have to do anything but make sure i didn't turn off the computer.That seemed to work for about 6 months.  Then the phone started complaining about storage memory.  in response to this, I took all of my pictures and media and moved it from the phone to a storage card.  I also deleted all of my voicemail, text messages, and emails from the phone.  It still told me it was critically low on storage memory - to the point where I couldn't download my VM, and when I sent out a SMS text message, I got an error saying the was not enough memory to encrypt the message and send it out.  Even better, when I plugged the phone into my computer for activesync to back it up again, the phone din't recognize that I had the latest version of activesync installed (error popped up saying i needed to have version 4.5 or later) and refused to connect.  so i had to backup my contacts the old fashioned way - notebook and pen.  I ended up doing a hard reset on the phone, clearing all of the memory and returning it to factory settings.  UGH!I've still got a few months before my upgrade policy allows me to upgrade, and I am counting the days.  I will tell you for sure that I will not get another Windows-based phone.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super Sleek and Affordable.

At first I wasn't sure if I would get used to the fact that it has a touchscreen key board but it's not a problem at all. I love to use it. Its super sleek and very affordable. Its so fun to mess around with. The only problem would be that it doesn't have as much memory as I would like. But other than that, it is overall a great, stylish, and entertaining phone.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "J.L. Populist", "ReviewID": "R1X8MPT2H63HEC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Of the smartphones that I have owned, the Samsung Omnia II is not a bad choice.That's not saying that there isn't a con or \"drawback\" with the phone.That one con I found so far is the program for syncing the phone with a computer. Active Sync does not work with Windows 7. I couldn't get the newer program for Windows Mobile to install. This isn't a big deal to me personally. I did get lucky enough to transfer a ringtone and a few songs via computer.What I like about the Omnia II:+ Clarity in call reception. I get clear sound and I have been told that my voice is clear on the other end.+ The touch screen. It usually responds very well.+ Navigation. This phone is easy to figure out without a manual. For instance, the center button activates the Main Menu screen.++ Battery talk time. This is a big improvement over the Motorola Droid 2 that I was using!Even surfing the web doesn't drain the battery much. I seldom shut the phone off. It may have better power management or the OEM batteries may be better.+ Wi-fi compatibility.++ Opera web-browser. I prefer and have used Opera for browsing the web on my pc for years. Closing out or exiting web pages with the mobile version is easy also.+ A must for any cell phone I use is that it works on Page Plus and this phone does.+ The keypads. Toggling the different keypads is easy. The suggestive text feature can be annoying on any phone. Shutting that off with this phone is simple.+ Light weight. This phone is surprisingly light.I know that the Samsung Omnia II is not a new phone, but it works well for what I need in a smart phone. I even use the internet more with this phone. Listening to You Tube videos is decent with the phone's speakers.I haven't experienced any lag on the web or dropped calls where I have service.Update: The touch screen has had a few instances where it was not responsive.A restart cleared it. For a comparable price, there are Windows phones that are supported and work better for the internet. The HTC Trophy is one.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "Elisha", "ReviewID": "RT6V4JE0YGV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a magnificent phone dispute all the bad reviews.

But, if you can live with the few flaws, the OS is amazing for customization. With so many hacks and software, Windows Mobile is a great OS to fiddle around with. Would I use Windows Mobile for my day to day device? No, I use Android. However, even Android, cannot provide the sheer amount of freedom that Windows Mobile does.
