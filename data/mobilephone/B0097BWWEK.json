I tried the Galaxy S4 for a couple weeks, wasn't happy the way it handled multiple email accounts, messaging and basic functions which required multiple key presses to accomplish. To add to this, the phone lagged between screens and apps and after reading forums online, I found I wasn't the only one experiencing this. I returned the phone and tried the Blackberry Z10. Their new \"Hub\" feature was nice, however the OS just didn't flow too well with BB's new gesture commands. Navigating through screens was not a pleasant experience. Perhaps with software updates, BB's new OS will come together someday, however, as of now, it's lacking quite a bit, especially in the app space.Unfortunately, in my haste to sell my iPhone 5 immediately after purchasing the S4, I realized I had made a grave mistake. To correct this, I purchased another iPhone 5. After experimenting with the other OS's out there with the exception of the Windows phones, I found that no other phone had everything put together as well as the iOS iPhone 5. iOS flows very well and especially with email which I depend on heavily for corporate as well as personal use. The iPhone excels in many other areas in comparison to other phones such as messaging, web browsing, camera features, music and so much more. People criticize the iPhone so much for the lack of a removal battery, expandable storage, lack of customization options and so much more, however the battery life on the i5 is amazing with wifi, BT and apps running 24/7. As for storage, just opt for a larger capacity. I feel like the prodigal son who just had to see what was out there in the world but in the end, came back home to the iPhone 5. I am not an iSheep or iFanatic in any way, I just like being efficient and getting things done quickly on a dependable and reliable mobile device and the iPhone 5 comes out on top in this regard.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ever!", "Author": "B. paull \"mrtwelvevolts\"", "ReviewID": "R3HYK3NVG68QB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPhone blows away previous models!

I've handled about every phone from the Europe and Asia-only handsets, to the latest and greatest Android models. I recently got the chance to play with the iPhone 5, which is supposed to be Apple's \"ringer\" in a market dominated by uber-displays, super thin and ultralight devices with massive processing power. To be fair, the iPhone is sort of an underdog, but it doesn't seem to mind (and neither do consumers) because it's one of the hottest devices out there.Why? I'm not an Apple fan and I don't typically use Apple products apart from my MacBook Pro, which I can't live without as I use it for my job. I have an Android phone by Samsung and love it. Wouldn't go to iOS, ever, but its hard for me not to like the iPhone. For what it is, it's absolutely stunning.Everything the iPhone 4/s got wrong, they fixed with the iPhone 5. It now supports both GSM and CDMA with quad-band support for both HSPA+ and LTE 700 MHz. It will run on any GSM carrier when it's appropriately unlocked and support LTE, which is also awesome. It does take a \"nano\" SIM, so you'd need to get one for it to work on T-Mobile, which is now letting customers bring their Apple phones over.Hardware-wise it's not too impressive. It has Apple's A6 processor, dual-core 1.2 GHz with 1 GB of RAM. Nothing special. It has a/b/g/n WLAN that can be used as a hotspot, Bluetooth, you name it. You can get it with 8, 16, 32, and 64 GB of fixed internal storage. No, you can't remove the battery either. It's pretty by itself in the construction/materials arena. No handset out there from any maker is built like the iPhone and I say that confidently. It's gorgeous to look at, hold, and feels rock-solid. The entire front of the screen is covered in Gorilla Glass, which is supposed to be strong, and it is. The rest, including the back, is brushed aluminum which looks awesome. Kudos to Apple for switching back to metal for the back an not glass, which cracks easily and is a fingerprint magnet. Even the screws are great looking! Apple put a lot of thought and engineering into this, just like all their other products. Only HTC could hold a candle to the craftsmanship and materials of this phone. The buttons are aluminum and seem very sturdy with solid presses and are tall enough for good tactile feel (no guessing which button you're pressing or groveling for super-short stubby buttons like I've found on some phones). It's very thin, less than 1/4\", compact, and lightweight. The processor might not be the fastest, but it's perfectly adequate. With 1 GB RAM, it seemed to be as snappy as a 1.5 GHz dual-core Galaxy S2.It has a 4-inch LCD display. Apple had been chastised for giving their flagship handset a small'ish screen (when it was introduced in 2007, the iPhone had a huge display) so they made it bigger by .5 inch. It's taller and thinner than the original, which some like and some don't. I don't really like small screens on smartphones and wished Apple had done better. Most all smartphones nowadays have screens over 4 inches. The top-end handsets are around 4.5 (Samsung's Galaxy S3 is 4.8, the Note 5.3, and Note 2 is 5.5). Why Apple didn't stretch it is beyond me. However it's still awesome. The resolution of the \"Retina\" LCD IPS TFT touchscreen display is 1136x640 with very high (326) pixels per inch. Colors are fantastic and images and graphics and text are sharp. I haven't come across a display this nice out of any handset I've seen.The camera is equally impressive. The 8-megapixel iSight camera is probably one of the best cameras out there now in terms of all-around performance. Samsung, HTC, and LG's cameras are great, I'd say Samsung's cameras are some of the best, but there's no question the iSight device is stunning. Tons of features, adjustable shooting settings, white balance, there's digital zoom, scene modes, panorama mode, face-detection, GPS and geo-tagging, you name it. It shoots 1080i HD video too. Pictures and videos are amazingly detailed and come out great. It has everything a mobile camera should, including shooting performance. The shutter lag is near zero, and follow-up shots are fast, done is less than a second. Only the Galaxy S3 and HTC One X do as good in my experience.iOS 5 has a lot to offer. I didn't get a chance to extensively test it, but from using the previous iOS's, I can say it's been improved quite a bit, faster, more stable and user-friendly. The interface is a little different, but still good. The menus and functions are well laid-out and easy to access and customize. Setting things up like email, iCal, is easy. Browsing is great too. It does get a little cluttered on that small display though. Overall I was satisfied with it. An iOS faithful switching to Android wouldn't have much trouble in the changeover as the two aren't too dissimilar, and for those who think it would be a nightmare to move from iTunes and iPhoto, or having to move their contacts will be happily surprised as there are apps and tools that make it relatively easy to move to Android. Furthermore, I think the newest Android 4.1 is the number one mobile OS. Period. Infinetely customizable with different ROM's, it's a techie's delight. You aren't on lockdown like with iOS, which is why I prefer Android.The audio quality is fantastic with headphones and the speaker is nice too. Typical Apple stuff here. Calls are nice and clear and the speaker phone sounds good too. Not super loud, but good enough for a crowded room or on a bus. Data speed can be very quick if you can get LTE. I've seen LTE speeds of 26 MB/s up and 19 down. HSPA+ achieved around 13-15 and 6-7.I do want to say this about Siri...it's awesome. Samsung tried to emulate it with S-Voice, but it's not as good. Siri isn't a novelty, it's a very useful tool.With that said, if given the choice, would I buy an iPhone 5? The short answer is no because I can get a handset with better features for cheaper. The iPhone holds its own, but it's nowhere near a phone like the Galaxy S3 or Note 2. There might not be too many things not to like about the iPhone, but they are significant and important enough to keep me away. The display, though bigger, is still too small. You still can't remove the battery. There's no expandable storage either. No Google stuff. You can add another 64 GB to the Galaxy S3 and Note 2, which would be great for someone who loves to watch high-definition movies on their phone or who has thousands of MP3's and photos. Both devices' large screens lend themselves to multimedia.Pros:Fantastic build quality and materialsThin and light, but hefty in the handGorgeous displayGreat cameraTons of featuresUp to 64 GB of internal storageSnappy performanceCon's:Display too smallOnly 1 GB of RAMNo expandable storageCan't remove the batteryLimited customizations for iOSIn conclusion, Apple did a lot of things right and fixed a lot of the things wrong with the iPhone 4/s, but it's still not enough to sway me from Android. You get bigger, better, faster phones with lots of available customizations and support for apps. Plus, they're cheaper! Those things to me are enough to keep me an Android faithful. Otherwise, this is an outstanding handset that will give you more than enough functionality, performance, and useability.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "sold as new but really one and a half years old.", "Author": "James E.", "ReviewID": "R1W29Z54OAYBQI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sold as new by Cali Wholesale but when the phone arrived not working, I took it to the apple store and the phone was almost two years old.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Kado", "ReviewID": "R17VAI87PBKKT0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Seller did not let me return the phone, and after about a month I bought it, the phone literally died and the batter is dead, forever.

After testing this one out in stores, and seeing the bonus of having an extra row of apps on the home screen, I went ahead and used my upgrade to switch to the 5.I still use the iPhone 4 on a regular basis, so I easily can tell what's missing and what's new. With the release of iOS 7, using both phones is much better, and, mostly, all functionality is the same.There is, of course, Siri, who was introduced in the 4S. Beyond the second day of owning the iPhone 5, however, I've never used her other than for kicks and giggles. My 1-year-old daughter uses Siri more, and only so by accidentally holding the home button down when she manages to find my device.The front camera on the 5 is about the same quality as the 4's rear camera, and, oddly, I don't notice much a difference in photo quality in either of the 5's cameras. Video quality, the rear is superior, but only just so in certain lightings.I notice no justifiable difference in the new Lightning connector regarding the speed of charging, so I don't know why Apple decided to change it and render all those neat accessories defunct. A mystery to me, but I have a battery pack case so I use a micro-USB charger anyway.It may be that my iPhone 4 is old now, but the iPhone 5 is a LOT faster. It's degraded some in the past year, but there's still a considerable amount of speed when loading apps and prompting the keyboard. And, because of the new operating system and landscape view, apps work much more smoothly.Speaking of the landscape view, there's little to no black borders when viewing widescreen videos, so there's much more room and a bigger view. Which was the big reason Apple seemed to transition to a taller phone anyway.I prefer the extended 5 for games, too, as there's much more screen to view the action, and I've grown accustomed to the tall design by now, though the 4 still sits better in my small hands.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Stuff!!!", "Author": "Jay Clark \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R1BKQMFJQPWJIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone arrived quickly and in better shape than they reported.One has to be skeptical for tech devices, but I felt very comfortable after receiving the product and would definitely order from them again.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Iphone 5 Review", "Author": "ldyunique", "ReviewID": "R1LPALVELTDNOP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Best Phone i've ever carried i use it too much my battery life sucks i need a 2nd charger for this phone one to keep at home and one in the purse that goes along with me every where my phone lasts about 8hrs before i have to charge it again.

I don't know how many people were fooled like me by AT&T;, but don't be the next!", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its the IPHONE 4S with larger screen and beefy power", "Author": "MekoRush", "ReviewID": "RN7LK0RXIH87B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll make this short, this is just like the iphone 4s just a larger screen and more power. Yeah you have your different speakers but i didn't notice any major difference in sound. It chargers maybe 45mins quicker than the 4S. It feels light and you just have that urge to put a case on it to add a lil bulkyness to get a better grip if you have big hands because it's so easy to drop the thing since it's light. If you're driving you'll forget its in your laptop sometimes and step out the car BOOM! it drops on the concrete, and oh it doesn't do well when it comes to drops like you can see pretty much every drop that the phone has had if it's in different areas of the phone. Other than that it's somewhat durable it can handle about 10 major drops before the screen starts cracking. I used this on ATT's network(straight talk) so i didn't get the full speeds most users get. I went from the 4s to this and I didn't feel like I had a new phone other than the new look. That's why I only pointed out the 2 obvious which is a bigger screen and faster processor. a 4 out of 5", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "i NEED HELP TO RETURN IT .", "Author": "Doan H.
