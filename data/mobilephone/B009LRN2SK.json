I'll have more after I get to use it a little.The shipping and receiving were of course flawless Amazon.The phone and accessories were well packaged and no damage.  I still find it hard to believe how hard plastic can be to break into though.Setup was .........mmmmm ...........not so good but came out all right.  Followed the instructions very very very carefully to do it online but when it came to the last set of numbers I had a blank screen.  So it was off to customer service which I knew from the past would be a headache.As usual the phone connection to tracfone was poor.  I had difficulty understanding her.  She had just as much difficulty understanding me.  BUT we persevered and SUCCESS.  My old number and my time and minutes were transferred to my new phone.Ring tone was set.  Lock time set.  First addition to phone book.  Everything I wanted to do was done with a minimum of effort.  However it was done intuitively because directions were scanty at best.  There is an online tutorial but I had the phone set up before I read it.So ... big buttons, big screen display, loud ring, lock out button ... for a fumble fingered, hard of hearing, sixty six year old man, I think I am going to like this phone.UPDATE 12/29 I have had this for about a week now and am totally satisfied with it.  Does what I want it to do with minimum fuss...that is make calls, receieve calls with no dropping of signal...clear reception and hearing...keypad locked so no unintential dialing...easy menu...the only problem I had when I turned it off in church not knowing it plays a jingle when it closes...so now if I forget I will use menu to go to \"silent\" mode...not that big a deal but more steps than just power off.  So I thought I was going to like and \"I DO!\"I had my old motorola flip phone for four years.  Hope I get four years out of this one.  I will keep you posted.UPDATE 5/25/13Just ordered one of these for my Dad.  88 years old and some hearing problems but we think this might be a good \"emergency\" phone.So far mine has done exactly what I want it to do.  We were in western OK this week and my phone was functional.  My wife's ... no signal!!!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW IS IT EVER NICE!!", "Author": "Ben R.

I have always bought pretty basic phones as I didn't have a desire or need for all the bells and whistles. The display window and numbers are big and bright. The \"manual\" that comes with the phone is pretty sad, and the info on the website isn't much better. But I managed to figure it out and set the phone up to my liking.  If you have trouble setting it up, find a 10 year old kid, seriously. They have an uncanny ability with these things. They will do it in 10 minutes. I set my ringtone to \"old ring\", so for me, there's no guessing whose phone is ringing, because no one I know has their phone actually \"ring\", as phones used to 30 plus years ago. The sound quality is very good, on the phone and in speakerphone mode.Some other pluses. Double minutes on airtime cards (don't buy a double minute card, the phone will automatically double whatever standard card that you buy). The phone has a good feel in your hand, and fits comfortably in a shirt pocket. I like the FM radio and I use it when cutting the grass or doing other chores around the house. By the way, there is a headphone/earbud jack on the side about 1/4 inch above the volume control (No mention of this in the \"manual\"). I plugged in my jvc earbuds and the sound is in full stereo and is excellent. Radio stations can be preset so a 1 key push will change to your favorites. If you text, It deducts .30 of a minute per text. More in .30 minute increments, if it's a very long message.Somewhere in the comments I read someone said that the radio will use up your minutes, but it does not.  Another useful feature I found (again not mentioned in the \"manual\") is the ability to attach a wrist strap/lanyard to the phone(the type that come with cameras).  About 1 inch above the volume control, there is a small hole right at the top curve. Pry off the back of the phone and you'll see a plastic peg inside where the hole is. Slip the strap over peg, snap the back on and you're set.Now the cons in my opinion;  #1-No jack for a headset or bluetooth capability.  #2-The very miserly, pathetic manual/instructions.  #3-You must enter a menu to change modes from ring, vibrate, and silent (airplane mode). With my old Motorola, as you decreased the volume, the next to the lowest setting put it in vibrate mode, and the lowest setting put it in silent mode. In my opinion, a much easier and sensible setup.All said, this is still the overall best cell phone I've had. I'm very pleased and I highly recommend it.  _____________________________________________________________________________________  Thanks for reading. I hope someone finds my review helpful in making a buying decision._____________________________________________________________________________________  ******UPDATE 12/12/13- A lot of people have asked if this phone has a cover over the keys, which it does not. There is a new version of this phone called \"The Big Easy Flip\", model # 392G. The keypad is the same, but the screen is a lot bigger, and it has 3G/WiFi, a 2 mp camera, bluetooth, mobile web access, FM radio, MP3 player, micro SD card, external caller ID and time window, and more. On Amazon it is $19.99. The link is below for anyone interested.  This one looks like a welcome improvement to an already great phone, even if you don't need all the other extra features.  ---> Alcatel 392G \"The Big Easy Flip\" Prepaid Phone With Double Minutes (Tracfone)********************************************************************", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needs a comprehensive manual", "Author": "John D.

Tones are loud and clear, a benefit to those of us that do not hear as well.  The keypad lock is a good thing.  My biggest gripe is the lack of availability of a comprehensive manual to guide and explain through the various set-up and use steps.  This is especially true for the Security part, i.e., password, PIN's, etc.  The available manuals and instructions are sketchy and not very well detailed.  In a call to TracFone's technical people, I was told that it would take a few days for all the in-phone data to be installed.

Also, with other Tracfones, you can't get receptions in certain locations such as National Parks, as I learned first hand in Yosemite and in Yellowstone last week.

What I was told was basically they do use the major carriers newtwork, (Verizon, At&T;, Sprint etc.) HOWEVER the networks can detect these signals and filter them or somehow prioritize them to use sub frequencies or more compression.  So yes, they do use the major networks, but don't have the same priority or signal quality.For occational use, this phone is perfect.

Phone cradle for counter top.  It is always charged.4. It comes with a car charger.  Some extra \"insurance\" against low battery for the car (just in case), at no extra charge.5. Nice feel to keys.6. It was only $20 on Amazon - great value for your money.Some nice extras:7. The built in FM radio gets excellent reception and seems to have no impact on battery life, and automatically pauses for incoming calls. I never thought I would like this, but have used it a fair amount. It has a built in scan function and it automatically enters all stations it finds in numbered presets, so you can easily change channels. It is sort of like a car radio.8. Built in LED flashlight.9. Built in calculator that works well.Ability to lock the keypad so you do not accidentally dial from your pocket.10. An alarm clock feature that is very easy to use.  Have an upcoming appointment, quickly set an alarm. Again, like the radio, I never thought I would use something like this but find myself periodically using it.11. Built in calendar and stored notes.

It's missing blue tooth so while answering it in the car isn't illegal just I'd prefer an earbud. Easy to see, dial and program..Inexpensive. Met most of my criteria.Update: Has some strange software actions when ending a call. The calls ends fine, but if you have dialed using the address book it then returns to the place you left off in the address book with the keypad unlocked. The keypad will then not automatically re-lock and the display may not dim, leaving you open to random dialing and dead batteries. It is necessary to either back out of the address book or push and hold the lock button for the phone to lock the keypad again. Not a huge deal once you're aware of the idiosyncrasy, frustrating when you're not. I'd still buy it.Another Update: 02/2014 Well I quit using this phone as most of the numbers programmed got deleted. With the belt case I bought the unlock button would get pressed by the case. Just a simple soft case on my belt. Hence most of the phone numbers ended up being deleted by bumping or other pressure.

Buttons are bug enough to see without glasses.SO-So:  FM Radio.  Already have in cars.  If did not, maybe could use or hook up to speaker system.  But not really a function I want/need.Cons:  1.  My biggest gripe with TracFone is that your Phone ONLY RINGS four (4) times and then goes to voice mail.  That is not enough rings for me if driving, or if the phone is put away.  My wife can never get to the phone in her purse in 4 rings.  Customer NO Service is no help, they say that is all the rings that the phones have available.  2.  No Camera.  A giant step backwards  3.  Finding features like ringtones and other settings features in NOT intuitive.  You really need to read the instructions and keep them handy.  Get the e-manual if you really want to be able to understand this phone.Overall a really nice phone if you are NOT looking for a lot of bells and whistles.  Plane Jane that does the job.

Never had problems until now. Recently the service they provide is garbage.  Other companies are possibly hacking into their services.  Their own managers and analyzers do not know what going on.  Any phone that you hook up with them with randomly be deactivated and you'll spend hours being on hold to get it hooked back up.  It happened every day for 2 weeks.  Many others are having the same problem.  Do not purchase tracfone!!!!!!!  Think about it, I myself just lost three job interviews cause I can't get my number back.
