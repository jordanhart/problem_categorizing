It's less than 1/2 the cost of similar phones. A very basic AT&T; phone, which has no querty keyboard and doesn't play music and has no micro sd slot, cost the same price... this is a no brainer. I have loaded tons of music and movies on my micro sd card and it plays them beautifully. A pretty decent volume for a cell phone. It has a nice volume on calls and texts easily. I'm not really a smart phone user. Just use it for calls and texting as well as listening to music and watching movies. It works vey well for those purposes. The $30 paylo plan of 1500 calls and 1500 texts more than covers my needs at a low cost. The battery life is also impressive. It's a bit thick and clunky in size, but at this price, who cares. I've had it for several months and no problems to date. IMHO, it's a decent phone with some nice features for a low cost:)", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best Paylo Virgin Mobile Phone currently offered, BUT ...", "Author": "JW", "ReviewID": "R3BL6NQXCDNRDE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At the time of this review, Virgin Mobile only offers four phones that works for their Paylo service, and the Samsung M575 is the best of those offered.However, be aware - With this phone you have both the good and the bad.The Good:1) Contacts are easy to set up.2) It can be set up to accept navigation voice commands. I.E. Go to messages.3) It takes good pictures and decent video.4. The sound is loud enough for people (like myself) with limited hearing loss to clearly hear the person calling you.5) Good sound quality - no static, etc.6) The phone has a few features - Internet, Alarm, calculator, a couple of built in games, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.7) You can block phone numbers from calling or texting you.The Bad:1) You cannot assign a name to an Alarm. IE. Quiting Time, Wake UP call, etc.2) There is no stop watch - as mentioned above.3) You are required to get all ringtones, apps, etc. from the Virgin Mobile Store.4) Most Ringtones/Ringback tones cost $2.50 a piece - with adds up quickly.5) There are extremely few apps available at Virgin's Mobile store.6) Virgin Mobile will charge your data plan if you visit their store from your phone, or download a purchase.7) There are no built-in photo editing features.8) I've read other reviews that complaint that the phone can easily be damaged if you drop it.9) The keys on the pull out keyboard are very small - thus texting with it is quite difficult.10) While you can receive photos via bluetooth from Windows 7 - You will not be able to send photos via bluetooth to an Windows 7 64 bit operating system. According to Samsung support - this phone is not compatible with 64 bit operating systems.11) I also have not been able to send photos via bluetooth to my android 2.3 tablet.At the moment, this is the best phone available for Virgin Mobile's Paylo service. However, compared to other prepaid phones I've owned, it definitely could use some major improving.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "nikya2000", "ReviewID": "R3S6COJOCCNNZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only reason I gave this product a 4 star rating was because the letters on the keyboard low and are hard to push.

We're rarely ever apart now, so it made no sense to pay a monthly premium for 2 smartphones.  Plus, we have a Toshiba Thrive tablet, and don't need multiple devices that all do similar tasks.  But just in case, we also got a cheapo LG Flair flip phone for 5 bucks at Target, and between the 2, we had all the cell phones we need.In this year since our switch to no-contract, we have seen virtually no difference in service or coverage area with our no contract phones.  They work great.  The only difference we see is to our wallets.  So this year, we decided to take advantage of the holiday sales at Virgin and upgrade our flip phone to this Samsung M575 (aka - Samsung Restore.)  My hubby wanted something that was easier to text with, and that could check emails if need be in a pinch.  So this M575 fit the bill perfectly.  It's really a well made phone, solidly built and looks really sharp.  It's also light, yet still weighty enough to feel really nice in the paw.  The slide-out qwerty is smooth and snaps into place nicely.  The keyboard is very tactile and responsive. After having only virtual keyboards on our touch devices, we forgot how much we like a good tactile keyboard with crisp buttons.  You can text waaaaaaay faster than on a touch screen.Make no mistake, this is not some repackaged 10 year old phone.  It's based off of older phones we're all familiar with, but this is a 2012 updated version, and it's really sweet.  Menus are quick and responsive.  It boots up and shuts down in a blink, and the battery lasts for daaaaaays, literally -- all of which is essential if this is to be a true emergency phone.  Call quality is excellent.  Stock ringtones are really nice.  And best of all -- you can set the ringer to SILENT for all calls, yet still have assigned personal rings remain active for the people you truly want to hear from! (Like my hubby, while ignoring everyone else!)  Perfect!!We really love this phone.  It's a good 2nd phone to have on hand for us, and it barely costs 80 a year to use it.  That includes everything, talk text and even limited web, from time to time.  It's not our main go-to phone, but for a 2nd emergency/convenience backup, this will more than do the job.For what it is, this is a 5 star phone.  Alexander Graham Bell would be in awe of how his invention has evolved.  Love it!", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "clunky and takes some getting used to, but content overall", "Author": "nelhig", "ReviewID": "R2AI9DN1ISA9DQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I desperately wanted to leave Verizon because I felt for the $, they are a rip off. I wanted to switch to a basic prepaid plan which I felt would be far more economical. Virgin Mobile has what I was looking for w/the 1500 minutes and 1500 texts plan for $32.67 (incl tax). Service is good for the most part, but always advisable to check with people who already have Sprint in your area to make sure. I find when the VM map says \"good\", it could be marginal.This Samsung M575 phone is truly one of the best of the basic phones I found from all the cell phone companies combined. They're all pushing smart phones which I just don't need. I've had the M575 for a month and it has taken some getting used to. It feels stout and durable though, not a cheap feel, esp with a thin case. My voice sounds just a bit tinnier to others, but from my end, I hear everyone well, esp on speaker which works great. Screen is a nice size for this type of phone. Once I got used to where and what the keys do, even highlighting some with a red marker to remind myself, texting has been fine. The text type is small though, and for the visually impaired that could be a problem. The keys are also a bit flat and take more finger pressure than nail pressure at times. Shortcuts are good once I figured out where they are. My biggest complaint is when I get a new text message, I can't scroll back to previous texts from that sender. I have to get out of that text and go to \"messaging\" to see what the past texts said. Battery life seems adequate, though once the phone hits 2 bars, it goes down fast. Recharging seems quick enough. I like the selection of ringtones. Camera is ok, but no zooming in. Don't buy this phone for the camera.If you want a basic phone that works reasonably well on a prepaid plan and is affordable, then I recommend going with this phone and VM. I'll save $25 a month having switched from Verizon, and I get triple the minutes and texts. That to me is well worth going with this phone and VM!", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone For The Money!", "Author": "William Serocki", "ReviewID": "R10X0Y6MXRXWXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great upgrade for those of us that have an Obama phone.

At first I thought the phone was great but after receiving it, I was kind of disappointed. I bought this phone with the GPS in mind which it clearly advertises as one of the features, but then I found out that I can't use it unless I pay 5.00 extra dollars a month or 1.00 a day. That just kind of turned me off, because now it is just a phone like the rest. I want to send it back and have been debating on that. I would like to have a phone with GPS that I don't have to pay extra for by the month. I don't think it is fair that you buy a phone and it has the features on it but you have to pay more to use it. If it does not come with it and you add it, I can understand that, but that is not the case here, it is on here and clearly you can use it, but apparently Virgin Mobile blocks it so that you can't.

It feels and looks nice, and I like the keys. But it wasn't very long before I realized why nobody likes it.

Once, as I was sitting there, my phone alerted me that I had a voicemail; the phone call had been made one minute earlier without a single ring. I've never experienced this with other phones, nor have friends visiting experienced this at all. Plus, last night, I could not get the alarm to turn off!

Upon getting Virgin svs for it, PayLo requires..we went blind trying to read browser box and use internet the way she wanted, she's 70.  I was very disappointed.  The phone is made slightly more cheaply too than other Samsung sliders for text and data.  The M575 was reported to have some faster specs and a bit longer battery.  I slapped a nice silicone skin on it and it is a nice phone.  If using it for Data however, consider going to a Smartphone at Metro PCS on the cheap because its only $40 for all and a much better exp, I got her an LG Motion on promo sale and the screen, size of text and a real internet experience which she wanted for Facebook and her internet searching.
