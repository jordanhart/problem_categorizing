{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A smart phone that has WiFi, and no data plan required!", "Author": "TVR", "ReviewID": "R3MP3Z6LC447J5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone specifically because it was one of the last \"Smart\" phones that came out before Verizon started requiring data plans on all smart phones. I just can't bring myself to pay $30/month for a data package when there is free wifi practically everwhere I go. As with all smartphones, it has it's quirks (hence the 4 star rating), but rebooting it once a week or so usually resolves any issues.I really like the slider keyboard. The buttons have a good feel to them and result in much less texting errors than a touch screen keyboard. I didn't think I would ever use the dialer buttons on the front, but I've found that I actually do use them quite a bit. Whenever I have to make a call to a number that is not in my contacts list, the buttons on the front are much easier to dial with than dialing on the touch screen.I also like that it comes with a stylus that conceals itself within the phone. Most of the things I do on the touch screen can be done with my fingertips, but sometimes the stylus comes in handy. I didn't really like the standard Windows Mobile user interface, so I installed SPB Mobile Shell, which makes this touch screen much more finger friendly. I also installed ThumbCal, which is a calendar app that is much better than the standard calendar. This phone can also open Word and Excel files, which I don't use very often, but the functionality is nice to have on board. I have the extended battery, and it will last for a full day, but if I do a lot of web surfing in a day then the battery will start to run out around 6 or 7pm. That's why I have a couple of spare batteries that I keep charged up, which I recommend.I know the days of smart phones without data plans are over, so I bought two of these so I can have another one when this one wears out. If you want a phone that has smart phone functionality, but not the smart phone monthly bill, definitely go with this one. You'll be glad you did, and you can take that $360/year you'll save and do something useful with it.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone.

The internet is quick and internet explorer loads pages very well. The stylus is accurate and easy to use. The greatest feature of the entire phone is the WiFi. If you decide you don't want to pay for a data plan, there is WiFi available almost everywhere and it is extremely useful. The contact management software, the Microsoft Office Mobile software, and the various other tools are extremely useful.

If you want a more expensive phone all you have to do is pay!I wonder why someone would spend so much time giving such a low report as some have done?  Suspicious!  But anyway, It is an older phone that gives you a lot of perks for a little money!Be sure and keep your programming up to date and you won't have some of the problems others have.  Buy an extra battery for $17 - $25 and you will not use them both up in a day...

Hung", "ReviewID": "RLZ180P7U9B9Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update 9/24/09: I had been actively searching for a replacement for my SCH-i760 since writing this review, and was recently offered a Blackberry through work.  It is a simple Curve 8310, but it is tried and true, and I have found it in all ways superior to the Samsung.In comparison to my 5 points below, the Curve 8310:1. Was even easier to get setup with email than the Samsung - no entering in POP3 information or guessing how to format your \"username\" for each account2. Came pre-loaded with Documents To Go3. Ran fully functional on the pre-charged battery at ~30% for 2 days, including battery-intensive activities like intial setup, emails, and some media playing.  A full charge has lasted me 5 days under similar use.4. Has the Edge network through AT&T; and it is quick, but pages do not appear as nicely as they did on the Windows-based browser on the Samsung.  Otherwise, coverage has been excellent wherever I have travelled so far, even in places where the Samsung struggled5. Has been rock solid reliable, with a host of handy pre-loaded apps that do more than enough for me.  I have not had to do any hard or soft resets, no software updates, no mysterious auto-shutdowns, no lockups, no laggy input response, no inability to answer and hang up calls, no quirky software behavior, no frustrations because there's no gimmicks with this phone.***********************************************************************************The SCH-i760 has been my first smart-phone, and it is for company use, which means the big needs were:1. easy acccess to email,2. ability to view and make simple edits to documents and spreadsheets,3. battery life when travelling on the road,4. solid wireless network for accessing the web around the country,5. reliability.5 points, 5 stars.  After almost two years of use, I have found the phone can only do the first two well, and none of the latter.So first, the Good:1. Email was easy enough to setup, and if worst comes to worst your IT person/people can handle that for you.  Emails can get pushed from your companies Exchange server just like on a desktop, and you can set up a few other (not sure the limit) other email accounts like Hotmail or other personal accounts and easily select between them to check all your accounts at once.  Attachments are easy to attach and download.2.  It is of course Windows-based, and initially I was torn between Windows and Blackberry OS but went with Windows because at the time, Blackberries did not have the ability to edit MS Office docs, which was crucial to me.  Now, apparently they do.  But in any case, the phone handles Excel spreadsheets about as well as you can expect, but powerpoint presentations are pretty slow to load and view.The Bad:3. Second only to Reliability, the battery life is, plain and simple, horrendous. While the phone has provisions for bluetooth and Wifi, the only connection I need is wireless broadband access so neither one is ever active.  I set screen brightness to the minimum setting, it auto-powers off the screen when I'm on a call after 10 seconds, the screen dims automatically after a few seconds of non-use, and the screen is set to turn completely off after 30 seconds of non-use.  In a typical day at the office where the phone is mostly dormant, I will go from a full charge on the standard battery when I wake up to hearing the low-battery warning light by the time I get home - approximately 9-12 hours depending on how bad my day is.  That is almost no phone use, no emailing, no web browsing, no vibrating ringer, no BT or Wifi, no games, no nothing - just the phone sitting there.  Taking it out on the road is risky, because the battery drains so quickly you can easily empty it by the time the evening rolls around.  I have never had the standard battery last more than 36 hours, no matter how lightly I used it in that period.  The extended battery (included in the purchase) fairs slightly better, but it will not last 48 hours with regular use, guaranteed.  Frustrating, disappointing, pathetic is how I'd describe the phone's battery life.4. Perhaps it's Verizon, or maybe it's Chicago, but the phone has a great amount of trouble getting a solid signal.  Firmware has been updated, tower's get updated regularly, and 1-2 bars is pretty much the average for this phone.  Travelling, it does well the few times I'm in San Francisco and NY, but it still hits \"dead spots\" pretty frequently, so I feel like it's a phone issue.  Dropped calls are rare but call quality is never what I'd call clear, there seems to be a slight delay in conversation on the receiving end.  In terms of wireless broadband, when I get a decent connection it's never what I'd call \"blazingly fast\".  Maybe it's my first experience with a smartphone, but I'm underwhelmed when browsing the internet with this phone.  And decent connections are few and far between.5. Reliability - this phone's biggest downfall.  Is it Samsung?  Is it Mobile Windows?  Or a terrible combination of the two?  Whatever the reason, the phone has proven to be incredibly unreliable and unstable.  The most persistent issue (after the firmware update) is it's tendency to power off completely, on it's own.  You will miss countless calls before you think to use it to make your own call.  I do not have any third party software installed save for Google Maps, which itself runs fine.  As a basic phone, the Samsung fails.  In addition to the call quality and reception issues stated above, there's also many times when it quite simply cannot make a call, citing a connection issue (and it beep-beep-beeps to let you know there's an error), or it just \"hangs\" during the dialing period.  Inputting phone numbers is often-times tedious because there can be a one-second delay or more between when you press the number and when it registers in the phone.The Samsung is exceedingly frustrating to use as a smartphone.  Of course, a smartphone will never take the place of a dedicated phone and laptop and it is not meant to, but the Samsung makes a very strong case for this route.  I've tried very hard to like this phone, because it's been an expensive investment for me, but I'm fed up with the unreliability, poor battery life and general lack of ability to deliver on what it promises.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "no probs", "Author": "sooner", "ReviewID": "R1EPFHMEOK770T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the phone came fast and worked as described.

The seller was great; the phone was not. As I read the reviews, I thought that this would be a phone that I could use as a basic phone. However, Verizon would not activate it as a basic phone, but a smartphone. Strike one. After I had it activated, it took 2 hours for Verizon to put my contacts on it throught bluetooth. Strike two. When I got home, the phone would not let me send picture messages or on the internet. Strike 3. After I recieved help for the picture message and had to reset the phone, the contacts were eliminated and I could not get them back on it. Strike 4. After this, I manually put contacts in, but the phone would not let me make calls, texts, or be on the internet. The phone kept on telling me that the battery was low, even though I had 6 fully charged batteries. Luckily, the phone did have an extended warrenty that allowed me to get a better smartphone. The phone does not like internet, wifi, or bluetooth. It works best with features found on a basic phone instead of a smartphone. Also, the phone is like a brick and is very bulky. The phone's manual is 2008, but the phone itself is a 2007-2008 model.It was a huge mistake getting this phone.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sorry... it's junk.", "Author": "Kelley Welu", "ReviewID": "R3GMDRX4JEBCSX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this one when my contract was up.  It worked well for the first month then the touch screen went wacko.  I had to tap in area's where I didn't want to tap in order for it to recgonize where I actually wanted it to tap.  The phone did have an option to recalculate the touch screen but it stopped working as well.  It would just recalculate, recalculate, and recalulate until eventually I just took the battery out and restarted it.  Not to mention the numerous times a day the phone would freeze up on me resulting in taking the battery out again or pushing the reset button.  The black paint around the qwerty keyboard also peeled like crazy so you would have black bits and pieces all over your fingers after use.  I called my provider and they replaced the phone for me as I was still under warranty and the second one still did the exact samme things.  I ended up throwing the phone a way and used a previous phone the LG Chocolate which I never had a problem with.  That phone lasted me 5 years.  These 2 Samsung phones together lasted me only months.
