{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not quite perfect, but the best phone for the money I know of right now.", "Author": "Daniel Grant", "ReviewID": "R3DSNUBWOJ5F4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With a few reservations, this is a great phone, and it is by far the most phone available for the money as of the date on this review. Since I have the most worthless cable company in the known universe, I depend on my cell phone for all of my internet access, so its only slightly less important to me than food, water, and shelter. While the Atrix HD isn't perfect, its good enough that I would still highly recommend it.The good:- Screen quality is outstanding- Great call quality, reception, sound quality.- It works great as a mobile hotspot (between the LTE availability and the great tethering signal, its basically indistinguishable from real wifi, at least in a 1 bedroom apartment)-On paper, the phone could stand to have a bit more RAM (it's got 1 gig which is half what the Galaxy SIII has) but in practice I could tell almost no difference between the speed and responsiveness of the 2 devices. For everyday internet access it's almost like you don't need a computer at all (though typing a review like this without a real keyboard would of course be a painful experience). It's tablet-fast almost pc-fast.-Like my old first generation Atrix, the phone is quite durable (esp the glass covering the screen), which is good for me, I'm very tough on phones.-Note on using your phone to provide internet access on your computer btw: on AT&T; you CANNOT use your phone as a tethered modem either through USB OR wirelessly unless you buy THEIR MOST EXPENSIVE 5GB PER MONTH DATA PLAN. This is no problem for me as I easily exceed that limit anyway, but this could make life miserable for the rest of you out there, and I already see one other reviewer seems to have a beef with the seller about this.So are there any negatives to this phone? I can think of a few.-Even as of my review date, this isn't quite the absolute state of the art anymore.-As previously noted it has half the RAM of the Galaxy SIII (which its roughly contemporary with), though I've owned and used both and do not seem to notice much if any difference in terms of speed and responsiveness.-The battery itself could be a bit better. It's only a little worse than the SIII though, and much better than the SIII mini (a complete piece of crap that has nothing in common with the real SIII but the name, OS, and manufacturer but that's another review.)- The battery is also not user replaceable. This is potentially quite annoying, but to me its not $300 worth of annoying, and its main rival on AT&T; networks (Galaxy SIII) is still a $500+ proposition unlocked.-This version only comes with 8GB of onboard storage. Since I've already had a 32 gb micro SD card in my phone for the past year, this was a non-issue for me. Generally speaking, its cheaper to add your own SD storage than pay for phones with more storage, but I'm sure 8GB of onboard storage could still be a dealbreaker for some people.-Moto's version of android is a bit quirky compared to Samsung. The lack of a physical button to scroll between and close active apps is a little odd imo, as is the lack of a pulldown menu for frequently changed settings, but you get used to stuff like that after a few days.For me personally, the positives strongly outweigh the negatives, and I'm very happy with my Atrix HD. I just wish I'd been smart enough to replace my broken SIII with one instead of ordering the SIII mini back in April. That's $350 and 5 months of my life I'm never getting back. I'd highly recommend the Atrix HD to anyone who can live with the short list of reservations I listed here. I can't name another phone that will do so much so well for this price.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "carlos martinez", "ReviewID": "R2TUNGI7FPF010", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was in great condition and is working very well couldn't be happier great phone would recommend to others great price too", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just like they said", "Author": "Wishin", "ReviewID": "RC3QC09SRY8UO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything was just like they said.

I love technology and this phone has it and some.The SMARTACTIONS are brilliant. I set it for different situations for the kids (sleep, school, bed) which turns off/on the phone at set times, sends messages to callers/texts that they are either busy or sleeping. My husband loves that it overrides the school setting so that important callers (him/me) can RING through even though the phone is set to silent.Brilliant HD pictures/video. Have you ever tried to take a picture of your kids science experiment of stalactites? Amazing close ups had to be taken as the experiment was actually very slow to take off. However, with the INCREDIBLY SHARP close-ups, the experiment looked like a huge success!What on earth are people talking about in regards to the lack of battery charge or replacing the battery?? This phone DEFINITELY HOLDS A CHARGE considering ours are loaded with Apps (GPS, tons of games by the kids, maps, data searches, etc.). Explain to me how the kids can use all these apps AND TEXT OVER 50 messages per day on the plan (that's in addition to Instagram, etc.) AND STILL HAVE BATTERY TO SPARE???  In regards to replacing the battery, THE BATTERY IS NOT MEANT TO BE REPLACED (its sealed in). So, yes, you will have to tear apart the phone if you've done something horrific to the battery.We have dropped these phones (we have four of them), taken them too close to the pool where they get wet and had NO PROBLEMS.  Gorilla Glass, Kevlar casing and a bit of waterproofing. GO FIGURE!!We actually have the original version, the Atrix 4G, which is in superb condition and which my husband will not be pried free from. The ATRIX HD is an upgrade that has better software and has a SUPERB HD SCREEN (download the free live ocean screen saver and watch as people ogle at how there is no distortion when the waves move).In closing, I have to say that the negative comments I have read are UNFOUNDED. This is an excellent phone made by a company whose CORE BUSINESS is the making of communication devices for longer than I can remember. That's another fact you should take into consideration. I certainly did and am very happy with my family's purchasing decision.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Alejandra L.", "ReviewID": "ROWAIK91I9KU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recommended!

I inserted the AT&T; SIM from the 920 into the MB886 and it cranked right up.I like Jelly Bean.  It is my first Android experience.  However, it's not as flashy as Live Tiles.  The MB886 screen is large and clear and the phone is light compared to the 920.The MB886 uses allot of battery.  I must recharge at night with maybe three calls and three texts a day with Wi-Fi, GPS, and data turned on.  This is with Green Power Free installed, which probably boosted battery life about 25%.I like that Play Store does not require a credit card free downloads, unlike ITunes.  The Microsoft app store has slim pickings, which isn't too fun.The only reservation about the MB886 is that it sometimes seems to lag or is unresponsive.

The form factor feels like a 5 inch screen not a 4.5 one. The sim and microsd card slot cover is kind of flimsy and loose and just doesn't seat well so it protrudes slightly. The phone just doesn't scream high quality build. For the price, however, its not half bad as a spare emergency phone, as was the case for me while I waited for my Nexus 5 to arrive. This phone is supposed to get Android 4.4 according to the Motorola road map which may make some very necessary improvements to this device. The screen is not half bad but considering the specs, it should look a lot better. The pixel density is there but for some reason, the image just doesn't appear that clear. That being said, its definitely acceptable just not as good as it should be.

Can't edit it, can't choose a new one, can delete the default one...So now I'm stuck with a wonderfully internet-friendly cellphone without internet.

In other words, you cannot use this phone as a mobile hotspot which is very unfortunate and renders it almost useless for me as I use it to work.The reason is that the phone has been locked by ATT, because in the states you need a particular rate plan in order to be able to share your phone's internet.
