Relatively fast internet connections and email.  Very easy to use.  PDA was great so I tossed my palm pilot.  I purchased this phone and had for approx. 1 yr before it was stolen.  Loved the touch screen and the clear cover to protect the screen.  My insurance company replaced my a1200 with the tmobile MDA...yuk!  Unlike the MDA this phone is small and light weight because of the clamshell design my cheek doesn't accidentally disconnect or mute my calls like the MDA.  The buss. card reader is a great time saver it will scan and store info in your contacts....no more losing other people's business cards!  Voice  recognition  works well.  I loved how easy it was to use.  It's built well...pretty tough I could never find a good cellphone cover for it and it held up really well being tossed in my purse and even dropped it a few times and it never got a scratch.  The stylus is sturdy and easily accessible.  The 2meg camera is great for pictures and videos outside or in bright lights but has no flash....it's one major downfall, that and the phone had a few  applications that I was unable to  use, do to language barrier (some of them in chinese)that's why only 4 stars.  My contract is up with tmobile and am looking to purchase another a1200 in red.  Red was the color no one wanted about a year ago and now it's the one that costs extra.....they're calling it special edition red now!  Go figure.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "C. March \"Im So Proud of Me\"", "ReviewID": "R36P69XR84HU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this phone about 3 weeks ago.  I can say, this phone is unlike any phone I have ever had.PROS:  Touch screen display.  PDA applications in a small design.  Very easy to use.  Very unique, I get asked all the time \"where did you get that phone.\"CONS:  If you have multiple applications running, it does have have a tendency to be a bit slow.  The red case is very appealing, however it displays a LOT of fingerprints.  The red case is not rubber like the black one.  It is a monochromatic case.  You have to have a special earphone adapter for the earphone jack.  IT WILL NOT TAKE A NORMAL EARPHONE JACK!!!!I do a lot of overseas traveling, and the phone hasn't let me down yet.  I have my service through AT&T; and I have not lost the signal yet.  I did however get a signal booster, so that might have helped a lot.  Overall, I love this phone.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm picky when it comes to the CONS, but if you can look past those, I'm sure you will enjoy this phone.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "fair", "Author": "Valencia Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2QEYKRJAWPA8L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the motorola a1200 in hopes to have hands on access to my everyday life. So far it has done everything that i know how to do with the phone. I must be honest, the features are difficult to use. I haven't been able to use hardly any of the features cause it doesn't really give full detail of how to use them.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "cionfusion", "Author": "W. barnes", "ReviewID": "R5G3Q7QNFL66A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone is ok, however I was sent the spanish version I cant read the manual its in spanish.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very unique and no one else you know will have it", "Author": "Felecia Qamar", "ReviewID": "R1YNLLH5R6YD37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a few months and I love it.  You will probably have to know someone who knows Chinese to put the phone in English.  You'll also have to go to your service provider's store so they can set the internet and multimedia messages to the correct network.  It's a really cool phone and everything works great.  The transparent screen is freaking awesome too.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "It wasn t unlocked !!!  I kill me !!!", "Author": "Leonardo P.
