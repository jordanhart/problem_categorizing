I was very excited to find out that this unit works just as well if not betterthan the more expensive ones.The pairing was simple and concise all the time. The ease of usage is nice for a person with manly fingers.I would recommend this to everyone.The one thing I would caution people about is the charging cable for the watch. It looks like a regular microusb plug but is a 5 pin connector.  Do not lose this cord or the head phone/mice cable either.  Even thoughthey are a little different they are very well made and the quality is great.Don't be shy about this purchase", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F0U6874"}}
