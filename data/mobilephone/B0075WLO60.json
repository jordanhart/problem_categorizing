In comparison to the Samsung Captivate, the Samsung Skyrocket has a much bigger screen but feels lighter, has a more than capable processor as well as sufficient RAM (hence the phone never freezes or lags), it has greater battery capacity, and I can use a 32GB MicroSDHC card. I use a Diztronic Matte Back Clear Flexible TPU Case made for the Skyrocket (available on Amazon). Most people mistake the phone for the Galaxy S III.  The two complaints I have about the phone: 1) the screen can run hot and 2) battery life is not stellar if you are actively using your cell or wi-fi signals. I would recommend definitely recommend this phone to mid-range to high end users, especially if the price is right.

I wondered why they immediately send out an email telling you not to leave negative feedback.  Now I know.  Because they sell crap.  The description of the phone says it is white.  It is black.  They put a sticker over the original pkg SN with a different description.  The battery was generic, not samsung.  The charger had scratches on it.  The quick start guide looked like it was photocopied.  The battery life was only about 6 hours even with NO use.  I removed apps, reduced power, etc.  I have done all the usual suggestions to make it better and it still had a terrible battery time.  I am a very light user.  I don't play games, look at videos or use it for music.  I just make a couple calls a day and texts.  It periodically shut off for no apparent reason and I did not know it til I tried to make a call.  It periodically would not recognize my SIM card and I had to reboot.  Sometimes the people I called could not hear me, nor could I hear them, although the phone said it was connected.  I contacted the lousy customer service at Joycells and their answer was for me to return the phone and order another one.  That would leave me without a phone for an indefinite period of time.  That was their answer... take it or leave it.  I ordered one from EBay.  Works fantastic.... I have no problem with Amazon.  Their customer service was good.

Also, this does not come with a manual, just a \"quick start\" guide and a \"safety and warranty\" booklet.  It is an ATT unlocked phone so it is preloaded with a bunch of ATT junk that I'm still trying to uninstall.  Otherwise this was an excellent buy that I would not hesitate to recommend.....just don't be fooled in thinking you will receive an extra battery like the pic shows.

Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Skyrocket S2 phone. Although I paid more to purchase this phone NEW, I am very glad that I did so as it is working wonderfully! My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me (with a 4.5\" viewing screen like the S3 has). For me, I keep this phone inside a case and cover and it still fits easily into a rather small purse. And also I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music when I work out. Since the phone is lightweight, it is easy to wear on my waistband (in the storage case).- Unlocked Sim - Yes, the phone I received is NEW and I tested the Sim slot to make sure it was unlocked. First I inserted my neighbors T-Mobile standard Sim card (she has a pre-paid plan with no data plan). I simply popped it into the phone and it worked right out of the box, called someone and it worked great. Sent a text (with no pictures or attachments, just text and went fine). Then I removed her Sim and placed my own AT&T; Activated Sim card (Standard sized card). With the T-Mobile and AT&T; Sim cards, this phone worked perfectly as the phone is SIM UNLOCKED, the basic AT&T; Logo is still there, the original AT&T; Apps still there. But you can use say T-Mobile, Straight Talk, or MOST GSM Sim cards should work just fine--just make sure you buy the UNLOCKED ONE not the locked to AT&T; one.However, if you want to use anything other than AT&T;, please contact me in comments for the APN settings for Data and MMS as I have all the settings.One more thing if it says UNLOCKED rather than International Unlocked, it means that JUST THE SIM CARD SLOT is Unlocked for most GSM Standard Sized Sim Cards but still shows the AT&T; Logo on the top front of the phone. Since I did not do anything on my neighbors Sim card but make a quick call and try it for about 30 minutes (she is thinking about buying this phone for herself and using T-Mobile as she does not an AT&T; Account). Also, if you use WiFi like I do, no need for data unless you are in an out of WiFi area a lot of the time. For me, I am around WiFi 95 to 99 percent of the time!- LARGE SCREEN WITH GOOD RESOLUTION - This absolutely gorgeous screen measures 4.5 inches (seems larger) and it is just the right sized screen. Before this phone I used to use a Galaxy Note and Grand (both had 5 inch or more screens), both were too big, heavy and bulky. Now, I am using the S2 Skyrocket as the screen is large and has good resolution with 207 ppi (pixels per inch) and higher is better. This has a very sharp screen with easy to read screen. It looks to me as sharp as my old Galaxy Note I did and MUCH MUCH sharper than my Galaxy Grand (which just had 187 ppi and it was not as clear as the S2 Skyrocket) so that extra 20 pixels per inch makes a big difference in my opinion. Again, this screen is so vivid and clear!- STANDARD REGULAR SIZE SIM CARD: This phone has a regular/standard Sim card slot. (Note the S3 regular phone and S4 phones accept a micro Sim. So glad that this phone accepts a regular/standard Sim.-- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the ONE OF THE BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 16GB of Internal space. The 16GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 10.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- CAMERA - The 8MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a very good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.- OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. For me, I use an OTG Micro Adapter (S3 and S4 ones work) and am able to plug in a flash drive, mouse and more. Could not get my portable Hard Disk to work, but flash drives work fine.- NFC (Near Field Communication) has been advertised to work on this phone. Have not yet tried this feature.CONS:- No built in FM Radio like the regular SII has. Not a problem because I installed TuneIn Radio (free) from the Playstore and I can play lots of radio (FM or other) when WiFi is on.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.

Only official batteries have the NFC antenna.  You may need to buy a replacement battery from your service provider or an official Samsung distributor if you want to use the NFC feature.-- The finish on the battery cover does not match the phone and does not sit flush with the phone body.-- The charging adapter has a flimsy wire and does not reliably charge the phone.

Sometimes it would take weeks (with reminders) to get a response.Technical details:When you set up data on a phone, the APN (Access Point Names) need to be changed. In the operating system on the phone, AT&T; has blocked the APN from being changed so you cannot change to a different APN (from a new provider).In older versions of the Android system, you could run an application that modifies the APN and bypass this lock. Unfortunately, Android (Google) decided to team up with the cell networks and block this option in newer versions of the operating system (like the one pre-installed on the phone), so you cannot unblock the APN.At least for the foreseeable future (until Google stops the nonsense), the only way to use this phone with data on a non-AT&T; network is to \"root\" the phone. Rooting the phone has advantages, but you lose the warranty from Samsung and the ability to upgrade with Kies.It is a good phone, but get it only if you plan to use it on AT&T; or to root it.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awfull phone", "Author": "chepamo", "ReviewID": "R1HGP5HLFWGTMU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone is not fully unlocked it does not work for some carriers like T-mobile and other like carrier. the phone is refurbish. the back cover is not the original and it is a different tone of white, some parts of the phone were changed, the data of t mobile does not work and some other software features of the phone does not work perfectly. if you are going to buy this phone for other carriers other than AT&T; do not buy it.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice and cheap", "Author": "Meri", "ReviewID": "R1DRT1G6179YEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LEVEL OF COMFORT IS MORE NOTICEABLE THAN FRACTIONS OF A MILLIMETER, AND WE FELT RIGHT AT HOME WITH THE SKYROCKET.By being a member of the Galaxy S II family, you've already come to know what to expect in the Skyrocket's hardware.

The phone itself is superb and came with Android vs 4.0.4.  I inserted my Tmobile SIM and worked right away, no problems there.  The issue is that I have not been able to get my laptop to recognize it yet so that I can use the Samsung KIES software, and I have been trying for over 5 days now.  Whatever I try I keep getting 'Unknown Device' error when I plug it in.  I tried on 3 different laptops with different OS's, Win7, WinXP, and Vista, all report the same issue.... all I can do is charge it when connected.  I followed instructions from a dozen websites of people reporting similar issues to no avail..... So for now, I give it a 4 star rating as I have to use the Kies Air app to access it via a URL.  I'll update this review if I figure out a solutionUpdate: 11/12/13:Changed to 1 star.  I really like the form factor/speed/features but my experience with this specific phone is just getting worse, I believe I received a defective device and am about to return it.- After almost 2 weeks of trying suggestions from online research I am still not able to get any PC/laptop to recognize it.  I even had 2 colleagues with similar phones try it on their PCs (that recognize their phones just fine) with their own cables but it still didn't work, so I know it's not my laptop and/or cable.- Charging doesn't always work:  Sometimes when I plug it to either my laptop or wall charger it doesn't charge at all some other times no issues- And since I cannot rely on charging to consistently work I have to turn it off at night, and yesterday evening when I tried to turn it off it showed the android character and said \"Downloading, do not turn off target\" and nothing was downloading and was stuck on that for a few hours.  I had to hold the power button down for a few seconds to force a restart.
