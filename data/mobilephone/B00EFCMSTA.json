I was fortunate enough to get this refurbished for only $25.00 and it was a steal. It has about 300MB of system memory so you can install all of your favorite apps and some games. It's very fast and smooth. Also, there is no activation needed. If you wanted to use this as a WiFi only device, it works perfectly. I would recommend you buy this phone, especially if you're getting it for a teen as a starter phone.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Kazi Begum", "ReviewID": "RNTJ2D53CM6SU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Better than expected and looks new and great deal for $27.

It's a great starter phone for a preteen. Basic functionality, durable (even more so with a case, I recommend the iTuffy brand), and a has good size screen.I would definitely recommend this phone for preteens, older folks, and people who don't try to keep up with the Jones' but not so much a teen/adult who wants all the bells and whistles.
