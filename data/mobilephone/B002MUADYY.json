Without a T-Mobile SIM with data plan you are dead in the water.  Since I live overseas, I am now stuck with a $150 brick.  Bottom line, if you are not on the T-Mobile network choose another phone.Yes I can root the phone etc. but why should I have to do this on a phone that is advertised as \"unlocked\"Lastly, if your preferred language is other than English and Spanish then pass.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "basic phone", "Author": "Cindy Raney \"Craney\"", "ReviewID": "RFH59VQLK0PTV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone is a great smartphone but does not have the browser for the market games and no wi-fi. other than that it is great!although it does not let you download pictures sent in a text or download very much from a link.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "JUAN MOTABAN", "Author": "Domarly Cova \"JUAN MOTABAN\"", "ReviewID": "R6YAJ0U4PI372", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente producto, es exactamente como se describe en la publicaci\u00f3n, gracias.

This phone looks very nice, clean design. The package does not come with a manual. But I was able to download one from the Internet. Because this is my first time using an Android phone, it took me a few days to warm up with the features, apps, and downloading new apps from Android market place. But now that I am used to it, I really like it, particularly the customization flexibility. My phone came with an older version of the Android. I updated it via T-mobile update to version 2.2.1. The battery life is reasonable for a smart phone. It took two full charges to stabilize. I usually charge it every other day. If you are on the phone a lot, play some game, or have lots of apps running in the background, then you will probably have to charge it everyday. One thing I wish is better is the touch screen response. I feel it is somewhat sluggish to my touch. The edge area is worse than the middle part. I know this because I played a lot of Sudoku which takes up the whole screen. My old Samsung touch screen is better than this. Overall, I am satisfied with it.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "terrible performance", "Author": "lorenzo", "ReviewID": "RX509O7OUJ9DS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have only one month with this device, and the truth is that at first seemed very nice, but when I started using it I realized how terrible it is expected there will be any application that you ask. is extremely slow, if you have to find a phone, I suggest that you feel. if you want to surf the web, mama mia, have to develop patience. wait longer than expected.
