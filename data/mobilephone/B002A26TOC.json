However, when installation was attempted it promptly lets you know that it is locked to ATT.  This is useless for an overseas carrier.  Unfortunately, I found this out while travelling and was not able to return it when I returned due to the short return policy.  In addition, item came packed loose in an ATT box.  It seemed as if it was a refurbished item due to its lack of packaging and information.  I know that this is not technically a review, because I haven't actually been able to use the item.  I was hoping this would work for my needs.  Maybe I'll sell it in the marketplace so that someone else can give it a try.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "It Works!  But...", "Author": "Lisa A.

Warthen", "ReviewID": "R3C4C0OS1I2VA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First a note related to the one-star review of this modem.  Of course, you need service with a mobile operator (AT&T; or T-Mobile in the US ... although you'll only get EDGE speeds on T-Mobile as this modem does not support T-Mobile's 3G service on the 1700Mhz band).  You need a SIM card with an active service contract from a GSM operator to use this product.  If you don't understand this, then this product is definitely not for you.AT&T; sells this product locked to their service as the USBConnect QuickSilver.The Option ICON 322 is a fast modem for automated sending of SMS and MMS.  I use it with the Now SMS/MMS Gateway software product (a.k.a., NowSMS).It also works great for internet access.  It's nice and compact, so it's easy to pack along with your laptop.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fine Replacement", "Author": "pbcguy", "ReviewID": "R2IQZDNK7ZDL4P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a replacement item for the wireless 3G Internet card I accidentally dropped on the floor. I need to add that this is an exact replacement - make, model and manufacturer, even down to being branded AT&T; - of what I dropped and that I did not drop the original from a high height on to a concrete slab; it was dropped from table height on to a wooden floor where it snapped apart. The device is made to snap apart but when I put it together, it no longer worked. What I am saying is that while the device may look durable, it is in fact quite fragile.Not knowing where else to turn, I went to my service provider AT&T; and was definitely not satisfied with their options. Since my card was \"out of warranty,\" they would gladly give me a new one for \"free\" if I renewed my contract for another two years - the service isn't all that great, but that's another review - or they would sell me a new one for - hold your hats, folks - $249! Neither option was acceptable.Fortunately, I had saved my old PCMCIA card. I took my broken card home with me, put the SIM card into the PCMCIA card, went online and found this card - unlocked yet! - at Amazon for under $30 and received it in under four days. It probably would have been sooner but there was a weekend in between. What's wrong with this picture that AT&T; was so willing to sell me a replacement at $249 while it was less than $30 on Amazon? As for ease of set up, there was no more difficulty than inserting the SIM card into a slot. The SIM card will go in only one way but make sure you have it right side up and don't force it.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very easy to configure", "Author": "ARASAN4", "ReviewID": "R1D1442GDY5CLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product because my previous 3G modem is broken.I plugged the new modem, a software was automatically installed, and I made the configuration taking into consideration the other modem configuration.

Even though I have TMo's web light which is supposed to be 3G I only got Edge. This was slow and I couldn't stream anything. I actually had to subscribe to Cox which I really didn't want to do. It's great for using it on the road to check email. I'd buy it again if I had to. I do like that the drivers and software is in the device. I did an uninstall of AT&T;'s connection manager thinking I could reinstall it. It never did so I went to Options website and got the software from there.

I decided to do a little research on cell phone internet. I purchased the Icon 322 and net gear 3g wireless router. Both of the units are needed if you want to play Xbox live, but if you just want the internet for your computer you can just buy the Icon 322.The Icon 322 did need a little brain power to set up on your computer.  After the Icon 322 and Net Gear wireless 3g router were hooked up my internet speed was at T-1 connection.Well it's now March 24 about three months of having the icon 322 and what's funny is that AT&T; found out that I keep swapping my sim cards from my phone to the icon 322 usb, turns out they don't allow that. They restricted my internet on my lg Shine phone and whats worse Them M/F wanted to charge me a air card fee. So the item does work, the only problem is AT&T; will found out and restrict your internet.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Useless and a waste of money", "Author": "Diomedes Ignacio Dom\u00ednguez Ure\u00f1a", "ReviewID": "R2Z2FJ6SVNHFPI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to buy the same item from some guy in eBay later I bought this one, because the first one don't work.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "from other reviews, I think I need to do something than just plug and go", "Author": "ybot", "ReviewID": "R35DSOLIMZZQPI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am researching to see if there is something else I have to do, or download something, I put it into my computer and nothing.

Works like a champ.  I recommend it.[...] customers -- this device does NOT support your new 3G network.  You want the Option iCON 452 instead.However, I don't see anywhere in the instructions where the SIM must actually click into position \"like a Bic pen.\"  None of my devices up to this point have used this technique to seat the SIM.  I couldn't use a fingertip to get it to click, and I couldn't get it to recognize the SIM, so I finally called Option's support line.  Two minutes later, a tech told me to use a paper clip to do what my fingertip could not.
