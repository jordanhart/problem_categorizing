{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing value", "Author": "John C. Kulli \"amateur historian\"", "ReviewID": "R23RSLRA8ZOCXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing for the price.  I purchased two of them, and 8GB memory cards for each.  I got the SIM cards from Consumer Cellular, which DOES NOT CHARGE for SIM cards, just for air time.  Consumer cellular does not support this model phone, but if you go to http://www.unlockit.co.nz you can find the Mobile Carrier Settings that will make it work.  Several reviews claim that the GPS doesn't work, and at first I thought that also.  But get the free app GPS test from the Google Play store and stand around outside for a while.  Eventually the phone picks up the satellites and you're in business.  One other detail:  the phone comes with the default British version of English.  You can change that with another free app.Several reviews complain about the keysize.  This is a minor flaw.Overall this phone does everything pretty well, and for $60 it's a steal.  Just be patient and be prepared to spend some time with Google figuring out how it all works.  There is no user manual.One last thing: there are two SIM card slots behind the battery, labelled SIM1 and SIM2.  The software has them reversed, so if the card is in the slot labelled SIM1, the OS thinks it's SIM2.  Again, a trivial problem.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "JUST SAY NO!", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R2V2VWYCGSJ5HW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Late arrival. Never held a charge.

BUYER BEWARE!!My own phone broke completely on me a month before my free upgrade date so I decided to just buy something cheap to last me until then. And yeah, for a \"smartphone\" it's cheap, but I don't even think it was worth the $51 I paid for it. More like $25-30, If that.For one, fresh out the box, I tried to remove the back cover so I could put in the battery, of course, this is something the makers must have realized that the customer must do right? I mean, they sent the phone and the battery seperately, it's not like an Apple iOS device where the cover isn't removeable. Well the cover is so tight on there and it's so flimsy, the freaking cover cracked when I tried to remove it. Yes, 5 seconds out the box, and it was already breaking.Secondly, after I got past that ridiculousness, I figured \"Alright, rough start, but it's still a pretty sleek looking device, can't be that bad. I put in the SIM card from my old phone and turn it on. First off, the startup for the phone looks and sounds like it's from a 2002 Nokia phone, which dropped my expectations even further, all the buttons look like they were made with Microsoft Paint, and the screen isn't a touchscreen, more like a punchscreen, because you damn near have to punch it to make it work, plus it feels like the screen is made of clear duct tape. And of course, IT DOESNT READ THE SIM. So, fearing breaking the phone again, I turn it off, remove the cover, and go \"Oh well maybe if I put it in the second slot. Nope, still doesn't work. So I'm not sure how this is supposed to be useful, especially if most of the useful parts of the phone need the SIM to run.Thirdly, I decided to just suck it up and start exploring, I noticed the date said 1-15-2013, So they're only about a year and 6 months off. I go to fix it, and when I try to type in my local area, I realize...This damn thing's keyboard has the old-school setting. Yes, If I want to type \"atlanta\" I have to sit there and type 2-8-555-2-66-8-2. I haven't typed out words like that on a phone since I was a child, and I'd rather not go back to doing that.Overall, I wish I had made a different decision. If I wasn't laughing at how preposterously horrible this phone was I'd be probably be crying at the same. I had never heard of SVP before and I'm starting to figure out why, this is like some chinese piece of crap I wouldn't even pass off to a toddler to play with. I not only would not recommend this phone, I would specifically ask that people DONT buy this phone. SVP needs to focus their efforts somewhere else, cause phone making in the 21st century just aint their deal.", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone sucks.", "Author": "Rawle", "ReviewID": "R33YU58ZBBQ0Q5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone suck, touch screen don't work properly.
