I am now not recommending this phone if you are a consumer cellular customer.  I gave it 5 stars, but I would like to adjust it down to 3 because of this.  Not  necessarily Huawei's fault, more of a problem with consumer cellular.  Consumer cellular uses AT&t; tower which makes these types of phones compatible with their service.  But as I said, it's limited compatibility.  If you have consumers, stick with their smart phones that are tweaked for full support.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Greatest purchase I ever made.", "Author": "julio lonnie lopez", "ReviewID": "RDAV16X6AKQMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I got this phone fast in the mail and it was real easy to set up. I have ATT with a data plan already and have been out of contract for the past 2 months.  My plan was to never get back into contract again with anyone so I bought this phone, hoping it would fulfill my dream of freedom.  And it has in spades.  The phone is great, snappy fast, and worked with my SIM card and my plan without having to change anything, except for ATT charging a $1 fee for changing phones, sneaky.This phone is a gateway phone, hopefully it will teach the American consumer that you don't need to have a subsidized phone in order to have a good.  That you don't need to be locked into a contract or a company for that matter.
