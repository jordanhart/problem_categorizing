I really tried to get a name brand smartphone like blackberry or the Samsung Galaxy but those phones were just to exspensive. But I still didn't give up the search for a new phone and that's when I came across this awesome smartphone. Even though this was more of a generic phone I have to say it is extremely high quality and when you buy one here is what to expect:fast internet browsing.high app storageCrisp and clear camera photos.lots of phone call talk time.hours and hours of battery life.beautiful graphics.highly cutomizable ringtones.easily enjoy watching videos and moviesYou really should buy this phone it has to be at least 10 times better than a lot the $400 and $500 I have bought but it's only like a1/6 of the price! I would highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Cell phone delivered that does not match the bid. - El tel\u00e9fono celular entregado que no coincide con la oferta.", "Author": "matosrafael", "ReviewID": "R2GH87XWN9S3E2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Greetings all, I write from Venezuela, the phone that I get, not what is on sale, because I get a phone with the following features:1. - Both cameras have a resolution of 2 Megapixels, instead of having a 3-megapixel rear camera as shown in the ad.2. -. - The RAM is 222 MB instead of 512 MB\u200b\u200b.3. - ROM memory is 156 MB, instead of 256 MB.4. - Has Cortex A7, a single processor Core5. - Accessories like protectors are not the same when published.As you will see the phone they gave me is different from what is offered, the company AMAZON should find this case to prevent misleading advertising that affects the credibility of the online store and worldwide.ESPA\u00d1OL.Saludos a todos,  le escribo desde Venezuela, el tel\u00e9fono que me llego , no corresponde a lo que est\u00e1 en la venta, ya que me llego un tel\u00e9fono con las siguientes caracter\u00edsticas:1.- Ambas c\u00e1maras tiene una resoluci\u00f3n de 2 Megapixel , en vez de tener  c\u00e1mara trasera de 3 Megapixel como indica la publicidad.2.- La memoria RAM es de 222 MB, en vez de 512 MB .3.- La memoria ROM es de 156 MB , en vez de 256 MB.4.- Tiene Cortex A7 , un solo procesador Core5.- Los accesorios como protectores no son los mismos al publicado.Como se ver\u00e1  el tel\u00e9fono que me entregaron es diferente a lo ofertado, la empresa AMAZON deber\u00e1 averiguar este caso, para evitar la publicidad enga\u00f1osa que afecte la credibilidad de esta tienda en l\u00ednea y a nivel mundial.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "about this phone", "Author": "Yohendrick Camacaro", "ReviewID": "R1CZWWB5CH48XR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "so im purchased 2 phone and work nice, is like mini s3 the size is perfect no more big..app work, faster, is not 3g but data run fast...camera 3mp work nice.. for this price the phone is good..the only detail is not skin protector or cover..", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sucks do not buy this phone", "Author": "Tuffy", "ReviewID": "R26PN30O4AR6WS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok for one I got a different phone than the one in the advertisement..i got teh package and one of the batteries were broken..the phone came on once and during that time i tested the camera and the flash didnt work...and it was slow as shi* I had ordered a case according to what was in the pics showing what i would be getting ..now i have a case and screen protector that does not suit this lemon of a phone.

Young", "ReviewID": "R2FWIJ7225K0MM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so disappointed in this phone. I thought I was getting a lot for the money, but the reason for a smart phone is the use of apps right? I have an app for my bank accounts, car insurance, etc. After trying to download my apps, the phones internal memory was already at max with the pre-loaded apps. Even after transferring them to the Micro SD car,I kept getting the message that the phone was at max, would't for anything. Screen was very blurred, and becuase of the capacity issue the phone would freeze even when trying to unlock the screen as well as any other function.
