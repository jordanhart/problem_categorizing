{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Straight Talk phone, uses Sprint cell towers", "Author": "Cable Monkey", "ReviewID": "RORXZH0GVJ57A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best Straight Talk phones available.  The screen is a little larger than the one on my S2, and the Android version is newer. As with all Straight Talk phones, cell reception is dependent on which carrier that model is attached to.  In this case, the Straight Talk Galaxy S3 uses Sprint towers, so it's a great choice if you have good Sprint reception in your area.  If you don't have good Sprint reception in your area, I recommend you get the Straight Talk Galaxy S2, which uses AT&T; towers.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome !", "Author": "sherri williams", "ReviewID": "R1PT6BT32PYRZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love love love it !!!!
