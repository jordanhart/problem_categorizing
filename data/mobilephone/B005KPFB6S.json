The phone is excellent for the price with many features such as GPS, WIFI, Bluetooth, FM Radio, etc. Something I didn't know before was that this smartphone has a trackpad in the center button too, and thats great when you don't want to scroll touching the screen.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't complain", "Author": "Akshat Sikarwar", "ReviewID": "R13TGZDZVVZ5X8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my third smartphone during the last 12 months. Earlier I lost an iPhone 4 and Samsung Infuse 4G. This time round I wanted a cheap, unlocked phone to ride out my contract.It took me a little while to get used to the small screen; my previous phone had a 4.5\" screen. But after a week of use I've grown used to its size and the physical keyboard is nice to have.I live in NYC and the local express delivery was just $9 and I got the phone the very next day. (It was cheaper than 1 day and 2 day delivery actually).The 3G won't work on AT&T; in USA - it'll just use Edge. But since 3G doesn't work the battery life is great (I get more than 24hrs).The phone was new but the box I got was clearly already opened. This phone was not designed for the American market and I suppose the seller probably opened it to put the Europe-to-America power adapter which is fine but then the hands-free earphones were missing (can't run the FM Radio without it).This phone shipped with a buggy firmware. The phone kept thinking that the SD card had been removed. Had to upgrade it using Samsung Kies. Kies is really really terrible and is easily the worst piece of software that I have ever used (makes me appreciate how simple it was to work with iTunes). It took several failed attempts (including one where the phone went into firmware recovery and wouldn't boot anymore) to get this thing running the latest version. Fortunately the problem is now resolved.It comes with ~256MB of RAM, ~180MB of internal storage and a 2GB Micro-SD card.The internal storage is just too less and will fill upon installing just a few apps. Moreover not all apps allow installing to SD card. Had to run adb (part of Android SDK) to change some settings which makes the SD card the default install target. But even then some amount of data gets installed on internal storage with each app and you will soon run out of space.I guess all of this is part of the 'Android Experience'. Things were much better with the iPhone - I had issues with the Infuse 4G (had to fight with Kies then too). Upgrading from Froyo to Gingerbread on the Infuse was a royal pain. I don't expect this phone to ever receive the Ice Cream Sandwich update, but at least it comes with Gingerbread already.All in all, I can't really complain. I've resolved the problems that I had and I have an unlocked smart phone with great battery life running gingerbread for $140.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK -  for emails and text", "Author": "Yuval", "ReviewID": "RMJU1JDU5P451", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is rather old (more than 2 years) so OS and CPU are quite slowThe physical keyboard helps a lot for all emails and textsTherefore, it is mainly for answering emails, whats-app and such but not to surf the webFor that it is a decent phone which is quite cheap and fits its purposes", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes and No", "Author": "B.J.

That said, there is a great benefit to business phone users to be able to have one single phone which can contain both their business phone number and private number, makes life a lot easier for expenses accounting, business and personal confidentiality as well as avoiding carrying two phone and related accessories around! I am surprised that the Corporations are not demanding more of such phones. Now back reviewing this phone -Generally all dual SIM phones are not the highest specs available beyond the dual SIM feature, typically having lower resolution screens and cameras, but this phone is the nearest to getting a dual SIM Blackberry, although it's an Android OS not Blackberry, and the keyboard whilst good enough does not have keys as large as most BBs.Some positives:- Good quality build and finish- Decent battery life- Both SIMs are simultaneously active to be able receive incoming calls. Pressing a dedicated key on the keyboard determines which SIM is active for outgoing calls, can be switched as many times as needed between business and private calls for example.- Android OS with loads of apps- touchscreen works for all functions except typing, that's what the keyboard is for. The keyboard can be used for most functions if your prefer not to touch screen, best of both worlds really.- chargeable via an adapter or USB, unlike Nokia dual SIMs that I reviewed which are adapter only.- good call quality- micro SIM expandable- front-facing camera for video and video calling.- accurate GPS system, with standard Google app included. Other and better apps available, even free.Some improvements:- 3mp camera is adequate for snaps, but would benefit from an LED flash. However buyers should realise this phone is a medium spec and priced accordingly, so if you want a BB or iPhone look elsewhere.- like most phones is made of slick plastic but would be more secure from slipping from the hand with a textured rear panel as many Galaxy Y phones already have.- some apps cannot understand that the screen width is longer than the height so they flip around 90 degrees onto their side. Although this phone can flip the screen content sideways on other apps, for those apps which already flip their layout 90 degrees the phone cannot undo the flip. This is not a fault of the phone but the fault of the app developers who need to recognise that some screens out there are of a different format. Most apps work normally but if your favourite app is affected in this way then it can be a pain to hold your phone sideways to use the app as well as it being more crammed into the reduced screen-width pixels.- screen brightness can be manually adjusted but does not auto-adjust from indoors to outdoors and vice-versa.- although this phone meets the minimum spec for Skype video calling it is not available as an option on the Skype app. I am not sure if this is a microsoft restriction on android or some other issue, but since I rarely use skype with video due to extra bandwidth needed, this is not a big issue for me.- spare batteries hard to find, but this is partly due to some confusion out there with dealers regarding the correct part number for the battery, so best to buy a spare battery at the same time as your phone purchase if you can.Despite a few weaknesses, none of which are really showstoppers, overall I am very relieved and pleased that I found a good dual SIM qwerty phone after a very long search. The 5 stars awarded are in relation to comparing this phone with other dual-SIMs which are all lower spec than single SIM phones, for some strange reason, probably network carriers influence as mentioned earlier. If I was rating compared to other single-SIM phones it would get 4 stars because of the areas for improvement I mentioned.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "A Jolly Good Fellow", "ReviewID": "R1IEI8P37VB97N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is Android, has a physical keyboard, and 2-3 days battery life.
