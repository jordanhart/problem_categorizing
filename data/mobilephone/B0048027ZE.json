{"Reviews": [{"Title": "idiotic reviews...", "Author": "dBenjammin", "ReviewID": "RD5HRJ5I8XD84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own this phone since the middle of December, and couldn't imagine owning another phone. I have to have a hardware keyboard or the phone is useless to me as I do a lot more than just talk on my phone. The keyboard on this thing i second to none, HTC really knows how to make a great phone keyboard. Within 2Hrs of owning it, I was back at my house and found on XDA, simple to follow instructions which unlocked, rooted (perm) and installed a custom ROM (Virtuous - Sense based). I use this thing heavily, wifi, tons of sms/email, bluetooth (Jabra BT3030 + NuForce NE-700X earbuds) so I can have awesome music quality while working. Installed Zagg Invisible Shield (full body) as soon as I got it.This Z Hinge issue everyone is making such a big deal out of is not an issue at all. You really have to be TRYING to make it open on it's own, for it to open on it's own. I carry my phone in my pocket most the time. I mean seriously who carries their phone \"while holding only the edges of the back?\" That's right, NO ONE! You would be dropping your phone every 2 seconds if you held it like that... I've even dropped this thing a few times, and even then the keyboard didn't open on it's own.This phone is SCREAMING fast when paired with a custom rom and a slight overclock (1Ghz). The phone is capable of 3000+ quadrant scores with a 1.7-1.9Ghz overclock (see XDA) and gets a very respectable 2200-2400 with a mild OC (1.2Ghz) on a Sense based ROM!!! That's freakin' awesome, and if you play any of the emulator rom games for psx/gba/snes, this makes gameplay smooth as butter! You have to be seriously trying to not like this phone. I will happily update after a few more months of heavy use.Can't wait to get either a seidio or mugen power 1700/1800mah slim battery so I can go a couple days (heavy use) between charges, without having to change my battery cover! With the stock battery and custom rom + mild OC (1.2Ghz) + HEAVY usage, I get between 8-10hrs on a charge, which is very respectable considering how utterly blazing fast this thing is! There are some wonderful programs which can help you get a lot more out of your phone, Tasker, Juice Defender just to name a couple.The only thing I would say was \"poorly\" designed would be the speakerphone speaker, while it's not that great, it does do what it is supposed to. Also, the placement of the camera could have been a little better, but the LED is SUPER BRIGHT for when you need to use your phone as a flashlight (for some reason that seems quite often for me... lol)Other Thoughts: Please just understand people while I feel this phone is pretty rugged compared to how it LOOKS. It is still just a nicely built smartphone and is prone to all kinds of issues if you're not careful enough with it, I am in no way saying this thing is delicate... just common sense people, common sense.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone", "Author": "A. Ogilvy", "ReviewID": "R1NYARV2FWJOOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little worried after I read the reviews about the slide hinge, but I bought the G2 anyway because I wanted the QWERTY keyboard in addition to the touchscreen. I don't know if there's another device out there with all the features this one has. The slider has not been an issue at all. I use the slide out keyboard all the time to text - it's so much better than texting with the touchscreen keyboards. My slider has shown no signs of wear. And the camera is phenomenal. It takes professional looking pics ... and the camcorder is easy to use, too. So is syncing your files to your PC. I also love all the free Android aps!!", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love, love this phone!", "Author": "vachihera", "ReviewID": "R28Y4P30ESYAWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first android phone ever and it is amazing and simple to use.

Provenzano", "ReviewID": "R3PP74D7LILR9G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just purchased the G2 on 12/24/10.  I love the processing speed, SWYPE, Android platform and the phone is extremely user friendly.  Mymain reasons for choosing this phone over all the others was the largest touchscreen and the full keyboard too.  However, the slide and lift design of the phone to expose the keyboard is very disappointing.  10 days after very mild use, the hinge stopped catching and the phone slides open and closed at random.  There is no more \"catch\" to keep it shut.  I used a Bodyglove protective case with belt clip on the first phone.  I began to notice while on my hip it was opening all the time.  I turned the clip in every direction to see if it would help.  It did not. I returned to TMobile and exchanged for a new phone of same design since it was less than 14 days after purchase.  I decided to purchased the TMobile gel skin for the second G2.  It has no clip but at least it would protect the exterior edges.Within 2 days I can already see that even the tiny additional weight that the gel skin provides, it is causing the hitch touchscreen to pull away from the base of the phone.  I have to say, I am very disappointed with the design flaw of this phone.  When you pay $500 bucks for a phone, you would at expect it to last as long as a $50 slidephone.  I will be returning my G2 and hopefully they will allow me to switch to another type of phone that does not have this design.Buyer Beware!!!!!!!  If you go to the store and hold this phone in your hand, be sure to turn it on it's side while holding only the edges of the back.  You will see that when you tilt it, it begins to pull away even before you begin to open it.  After a little usage, it opens very easily if tilted.  This is very important to keep in mind if you will use a bodyglove clip cover or gel skin.  It may take longer for the flaw to show itself if kept in a case with no gel skin.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Collin D Parenton", "ReviewID": "R1KZXJEQ9MA3ED", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first, I really liked the G2. It was a snappy phone loaded with features. Despite what HTC says the \"Z\" hinge is an issue and will be with this model. After about a month of moderate use, the hinge was so loose that the top portion flopped open easily, too easily. There doesn't appear to be any way to re tension the hinge. After 5 weeks, the phone's ear piece speaker stopped working for no apparent reason. People would call and I couldn't hear them. I hadn't dropped the phone or exposed it to water. In fact, I had used the phone earlier in the day and that afternoon the problem started. I am not sure if this is related to the Z hinge or not. I have always like HTC made phones, so I was really disappointed in this one.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.99", "Features": "Windows Phone 7 operating system .\n4.3-inch touchscreen display (480 x 800 pixels, 16 million colors) includes light and proximity sensors.\nFull QWERTY virtual keyboard\n5-megapixel autofocus camera with dual LED flash gives you a brighter light source for taking photos.\nDigital media player compatible with MP3, WMA, AAC/AAC+/eAAC+ music formats and MPEG4 video\nUltra-fast Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking (802.11b/g/n) for accessing home and corporate networks as well as hotspots while on the go.\nHD video capture capabilities (720p)\nBluetooth connectivity (version 2.1) includes profiles for communication headset, hands-free car kits, and the A2DP Bluetooth profile-\nGPS navigation with access to turn-by-turn navigation from TeleNav GPS Navigator\n16 GB internal memory\nText (SMS) and picture/video (MMS) messaging\nAccess to popular instant messaging services\nAccess to personal and work e-mail (supports Microsoft Exchange corporate e-mail\nMicroUSB port (2.0) 3.5mm headphone jack", "Name": "HTC HD7 - WM7- T9292 -", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41r27H4TgkL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0048027ZE"}}
