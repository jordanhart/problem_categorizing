When it didn't sync in my detail, and began losing content that I tried to store, I took it to the Apple Store.  They indicated that this iPhone is over three years old and was faulty,  In fact all information was eventually lost and unable to restore.I will never buy a \"New Phone\" on-line again because no one can be sure of what they are getting.
