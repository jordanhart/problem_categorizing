He had this phone previously but it was stolen and AT&T; no longer carried this phoine as a replacement.  My husband is blind and this is this best phone for him to use. No other carrier carries a phone that will meet the needs of the sight impaired.  Thank you for making his life just a little better.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be Happier!", "Author": "G.

We dried it out (via the rice method) but some of the buttons just wouldn't work anymore.  I checked with AT&T; but they don't offer this model any longer so we took a chance and ordered this one from Amazon.  We stuck in the sim card and battery -- and voila!  Brand new working slider phone!!  I don't know why the other reviewer had a problem with the AT&T; sim card but ours fit perfectly and the phone works like a charm.  We're thrilled!!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid phone", "Author": "Kathryn I Haslam", "ReviewID": "RPRGT0EADUVP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No complaints on this phone. Built solidly, great battery life, no problems at all. I use this as a person who is certainly comfortable with the operation of smart phone but chooses not to pay for one, so I don't know how this phone stacks up for someone who is not technicologically literate, but it's a very good quality phone for a basic plan.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "exactly the same as my last one.", "Author": "Stephen Lutz", "ReviewID": "R2L6YBJE9H41CO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a perfect replacement for the one I was wearing when I was riding my bike and the rain started pouring down.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good replacement phone", "Author": "John Saunders", "ReviewID": "R19NGAKGY1PS3R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace the same model that got soaked when I was at the beach.
