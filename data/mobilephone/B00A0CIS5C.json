A class of its on!", "Author": "AndroidDude", "ReviewID": "RSOX77GXQFCWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm somewhat of a \"Tech junkie.\" Therefore,  I've owned/own my fair share of devices. Iphone 3g, 3gs, HTC EVO,  EVO 3D, Galaxy TAB 7.7, Droid Razr Maxx, and droid DNA by HTC, to name a few. This by far does what all the above do and MORE. I am not a Samsung fan, but as of late they have set the bar in what modern tech can be. Anyone debating on making the leap to this monster of a device shouldn't hesitate! I thought the size would make it uneasy to handle since I have small hands but, I quickly got used to it.  It also has 1 handed mode, where you can switch the keyboard,  phone dial pad, and ecen the calculator to favor either side with the touch of an arrow! I know women who have no problem operating the phone with the smallest hands. There is already a wealth of accessories at your disposal since this is a global device, as well as being available on 5 U.S carrier's.  This has taken over my tablet as my browsing and media device. The S-pen acts as a mouse with features like hovering over links to show previews of emails, web content, photo albums and even shows a live preview with sound of your videos just by hovering! this device is nothing short of amazing! of course, the main reason this device is made, being a phone, it is excellent and reception and 4g LTE conectivity where available. No dropped calls and everyone sounds clear and say that I sound clear on my end. Buy it!Pros: super fast quad core 1.6 GHz processor.Large 5.5 inch super amoled 720 p HD screen non pentile version.A plethora of the features including the extra features that that s pen enables.Great battery life with 3100 mah battery whuch is removable.Micro sd slot for up to 64 gbs of external storage.Cons: Pricey, but you will not need to worry about your device vecoming obsolete before your next device, as its packing the latest and greatest in every aspect besides the 1st and only 1080p display in the USA on the DNA. Which that device has ONLY a 2020 MAH battery, and a few other shortcomings which I don't need to list in this review.A little large,  but as I mentioned you will quickly become accustomed to the size and everything else will feel unnecessarily small. Making myself wonder why I ever wanted such a small device especially with this being pocketable.My conclusion.  This is hands down the best device for all your entertainment,  productivity,  and typical smartphone needs!", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sprint vs. Verizon Wireless", "Author": "Falcon7X \"pgrv1\"", "ReviewID": "R31R80NTRHRYDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will not needlessly critique the mobile phone, as it is the best handset on the market -- largest most attractive screen, extremely thoughtful and intuitive Samsung customized user interface, best battery life.I had been a Verizon Wireless customer for 4 years -- recently on the Galaxy Nexus phone.I use lots of data for streaming investment information, and the Galaxy Nexus was inferior when tethering / mobile hotspotting it to my laptop computer.The Sprint 4G LTE network in Chicago and Rockford, IL is faster than Verizon's.  Likely this is due to the lack of traffic, as Verizon's network was fast a year ago, but much slower now. (2011: 15mbps DL / 10mbps UL, 2012: 4mbps DL / 3mbps UL on Verizon; 2012: 20mbps DL / 15mbps UL on Sprint)Sprint, having a deep pocketed Japanese investor, is poised to be the top carrier in 5 years.  They simply have more wireless bandwidth they intend to leverage.The Galaxy Note 2 I got thru Amazon.com for $100 as a new line of service.  Add  to that the $100 discount for switching from Verizon to Sprint and the GN2 mobile phone was free.  If that were not enough, Sprint offers CREDIT UNION customers 10% off on their bill, AND, waives the $35 activation fee.Sprint deals are simply the best.Lastly, Sprint voice mail service seamlessly integrates with Google Voice.  Google Voice allows for efficient and easy voice mail and calling services.  Notably, when I left Verizon I had forgotten to back up my voice mail messages, and they were lost permanently.  Google Voice emails me the voice mail message as an audio file AND transcribes the verbal message in the email as well.  A feature that is cutting edge, and remarkable.Anyone reading this review must choose this phone, with this carrier -- Sprint.  The $100 discount to switch carriers, along with a credit union discount of 10%, and waiver of the activation fee, makes Sprint #1 in competitiveness.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Innovative.

It is not only fun to use and explore, but seriously one of the most interesting gadgets I've ever used. I bought the iphone 5 first, which I was super excited about at the time. After 2 weeks of glitches, dropped calls, microphone malfunctions, and boring interface I decided to try out the galaxy. WOW. A world of difference. The iphone seems like a dinosaur next to this phone/mini computer. I love my galaxy note II, and having the iphone first makes me appreciate this phone that much more. There are so many cool features, like handwriting texts with the s-pen, burst shot photography, you can make cool and intricate artwork with using the pen and appropriate applications, the list goes on and I'm still learning. This is the best phone I've ever had by far. It has excellent call quality, I have yet to have a dropped call, and unlike the iphone 5 everyone can actually hear me! The screen displays vivid colors and is the perfect size for viewing videos and photos but not too large that it's a nuisance.

It's got a good camera, and the native software do their jobs well. It's good enough for anything I can think of so far, and I'm very happy with its responsiveness. It's a great piece of hardware on the inside, however the outside visual aesthetic is boring (aside from being thin, grey, and smooth) but that doesn't matter if you buy a case. I have a serious case of man hands and this phone feels right.And Google maps is awesome on this phone. One of the biggest reasons why I chose not to go with the new iPhone is because of their sub-par Apple branded map app. I am astounded how manly leaps and bounds Google maps is beyond the Apple Map app. I am very glad I switched, and I am very happy with this piece of hardware.

I teach the computer in my church and found they have 4G coverage in the area and Verizon does not have 4G in the area. It works better. Most of my friend who has I-Phone checked this phone and find this is more responsive and smooth than I-Phone. My daughter should use medical program for her work and her performance goes up because of the faster speed of the response. Because of quad core process, the web response become much faster. I am not worried about the storage because I have installed 64 GB micro SD card. I checked the navigation. This is much smoother than GPS. I am considering to buy the mount and car charger. Once I changed to manual sync from auto sync of my e-mail accounts, the battery can hold 2 days enough. This become the walking entertainment machine for me since you can enjoy the U-Tube.

It can do it all.", "Author": "Calvin H. Phuong \"laker fan\"", "ReviewID": "R11A09WLG5N9IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is about a phone that can do it all.In a couple short years, Samsung has created a new form factor and design to lead us into the future of smartphones. 6 Years ago, my favorite phone was my Treo 650. A trusty Swiss-Army-knife-type phone that was a blend between PDA and cellphone, issued to me by my company at the time. It had everything a professional could want in one package.... albeit a very bulky package.Since leaving that company, I have had quite a few cellphones with NONE of them matching the utility and business acumen of the trusty Treo 650. I played with hardware QWERTY phones and some with snazzy screens and dual cores. Each phone had it's own draw, but none of them covered all the bases. Phones began to get smaller instead of expanding their roles as Digital Asistants.Until now.Samsung has changed the game with this segment-defining piece of mastery. The skills that they have amassed since their entry into the Android sphere have culminated to a device that is part computer, part cellphone and part everything else in between.THIS IS TRULY ONE PHONE THAT CAN REPLACE MANY (IF NOT ALL) OF YOUR DEVICES.I'm not going to get into all the fantastic specs and numbers that this phone currently holds title to, because in the world of smartphones, this will only last a short while. What I want to show you is why you should seriously consider this phone as your device for the next 2+ years.The specs themselves are enough to persuade many to purchase this phone (including myself), but it is the things that don't hit the spec sheet that will make you happy after the inital buzz wears off. Things like the S Pen (Samsung's Stylus that is based on award winning Wacom technology) and Samsung's dedication to cater to everyone make this the perfect companion. Multi-screen, just one of Samsung's many developments, allows you to run two apps at the same time, sharing half of the screen each. You can also dynamically change the amount of screen that each app occupies. Want to shoot off an email while finishing up that YouTube video? Do it at the same time. This is just one example of the Note II's appeal.SIZE MATTERS:My previous phone to the Galaxy Note II was the T-Mobile MyTouch 4G Slide. A QWERTY device with 3.6\" screen. And although the screen on the Note II is nearly 2 inches greater, the flatness of the Note II makes it fit in my pocket more comfortably. The weight is just about perfect with a nice 50/50 balance between all sides. Holding the phone for the first time felt a bit strange as my hand got used to being more open. Within a week, the Note II felt perfectly natural. In fact, I feel quite \"weird\" grabbing an iPhone or my old MT4GS and having to hold it closer to see. I notice that the Note II's viewing position is much more natural for my arm and eyes. Samsung even included toggles to change the font sizes to match your needs, as well as a \"one-handed\" mode in some apps so you don't have to reach across the full screen with your thumb. All other phones look small to me now. The Note II has literally changed me.The screen real estate comes in REAL handy when using SplashTop to remote into my Windows 8 machine. The S Pen doubles as a mouse, if you don't feel like attaching a regular mouse using a USB OTG (On-The-Go)adapter. (That's right: the Note II can use standard peripherals like wired/wireless keyboards and mice). During the my 2 week vacation, I was able to remote into my work computer and stay productive using a wireless mouse and a bluetooth keyboard (Logitech). I'm not even going to get into all the things you can draw and create with S Note and S Pen, you should play with that yourself at a store if possible.Another place that the increased screen size has come in handy is while watching movies and videos. All eyes will hit your Note II when it comes time to share videos with a few people. No need to break out a tablet or computer, everyone will have a good view. And if you want a bigger screen, one button will send your screen images in the gallery to DLNA capable devices (like my Sony Bravia LED TV) to be put on screen.Some people will want to hold out on getting this device since it does not have a full 1080p screen like some that are soon to launch including the Droid DNA. To me, the 720p screen of the Note II does a fantastic job. I cannot discern the difference between pixels, even when holding the phone painfully close to my face. That said, the Note II is able to manipulate the 720 lines of resolution with aplomb, making it an excellent Netflix watching experience. I'm not sure if the extra pixels will make much of a difference.CANNOT HOLD IT DOWNThis phone just cannot be held down. I have seen YouTube videos of torture test that show how much this device can handle. There will be no point at which you will outpace the phone unless you are deliberately trying to bog it down. And with all this strength, you would expect the Note II to have a battery that can hold up to the demands of such a powerful device. And Samsung delivered the goods, mating the Note II with an enormous 3100mAh 3.8V battery (11.78Wh if you're counting). This easily lasts me all day, and I like playing with my phone. The battery is removable if you have any concerns with spares easily available. I have a spare battery and only found it necessary during a plane trip in which it became my movie player.FUTURE PROOFWith technologies like NFC, DLNA, MHL (11-pin), USB OTG, LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, and WiFi 802.11 b/g/n the Note II is FULLY future proof. You certainly won't be \"left out in the cold\" when some companion device comes along and requires one of these technologies to in order to have full funtionality. (i.e. FitBit's BT 4.0 requirement or NFC for contact less payments and sharing).EXCLUSIVESamsung has worked hard to create services and features that other manufacturers do not dare to dream. The social and sharing capabilities of the Galaxy line will make them a coveted group. The Smart Dock (look it up) is just another example of how Samsung is shaping the what we can do with our devices. Being the Flagship device, you cannot go wrong with the Galaxy Note II. And if you don't like the color choices right now, more options will be out soon as Samsung has realized that they have a winner in the Note II.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Bosco kim", "ReviewID": "RDDNI5DU62AL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing phone.

Skeens \"Truly Yours\"", "ReviewID": "R15LJZJAA0WBFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I placed my Amazon order for the Titanium Gray Galaxy Note 2 on Black Friday for $199.  It was a sweet deal because everywhere else, including Sprint, was selling it for $299, and no one would match the special pricing.  Initially it was on backorder with a ship date of Jan 6th, but ended up shipping a month early.  So I received the phone on Dec 6th and been having fun with it ever since.  Its a huge upgrade from my previous phone, so there's a bit of a learning curve.  But its been almost 2 weeks, and I'm loving it!  Just today a buddy of mine asked about my phone because after seeing it in action, he wants to get one for himself.  I showed him the phone on Amazon and noticed the phone is now $99.  Upon calling customer service about their low price guarantee, they issued a refund for the difference.  Sweet deal Amazon!!As for the phone itself, its a real joy to work with.  The screen is gorgeous and the display is really responsive.  No lag whatsoever.  Samsung has really stepped up the quality of their devices.  One of the most repeated arguments against this phone is the size.  But it is a niche device, and the people who buy this phone want it because of the size of the display.  The S-Pen is very precise and the included apps allow you to create as if you were using an actual pen and pad, but without all the crumbled up pieces of paper.  My one and only qualm about this phone is the Smart Stay/Rotation feature, where if its activated the device is supposed to keep the screen orientation on portrait as long as you're looking at the screen.  Should work when you lie down and turn the phone sideways.  It doesn't seem to work all the time, but I suppose that is because it may have trouble detecting some peoples' eyes/face.  Other than that, everything works as advertised.  I did lots of research on the GN2 and other high end smart phones before buying.

I was hesitant but curious about the Note 2. The specs were exciting; the quad core processor? Woof. I was mostly concerned about the overall size of the phone. I went from an iPhone with a 3.5 inch screen to the Note with a 5.5 inch screen.First off, I'm a tall guy with large hands. Navigating the phone with one hand is rarely an issue for me. It is very slim and very light and fits in every pair of pants pockets that I own.I've come to love the size of the phone. There is a transition period to going to a larger phone like this, but I couldn't be more happy with this device. I'm more of an Apple guy and had the option to go with the 5, but I'm perfectly content with my Note for the time being.Battery life is AMAZING. I definitely recommend hooking up to wifi and home and at work if you have the ability to. Configured correctly, I could go THREE DAYS between charges when connected to wifi. That is completely unheard of these days with smart phones. When signal drops, battery tends to drain faster of course, but this is hands down the best smartphone battery life I've ever come across.

I'm a real estate agent and I've never been able to keep up with emails and voice messages like I have with this device. The size of the screen makes it incredibly easy to use.

I usually put it in the seat next to me when I drive because it's just too big to get out of my pocket if someone calls, though. I assume a blue tooth headset would help.My only complaint is that the volume is not that great while I'm on the phone (again, probably solved with a blue tooth ear piece). It's not terrible, but it's not great either. The speaker-phone option is actually good, but I rarely use it. This small annoyance is so far outweighed by the benefits, its not even funny.The battery life is great. It gets me all the way through the day without having to plug in and that's with very heavy usage - I've been an Android user for years and I've never had a phone that will do that.

With music in the  Google Music cloud, I intent to use the memory for video/pictures as a camcorder/camera.I strongly suggest going through Settings and customizing many things as per your desire. I did Voice Input, Keyboard (this comes with English(UK), change to English(US) for example. Fiddle around the settings and you will be amazed how much you can customize. I also did Battery % to appear in notification bar.One thing I found the default keyboard did not show Mic button. I realized it was next to Sym button. Long press it and choose Mic. And then on, it will appear in default keyboard. Also customize the accent. It can do magic for typing. I type paragraphs at a time effortlessly. This is Google backend servers at work. The Mic on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 does a fantastic job!S-Pen, Ah.. I was truly impressed. You have to use these to believe it. The note taking was very fluid. Samsung seem to have nailed it. I wrote up an equation in Equation mode - x^5 = x^2 + 2x + .... Something completely random, another one d/dx(an equation) and it recognized perfectly and asked it to search, it went to Wolfram Alpha and solved it. It is at first unbelievable and then it starts to sink in this is a computer program made well. Like it should be in first place! Export to pdf is very good. The main thing is the pen is very fluid and feels like a fountain pen writing.Overall, the phone feels very smooth and snappy. The screen is crisp and clear. Apps can even be multi screened. Samsung approved apps can be placed two in a screen. Eg. Maps on top and email on bottom portion. I doubt I will use this, but handy.One gripe I have with this phone is speaker is on the back. Typically if you lie the phone down, the speaker is blocked on bottom. I wish the speakers were in the side. This is a design decision and not sure why phones have speaker on back. But the speaker volume is very high, so I am not complaining too much.One big pain point with Android is once you purchased/downloaded for free Apps, they cannot be permanently deleted. So even if you get a junk app, and delete immediately they are permanently there in your Google Play store. From the phone's play store I got 300+ Apps. One cannot choose 50 apps and say get all these. You have to do one by one. After getting one, the screen resets to beginning. So I went to a computer browser and pushed apps to pone. This is easier and faster.UPDATE:  In Jelly bean, you have a circle with a / and pressing it prompts a pop up to delete. After delete it reverts to top of the list again. Why dont they go to same spot. I have hundreds, so it is a pain, nevertheless good feature. I will delete few every day!Some of apps I have as of now :Amazon MobileAndroid Status : Android Status app shows ARMv7, Max Freq 1.6 GHz, BogoMips 1592.52 Memory 1.79 GB, Free 365 MB, Internal Storage 10.46 GB Free 7.18 GB.

When I first started seeing people with these GNs and GN2s I thought to myself that they looked too large for a phone, but after having my own it didn't take more than a few days before anything else just feels too small. The processor is snappy, programs open and do exactly what is expected when called upon. The battery life I'm getting is 20+ hours with moderate use. I've had several days when I went greater than 24 hours on a single charge. I'm a paramedic who works 24 hour shifts, so that kind of battery life from a smart phone is a godsend. I've even been able to easily install Adobe Flash (from the Adobe website archives) and now I can watch Amazon Instant Video on this beautiful screen practically anywhere!! I've not encountered any problems with foreclose issues or random reboots or whatnot.My only concern with this phone is that the first device I owned was working just fine up until a firmware update from Android 4.1.1 to 4.1.2 was forced (Sprint is my carrier), and I suddenly had poor to no reception in many places. It seemed as though the cell radio was averaging 15-20 dBms less than the other 3 phones on our plan in any given area. I don't know if there was a hardware failure that occurred at the same time as the update, or if the update caused the reception problem. But after 2 weeks of \"trouble shoot and wait\" with Sprint tech support, they replaced my original Galaxy Note 2 with a brand new one. The brand new one works excellent, just as good as my first one did - and it still had Android 4.1.1 on it. So when the system prompted me to accept the update to 4.1.2 I declined it because I'm half convinced that the update was the problem with my first device. So now my gripe isn't with the Galaxy Note 2, but with the constant nag notifications that keep prompting me to accept the System Software Update. It's non-stop, and I cannot figure out how to make them quit bugging me already. The only thing I have read about that works would involve 'rooting' my device, but that would void the warranty. So, that's my ONLY gripe with this device.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "best phone ever", "Author": "Christopher Long", "ReviewID": "R2SMIGG1213TUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is worth the money because there is nothing you can't do with it.I paid 700 for it and it has replaced my 1200 $ computer.This isn't a phone its a computer.If you buy one be sure you get the biggest storage model.and a 64 gigabyte sdcard.your going to need it at some point. it's really easy to use it does fit in your pocket.

I upgraded from the HTC Evo 4g and the screen alone is bigger than my entire old phone. If you wear pants with tiny/tight pockets, then you'll have trouble finding a place to put this. That being said, the phone is exceptionally thin and slides easily into my pockets. It's also very light considering the size, however there are definitely lighter phones on the market if that's a key point for you. The big screen is very helpful if you plan to have multiple windows open (a great feature of the galaxy line).B) The phone is more powerful than the SIII if youre looking to compare the two, and while it's not the most powerful on the market, it'll do just about anything you need it to do unless you're often using extremely power intensive apps. The S pen isn't all that great, and I prefer to think of the note II as a large phone rather than a small tablet, but it can pull off tablet-like functions if that's what you're looking for. Most of the functions on the phone are easily found and understood, so whether you're new or a pro, it's easy to manage and learn.C) Call quality is very clear and loud on the phone, although people might look at you funny for holding such a large contraption to your face. The note II is also very intuitive with calling and messaging functions, so it's easy to pick up and learn.D) If you're reading this review than you're probably also thinking of buying this phone through amazon as I did. I upgraded 3 phones on our family plan all through amazon. The process isn't the most streamlined if you're planning on ordering multiple phones, but I do have to give an A+ to amazon's customer service. I had to call during the ordering process to figure out how to order multiple phones, and then again when I got an email saying there was an issue and the order was cancelled. Both times my questions were effectively answered with very polite and helpful people. I then called Sprint to activate my phones and was again pleased to find helpful customer service.I'm constantly learning new and interesting functions on this phone, and may update this review later if there's something I stumble across that needs noting. I own(ed) an HTC Evo 4g, a Nexus 7, and now a Samsung Galaxy Note II.

With the pace that technology is currently speeding at, buying a new phone can be a very stressful task. But after doing lots of research I narrowed my search down to two phones. One being the HTC one and the second being the Note 2. The HTC one is very premium, and had a beautiful 1080P screen. However, what made me go with the note 2 (besides the big screen, very good specs,s pen and great price) was the software it had(touchwiz). Touchwiz on the note 2 is far more superior than HTC's sense. I had come from an Evo 3D so I was quite familiar with the foundation and basic features of sense. Sense is stale and takes away from the Android experience in my opinion. Touchwiz enhances the android experience with the s pen, multiwindow, great camera app, the personalization,  and keyboard. These are very important aspects when buying a phone. The 720P screen is very vivid and beautiful, which was my concern when buying the note. It's very fast, has a great camera,  and a massive screen. It is the perfect size to enable you to fit in your pocket with no problem and is very thin. The battery is phenomenonal too.

Of course, a new 2YR AGREEMENT was required, but this is an $829.99 phone! No mail in rebates... No hidden fees... No phone to trade in.It's been about a month, and the phone continues to exceed expectation. PROS... Very smooth, generally lag free, good battery life, huge display, 16GB internal plus SD compatibility.CONS... I see only one con for certain people, especially females; the HUGE 5.5\" display. I have large hands, and I can barely handle the phone using just one hand. The phone has specific options to make navigating the phone easier, but it doesn't quite cut it. This phone demands two hands.The size also affects the idea of carrying your phone in your pants/jean pockets. I wear baggy clothing with big pockets, so it works for me, but most pockets won't work. And even when you finally squeeze it in... Once you decide to sit down, the phone stabs you in the stomach.Overall... GREAT PHONE! And for $99.99 it is RIDICULOUS!

Beware Amazon Wireless purchasers...", "Author": "Over-Worked Volunteer \"Mary\"", "ReviewID": "R3MRN51YP3ZYW6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was a BB user. Tried HCT - didn't like it - went back to BB. Got the Note II - from Amazon Wireless, with continued service thru Sprint Dec 26th, 2012. LOVE IT!  Then the phone died on March 21st (which was a Thursday).  I had never dropped the phone or done anything else that would have caused it to stop working so I called Sprint - from my land-line - and had to MAKE AN APPOINTMENT (for later that afternoon) to take it to one of their repair shops. (Not all Sprint stores do repairs.) The phone repair store could not do anything with it because it would not boot past the Samsung screen AND wouldn't turn off unless you took the battery out - so they had to order a replacement phone which cost me $50 (because I opted not to pay the $11 something per month for Sprints TEP - Total Equipment Protection when I first started using the phone).  AND FYI, if you think phone insurance will cover it, guess again because there is a $50 to $200 deductible you have to pay first.Before going to the repair store, I had enough sense to bring my old BB (fully charged) phone with me because I was pretty sure they wouldn't be able to `fix' the Samsung. They re-set up my BB to use until the replacement came in the following Tuesday. The replacement is a re-manufactured Note II - and I swear is not working as well as the first one - before it died.  But, that's what I'm forced to accept. Whatever.... My biggest grip - the apps I had on the first phone are gone and I now have to retrace what I had on the dead phone, some of which were free and some I paid for.  The way I understand it, there is no backup program out there that backs-up the apps on your phone.  They may transfer to a replacement phone - IF the broken phone can be accessed - but mine could not.  So, I have had to spend hours of my time since the phone stopped working to try and get back what I once had before it broke. (My photos and contacts were all backed up but not the apps.)Amazon Wireless has no way to take care of you face-to-face and therein lays the problem when purchasing an important item from them, such as a cell phone. I don't know why the phone died - but it did.

The menus in the Note2 are also difficult to navigate unless you know exactly where something is otherwise it could take 10 minutes of searching to turn something off.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone, but ...", "Author": "Ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R3V85UN447PCH9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is an excellent phone.  I love everything about it, except that it keeps rebooting.  Appearntly this is \"known\" problem for these kind of phones.  I swithched from an iphone, which this never happened for years.  I call the customer service to report and return the defective phone.  They don't send you anything before you ship back the phone.  This means you'll be without a phone for a few days.  What do you get?  \"I'm really sorry\" Come on, really sorry???  I asked for an overnight option but they don't have that option.  I guess there is value in getting your phone from a store, where you can get it fixed or replaced on the spot. Especially if you need your phone to work and make a living.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "didn't no one call me", "Author": "Booker Faulkner", "ReviewID": "R33DDXLFPKMDUB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Because my phone is still freezing up and running slow I called in about this and I didn't get a call so I am very very not satisfied? ???", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Terrible Service", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R21CRJPJE6ETAK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a terrific phone, but you won't be able to enjoy it, let alone activate it, because the service is terrible (when it is actually available). The battery life is nowhere near what it's quoted at with Sprint because you are constantly roaming. You never get to experience any of it's features unless you are on a WiFi network. Great device for media, plays all file formats for video and audio. All around incredible device, but the service is god awful. Do yourself a favor and get it through another carrier. I purchased it through Sprint and had to return it the next day, now that I have the Note 2 through Verizon I'm able to experience what the phone has to offer in a whole new light.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy Note II, Titanium 16GB (Sprint)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00A0CIS5C"}}
