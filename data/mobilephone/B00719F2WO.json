Three Android phones later (and also one iPhone later), I decided to take a leap and go with the Lumia 710. I knew it was a low to mid-range Windows 7.5 phone that would not be capable of upgrading to 8, but bought it anyway.I was VERY skeptical, and anticipated sending it back, but I was pleasantly surprised. It does not lag, freeze up, or display any sort of weird stuff that all of my previous Androids displayed. Plus, it synchronizes with everything...I was heavily invested in the Google ecosystem, and it easily synced all my contacts and calendar.The interface is where it really shines. Microsoft has done such a great job (I can't believe I am saying this) creating an ecosystem where everything is very similar in look and feel, using the tile approach. It works very well, and I have really fallen in love with this phone.There aren't quite as many apps as Android or iPhone YET, but quite honestly I found everything I needed, and for free. Microsoft Office even comes built-in.Amazing, amazing phone. I can't put it down. I strongly recommend it. I can only imagine how awesome the new Nokia 920 will be.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its not unlocked", "Author": "scorpio", "ReviewID": "R2BRBK5M91NGEU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product says unlcoked phone, but its locked with T mobile and am not able to use it with other carrier.

After having tried my friends and fiancee phones (iphones, Samsung Galaxy, etc.) I have decided that neither of them was what I wanted. I wanted something extremely intuitive and, possibly, very reliable. After reading plenty of reviews online I decided that, based on my parameters, a Nokia Windows Phone would have been the best fit.I badly wanted to buy the Nokia 920, but it works only with AT&T; which is far from being a decent company from my point of view (one of the worst customer services I have ever experienced and expensive plans). Hence, I decided to try the `smaller brother' of Nokia 920, as a temporary phone while waiting for my provider to sell an excellent Nokia Windows 8 Phone.I have to admit I was a little bit worried because the Nokia 710 still runs with Windows 7 (version 7.8 after the first update), but  I was fairly impressed with man things.Let's make it clear, this is not a phone to compare with the last i-phone or the Samsung Note. In its class of phones, this item is very good. In absolute value, it's a not-bad phone, but I would give it probably 6.5 out of 10.The reasons?Well, the Windows 7 system is somehow the opposite of the laptop Windows 7 system: it gives no problems at all. Never frozen, never had any single problem. The `tile' view is very appealing and intuitive and I like the way one can personalize them. The menu and the design of the system in general makes it very easy to use, even to a first-time smartphone user like my mother.The not-so-good news are the following:1)the battery lasts slightly less than it should. With a couple of hours of conversation, some text messaging and minor searches on the web, the battery last about 2 full days IF one checks the 'save the battery option'. Without this option selected, it lasts only 1 full day.Even worst, once in a while (approx 1 day per week), for no apparent reasons, the battery lasts half than it should, even with the battery saver on.Even worst, if I keep the wi-fi on, and I use the phone as I mentioned before (light use: 2 hours of conversation, text messaging, a few searches online) the battery lasts approx 12 hours.So battery is one of the weak points. On the other hand, very few smartphones lasts really long, and they are usually 3 times more expensive than this one, which takes less than 2 hours to recharge.2) the quality of the call is fairly low. My fiancee complained several times that if keep the phone on my shoulder (while I do other things) and talk to her, she does not understand a word. None of my previous phones gave me this problem. She said that, in general, my voice comes out harder to understand and more robotic than my previous phones.3) The camera is decent, but pictures often come out with colors that are far from the actual ones. Again, I did not buy the phone for the camera (I already knew it was not going to be good), but from time to time it is useful to have a camera handy to take a picture of something, and I would say that this camera is low quality.As another important pro, it is almost impossible to destroy the phone (like every other Nokia I have tried). A friend of mine, in front of me kicked his Nokia 710 against the wall. I told him he must be crazy, but he said that this phone is simply impossible to destroy. So, he kicked the Nokia against the wall, the Nokia split into a number of pieces that he collected back, put them back together and then tried to start the phone again. I would not believe it: it was working like nothing happened to it!Other pros are Nokia Maps (amazing!) and Driving system. I was impressed, and I appreciated that I could just download the maps and then use them whenever I wanted without need of having internet connection (useful when you get lost in the middle of nowhere and there is very poor connection to use the GPS.I cannot tell that much about the music, because I did not use it very much so far, but I used to have a Zone and I liked their system a lot.All in all, the phone is definitely a good value for the money, but it's not a good buy if you want a phone where everything is perfect. This is a good phone with more pros than cons, nevertheless, there are cons that you may need to consider before buying it. For my needs, this phone works very well, and if it were not for the battery life and the quality of the call I would give it 5 out of 5.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows Phone 7", "Author": "Edgar", "ReviewID": "RNI3W6B5GXHYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone software is good to work with it, it`s like having a mini computer, so far for me is the best Phone, as of now the price is not withing my goal, I`ll wait until the original price posted before", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible phone I love it!", "Author": "J Seal \"ILMA\"", "ReviewID": "RWTT2E4ZNYOHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The screen is beautiful.

Also love the easy search feature and how it combines my Facebook and other Social Media with my phone contacts so I automatically have contacts, photos and emails etc before even actually adding anyone as a contact. Love the 'Me' feature which has all the SM Notifications too. It also came with earphones and an charge adapter (but I didn't receive a USB cable for the adapter)I took off a star because:1. The camera could be better2. I am a heavy phone user (calls, messaging, email, browsing, gaming, streaming movies, social media etc and I always have WiFi on).

I have always been an android smartphone fan. I was one of the first buyers of the Google G1 smartphone several years ago. However, I decided that I wanted to give Microsoft's version a shot. It is quite simplistic in relation to many other smartphones on the market, which makes it easier to maneuver through the phones software. However, the limited memory and apps become a problem after a couple of months. Unfortunately, apps that are often free through Google Play cost in Microsoft's Marketplace. In addition, the Marketplace bloats with with lackluster apps. With a small amount of memory and no extra port to add memory, I found that I was constantly having to upload everything on my computer. It really cannot be a substitute for an MP3 player, especially if one takes a lot of photos. By the time I had almost hit my one year mark with the phone, I was quite tired of it. I'm an academic, and I need something more productive--got the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The newer Microsoft phones might be better, but I really wouldn't, considering all the types of android phones on the market, purchase this or any other Microsoft phone.
