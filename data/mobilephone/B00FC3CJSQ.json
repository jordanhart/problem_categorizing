My former phone was quirky after dropping and shattering the screen, even after replacing the screen twice.  I have big hands and was always hitting multiple keys and having to go back and enter stuff again.  I can read most everything without having to zoom in all the time, this with bifocals and almost 60 years of wearing glasses.  Glad I had some Android experience and did not have to learn everything at once.  Rearranged apps, screens and widgets and it is working well for me now.  It is part of an effort to wean myself off an old laptop PC and just exist on Nextel 10 and phone.  Bought it refurbished and had excellent help from vendor.  They noticed my text from Sprint network and alerted me the NT-G1700 model was not set up for my network.  So, I got this model which was able to activate and work out of the box.  Bought a few covers and screen protectors to keep it in good shape.  Happy, happy, happy.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Huge phone, Fast Shipping, Good Seller= Im HAPPY!:)", "Author": "Tyiesha Kidd", "ReviewID": "R1BJN41KZ6S28D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone Monday because i really wanted a Note II for so long. I been looking on ebay but most of them have bad ESN and were damaged so i was like f-that. I went on here and found a few phones but i stumbled across this one because i wanted white...and it had some cheap prices! The one i got from a seller described it as only having a scratch on the side...no biggie for me...and it was only $260. I had to get it! I contacted the seller once to ask about the color of the phone and they replied immediately which was very good. It got shipped off in two days and in the very next day i come home and the package was on my doorstep. I was like...\"Wtf? I know this isnt my phone!\" And it was! I turned on the phone...activated it with no problems! It works very good! There is barely signs of use..it looks like a brand new phone! Even the seller threw in a case which happened to be my two fav colors and an armband for exercising...never been opened! Thats was awesome! I am very pleased with my phone! Thank you!!!!", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not working properly", "Author": "jatae", "ReviewID": "R7TCUDJ5VPE2C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been having problems with the phone since I bought it.
