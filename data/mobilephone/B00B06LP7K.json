I still can't a skin cover OR a screen protector.The keyboard is VERY small, so make sure you're ready to buy a stylus, or at least train your dexterity.I don't like the fact that the music button plays your songs with a single click- I'm scared it might go off when I need serious silent mode. This is easily solvable by pulling down the multimedia volume.The interface is simple as can be. Android's Ice Cream Sandwich is a considerably fast OS compared to Gingerbread, which I used in a tablet before. Yet, make sure you don't open TOO many apps. I've been able to watch an episode on Netflix without the slightest trouble. The RAM builds up quite fast, but then again, it helps if you periodically force a cleanup in the settings menu.Conclusion: Buy it if you can handle a teeny tiny phone and don't plan to use big-ass apps like Document Readers or Angry Birds Star Wars.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "robert wayne kennedy", "ReviewID": "R42BVEWABAZ8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my phone well packed for shipping. The FM radio tuner works fine. The phone is loud, not terribly loud but I can hear with it even with my hearing loss. The cheap ear buds that came with the phone could have been omitted. The only thing that kept me from giving the phone 5 stars is the fact that I have to wiggle the micro usb cable/charger to get it to seat in the phone. Considering the price and that it is aimed at the youth market, I can deal with it. The screen is somewhat small at 3 inches, no false advertising there, but I find it adequate as I am not watching movies on my phone. If the larger screen is important to you phones with 3.5 inch screens can be had for $50 more from the same manufacturer that still have the same dual sim capability. No flash but takes a decent picture when there is enough light. Battery life for me with heavy usage of applications lasts 1.5 days which I consider adequate for calls, data, texts, internet and viber. I just charge it nightly. Of course if I usb tether it to my laptop as a hotspot, it charges off the laptop battery. It's a good budget phone with android 4.04 icecream sandwich operating system. The screen is old/budget tech, not quite as clear as more expensive phones, but still good. If you need a capable dual sim smart phone on a budget, I would recommend this one, even cheaper would be the galaxy y.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really like it", "Author": "vejorge", "ReviewID": "R37FW4G963SCZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great stuff, excellent performance and work perfectly with my carrier (Movistar) in Venezuela.

Loved , Loved, Loved it...Loved the color.  Loved the size (at times wished for a bit larger screen) Though a bit heavy in the pocket - Loved how it felt in my hand. The sound and volume phenomenal !!! Which is why I leaned toward Samsung. So used it on and off mostly for music and shopping on the web since I bought it primarily to use down in another country (so my cell service didn't work here). Which is also why a dual sim. One of these days the people of the US will be allowed freedom from phone plans. The point being my Duos wasn't really getting much use. Then on day 30...internet screen crashed! The internet screen blacked out never to be seen again.

It works well with the 8gb sd card I purchase separately, although I had to format the sd card on the phone before it started working.  The dedicated music button is easy to come on or off in error because for the location it is in.  The headphones are pretty cheap in terms of quality, however the quality of sound from these headphones is pretty neat (superb).  Apart for listening to music with the headphones, there is nothing else you can do expect answering an incoming call.  There is no mechanism on the headphones to forward the next song of adjust the volume like other headphones would do, (I guess this feature would have made the phone more expensive).  All in all it\u2019s a pretty neat phone, beautifully design; however the screen size would limited but still does the job.
