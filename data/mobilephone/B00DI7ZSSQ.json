{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hidden features make this a gem of a phone", "Author": "ank \"independent researcher\"", "ReviewID": "R1B6ZP8W2UJG8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been so curious about Blackberry's fall from grace. The relentless way in which the media gunned for it was sad, especially when its products are so good. I've just received my red Q5 and golly it's a great thing, so I am going to write about it here. My 14-yr old pronounced, 'it has cool written all over it.' She said it looked better than any of the full face touch phones. It is a beautiful object, nice weight in the hand, lovely dimensions, crisp clicking keyboard where the individual characters light up rather than just the keyboard itself, and touch display slightly more pixel dense than the iphone. It also beats the iphone on battery life and expandable memory. I am not going to compare spec with spec, you can do that yourselves, but just to say that this phone is very much less than half the price of an iphone and it has NFC, Flash and wireless HD broadcasting to TVs. BB10 is about productivity. It is a gem of multitasking messaging.  All social media, email accounts, calendar, contacts and other messaging apps that you may use, like WhatsApp and BBM come together in one simple interface.  More than that, there is Blackberry Remember which no reviewer mentions. A Blackberry version of an Evernote-style app that can also integrate Evernote folders, but where you can tag anything like an email, a file like a photo, a voice note or a picture, or any of your messages, and have it collect with other tagged items in folders.  A true bliss of project organisation.  The web browser is really quick. A single entry line serves as input for urls or  search.  You enter your search term and it immediately comes up with web site options that you can select and go to. It all works with from the swiping of your thumb - true one handed operation, until you type, and that is very much quicker than a virtual keyboard.  For one thing, easy access to question marks, brackets and apostrophes which are always on the second screen of the mac virtual keyboard, makes typing a pleasure (at least for what I tend to write).  The word suggestion is marvellous;  it comes up with anything you use regularly, however strange. These are all subtle but effective productivity enhancers which no other smart phone has. Back facing camera is 5mp with a flash, and films in full HD, and there is movie making software bundled in. You can turn a call into a video call without dropping the call and re-dialing like on iphone and android devices. There is also the Smart Tag feature which allows you to make a 'tag' out of anything - email addresses, logos text, calendar dates etc. and pass them on or burn to recordable NFC labels that can be stuck on anything, so that they do things automatically like send you messages or go online to a web page or make a call. Pretty nifty. Easy to share information with NFC devices as well.  Apple's a step behind here. It has a beautiful night feature that no one mentions.  Swipe down from the middle of the top and a crescent moon comes down and turns the display off.  Swiping up from there brings up the luminescent clock which you can set for alarms by swiping around the dial.  You can turn on and off your notifications as well. Swipe all the way up to the top and you are back in the opening notification screen. It has a voice activate function which once got used to was very handy in leaving text notes opening mail and the calendar and doing searches. The search function is exceptionally fast.  It sorts items it finds on your device according to function and you can widen and refine your search to include the web. There are many more features and this extensive review of the Q5 here.[...] pretty much covers everything. The main criticism of these phones is  the idea that a keyboard is so yesterday, and eventually voice will take over.  Well until that day comes there is no phone out there that works as well with one as the Blackberries. No one has found the perfect answer to what humans want from their hand-held devices.  With a Blackberry, Thorsten Heins prediction that no one will want tablets eventually makes a lot more sense. A phone like this at the core of working on the go which can then dock into screen and keyboard at the office seems nearer than ever. I am not interested in playing games on my phone nor watching movies, though the sound played through speakers and video playback on the Q5 are terrific. A fundamental criticism for me is the price.  I think Blackberry got their pricing very wrong with their flagship phones, even the Q5 may be priced about 10% too high, and this is why Blackberry is in the position it is in. But if you want a phone for productivity and you can get this phone at any kind of discount, I would heartily recommend it.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Juan Yonzo", "ReviewID": "R27QTTXU8J6RM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this mobile phone for my father because he doesn't like all-touch phones.When I was setting it up, I was surprised for  the speed of the OS, its really fast.It feels good to the hand, the keyboard is very nice and the touch sensitivity is ok too.The best is the multitasking feature.

The keyboard of course is terrific, the LCD screen is very bright with excellent colour (not strange looking like AMOLED).  The OS is super smooth and multitasking is unmatched on any other platform. The speaker and battery life are exceptional (way better than the price would suggest).  I use the phone for business and thought I would give the Q5 a try.

Ricciardi", "ReviewID": "R3DCUFU9LS0686", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this phone for two weeks in Argentina. No issues so far. It was just what I expected. Does not work with my BB plan, though, gotta get a full data plan. Still, it works great. I'm replacing a torch 9860, and it feels like heaven to have keyboard again.The phone is not fancy, but seems a work-beast so far. No memory issues or whatsoever. Do not expect a stylish finish or a bold-type keyboard. However, its perfect for work. And delivers. Ideal for the road warrior.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A really good value if you are looking for a solid smartphone with a physical keyboard", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R1PW290Q8FMQTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a great combination of physical keyboard and the BB10 OS. The phone is light and easy to carry around. I've dropped it several times already and not even a scratch, so it has a sturdy build just like most BlackBerry devices.The keyboard is comfortable to use.Battery life is really good. Lasts all day even with Wi-Fi on.The cameras (front facing and rear facing) are nothing special but get the job done.Screen: Big enough, you sacrifice a bit of space for the keyboard but it's a good compromise if you want the physical keyboard.BB10 OS: Fast, responsive, a good selection of apps, plus all Android apps will be readily available to install in BB10 phones after the next OS upgrade (coming in early 2014). I found the BB10 OS quite easy to learn. It took me about a day to get used to the gestures and new menu structure.Overall I am very happy with this phone. For anyone who is having trouble deciding between the Q10 and Q5, don't be afraid of going with the Q5 if you want to save some money.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent cost for its benefits", "Author": "Ronnie Lot Sergio", "ReviewID": "R11DJ385WSQNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent price for product features, BlackBerry10 system is very good and easy to use.Product appearance is ok, Q10 is nicer but not to cost USD300 more.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Aruscito", "ReviewID": "R270IOMUBU92Q7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my iPhone for this BB Q5.

This has it all. BB is going to make, don't believe the nay sayers out there, why are all the iPhone and Android users downloading BB Messaging if they thought BB was so bad. This is a secure phone too, serious users all over the world trust BB.

It was either 78% or 82%. Either way, that is impressive.I love that the keys are spaced farther apart so typing is much easier than on the BB Curve. I am still getting used to it, but overall I like the phone. The combo of touch and keyboard is great. Some of the stuff is not intuitive. I had a hell of a time trying to figure out how to change the main ringtone. I could figure out how to give each individual contact a special ringtone if I wanted to, but I could not figure out how to change the general ringtone. The answer was not in the online manual and, to be honest, I have no idea how I finally got the answer, but I actually had to spend time on the internet looking around for the info. The sound quality is great. I can dance to the ringtones :-)It is bigger and slipperier than the BB Curve, but I bought the rubber casing thing for it that has grips on the side. I do miss the smaller size, but I'll get used to it. I also liked this over the Q10 because the keys on this are actually separated whereas the Q10 has them connected.Would buy again.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Monica Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R22BHWTXUJ0BGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using it  at Venezuela by several days now and it it just an excellent cel phone totally recomended.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beware, not BIS anymore!!", "Author": "Jorge Martinez", "ReviewID": "RQ3Y30LPLW473", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Do not forget that any previous BIS/BES data account you may had with your previous BB device is not valid any more!!

Camera is good, nothing special, but better from older versions.Screen sensibility it's awesome. OS it's very fast, switching from app to app it's quite easy.

Had it supported my LTE service, and had it not been stolen, I might have gotten over the keyboard thing and ultimately declared it the smartphone bargain of a generation, because I generally think BlackBerry overall suffers from even worse luck than I do (and I had *five* phones stolen last year!) w/r/t its eternally crappy PR. The Q10 is an exquisite phone, and the BlackBerry 10 operating system is as intuitive and robust as they come.
