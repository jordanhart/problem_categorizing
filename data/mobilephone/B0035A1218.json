Even though the Palm Pre was abandoned by Palm and sold to HP who shelved it. It is still competetive in the cell phone market. This Primarily due to the fact that the initial technology was so far advanced. If more apps were created for this phone and the manufacturers would get behind it I think this phone could still flourish, A lot of consumers such as myself are looking for alternatives to I-Phones. For me personally the phone meets most of my personal and business needs, an as long as it available I belive I will be an owner.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality extremely low", "Author": "Paulo", "ReviewID": "R73AA50BTGWQ0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Phone was scratched and damaged more that the description, I needed it as an emergency but after seeing the conditions I decided not to use it...", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "good back up", "Author": "Mannie C.", "ReviewID": "R2N8KERU5E6F58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "not even a 3G but it was good as far as battery life, lasted me 2 days with out charging(smart phones cant do) good back up phone i keep it in my car just in case", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "What I Needed", "Author": "Jamal Fruster", "ReviewID": "R2J6JZ8M02VT11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just what I needed.

The phone arrived in a generic Sprint box not specific to the model, and it had a user manual from a later version of the phone - the Verizon Palm Pre 2, which is a different handset with different hardware.  After a memory problem came up in the first week I took the phone into the Sprint store and they told me it was refurbished.  I also checked ##786# diagnostics and it shows a recondition date.  I emailed the seller stating I was overcharged because the phone was listed as a new handset but it was actually reconditioned.  I requested a partial refund and the correct user manual but got no response.  The phone looked unblemished when it came and it works OK but I think I overpaid and I had to download and print the manual myself.  I'm not a satisfied customer since I was overcharged and got no response from the seller about my issues.

I have loved it ever since. It's a brilliantly designed OS and cell phone. I'm hard-of-hearing, so the calling parts has little value for me. I e-mail, txt, and read NewsRoom a lot on it. It's very convenient. I especially love the ability to have an unlimited no call list on the cell phone, and won't even go to voice mail. I had my original cell phone for some 3.5 years... recently the screen cracked from running after the city buss and I dropped it. The battery was at the end of it's life, and I was going to just replace that, but the screen became to unreliable... Thankfully for me I was able to get another brand new one here in Amazon. Paying $120 this time while including a touch tone and Palm leather case, I was thrilled, I paid some $300 just for the cell phone 3.5 years ago. I was able to go online to Sprint, beside my cell phone I hit activate a new cell phone, Did that and typed in the special cell ID, and in minutes I was already on my new cell, I feel so brand new again! The only thing I wish would be for the ability of the Pre 3 to run on Sprint, I so wish that was possible, apparently the Verison's CDMA is not like the Sprint's CDMA and therefore won't work. All in all, I am happy with this cell phone and really wish webOS was still alive in the mainstream.
