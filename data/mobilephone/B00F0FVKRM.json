{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Important About Unlocked Note 3 Phones", "Author": "Ryan Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2B4S3OCXBH9XZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone. But before you buy the unlocked version their is some information you need to know about the different models of the phone(s). The Galaxy Note 3 was released in many country's on every continent. Although anyone can buy the phone from any country; each model was made to work on different frequencies. In this review I am going to go over each model of the Galaxy Note 3 and the services recommended for use with them.But First everyone may be asking about the Region lock attached to the phones. Yes before the phones are unlocked their are region locks attached to the different models forcing them to only accept SIM cards from their designated country's. But after unlocked the Region locks are removed. Does this mean that all models will work everywhere, no, but I will be going over if the phone will work in your region after the locks are removed in the model descriptions below.Second the different levels of service. Depending on your area and the service towers available their you will get different letters to indicate service level and the speed you're getting. Below are the most common levels and their average speeds in order for your reference during the Model review.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal avalible for the data internet conection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I still recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to comfortable able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (360P recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be also flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like netflix(Recommended 460P), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that most 2010-2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable it is not LTE but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on their phone this signal is more than enough to give you a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal that everyone is going after. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Now for the common phone models:1. SM-N9000 3G = International/Made for Travelers: This is the international model. This one has a dual quad core processor running at 1.9 GHz Cortex/1.3 GHz A7. The reason for the processor being change is because this phone is meant to work everywhere their is a GSM signal and kicks threw the different processors to maximize signal strength. The N9000 CAN NOT to 4G speeds of any kind. This is due to most country not having 4G signal and that a lot of county's run on different cell frequencies. By removing the 4G radios this phone can pick up way more cell frequencies then the other models. This phone is not made for people looking for Data speed this is made for travelers whom want a reliable way to have cell service no matter where they are. Don't despair about the data or processing speed this phone still has Wi-Fi connection available and can breeze though 3D games; you shouldn't even notice a speed difference when doing tasks.2. SM-N9005 4G LTE = European Model/International: This model contains the regular 2.3 GHz Snapdragon Processor. This phone unless unlocked is Region locked to only European SIM cards, after unlocked their is no region lock. Although this phone is an LTE phone it can only get LTE frequencies while in Europe. When you take this phone out of Europe it will get international signals but will not get LTE, when this phone is in the USA is will get H+ (Reference above) signal maximum.3. SM-N9002 3G = China Model/Select Counties: This model is not LTE or 4G compatible. This was the First generation of the Note 3 released and is considered the Beta. With all the same hardware as the LTE version this phone will still preform flawless tasks.4. SM-N900W8 4G LTE = China Model/Select Counties: This model will only get LTE in select counties and I advise you check with your service provider to see what signal you will be getting. This model is completely subjective as to what frequencies of LTE you will be about to get. Example: Imagine you are in Europe and you are in a city and get LTE. Then you move to another city and you lose LTE this is because the first city runs on an LTE frequency the the phone can get but the second city although may offer LTE to most cell phone; does not offer LTE on a frequency this phone can't run on.5. SM-N900A 4G LTE = USA AT&T;/Worldwide: This phone is International but you need to consult AT&T; to see if you city or county can get LTE service or not. This phone once unlocked will work on Straight Talk, Solavei, T-Mobile, and any other GSM based network. Note: When using T-Moble, Solavei, or other services that piggy-back on the T-Mobile towers you can get LTE service but depending on your area you may not get 3G. If you live in a 3G area consult your carrier to see is the frequencies for 3G match up with this phone. (This review for the AT&T; model can change at anytime due to AT&T;'s bootloader)6. SM-N900T 4G LTE = USA T-Mobile: This phone when unlocked can get all USA frequencies. Example: You will have no problems using a AT&T; SIM card with this phone and even get 4G LTE threw any service whom provides is. The N900T model is the most versatile model out of them all and if you plan on getting one I recommend going to a T-Mobile store and purchasing this model outright. Unlocking this phone is easily done threw calling T-Mobile and even using YouTube for an unlocking video.So out of all the models the N900T is the most versatile, but unlike the N900A (The second most versatile) the N900T is harder to find online already unlocked so you will most likely need to buy if from the store and unlock it yourself.I hope this review has helped with you decision about what unlocked version to buy.If you have an questions or addition to the review please leave a comment.Video review of phone Specs and features coming soon.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title":

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone.

I will be glad to answer any questions.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Technical/Hardware Masterpiece", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R1N6V0VBCEVY53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year I owned the Galaxy Note 2. I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are getting very very interesting....Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. There are a handful of improvements:  * The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.  * You will also find out that it is a bit brighter. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(when auto brightness is turned on).  * Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. However, it is still not as good as the HTC One's screen. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). As a whole however, and because of its Pentile pixel system, it comes just a bit short of the HTC One's Super LCD 3. It is really nitpicking though, so you won't ever regret this.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content!3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all, I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS:There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. With rumors of a new Galaxy line, this may be changed very soon though. Also, the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative. This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and awesome battery life.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this phone!", "Author": "DANIEL G.", "ReviewID": "R2J9UWLTEBGRBF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am advising everyone to stay away from third party seller.

If you live in the US and looking to buy a smart phone such as Samsung galaxy 2,3,4,  note 2,3 etc, you don't have to purchase an unlocked phone, all you need to do is to purchase a sim card from straight talk, tmobile, so on then get your sim card activated then insert it into your att or tmobile devices , no activation is necessary especially for the pre paid users. All you need to do is to set your access point under settings.

I consider myself from a moderate to heavy user depending on the days. Some of my daily phone activities include:-SMS. Receive & sending simple text messages to/from office colleagues, staff & business associates.-Email (yahoo & Gmail). Checking & emailing for both personal & work.-Messengers such as WhatsApp, Viber, Skype & Facebook to connect people locally & worldwide. I love these messengers as I can insert emoticons & attach photo, etc. :)-Chrome. I use this to check on the latest local & international news, browse the internet for info & sometimes also do shopping & banking.-Facebook groups. I'm a regular user & check for updates whenever I have the spare time! :)-Photo/game.  From time to time during my \"non-office\" period or in a long traveling, I will occupy myself with some relaxation along the way. I'm also a photography enthusiast & love to take photos whenever I have the opportunity. All photos taken are sync to my cloud service (Dropbox).-Video/Music. Youtube is my best companion. I love watching movies, hence I download all the latest trailers & watch them in my N3. I also, download lots of music video (MTV) & other interesting video clips. I also transfer some TV series/movies into my N3 in case I have to endure a dull day or on a business trip. Therefore, the max 64GB micro SD comes in very handy!-Waze Social GPS Maps & Traffic. Occasionally, I use this community based mapping, traffic & navigation app.-On weekdays, my phone is connected to mobile data on a daily basis usually from 6am until 11pm.I will not dwell into the outstanding specs of this phablet as I'm sure most of you are aware. If not, you can easily look them up over the net. I will share my thoughts particularly from a user's point of view that has never use a Galaxy Note before. Let's start with the pro.The Good:1. Display.I find the screen size at 5.7\" is just right for my need. While the Galaxy S4 is great but the display is a tad too small (I would scream each time I used the multi-window mode!) & it's quite stressful for my eyes especially during long hour session of reading/replying emails, reading company reports, etc.  Now, my eyes are very comfortable viewing the N3 big display!2. Battery life.On a regular work day, my N3 can last an average 14-16 hours! That's a huge improvement compare to my S4 which lasted about 8 hours only! I'm very happy as I only need to do a single full charge once a day before I left for work unlike my S4 which require 2-3 charging per day.Samsung Galaxy S4 has a Li-Ion 2,600 mAh battery which is capable of making it through a work day (about 12 hours) of moderate usage. The bigger N3 has a battery to match (Li-Ion 3,200 mAh) and even though has a larger display, N3s processors are more battery-friendly, so with moderate usage, I expect it to have a battery life spawn longer than a day.Charging time from 25% to 100% full took less than 2 hours. The N3 is also the first phablet to include support for USB 3.0, which enables faster data transfers and charging when attached to a compatible port. The regular USB 2.0 still can be used for data transfer & charging but at a much slower rate.3. Speed & overall performance.N3 is a monster! If you're familiar with the An Tu Tu Benchmark app, my N3 got a nice score at 32,910! Currently, N3 is occupying the top spot in the Bar Chart.4. Heat.Those of you who are familiar with Galaxy S4 know the heat issue is very irritating. From very warm to HOT just in a short while of usage esp with the mobile data switch on. At times the handset would become so HOT that it's impossible to put your ear near the earpiece to make or answer a call. However, in the N3 the heat resistance is very good! (I spoke too soon. See below)The Not So Good:1. Size.It's a double-edge sword here. All these years, I got used to using phones in one palm. N3 really change the outlook! Luckily, N3 comes with the \"One-handed operation\" feature where you can adjust the scale & position of the screen so that you will able to use it with one hand. This feature come in handy for functions such as calculator, dialing keypad, keyboard & the unlock pattern.The other inconvenience is for those who love to wear jeans or tight pants. Seriously, it's a hassle carrying it around inside your pocket with the N3 bulging! If you're wearing normal pants then you can put it inside your pocket with ease.2. S-Pen (stylus).Initially, I find it to be very annoying & frustrating in removing the S-Pen from the N3. Don't let this tiny, cute & innocent stylus fools you! It has its own attitude especially when you're in a hurry & try to quickly detach it. After a few days, I'm getting the hang of it. I can't imagine those with huge hands, it could be a nightmare!3. Heat.I was playing the Zombie Vs Plant 2 game for about 15 minutes & noticed the handset became quite warm. Fortunately, it doesn't occur during video & music playback. I watched a movie for about 2 hours & there was no heat issue. So if you're a game lover, as a precaution you might want to let your handset rest for a while (to cool down)after a long period of game play.4. SIM slot.Geez, besides the S-pen here's another annoying predicament, I find it hard to believe Samsung decided to remove the standard \"spring-load\" SIM slot in this high-end phablet! In most phones, you can easily remove your SIM by using your finger nail to press it in & release. This mean once your SIM card is inserted, it's impossible to remove it with your bare hands or nails without the assistance of any tool (tweezer, clip, etc). To see how you can remove the SIM in this tricky situation, check out this video/tip link: [...]**Will update if I discover more cons.****************************************************************************************Main Features:S-Pen (digitizer stylus). I must admit I'm not a huge fan of stylus but with the N3...Wow..this is cool esp if this is your first time using a Galaxy Note! The N3 highlight is its new features offering the Air Command which gives you quick access to Action Memo, Scrapbooker, Screen Write, S Finder & Pen Window.Action Memo is basically a note taking app (similar to the Stick-em note). It's very useful when you need to quickly write down a person's name, contact or email (any short & simple details). Once done, you can select the specific info & use it to send a SMS text, create a new contact, send an email, open the internet browser or even set it as your new task. For a longer write up, you may use S Note.Scrapbook. Similar to a real Scrapbook that our kids (or ourselves) love to do. You can easily collect any photo, words, quotes, emails, or web sites with links and store them into your Scrapbook for future reference. E.g. You're planning a trip to Paris for the first time together with your wife, hence you collect all photos relevant to Paris point of interest & store them all in your Scrapbook.Screen Write. It does what it says, it captures a screenshot & let you write on the screen. Once done you can keep it or send it to your friend, etc! For E.g. Two weeks ago, I took a photo at a bakery. It shows a variety of breads & buns. I want my brother to buy some on his way home. I highlight by making a circle sign on the specific bread that I want & scribble a note \"Pls buy 5. Thanks, bro!\" A picture speaks louder than a thousand words.S Finder. It's a quick search tool for content on your handset & on the web. E.g. You want to retrieve a music clip but can't recall the exact folders as you have hundreds of music stored in your handset but you do remember the name. No worry, just type in the music name & viola!!Pen Window. This let you access to some \"mini\" apps that float on top of your screen or your current app. Some of the mini apps in my menu are: Calculator, clock, phone, contacts, ChatON, Hangouts, internet & WhatsApp. These are apps are exactly the same as the regular apps. It's just that the size has been scaled smaller & you can move (float) it any place on top of the screen, enable you to access for other info while doing a task on your current screen/app. It's another multitasking.******************************************************************************************To know/learn more about the S-Pen & S-Note, I recommend this Youtube video:Samsung GALAXY Note 3 S Pen and S Note New Features.

Search the web for Galaxy Note 3 SIM Restrictions and you will see why. It seems these phones are region-locked by Samsung as an attempt to prevent grey-market imports. The phones are blocked from using SIMs from other regions - e.g. if you buy a Note 3 in Europe, you can't use a Chinese local SIM when traveling in China. Many people do this sort of thing to avoid heinous roaming charges.Samsung have stated that if the first SIM you use with the phone is one from the \"home region\" of the handset then the region lock is automatically lifted. However, there have been several posts from users on the web who have stated this is not the case. These users have been blocked from using local SIMs even though they had first \"activated\" their handset with an in-region SIM before traveling.My advice is do not buy this handset if you think you will ever need to use it abroad without paying roaming charges to your home carrier.(Thanks to Simon Jerrie for the heads-up).", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "TMO Galaxy Note 3 Review", "Author": "zero1000100", "ReviewID": "R33TH382VVMTE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not often that I come across a piece of technology that completely changes my day to day routine. That changes the way that I interact and utilize the tool that's in my pocket. More so, a piece of tech that breathes life back into my passion for technology and the modern smartphone landscape.The Galaxy Note 3 is one such device. For a bit of background I've used every major OS that is on the market now as well as some casualties of the Smartphone War. I've bounced back and forth between the current giants of the land but I've at times ventured away towards the outcasts. My last experiment was with a Nokia N9 running MeeGo which overall wasn't a bad experience but the dated hardware made me forfeit that journey early on.Enter the greatest smartphone in the World! The Galaxy Note 3! Sorry, I don't mean to sound so dramatic but at the same time...I do. That's just how enjoyable this experience has been overall.Everything about this device has me wanting to tell every person that I see to go and buy one. I try and show them cool features or just how beastly this device is and even with my impeccable sales skills my praises fall on deaf ears. Not because what I'm saying isn't a good enough example of the Note 3's superiority to every other device on the market currently. The issue is that all the features that make this N3 amazing are things that you have to experience first hand. The first time that you're on a call and take an Action Memo or your first Scrap Book creation or your first Sketch Book sketch. These are all things that need to happen naturally while using the device for you to sit back and think, \" Wow...this phone is awesome!\".That's really the point to all this is that these are all things that you have to experience for yourself . I don't find it a coincidence that within Best Buy stores are Samsung Experience Shops. It's all about user experience and how their products differ and how it makes you feel. That in my opinion is the most important aspect of Apples business model that they copied or modeled themselves after. It's all about user experience in day to day operation and \"almost\" nothing else. I say \"almost\" because I've used enough Android devices to know specs matter on an Android powered smartphone.I could drone on and on about the industry leading specs of the Note 3 but I'm not. Maybe they don't lead in every single category but as a whole its the Champion. It's actually the first Android smartphone that has my iFriends saying \"Dude, I would use that Android phone over my iPhone in a heartbeat!\". That little satisfying confession has zero to do with specs and everything to do with user experience in THIER eyes. Realistically, it's actually the insane spec sheet that is making this Note 3 so amazing to use as a daily driver. I'm sure they have no idea what the specs of their iPhone are nor do they care. Simply because that's not what Apple pushes. They push experience and status. Samsung has started on the same campaign as of late. If I knew just how awesome the Note line was I would've picked one up a long time ago. Though I fully believe that it's the Note 3 specifically that has reignited my passion for mobile tech and expanded my perception of the usefulness of electronic gadgets.Clearly I'm more than satisfied with my purchase of the Note 3 . More than that though, I'm excited again to pick up my phone and use it. Heck, I find any reason to pick it up to use it for whatever or nothing sometimes simply to look at that gorgeous display. It also makes me excited to see what's on the horizon. Just to add a little more perspective, I'm someone who used to make fun of the entire Note line and all phablets for that matter. The reason for this was my ignorance of the Note line.Bottom line : Each and every time that I pick up my Note 3 there's a smile on my face. I look forward to a reason to pick it up and I find myself pulling out the S Pen to do anything every time I use the N3. I highly recommend all smartphone lovers to at least give it an honest test drive. I guarantee that you won't come away disappointed. It may not be the device for you but I don't think you will be able to deny it's appeal and usefulness.Best/favorite Android device to dateP.S.

I talked to the stateside service folks (no go, 9005), I talked to Indian service centers (nope, 9005), Finally I sent it to england and now it is stuck in a Geeksquad center (a contract service provider) who cant fix it, guess why.... they need the email and password!

I didnt need to use it though.The phone came in a locked Samsung box, brand new with all of \u00edits devices plastic wrapped from factory.The only (really minor) problem was that the instructions came in French, which I solved peeking at google translator until I changed the language to English, although I could have chosen a variety of languages, including Portuguese.Great phone!", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Phone I ever had.", "Author": "Paris Piedade Neto \"Paris Neto\"", "ReviewID": "R3SEB25VLL3EED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's is awesome.

But Samsung is not selling phones anymore.Samsung is selling user license.I moved to NEXUS 5.It is not about hacking the Galaxy Note 3. It is about the categorical principle of \"Open Source\". Android was born as an open source project:[...]Region Lock is a proprietary move against Open Source Philosophy:[...]\"Open Source\" is not only an immaterial way of doing and creating, but the main value remains in the process rather than the end-product or result. As von Busch indicates (2009: p39): it is doing rather than having. This could be paralleled with \"buddhist economics\" by E.F. Schumacher (1973)12:\"production by the masses, not for the masses\" - the materialist is mainly interested in goods, the Buddhist is mainly interested in liberation. Just like the buddhist monks draw on the sand and accept that the next minute their performance is washed away by the waves. It is one way to fight the ego. \"The Buddhist point of view takes the function of work to be at least threefold: to give a man a chance to utilize and develop his faculties; to enable him to overcome his ego-centredness by joining with other people in a common task; and to bring forth the goods and services needed for a becoming existence(Schumacher, 1973). From the Buddhist point of view, there are therefore two types of mechanization which must be distinguished: one that enhances a man's skill and one that turns the work of man over to a mechanical slave, leaving man in a position of having to serve the slave. The machine must be treated as a tool for a cra$sman, not the other way round. Likewise in open source philosophy, the information, tools and design contain the most value.

I guess I missed one. I understand this is the \"International Version\" but I greatly doubt it won't have this MAJOR defect....Okay, so I got a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 through Verizon Wireless's \"Edge\" program, which is their monthly installment program (NOT the international version, the $700 version). The 24-month installments was to be around $29 / month. I ordered it over the phone to replace the HTC One Max. I wanted a phone that had some feel and functionality of a tablet, but not as huge and ridiculous... I guess this is called a \"Phablet\" - combination of phone and tablet. The HTC One Max was still too big, heavy, clunky. BTW, the HTC One Max DOES have great battery life and great sound because of dual front-facing speakers... Anyhow, so I got the Galaxy Note 3...I couldn't get the Note 3 activated... Had to call into Verizon Wireless and pry out the SIM Card (with the Note 3, this is NOT an easy task), in order to give them the SIM Card number. So, it got activated...I noticed first while playing a game app for long time (let's say over 30 min, but I think it started sooner than that), the screen would DIM itself, then return to brightness level I had it on. Anyhow, it KEPT doing this, at random periods, and for 5 seconds or so each time.I went into settings, made sure brightness was on MAXIMUM, and \"automatic\" was OFF. Also, I checked and changed the video options... Like HD TVs, there's different video modes - \"dynamic\", \"standard\", and \"movie\", or something like that. It did not matter what I changed it to, it kept doing this.I tested this on other applications, and it did same thing. I called and got the Note 3 replaced for what I and Verizon Wireless thought was a defective device. When I received the new Note 3, it had same issue. It happens even without a cell phone case on it, BTW, but it takes a little longer for it to occur. Oh, and if you keep using it or playing games PAST when it starts doing this, it will start dimming it to what seems like the MINIMUM brightness. Can you imagine how irritating this can be? Now, grant it, it seems to occur FASTER if you play a game, but it WILL occur, no matter WHAT you are doing, if it's on Max brightness for an extended amount of time. After calling Verizon Wireless again, and checked into information from Samsung... and I even spoke to Samsung myself about it... this IS a DEFECT, but it's a defect built into EVERY Note 3.Why would a $700 phone be doing this? Why have full HD display, quad-core cpu, 3 gb RAM, and great life battery, if you can't fully utilize them? Apparently, this is a feature to prevent overheating. Could you imagine watching a movie and this happen? Just saying... because even though this happened with my game, this will happen no matter WHAT you are doing. So, if you are a heavy gamer, or heavy internet browser, or movie watcher - either way, this WILL occur.I had to open a new line on my account in order to get ride of this nasty nonsense piece of trash. Seriously, a $700 phone acting like a $200 phone. Seriously, this phone is a waste of time! I am surprised there's not more people complaining about this! Leave these features to the phones that are prone to overheating - not a $700 beast of a phone that should be able to do all this EFFORTLESSLY!  Major epic fail, Samsung - major epic fail!Also, it uses higher percentage of its RAM than its competitors without doing anything on it. I had to kill a lot of tasks on it frequently to get it down just under 50% of its RAM - the Moto X and Droid Maxx, same killing of tasks brings it down to under 40% of its RAM - and those Motorola phones only have 2 GB Ram, and the Note 3 has 3 GB Ram. That's bloatware for you, I guess.Stay away from the Galaxy Note 3!", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung Kies synchronization software - quality reaches a new low, beware if you want to this phone for media", "Author": "P.

As a tech-savvy engineer and former wireless industry analyst and consultant, I haven't seen commercial software as bug-laden and user hostile as Kies.It would be easy to go on forever about ever problem with Kies, but suffice it to say it is such a bad product that only phrase used to describe the Yugo is fitting \"quality reaches a new low.\"  Various iterations of Kies crash or hang during the synchronization process.  There have been constant communication errors with the device. Some items would mysterious only partially sync -- partial playlists or songs from the playlists would be absent.  It would hang on podcasts.With Kies 3.0, Samsung has eliminating most of the problems by eliminating virtually all of the features.  There is no synchronization or importation of Itunes elements (e.g. playlists, podcast). After a forced upgrade from 2.6 to 3.0, the user notices all of the functionality has been eliminated.

Very avid reader.  However, can't customize multitask apps, or pen window apps besides Samsung's own...their browser ain't the best.  Everything else is very customizable.One of my biggest gripe is that they added so many features, they also tried too \"clean up\" options.  Now you can't disable lock screen notifications without also disabling status notification.  Why would I use a lock screen and show people my messages.It's still at it's infancy, but getting better.
