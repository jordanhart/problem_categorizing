I chose the 9320 as I am a believer in reading reviews and saw it had a good track record.  I was not disappointed.  It keeps me organized and everything comes straight to my phone which is very convenient (and a bit annoying).  Takes really good quality pictures (thanks to the flash) and has a very user friendly layout.  I am definitely going to have to source a case as it is quite light weight as compared to a 8520 and is more prone to accidents.  I like the look and it really serves its purpose.  Good buy.  Comes with a 2GB memory card though so beware of that.  the head phones have good sound and it comes with the USB/charger, installation CD and instructions.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone, good battery, 3G but with not good screen", "Author": "AyanD", "ReviewID": "RZR36FIOZCJSH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for a gift for my father.

Phone itself is good looking, easy to handle, okay call quality, okay camera and has a costly feel. But I am disappointed with the display. It is a small display which is okay, but at the same time it is low resolution even for the smaller screen.

The phone had dust under the screen and came in a strange (probably fake) box without a berry symbol next to the logo type. All the accessories were new and included though.CARRIERI have AT&T; in the U.S. and the phone was unlocked and clean (no carrier info/settings) so manually programming the phone was difficult, even with AT&T;'s help. Nonetheless, it did work very well on AT&T;'s network and it had very fast data speeds. The call quality was very clear and SMS was like clockwork.HARDWAREThe phone itself worked well, everything was sturdy and felt very new. The speaker is very loud and clear, the display is decently sized and of good resolution.COMPLAINTSThe only big complaint I had was the keyboard. I'm 6'2\" and 270lbs. I'm a pretty big guy. I have decently big hands and the keyboard was near impossible to type on. Other than that, the phone is good but BEWARE OF SELLERS CALLING IT \"NEW\" if it's not.I ended up returning this phone for the 9900/9930 Bold Touch though.
