{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Way better than a Razr!", "Author": "Julie L. Hyde", "ReviewID": "R2NFN1V99XKKPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing does everything a razr can do, but without all the software bugs. Alao, its design is far better, its not so long and wade, it slips right into your pocket because there isnt an antena or sharp edges. Its also very durable, I'v dropped it twice and it still works perfectly, and whatever material surrounds the metal casing is virtually scratch-proof, so it still looks great too.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "A beautiful phone but with some limitations", "Author": "Helen Hancox \"Auntie Helen\"", "ReviewID": "R8OLI9BYWP6UT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one. My original one was a free upgrade but after two weeks I was willing to spend \u00a3100 on a replacement. I liked it that much.I've now had my PEBL for over six months. I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with. Despite the poor quality of photos I still give it 5 stars because I think it's that good. It won't suit everyone but that's why there are hundreds of different models of phone out there!", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect Pink Phone", "Author": "X", "ReviewID": "RFYF4CULR2M1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really am happy with this phone overall. The pros: great color, it's not a RAZR so not everyone has one, I like how it opens up, looks great, works great. The cons: slightly bulkier than I'd like it to be, because it's an unlocked forgeign phone, some of the spelling of words are different than what we Americans are used to. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone who wants something that works like a RAZR, functions like one, but just doesn't look like one. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. I am on a Cingular network plan, and it works just fine.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, crappy battery", "Author": "AimVicBen \"Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R2TR3EPWL1O4YR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is super sexy and has awesome features.  It does a lot more than your typical razr phone, I love the voice feature of just being able to say what number i want dialed and it will dial it.  No need to program your voice for each name or number, It just knows!  The only flaw with this phone is the battery dies SOOO fast!  My old phone held a full charge for about 2 days before the battery starts to die, with this phone, the battery is dieing after about 12 hours.  Would I buy this phone again?? In a heartbeat!", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Girlfriend Loves It!", "Author": "Consigliere \"\"Everyone should believe in ...", "ReviewID": "R30YXK1CXKR9L0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My girlfriend has been wanting a new cell & when we saw this one for $99 she couldn't pass it up!  I know it's an international phone but was really surpised when everything (manuals, quick guides, etc.) where in Italian but whatever a quick Google search & I had the language changed to English & I was on my way to programming it to work on the AT&T; network.  I bought an unlocked cell from Amazon before so I knew I wouldn't have a problem getting it to work with AT&T;, took all of 10 minutes to input all the needed info & she was in business.  This phone overall is pretty sweet, even thinking of picking up a black one for myself.  Can't say anything negative about it, but for reviewing sake I'll nit-pick & say that expandable memory would be nice & maybe a better camera but she's not one that lives & dies by her cell's camera, she wanted a cell that not everyone had & she wanted a pink phone, this definitely fit the bill!", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "don't spend this much money", "Author": "Katherine Avant", "ReviewID": "R1UX6ZZRE9JVLT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I give it four stars because it's a good phone but, you can get this same phone from the motorola website (yes, it too is unlocked) for $165.99!
