I am a technophile with some BB knowledge.HARDWARE:Body is slim and sleek, nice lines and curves. It easily fits in the pocket. Slimmer and lighter than my mothers previous 8330, I think she will like it. Buttons seem a tad smaller than previous Curves, but still easy to press. The menu buttons also have a nice click to them even though they are flat and flush with the body.This was my first time using the newer trackpad on blackberry's and it was nice. Seems a little weird at first but it actually better when you become accustomed to it. Center button clicks nicely and no accidentally rolling around when you try to hit it. Camera and volume rockers are also the newer style, built into the body. They press easily as does the top lock button, also built in (not sticking out). Call quality is good, as can be expected on BB's. Camera is OK but I dont put much stock in phone cameras so am not inclined to thoroughly test them. Screen is absolutely gorgeous. Brighter than any other BB I've seen except the Torch. Colors are nice, resolution is good enough for pics and video. Havent tried any games since I would need a BB account and this is going to be a gift anyway. WIFI is fast but not all the apps seem to take advantage of it (more on that later). Tmobiles 3G is properly taken advantage of but of course, your mileage may vary. I dont know if this unit supports AT&T;'s 3G network.I love having a multicolored indicator light on the top, wish more phones would do that.Battery strength is as good or better than any other Blackberry, it charges quickly as well. Got a full days use but not using GPS, Bluetooth or NFC. In fact I havent seen any stores or found anyone else using a phone with NFC, so theres no way to tell how good it is.SOFTWARE:I am not an expert on BB OS 7 but I can see the differences. Main screen is less cluttered but you can still see all the important items. Accessing settings and finding the essentials is easier than ever. In particular, disabling all or individual radios is much simpler now. Settings menu is also less cluttered and you can do more without digging into as many subsections. Your home screens of icons can be customized a lot compared to earlier versions of BB OS. You can set up as many custom screens as you like. Scrolling through items is always very smooth, due in part to the new OS and faster hardware. Everything looks a little nicer, easier on the eyes without seeming too cute for a proper business phone. The email is unified and looks nice. Blackberry messenger is much sleeker and easier to use, but I dont think is integrated with the other messaging programs. Social networking is also unified though you can choose to use individual apps for twitter and facebook and others. Everything is a little easier to use than in previous versions. The youtube app is really just a link to the mobile web page. Vids do look good especially for being on a small screen. Audio is acceptable over the speaker but if you plan on seriously using this thing for music and vids you should probably plug in the headphones. All the usual apps are here like To do and memo and Office to go. Most of them seem to be improved a little, easier to see important stuff and create new documents. You can even create PP presentations from scratch which is something office apps for other platforms lack. There is a file browser (at least on the unlocked phone I purchased) but it only allows you to view media files you've copied over or documents you've created. Only power users will care about that but it should be noted. Voice notes work well, as does the password protector app.Games look great but only 2 are included and you need a BB account to get any more, even the free ones.Search is now universal like on most modern smartphones, and its also easy to specify where you wish to search (web, local device, contacts, emails, etc.) A VERY nice touch to serious BB users who have tons of junk and cant always make time to sift through it. Big improvement here and RIM should be proud.Theres also some basic network diagnostic tools which is nice to see, again mostly for power users, but also good if your IT person is trying to setup your corporate phone and doesnt want to download additional apps for this.NITPICKS:Box did not include a nice protective case like the last BB curve I bought. But they did include a 4gig micro SD card and it was already installed. No self-portrait mirror on the back but it did have a flash which not all BB's use, even some of the newer models.Battery case was weird to get off. It would seem theres a little indentation on one side of the body that you gotta dig in to pop off the back. Almost ripped the body apart before I figured out how to work it, even with the little picture showing me the process. My last Curve had a little button you could press easily to make the back open. You can access the SD card while the phone is on but I think it gets upset if you do.Apparently the new OS 7 lacks backward compatibility with old apps, which is nice if you thought blackberry needed a total refresh but if you have a bunch of old stuff (especially paid) you may be unhappy with the change and lack of modern apps in the market. It will take time for developers to catch up.The Curve 8330 lets you specify cellular only, prefer cellular, prefer wifi, or wifi only. I couldnt find such a setting on the new OS, and in fact when there no cell coverage (which can happen with TMobile) it doesnt seem to want to use the Wifi at all. When trying to use the web or mobile store it gives me troubles, complains theres no data service even though I can clearly see its connected my home wifi. This is actually a serious issue and not a nitpick. Needs to be corrected.- FINAL THOUGHTS -Overall a great update to the Curve line. If you love Blackberry's and like the small Curve you will love this one. Latest OS and new apps plus advanced stuff like NFC make this a winner. BUT, if you still prefer iphones or Androids this wont likely encourage you to switch. Experienced users will appreciate that it feels basically the same but with plenty of improvements, newcomers will like how simple and neat everything is compared to a messy Android desktop.- UPDATE! -Completed my tests on the battery. This bad boy lasts 9 whole days with all the radios off, and 6 & a half days with all the radios on, including NFC which is basically useless right now.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT OEM", "Author": "RAMON", "ReviewID": "R3LJL5LKPQBGD7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is branded t-mobile is not an oem product. at least in my case I use the network services movistar in Venezuela does not work with 3G services should be required to place in the description of the phone if it is oem, at & t, t-mobile so the buyer could make a better choice and not feel unhappy when they receive a product that not  wanted in my case I live in Venezuela and I can not return the phone to the seller", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Need data plan to activate an email client ?!?!?!?", "Author": "bk.studio", "ReviewID": "R2CTEURMX57HFW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i couldn't believe in that. it doesn't matter if you're connected to the net through WiFi or not, unless you don't have a special blackberry data plan for this unlocked device you can't even setup an email account. i could get this phone for FREE with plan i HAD to purchase just to use as simple thing as email. why nobody mentioned this important future in their reviews???by the way, for those who experience problems with blackberry battery life, just remove those facebook tweeters and other social network guys, and you battery will be back to life.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Curve first time", "Author": "BBVIRGIN", "ReviewID": "RFYMRZ1YE2XDN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered my BB on Christmas night. Through the Christmas and New Year's holidays... the order still came on time! Amazing! Nothing was missing! Everything was working perfectly! Unfortunately, this phone is a gift and not for myself... now I wish to keep it! This phone has absolutely everything! It's better than an iphone! It looks so professional and sleek!The only thing is... the charger... the charger plug does not fit into my outlets in my walls. No big deal, the charger is designed to fit a European outlet and not an American outlet. But I can easily fix this because the charger wire and charger hookup is not connected, so I can simply buy one to fit a regular American outlet instead. Not a problem at all. In fact, this makes this phone fit any plug because the wire that connects the phone is by itself... giving that the wire has the ability to have different type charger plug connections on the other end of the wire (opposite of wire connecting BB) depending on what country a buyer is in. I hope this makes sense... (I'm sure reading the details of the phone would also explain it).This phone also is so small! But the buttons are still big enough to press! It's so sleek! fits perfectly in the pocket, or anywhere you put it! It's durable too, but that doesn't mean you should drop it. Treat it like treasure!

I found Android to be full of bugs that hindered its use.  Both of the phones I had previously (LG G1 and Samsung Exhibit II 4G) had countless software problems, most importantly horrible power management that required me to leave the screen on the lowest level just to make it through the day.I think of this Blackberry as kind of like a convertible, it's a neat little phone but you may need a larger tablet type phone or device depending on what you are trying to do.Pros:- Easy to use, terrific for email, the keyboard is essential for me.  I was making embarrassing mistakes on Google's \"swype\" which functions extremely poorly.  I find the keyboard the best and most accurate of any device.- I like the way you can click on a contact and see all emails, texts, phone calls, all at once.- The calendar is so nice and easy to use- Battery (like all Blackberries, the battery lasts 2 days).  You do need to update the phone software to 7.1 however.- Maps works better and faster than the Android map program, which seems to stall endlessly and is slow as a snail.Cons:-  The app store:  it's OK but the apps are definitely not as good and there are not as many as the iPhone.  Android is starting to get better apps, but Android's horrendous power management will suck any joy out of using any application.- Small screen size- Internet browser not as good as iPhone, Android.So it depends what you value.

So thank goodness for my Blackberry Curve 9360 _It rocks!!!", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Perfect PHONE", "Author": "James Carre \"Steven\"", "ReviewID": "R1F6IKE3VDHI0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What do you need in a phone?1- The ability to call people2- Text3- EmailThose are the 3 essentials to have in a phone nowadays and this Blackberry Curve 9360 is perfect for all 31 (calling)--- Obviously every phone's got calling, but the blackberry curve has really loud volume so basically anywhere (even in loud places) you can hear what the other person is saying very clearly2 (text)--- The keyboard is incredible. It's SO easy to type that after using the phone for 6 months I can type without looking at the keyboard. Plus I barely ever make spelling mistakes because the keyboard is so well laid out. Texts are clear and have a nice, easy to see view when you are scrolling through all your old texts3 (email)--- Blackberry email is really easy to use. Emails are easy to respond to, easy to read, and since you can type so quickly, unlike the iphone you can respond to them so much faster. PLUS (a huge benefit) blackberry doesen't have iphone's stupid autocorrect which can really screw up an email if you don't reread it carefully. With balckberry you don't need to waste time on rereading all your emailsBonus: This phone is TINY. Really small, way smaller than iphones, a lot of times I mistake it for my really thin ipod touch (the new one) because it's that smallObviously the apps and internet on this phone are not close to the iphone's level, but do you really need to use apps or internet all the time?Personally the only app that I wished I had was the iphones maps app. Other than that I have NEVER wanted any apps on this blackberry. AS to internet, it's possible to use, but it is annoying. But at work you have a computer for internet, at home you have a computer, do you REALLY need to use internet while traveling?SUMMARY: The curve 9360 does everything that phone is supposed to do better than any other phone. Calling is smooth, the kyeboard cannot be beat, and email is quicky and very easy (and secure if that matters to you). To me, it's the Perfect Phone, i'm not exaggerating", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great cell phone", "Author": "Fairuser", "ReviewID": "R1JYBJ1NYP4R3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this phone as expected (time and accessories).

I do not think so. Higher speed processors, mean higher power consumption, shorter battery life...), really nice and slick case design, well built, pretty good quality camera, flash. The real problem of this phone is short battery life: it comes with a a tiny 930mA battery, which drains completely with in few hours, even if you do not talk or chat... When I realize that, I wanted to throw the phone against the wall... Well, after reading for awhile, I find some possible measures to improve the situation: I upgrade the OS to 7.1 (the phone came with 7.0), and disabled 3G... After that, the battery lasts whole day (from 7am to 10 pm), including a lot of chat, email and phone calls. which I consider is acceptable, although, could be much better (8900, I had before, lasted as twice as long, under the same conditions). Well, also I got a hi capacity (2340mA) battery, which was supposed to help a lot, but I have been unable to make it work, since RIM encodes batteries, in order to prevent the owner from using aftermarket batteries, which I consider pretty ugly, because they are unable to manufacture decent batteries...In order to finish this, I would say that the I feel pretty satisfied with this phone, although it requires some improvements, mostly, regarding battery life", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "it didn't bring the memory card.", "Author": "Luz", "ReviewID": "R83DE6STCU3IN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone is new, but it didn't bring the memory card.
