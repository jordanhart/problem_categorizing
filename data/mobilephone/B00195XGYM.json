Wall", "ReviewID": "R17L3YFUT1099A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this unlocked phone from MobileCityOnline.com (via Amazon) in the last week or two.  I've spent hours of time with tech support with Motorola trying to work out the kinks.  Let's start by saying it's a very cool smartphone with tons of features.  BUT - the caveat is that many  would have only worked if I'd lived overseas.First, the charger that came in the package is non-compatible with U.S. outlets,  and so I purchased (at very low cost) another charger to get the phone working.Then, although my manual was in English,  the phone itself (menus, etc) were all in Chinese,  presumably because it came from Hong Kong and was geared toward that area.  Hence the first call to tech support.After working through converting  the language to English (I'd needed help navigating the menu's since they were all Chinese),  I tried to do simple things like buy new ringtones and wallpaper.Come to find out,  no dice. These are not able to be downloaded in Atlanta (or U.S. period, apparently). Motorola tech support reported that they could not help as the phone model is not supported in the U.S. I am also unable to access the web.I've spent too many hours with tech support in the short time I've owned this phone, and so I need to return it. I have never have needed to contact tech support for help with any other phone, and have never needed to return one.Please be careful before you spend 259.00 on this model if you live in the U.S.So, here I am today, spending more time (on a beautiful Saturday afternoon) making YET another call; this time to MobileCityOnline.com to return the phone.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "Capuchin", "ReviewID": "R36QPOPWZ4BJ89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this phone because I had a RAZR3 I really liked, but it stopped working after several years of use.  I tried a slide phone (Motorola ZN300) and hated it (the phone was fine, except it was too small and I just don't like the slide feature).  This was one of the few flip phones available.I got this phone from J&R; Music and Computer World.  They shipped it out the next day and I got it the day after that, ahead of schedule.I have a charger that works in the US and the manual is in English.  My phone has English, Portugese, French and Spanish.  Most everything was set to English.Two things I had to change via Setup:  I use Motorola phone tools.  In order for the phone to be recognized, the USB mode must be set to modem (not mass storage).  Also, if the keyboard is set to the wrong language, go to Setup, Input setup and select the correct language.  Then, power down and start up and the settings will take effect.  Once these two things were fixed, everything worked smoothly.It was easy to personalize.  I like the alarm and calendar.  The sound is good, both receiving and sending.  I don't use internet, send email or text, so I can't comment on those options.  I haven't tried the bluetooth, camera or video, yet.  I will post after I see how they work.  In all, I'm quite pleased.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweet little phone!", "Author": "Erica M.

I absolutely loved it and I still own it! I plan on using it on my next deployment. Awesome that it came unlocked, it's durable, the body is comfortable to hold, the stylus and touch screen are comfortable to use and it's just a great phone. I wish I could give more specifics, but I can definately say overall it's a great phone.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "nice phone", "Author": "Carlos Pena", "ReviewID": "R4UQ1K89IRNYY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice phone, be aware because mine only came with two language: English and Chinese.  the systems that this phone uses is linux, you have to be a power user if you want to download or change anything....keep that in mind.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Very Unique Smartphone", "Author": "M. Hachey", "ReviewID": "R11UTG2RRQVVAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been my favorite phone ever.  Besides the fact that it is extremely unique and makes people go WOW, the capabilities of the phone are far beyond what I ever need.  As a standard phone for texting and calls it worked fine.  The stylus is required for all texting since the keyboard is very tiny.  If I used my fingertips there were too many mistakes but once I got used to using the stylus I could move at a reasonable speed.  I was able to access my contacts and make calls without using the stylus but those with larger fingers may have a problem with this.The built in memory is fantastic as well.  I had a total of 1700 texts on the phone before I had to delete them as I was out of space.  Much better than every other phone I've owned that held a total of 80-100 texts total.The 2mp camera takes good pictures for a camera phone.  There is no flash but if you want high quality pictures get a camera.  If you want to store a lot of pictures make sure you get a memory card as you'll probably need it anyway.I never used the web browser as I didn't want to pay for a data plan.You can install programs on this phone via memory card but I never ventured down this path.  You can do a lot to it though, its all up to what you want and what's available and there is plenty of information on the internet, specifically on forums geared towards modding Motorola phones.  Since these phones are unlocked in order to be used in the US you're able to do anything and everything you want.If you want a truly unique phone then this is the one for you.  Everyone has their Blackberry's and Treos and iPhones.  This phone will stand out above and beyond and thanks to the clamshell design you don't have to worry about buying screen protectors like all your friends do for their PDA phones.If you have the patience to experiment with this phone and are smart enough to handle the lack of tech support then this is the Smartphone for you.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT BUY", "Author": "Elijah Banks", "ReviewID": "R15Q12G9CR8XE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS PHONE IS EXCELLENT, IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU NEED IT TO, THERE ISNT REALLY NOTHING BAD ABOUT THIS PHONE, AND THE BEST THING ABOUT IT, ITS ADDICTIVE, IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PHONE AND LOOSE IT LIKE I DID, YOU WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE IT AGAIN, ITS WORTH THE BUY, AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
