{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No surprises from previous Rugby versions", "Author": "MdniteEagl", "ReviewID": "R2FCQYJ8QO0J2P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you've owned the Rugby (A837) or Rugby II (A847), the new Rugby III (A997) will be pretty familiar.  I had the original Rugby as my frontline cell phone for a long time, and I liked the ruggedness and general durability of it.  But it had its shortcomings, most notably a rather small screen.  I passed on the Rugby II (although my mom has one, so I'm familiar with it), hoping something much better would eventually be offered.The Rugby III has a few notable improvements, the most obvious being the larger main screen.  It's 240x320 pixel and 2.4 inches diagonal, same as a number of \"senior-oriented\" phones like the Pantech Breeze line and the LG A340, also offered by AT&T.;  The web browser is a bit better now, and can handle most reasonable web sites, although you're not going to watch movies on this phone.  The texting interface is nicer and offers a lot more special characters than before.  The camera has been increased to 3MP in size, but still doesn't offer many effects features - but it is now fully functional from the outside while closed, using the external screen as the viewfinder.  The AT&T; Address Book sync feature is probably the only useful app of the included bloatware - it allows you to upload your address book from both the phone and SIM to an AT&T; server, where you can then retrieve it from a different/new phone should something happen to yours.  The Rugby III also includes AT&T;'s enhanced Push To Talk (ePTT).On the downside, I'm disappointed with the navigation buttons.  The main arrow keys are almost flush to the center button and are visibly smaller than they used to be, making it very easy to accidentally push \"OK\" when you meant to go left or right.  The USB/charging port is still that flimsy little tab and is even more difficult to open quickly.  The body surface isn't the rubbery feel of the original Rugby; it's more of a matte-finish coated plastic than what used to feel like a legitimate rubberized coating.  There's also one feature in the texting that I can't turn off and makes no sense to me... the first 30 inbound text messages (but not multimedia messages) are saved on the SIM, but message 31 and up go to the phone memory.  I don't want texts on my SIM... if I need to archive them, I'd rather copy them to the microSD card or transfer them via USB cable to my computer.  The text interface is also rather skittish when you want to capitalize the first letter of the next word (\"Abc\" mode)... sometimes it will do it right away, sometimes it won't and you have to back up and do it again.The Rugby III will do just fine for most everyday usage, or when you are a little rough/clumsy with your phone.  It's one of the very few decent flip phones left on the market that aren't cheap/thin \"basic\" phones.  But if you need a true \"rugged\" phone from AT&T;, spend the big money and get the Sonim XP5560 Bolt.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!  Way better than other phones I have had", "Author": "clutchxp", "ReviewID": "R1K9FH06IHIW0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone back in February this year and I really enjoy it.  I was looking for a phone that was really durable and would last well.  I found that and more with the Samsung Rugby III.  Below are the PROS and CONS of this device.PROS- It is a world phone- It has physical buttons- The hinge for the lid when you flip the phone up feels solid- When you cover the charger port back up, it has a secure seal, unlike other phones where the cover piece feels cheap.- The battery lasts for days.- The audio quality for the ear piece and speaker phone sounds pretty good.- The ringer is loud and stays at the same loud volume I have it set to, loud enough for me to hear it across the room.- The microphone to talk into is below the number pad.- It can download MP3 ringtones and wallpapers- It displays text messages individually- It does not require a data plan.CONS- When typing a text message, even if I have the Abc mode selected, sometimes the phone will not let me capitalize a letter and I have to press the * key numerous times to cycle through the text input modes before I can type the capital letter I want.- The camera on this device is not the greatest, but it does the job okay.- The phone only comes with one game, which does not bother me, but it could be a problem for those who like to have games on their smart or basic phones.- It accidentally takes pictures of the inside of my pocket if I do not have the phone in a case.  Definitely get a protective case for this phone to prevent you from pressing the buttons on the side.- The Push To Talk button is easy to accidentally press.With the Samsung Rugby III, I found more positives than negatives and I definitely would recommend this phone to someone who is hard on cell phones or has a job where he or she needs a phone that can hold up pretty well.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone.", "Author": "Well Read", "ReviewID": "RKMXYFEK7C5FL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own and ride horses and maintain 5 acres of property in harsh winter conditions.

With a 2 year contract they were going to charge $99. I decided to check the Amazon online price and was able to purchase the same phone, with a 2 year extended contract, for a penny at Amazon, plus a $36 charge will appear on my first AT&T; bill. The interface from Amazon to my AT&T; account was flawless and indicated exactly what my usual service included and the amount I pay monthly; this was reassuring. After purchasing the phone, I received an email that indicated a few very simple steps to get the phone activated. It was a simple process - done in about 8 minutes. One thing you should know, however, is that you have to use the new SIM card that comes with the phone, which means you will need to re-enter your contacts. I suppose it may be possible to have the data transferred somehow at an AT&T; company store; if you need that done, I'd contact them prior to purchase to see if that is possible and what the process for doing so is.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't kill it.", "Author": "A.

I dropped my old Rugby II in a swimming pool and it still worked.It even worked after I ran it through the washing machine with my work clothes.

If you do a lot of texting or internet stuff this is not the phone for you. It fits in any pocket without getting bulky like Smart Phones.My only complaint is the PushToTalk button, a pain in the neck, placed for accidental activation.  I don't use PTT so I pried the rubber key off and snipped the little rubber nipple off the back and pushed the rubber key back on the phone to keep it waterproof.

My family members and friends think I took a step backwards by buying a flip-phone. I beg to differ. The previous Flight II phone did many things well but providing basic phone communications and features wasn't one of them and that's why I made the change. My needs are simple: I wanted an excellent phone that was easy to use without too much thought. In short all I absolutely need to do is talk on the phone and text. The Rugby 3 excels at those tasks. It also takes great pictures, acts as a good music player and is able to share files with your PC. The only negative about this phone that I've see so far is that the navigation button can take a little while to get used to but it wasn't a showstopper for me.

I bought twenty of these to replace the Nextel phones that recently became obsolete.  I will start with a brief list of the positives on these phones.It's durable, has a good music player and it is water-proof (but then again, so is a rock and the rock would have better sound quality).With that out of the way, let's touch on a few of the many negatives.Poor sound quality, you sound like you're underwater even when you're not.ePTT is pathetic for so many reasons:  Logs you out constantly, alert volume is non-existent, ePTT volume is tied directly to ringer volume (how non-intuitive is that?), you can't see who you are talking to when someone alerts you, transmission and receptions can be spread over several minutes (i.e, someone says \"Hi, how are you?\".  You hear \"H......i,.............how..........re......ou...\"., phone needs constant re-boots to keep ePTT happy, poor coverage with ePTT even in metro areas, etc, etc.The keypad is poorly designed.  Constantly hitting the \"return\" button when trying to navigate.  When hitting the outside \"ePTT\" button, the speaker button is directly across from it, causing you to constantly turn off the speaker when talking on ePTT.The phone randomly chirps and buzzes without having a reason.  All of my co-workers have noted this, so it's a wide-spread problem.I could go on for weeks about the poor quality, but I will leave it at that.  Again, worst product I have ever owned.

That quickly changed as I discovered that it would turn itself off.  Resetting the phone, restoring to factory settings (all with the guidance of Samsung support) all do not work to resolve the issue.  Support is sympathetic but will only \"repair\" my new phone and not replace it.  Additionally, they won't send me a phone to replace it so now I am to go without a phone until they repair it.To be fair, we bought two of these and my wife's works fine and she likes it.  But 50% is not a good average.So if your looking for a non-smart phone, look elsewhere and avoid this POS.

Major Negatives on the cell phone charging cord because the connector and the cord are cheap, flimsy and won't last very long. Awful for product quality. I wish there was some type of descent standard for these things because this just sucks! Help, I'm in shock! (very cheesy) In 1969, I had a tinty AM transistor radio built better than this piece of junk. All cell phones Stink! Phooey! I'm not surprised at how little cell phone technology and cell phone signal booster technology has changed since my first cell phone. There are NO earphones or mic headset with this thingy either, PLUS if and when you decide to get earphones you will have to disconnect the charger or use bluetooth (cheap & breakable) technology, but it's very expensive to have it. Why not use the standard USB connector or anything more durable than the cheap piece of junk for charging and communicating at the same time? I guess that was too sensible. ReStink Technology!
