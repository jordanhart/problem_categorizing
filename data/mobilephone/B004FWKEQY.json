I type M and Z comes up, P won't work at all.  I bought it for a test and it has proven that dual sim capability is possible but this thing is not worth the $50 I paid.  Go with a name brand and let the Chinese sell their junk to themselves.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Change of time and date", "Author": "kasturi", "ReviewID": "R23UTVR9TLCR1L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was unable to change the time and date after following the directions. When I changed the date it reverts to the default date. As for time, I try to change it to New York time as I live in the same zone, the time does not change. I am disappointed. I cannot use it as an alarm too.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be sure to retain original packaging to all purchases.", "Author": "Erika Blandin \"Real style\"", "ReviewID": "RXVER2CKJ67QF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wouldn't purchase from this consumer again. The phone wasn't new,as stated. In addition to that, the charger worked for roughly 2days. And because I was out of the country (Which was the purchase reason), i had to go without the use of the phone because their was no place that had the same charger or one to match. I notified the sailer and I was,informing them that i will keep the phone if I could just receive a another charger. Their reply was that i needed to return the defective item in its original package. Of course that was impossible because not only had I not retain the box and rapping it came in but I had taken the phone with me out of the country.Had I known that the charger would be defective, i would have kept the packaging. So, nonetheless, I am stuck with a phone that can't be charged. I think that instructions /info that the retailer should have made known, is the fact that all packaging should be retained for up to a certain period in order to be refunded or defective items to be replaced.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hello hello?", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1DL6THZDSHNWG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The dual SIM is a blessing when you have perfect communication all the time. This phone is really a 'wannabee', it has the looks of a great phone but it sucks! You have to walk and turn around for people to hear you without cracking or robotic sounds. The internet feature is a scam, it takes 10 minutes to go online and another 10 minutes to open an email, forget about surfing the net. It has these 'group divisions' (family, work,etc) to store phone numbers but it doesn't work. It doesn't have settings to send your sms messages to the memory card which has a greater capacity for storage, it sends them to the mini phone memory. Video and music have not mp3 or mp4 or any other 'normal' file extension, you have to convert them first the the weird phone's file extension. I wouldn't even give this 'imposter'to my kid, it would be pure torture.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "malfunction after 4 months", "Author": "Neo", "ReviewID": "R2DKWQX64TQXF8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The keyboard has a malfunction just after 4 months of light use.
