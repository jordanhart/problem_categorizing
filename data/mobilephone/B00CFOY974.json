{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Low cost alternative to Samsung Note", "Author": "Jerry Chu", "ReviewID": "RN86LJZ0IFMED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What I really want is a no-contract Samsung Note, but I don't want to pay more than $400 for a phone. After much research I settled on the BLU 5.3 II. It has the 3G frequency I need (I'm on Ptel, which uses T-mobile network).The screen is big and beautiful. There's a protective film over it, which I leave on as screen protector. Everything worked as expected. The only thing that gives a hint this is low cost device is the back-light of the 3 touch buttons below the screen. The back light comes from the left and it shows.Speaker quality is good. The 2 LED flash light, front camera, dual SIM (I travel abroad every year) are nice additions.Android 4.1 is much better than 3.2 on my old Samsung Galaxy. Very responsive. But I hate the Google search bar that occupies home screen space. So I downloaded EZ Launcher and got rid of it.Over all very happy with the features, quality and price.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone and wonderful service from the seller. Wish all my purchases were this great.", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "R3TAIUFRZQOG3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received the phone from UPS and plugged it in for several hours just to make sure it was full charged. It was 35% charged when I plugged it in. I started with getting the inhouse WIFI to work and it accepted that on the first try. Then easily downloaded several apps. The bank APP and was able to get on line with the bank right off. Then I went to Yahoo and signed in and downloaded the Facebook APP. from then on it was smooth sailing to what ever I wanted to do. Screen went off several times on me so I went to Settings and clicked on Display and up'ed the time out to 20minutes. That made it only dim down occasionally and it is just a tap to get it to full bright. I'll do something else later. Don't have a sim card for it yet so I might have to come back to that but I feel that will be as easy to get signed on to either Straight Talk or T Mobile. Not sure who is bettercause I have been on Verizon for ten years and decided they were too expensive. I don;t care for just 500 MB of on line time. Should be at least a Gig as other services do.Best of all the phone was easy to use and easy to read even the smallest print was able to read and I am 78 years old so a younger person should have no problem. LOL Everyone seems to be younger than me......The phone is really high quality and I am proud of my purchase. I love the white and the way it feels very feminine. The CPU is fast too. I can;t type as fast as it is able to take my texting. I am pretty good too with texting to all my grand kids and family. This is my tenth phone and I have had computers sense 1985. Windows 3.0 was my first with MSDOS on a Packard Bell computer. I only hope it last a while and gives long service. I really love it and plan to buy another one for my sister and partner. I really examined the fleet of phones available and decided on this one as it has G3 850/1900. The rest couldn't go G3 cause it had only G3 850/2100 which if for Europe Systems. This is something to look out for unless you want to be stuck on G2 all the time........The top center button is the on button and when you put the back on put the back over that button and continue down to snap the back on. That will save you from reading the whole book to find out how to get it up and running.

Mostly do my bills, check email/facebook, go on web to check things. I sometimes get a call but mostly send & receive texts and check my voicemail. It has just about everything that the name brand version of S G 3 or 4 has without paying an outrageous amount of money for it. Pretty to look at and I love the huge screen...I have vision problems and could hardly see things on my old phone...I can clearly see everything on this one.

It has same features as big name phones costing 2-3 times more. The big screen is great for viewing web pages, pictures etc. It is a bigger phone than the regular size ones, with 5.3\" screen so be aware of that. I have had no issues putting phone in me jeans pocket and go.It comes with a back silicone cover, and I could not find any other covers online to put on it. Not a big deal for me, but might put some off. Comes with it's own charger and earbuds, so all in one package.I haven't used the dual sim yet, but could be nice feature down the road. I put in a 32GB micro sd flash card, so plenty of space for pics, videos and apps. Recommend on any phone to move apps to sd card for better performance.If you want great phone at great price, you should consider this one.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Lender", "ReviewID": "RDB6WNFWOU4U2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Brand, satisfied with the product, good phone components, work in 3g with my operator, thank you very much from Venezuela.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Jolando Thornton", "ReviewID": "R3UNPJ2SNJ8HNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone overall was very nice!

The specs are mediocre and the phone lags a bit but it does what it's supposed it. There is, however, a small but significant glitch with the phone: the screen goes dim after like three seconds no matter what your screen/sleep settings are. You have to download an app to keep the screen set to \"always on\" and if you forget to hit the power button after you're done, your battery will drain from the screen being on.
