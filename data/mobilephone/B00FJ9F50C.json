The only poor feature is the camera. But I guess for the price you shouldn't be expecting a high end camera. Highly recomended.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better off buying a more expensive BLU device", "Author": "Brent A Mclaurin", "ReviewID": "R1BCHOP2NVHN70", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for a friend when his phone broke.  When he turned it on, there was a line of dead pixels across the screen, and there were a number of other problems that he had with it (a good portion of which involved the lack of memory).  BLU makes some damn good phones, but this one is too cheaply made to be of any good use.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone failed.", "Author": "Bob Wendorf (dasdbobb)", "ReviewID": "R2SH8S39TM9ACT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "less than 60 days old, and a manufacturing defect the phone shorted out.

I thought it would be made cheaply with horrible quality plastic. Wow was I wrong. The Dash Jr  was a pleasant surprise. So much nicer than my expectations. The quality of fit and finish is superior, very nice design. Call quality is perfect, texting a breeze, and the internet is equal in speed and quality as was my former Samsung S 4g. The dual sim feature is just the cherry on top. I travel to Asia and Europe often so I already know just how handy such a simple feature will be. An added personal benefit is that I am no longer part of the back and forth battle between iPhone and Samsung fanatics. It feels good to no longer be part of a clich\u00e9. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a nice smart phone that feels and acts like others that cost 10x the price.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "No good!!!!", "Author": "paulo rafael sanchez v", "ReviewID": "R1Y3ZO5JU460XB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product its crap do not buy it, gets Chinese virus and also goes off all the time, mi girl isnt happy at all with this product", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "it is a valuable phone", "Author": "Jie Wang \"jie wang\"", "ReviewID": "R3HOKWKI6GDPD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is a good smart phone, and it is very valuable compare to this cheap price.
