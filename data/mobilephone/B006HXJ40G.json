Flatbed scanners lose track of where they were on the page. Printer servers seem to lose their jobs somewhere in vaporspace. Seriously, her idea of high tech is a digital children's thermometer...A couple years ago, the kids and I helped her migrate from the realm of flip phones to the smart phone world, and the Samsung Illusion is the phone that the kids picked out for her as a birthday gift. It was the right choice for the job -- not too complex, not too many bells & whistles, just the right size for her somewhat petite hands, and easy to navigate. Of course, she jumped head first into texting with family and friends.It took her a few months to put away her paper address book and start to use the phone's Contacts functionality. Took even longer for her to get comfortable using the Illusion to check and send email. Now she's progressed to taking and sharing pictures, reading and sending work files and other pdfs, and using Google Navigator.Yes, she is finally on her way in the smart phone world. Now if she would only get comfortable remembering to take her phone with her wherever she goes, and stop putting it back into her purse (... and then taking it back out again, over & over) each and every time she sends and receives individual texts.One thing that we did notice is that the charge on the original battery lasted, on average, a little over one day. That battery died a few weeks ago, after about two years, and the Samsung OEM replacement purchased on Amazon (Li-Ion Polymer OEM Replacement Battery (1500mAh) for Samsung Illusion (EB484659YZ)) has been fantastic. We think the charge on this one lasts even longer than the initial one did.If you are looking for a good starter smart phone that is reasonably priced and easy to use, we highly recommend that you consider the Samsung Illusion based on our experience with it.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone For a Great Price", "Author": "Robert T.

But I'm really enjoying it.Note I didn't buy from Amazon, got from Target, nonetheless same phone without any special upgrades.  Works beautifully, very smooth page transitions, feels fast.  No trouble with wifi except I wasn't able to purchase Monopoly (phone came with Monopoly demo)...said it couldn't connect through Wifi or 3g.3g is plenty fast for me, youtube videos loaded quickly.Battery life seems good so far, I don't spend all day watching videos.  If I made 5-10 phone calls, sent 5-10 texts and watched 5-10 videos in a day the phone would be at about 50% charge by night.

It's not the latest iPhone or Android wonder machine -- not that I've gotten close close to one -- but it was inexpensive and works with PagePlus network. It can handle Google Drive documents, which is a nice plus for this Chromebook user.It's also a nice phone for my wife's first smartphone. She is basically a talker / texter, and although the touch screen has been tricky for her, the Illusion is user friendly enough that she hasn't thrown it at the wall... yet :)UPDATE 2014.04.23 -->It's still a nice, basic smart phone as far as handling apps, but I felt like I needed to come back and say that if you're going to use it on the PagePlus network, it will not update the operating system automatically. That may contribute to some buggy behavior in the phone operations -- sometimes I can't get the virtual keypad to show up during a call (like when I need to press a number), and sometimes pressing a number on the virtual keypad doesn't work. I'm not sure if that's just because it hasn't been updated (due to being off the Verizon network) or just the phone itself, but there you go. It's gotten so irritating that I'm ready to try rooting it, even if that makes it unusable. I'm ready for a phone with analog buttons again, I think.And yes, it does go through battery life quickly when you have your apps updating automatically.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's OK....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWD71WR8YOCEO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is not the greatest, but it meets my current needs.
