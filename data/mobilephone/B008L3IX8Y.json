I love the rubberized feel, the water resistance, and the GzGear apps.  It's size is great, nice and thin, super easy to read front display, even in direct sunlight.  Its perfect for an active lifestyle, EXCEPT, it doesn't work.  When on a call, the other person can not hear me.  It sounds like I am in a tunnel for a few moments and then the volume on their end fades to nothing!  So, I am stuck using speakerphone or a headset.

It was tough, waterproof, looked cool, and was very comfortable to use, with good reception and sound quality. The Ravine is rugged and waterproof like the old one, but for a phone, it performs terribly. Most annoying is the microphone placement, high up and on the right side of the phone. It is incredibly awkward. You have to hold the phone at a really unnatural angle to be heard well, and if you are holding the phone on your left side, no one will be able to hear you. The microphone also traps water in the little recess, and you have to blow into it after it gets wet, or the little bit of water blocks the sound. A towel won't get the water out. Next, the reception on this phone is the worst of any phone I've ever had. I get more dropped calls, volume that fades in and out, moments of silence, and static interference. If that isn't enough to dissuade you, the phone is also very uncomfortable to hold against your face. That wins it another \"worst\" distinction, that of being the least comfortable or ergonomic of any phone I've ever used. I cannot wait to replace it. The waterproof and rugged characteristics are pretty much rendered moot because I never want to talk on this phone. I talk to my out of town friends much less since buying this phone because it's so uncomfortable and the call quality is always poor.

Roberts", "ReviewID": "RONDV73EOYTLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this model of phone in my business since they first came out. The first 3 I had lasted less than 3 months. In spite of the promise of \"drop-proof\", one single drop onto a hard surface and either the outside or the inside screen failed. They were replaced under warranty and those phones lasted for years. One caveat: make sure that the battery cover door latch is in the locked position! One of our phones fell onto rocks, the unlatched door and battery popped off, and then it fell into the ocean. Despite the fall on the rocks, both screens still worked. Unfortunately the salt water got to the electronics and it wouldn't completely boot-up anymore. So I bought 2 more from Amazon. I tried to get them through Verizon (I was eligible for an upgrade) but they told me that the Ravine II was all that was available. They wanted almost $300 per phone - with my discount for renewing my contract for another 2 years! Amazon's price for 2 phones plus priority shipping was less than that.The process for enabling the phone to use the old phone number was automated and quick - didn't have to talk to Verizon at all. These are new phones, not reconditioned. The only advantage I can see that a Ravine II has over this phone is that the buttons are laid out in a rectangular grid instead of staggered like the original Ravine. If you text a lot the staggered layout of the original Ravine takes some getting used to.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "GZone phone", "Author": "Bob St Denis", "ReviewID": "R3Q0KTBO1LYNH3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I thought I woul reall like this phone as my wife has one.
