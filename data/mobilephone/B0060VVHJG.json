The main issue is that the Straight Talk Android Optimus Q Smartphones are ported to work on the Sprint Network (I'm told) which doesn't offer near the same coverage as Straight Talk's non-smartphones which use the Verizon network coverage. I checked Sprint Coverage map & it seems as long as she's driving on a major Interstate corridor or in a larger metro area,  coverage is good.  It's when she drives to smaller communities off interstate that things get spotty,  especially in NW Louisiana or East Texas.  And what is surprising is her company is based in Dallas, TX at the Dallas Market Center which is a huge bldg off I-35/Stemmons.  4 to 6 times a year she attends the seasonal retail markets as a rep and works the showrooms where all reps get text msgs on their cells from clients coming in for sales appts.  Well any rep with Sprint Network don't get calls or texts unless they walk out in the hall and stand near one of just a few windows to get reception.  Sales reps with AT&T; or Verizon don't have this issue. The Sprint coverage map indicates that coverage at this bldg location is Excellent but inside the bldg...there is no reception unless you stand by the larger windows near the escalators.  It's really become a nuisance for sales calls.  I think we're going to look at a different service as this Sprint Network is just inadequate.P.S.  Adding this a few weeks later as I discovered that Straight Talk has added some newer Android Smartphones to its line up that work either on AT&T; or Verizon networks.  If you're considering the ST Androids....be sure to ask about which network they are ported to work on .P.P.S. -- Adding this later, I learned that you can determine which network a phone will use... there are two types: GSM & CDMA,  on this phone the CDMA-S means it is ported for Sprint network towers,  phones with CDMA-V are ported to work with Verizon network towers.  The info should be in the phone specifications and/or written on the original box labeling.

Cut my bill from over $140 per month to $45 flat, what a deal!", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good deal - a rare value for your bucks", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R2KRVT3DFD94ZO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the record, this is my first Smart Phone and I am not a heavy user. It would be a rare day for me to make more than 2 calls & 2 texts on any given day. I spend most of my day on a computer at work so I'm not much for going online once I get off work... but I do like having the capability when I need it.The manual: Provided by Straight Talk, was very poorly done. For example, there are 5 icons available to turn on/off different functions but I didn't know what they were. Going to the supplied manual it did mention those icons but there were no pictures to show you which one was related to which function. I downloaded a Verizons manual for their version of the phone and it supplied the needed information.Battery life: With GPS and Bluetooth turned off and Wi-fi turned off about 75% of the time I was just barely able to get 2 days of battery life having made 2 phone calls, sent a couple of texts, played a game of Solitaire, and did less than 30 minutes of internet time.Phone functions: Compared to my previous (non-Smart) phone, the internal speaker really lacks volume and clarity. For example, while in a busy shopping mall and speaking with my wife, I had to ask her to repeat herself numerous times (this never happened when using my previous phone).I love the slide out, full keyboard that has vastly increased my texting speed. There are even dedicated keys to enter \"@\", \".com\", and over 10 different SMILEY faces.Connectivity: I really don't know if it is a service provider (Sprint system?) or of the phones reception abilities but at my home and where I work, about 10 miles away, I only get an average of 3 bars, which, so far, has sufficed.Android: Getting used to the operating system takes some time. It's really not all that difficult but it can be frustrating at times with the inadequate manual from Straight Talk.I was able to set up 3 different e-mail accounts (2 GMail & 1 Yahoo) quite easily. Though I'm a long time user of Google, I had been using MS Outlook much longer and I had all the details for my contacts in MS Outlook. Because this phone/system uses the contacts from you Google account, it took me a fair amount of time updating all the information. The good thing about this, I did it all on my computer and the phone simply synced with the Google account and everything magically matched.A change on the phone or a change from your online account is automatically reflected throughout. The sync also include your Google calendar (how cool is that)!I'm having a problem with the voice capability using the \"Quick Search Box\", this is box on the home screen, that allows you to do a Google search using text or voice. Usually, when I select the \"voice\" option it gives me the error, \"Server Problem\", so far it has only worked for me a couple of times. Maybe I need to fix my voice?APPS: There are plenty of APPS available for downloading from \"Market\" and they are easy to install and use. So far I've downloaded Red Laser, Yelp, and a Solitaire game.Manufacture support: Going to the LG web page I searched the site and was unable to find a listing for the \"Q\" model. I suspect it is very close to the \"S\" (Sprint) version but I don't understand the complete lack of any mention of the \"Q\". I did download the pdf manual for the \"S\" which is vastly superior to the printed copy Straight Talk supplies, and seems more akin than the Verizon version I had earlier downloaded.I paid $175 at Wal-Mart for the phone and pay $45 per 30 days of unlimited service. Pretty hard to beat.Nope, the phone and service is not perfect but your getting a lot more than what you paid for when compared to other phone plans.Final note: I've had Straight Talk for almost 2 years now and never really had a problem with service or my phone, until... buying this new phone it was a requirement to change my auto pay from the $35 to the $45 plan. You can't do this online and need to call customer service. This comment is not reflecting my score for this review, but... their customer service was TERRIBLE! I called 3 times and each time the representative ended up irritating me more than helping me.UPDATE: Overall, now that I've had the phone awhile, I'm still a happy camper, but there are a few negatives that folks might want to be aware of:- I've now had more experience with the phone I've found that I can use up the battery pretty dang fast when doing more than bare minimal internet... or worse with some of the apps that are available.- Having had a Straight Talk phone for a couple of years I NEVER received a spam text but now I've received a few on this phone.... wonder why?- Unable to block a phone number (see above)- There is a function to set a sound to alert you to a new \"message\", the problem, there is no way to set if for JUST a new text message. I have 3 e-mail accounts on the phone along with the texting function and whenever I receive a new e-mail OR text I get the alert... I ONLY desire to be alerted to a new text but that option does not exist.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheaper at WalMart", "Author": "Katherine McMullen \"Katy McMullen\"", "ReviewID": "R2CY3J2BEG9SO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent phone.

I believe this phone runs off the Sprint network, so you should check out their coverage and service before purchasing.-The phone is sleek and well built. I did buy this case for it (White Hard Case Cover for LG Optimus Slider LS700 LG Gelato Q), although you could probably use it without one.-Fairly fast, although probably slower than a more advanced smart phone. Still, for the price and the fact that you don't have a contract, it's easy to deal with the rare times the phone hangs up.-Simple to set up the phone, not only with Straight Talk, but also with the Google Play store.-Includes very nice Google audio search that actually works quite well. You can call and text people using this feature as well.-The slide-out QWERTY keyboard is a lifesaver for someone like me, who does not particularly like to hunt and peck on the virtual keyboard.-I know a lot of people have battery issues with this phone, but I've not had any trouble. I use it throughout the day to play games, make calls, text, and sometimes surf the web, and I've always had at least 20% battery left by the end of the day. I expect to have to charge my phone every night anyway, so the fact that I have to do that with this phone does not count as a negative for me.CONS:-This phone only has 215 MB (yes, MB!) of usable internal memory. Although it comes with a 4GB mini SD card, not all apps can be installed to the card, so you will run out of space VERY QUICKLY if you love apps as much as I do. If you buy the case I mentioned above, it makes getting the back off the phone pretty hard sometimes.-Every so often the phone totally freezes up on me and I can't get it to restart. I end up having to open the back of the phone, take out the battery, and reinsert it to get the phone to work.-The camera is TERRIBLE. Awful. It's passable when taking a picture of something at a fair distance, but shots are almost always blurry when taken from up close. There is also no flash on this camera.-A lot of times, my wireless connection goes away and the phone reverts to 3G. This doesn't happen on any of my other wireless devices, so I can only assume it's the phone. I usually have to reconnect the wireless manually to get the phone to use the wireless again. This can be really, really annoying sometimes.-In addition to the above, many times my wireless simply will not work at all and the 3G will not automatically kick in as a backup. The wireless has a signal and SHOULD be working, but instead of green (meaning the wireless is good), the wireless symbol is white, which means it isn't connecting properly. This is another issue that never happens on my other wireless devices.Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. For what I paid (and the small amount I pay each month to Straight Talk), the phone is a real bargain. I plan on keeping the phone for a year or so and then upgrading to a better non-contract phone: one that has more internal memory and a better camera (with a flash!). I'd recommend this phone to anyone who needs a somewhat basic smartphone at a good price.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Go Straight Talk!", "Author": "skizdidlyidler", "ReviewID": "R2UZ06NQ8818KQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first had the Samsung 528...AKA crap.

Well, we decided to try straight talk, since we kept losing signal everywhere we went. I told him if we go to straight talk, we're getting the phones closest to what we want. So, we chose this phone. It's definitely an upgrade from a non-smart phone. I had a samsung behold 2 before my lg optimus q, and they're are obvious improvements. That doesn't mean this phone is flawless, but it's definitely worth the money you put into it. When looking into this phone, i noticed everyone kept griping and complaining about the camera. No, it's not the best, in fact not as good as my samsung was, but it's not even close to what i would consider bad. I've had many crappy phones when i was stupid and in college, and the cameras on those phones don't even hold a camera to this phone. Now, granted I didn't dish out almost $200 on those phones, but if you want a really good camera, then buy a really good camera, not a phone. The touch screen is very responsive, but it does tend to freeze sometimes, and the best thing to do when this happens is to just let it alone. Playing with it more will only freeze it up more. I've found it really only freezes on you when you're impatient with it, which i admit i'm impatient. For, example if you click on an app, and it doesn't respond right away, don't click on it again immediately after, it will freeze. There are plenty of apps in appstore to choose from. And a lot of them are free, which definitely sets androids apart from iphones.I highly recommend the i heart radio app. You can customize your own radio stations. Slacker radio app also does this, if you're a guy who does what a big heart icon on their screen. The papi games are a lot of fun. Netflix is okay, it runs a little slow, but i wasn't expecting this phone to be incredible at streaming movies.Overall, it's a really good phone.

I considered returning it every day for the first two weeks that I had it.  In the end, I just decided to use it as little as possible and deal with the slowness.  - There are double-size batteries available online for under $20, which I will probably buy.  I have to charge it every day, just for talking/texting - no GPS, no wifi, no web-surfing.- One example of the slowness - I end a phone call and it sort-of freezes for several seconds before the phone can do the next thing, like go to the home screen.- It is preset with a lot of annoying Google crap that requires an account.#3 The Good: I decided to keep it because I loved the video recordings.  I need to be able to record lectures and I tried several videocams that were either not as good sound quality or turned off after 30 minutes. This will record for hours and uploads easily to my computer. (Since I am already plugging it in to charge it anyway - lol.)#4 The Great: I really enjoy having a full slide-out qwerty and a full touch screen.  My phone looks just like everyone else's until I pull out the \"secret compartment\" - and type easily.  Then they all get jealous.#5 The Annoying Mystery: The Home screen text size is small.

I've had the Straight Talk service for awhile now ( best prepaid service out there) and I always buy the unlimited plan because the $30 isn't enough text/talk for me, but the web was wasted due to my phone. Well I'm just in love with this one! It's fast, the battery life is great, it's easy to text, and it have great coverage in my area. i would 100% recommend this phone.The one downside is that the manual provided is not very detailed, so I find myself having questions and nothing to reference. For example, when typing with the physical keyboard, the apparent fn key, which allows one to type the numbers, is only good for one type, and then it goes back to letters until you punch it again. This seems extremely silly, but i can't seem to find the way to keep it in number/symbol mode until i wish to go back.Anyway, for sure a good buy if you either already are on Straight Talk, or are thinking of switching.

Well this phones memory is so small that after only a couple apps I was forced to delete things to free up space because it wouldn't even let me send a text.  I have a 16g sd card in it too.  The problem is that the basic functions of the phone work off of the phones memory capacities and do not use the sd card.  There are many apps that require them to be directly on the phone too and not on the sd card.  Another problem I have is that my text DO NOT ring in.  I have gone in and changed the settings multiple times thinking it may just need a different command.. nope that's not it.  I think this phone would work great for someone who only wants to check the weather on occasion and have maybe one other limited app.  The battery dies at least once a day, sometimes twice.  I'm still within my 30 days money back period and I am seriously considering sending it back.

BUT she didnt tell me i had to set up a google account to just get into the phone and get it all started. Both people i talked to kept telling me to turn it off and hit 3 buttons to turn it on when all you have to do is just turn it on with ONE button.  The other thing i dont like about the keyboard is that you have to hit a button just to get to the numbers. It doesnt have dedicated numbers. And the top of the keyboard is right on the edge of the slider. My other phone wasnt like that. Im still learning how to use a smartphone. But now that i have this one i would have chosen a different phone knowing what i know now about it.

Now this. Each phone was an improvement over the other for the most part with the Rumor and Exclaim being close. However, this Android while not perfect is my best phone yet! I love texting on it and the little android smileys. Sometimes there are problems sending them though and you have to click re-send message. You also won't be able to send a message while someone is sending you one (but I think most/all cell phones are like this). Internet is fine but that's mainly when Wi-Fi is on. Otherwise things load slower or not at all. Some videos on the internet still won't be able to play on this phone which is disappointing. I played a couple of adult videos fine but some music videos embedded on a page wouldn't load which was a bummer. I don't really plan on playing games on this phone much because I've never been about that so I can't comment on how fast they load and how well they play. I was used to 2.0 megapixel cameras on my last 2 phones. This 3.2 camera is a pretty good improvement. I'd still prefer it if it were 5.0 but the pictures are overall clear and less grainy than on my older phones. Sadly, flash is absent with this phone though. :/One of my favorite features on this phone is actually the music player. While paired up with an app called Simple Last.fm Scrobbler I can register my music plays on Last.fm's website for my enjoyment and for all my friends to see. The only thing I don't like about the app is that you can't register plays of a song that is on repeat 1 which sucks. Video recording is alright. The picture is generally clear but when I recorded 2 short videos of a band performing on stage the sound was kinda muffled a bit. It may seem like I have a lot of complaints but some of them are small. You can get a s***load of apps on the Google Play store and many of them are free! Lastly, I would recommend you get this phone at Straight Talk's website cause you can get it for $130USD brand new. Some time after I bought it they were even offering a $20 dollar gift card which is a steal. I was a little ticked about that!Good phone. It has its shortcomings but I'm proud to say that I own this because it was my first cell phone I bought on my own and some of the features are just great. If you are looking for a really great experience though maybe you should spend a little more money and get one of the other Androids that are faster, have more features and have a better camera, bigger screens, etc. But for something that's overall affordable you can't go wrong with an LG Optimus Q.4.3 stars.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!!", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R1KS708EDS1JZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this phone.

I bought a refurbished one back when the \"new\" one costed an arm and a leg.The phone overheated a lot. It'd randomly turn itself off in the middle of phone calls. It turned itself off in the middle of opening apps.I contacted them, had to send it back, and they sent me a replacement.Then the replacement came. The replacement's touch screen was broken. Any time the phone would get warm, it'd act as if someone was touching the touch screen. The touch screen would go CRAZY. Opening apps, calling people, etc. I had to put the phone in the refrigerator about 35 times/day when it did that to make it stop. I contacted Straight Talk, had to send it bac, and they sent me a replacement.Then the replacement came. It had issues. Got a new one. It had issues. Got a new one. Long story short: I've had this phone about 10 times and not a single one of them has worked properly.A lot of the apps are incompatible. Meaning some of your favorite apps, such as Candy Crush and Temple Run, you can't download.The memory on this phone sucks. I have 8 apps on it and that's all I can download, even to the SD card, which has tons of space still.LG doesn't sell it (or guarantee it) and the LG program you download to your computer doesn't work on it, so you have to download an app to back up your stuff.I've used the slide-out keyboard a whopping TWO TIMES! since I got the phone. It's difficult, the letters aren't easy to reach, making things capital or doing punctuation is a pain, it just makes typing a text message take like 5 minutes instead of 2 on the touch screen.I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. It's cheaper now than it was when I got it (even cheaper than the refurbished one I bought) and that's because it's a piece of crap. lol. Save your money up and buy a quality phone...EDIT: I would also like to add the fact that you CAN NOT take screenshots on this phone. I had to download Handcent SMS just so I could take screenshots of my texts and I had to download the Dolphin Browser and an extension for it so I could take screenshots of web pages. I can't take screenshots of my home screen, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, fitness apps, any of my games, etc. unless I download MobileGo to both my phone AND my computer, plug my phone in via USB, and take the screenshot on my computer.
