{"Reviews": [{"Title": "State of the Art  Android phone", "Author": "Regi Sylvain", "ReviewID": "R20H34NJP5HVA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This gets 5 stars as that is the maximum one can rate.Following are the reasons:1. I have been using a Galaxy S3 for the last few years and was looking for a change. Being on a budget this time,I didn't really know what I would get for one sixth of the price.There were of course cheaper ones available but had such horrible reviews that I was deterred to go for one.2. I took a chance on this one and boy what a surprise.3. Set up was quite easy.I inserted ny AT&T; unlocked simcard and network was automatically set up.To my surprise I  saw the \"H+\" on the side of the signal bars indicating that it was hooked up to  HSPA+ equivalent to 3G or above,4. Remember to put \"Data On\" to access Data features.5. The (1280*720) display was awesome. Super clarity and pleasant colors.6. The processor  speed is fast and navigation a breeze.7. Downloading apps could have been easier with a great processor and super wifi speed.8. Camera is good and takes great pictures9. This is an extremely great phone for its price.Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just Like a Note 2 - Well Built, New and was shipped fast.", "Author": "Todd Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1F3QRRE71XUHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like others I had my concerns about a generic phone, but after being with Virgin Mobile/Sprint for 4 months I could not wait to get back to T-Mobile.First, Right out of the box the product was NEW, in shrink wrap, never used.Second, I placed my T-Mobile SIM card in the phone and H+ showed up on the data speed.  Which means this is 3G or 4G.  This is not a LTE phone.  But my download speed was 14.2 and 11.9 mb/s respectively.  This is faster than DSL.  More than I would ever need.Third, The phone is rooted.  Meaning the full android platform is open and available.Fourth, The phone has 4GB of internal memory which is more than I would need and I have added a 8GB SD Card for additional storage.  Others say the phone had limited memory.  I have found this to not be the case.Fifth, It comes with 3 screen protectors, and a white flip cover to protect the screen.  It also comes with headphones and a extra battery.Sixth,  I upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to this phone and have found the call quality excellent, the speakerphone works as any other phone.Seventh, It is well constructed easy to set up right out of the box and have received compliments.  Most my friends could not believe I could purchase such a phone for $150.00 and be this high quality.  Now they are ordering!Eighth, You would be foolish not to buy this phone.  It works, looks and operates just like a Galaxy Note 2, the cases fit same.Ninth,  The phone is also fast on the fly opening programs, with no if not any latency. NO CRASHES!andTenth, Buy this phone over others.  In my professional view, this phone must be manufactured for the \"sam\" company without the name brand on it.  I matched up a Note 2 and most the markings are exactly the same.Well worth the money, dont get into a contract and screwed by the carriers.  You will be more than happy with this phone!", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAAAATTT!!!", "Author": "jasimand", "ReviewID": "RW1OBJPKLGAM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone 2 days with one day shipping came on timeThis phone met all my expectations works with straight talk Sim...Pictures are clear..internet moves fast...have not had a prob with memoryI love this phone ..screen size is nice volume is nice and loudSpeaker phone works great..

Fuhrman", "ReviewID": "R32ECPBEMIZHSL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to like this phone, and for the first few days I thought we would get along just fine.  After owning an S4 that suffered a bad drop and broken screen, I was looking for an inexpensive smart phone that wouldn't make me cry if it fell in a lake or suffered a bad drop so decided to give this phone a try.First few days went fine, this isn't a really fast phone and sometimes is laggy, but that was to be expected and was something I can live with.  It worked fine for making calls, checking email, and playing music. Bluetooth works fine. Battery life was actually surprisingly good and it made it through a day no problem.  The screen is where you will notice a difference if you are used to more premium devices... it is very directional like an old laptop screen, blacks aren't that black, and brightness control is a bit crude.  Still, it worked and I could put up with a sub-standard screen for the price. GPS seemed to work ok.On day 3 the little ear hole cover piece dislodged itself and things started going down hill. Day 5 the touchscreen calibration was way off, where I had to press about 0.75\" to the right of where I was trying to press.  Day 6 the phone became unusable because the lower portion of the touchscreen became unresponsive to any touch and now I am unable to unlock the phone.  I think I will be returning this phone and probably get a Moto G for a bit more.
