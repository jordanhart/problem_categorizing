I Love the price it was $20-40 cheaper than the ones they are selling in Boost Mobile stores + Boostmobile.com. I really enjoy it. A gamer\u2019s wet dream.  I have upgraded from the gingerbread based Boost mobile phone the Samsung galaxy prevail which was logy, took forever to open an app, took forever to swipe, forget about emulators, bad RAM count had to upgrade to a 4 GB SD card and still ran out of room. The amount of apps on that phone that I could hold on the phone only was only 11 or so. This phone kicks the crap out of that. I can play any emulators from Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, N64, and PS1. Game board Apps like Monopoly run like a charm. The Music Player kicks butt, the weather widgets, facebook buttons widgets, Google play books, and optimized ram is perfect. I am an electronic file junky. I enjoy collecting music and movies making ringtones and taking photos + playing all kinds of games. This Phone is perfect if you want everything in a phone and the price is perfect. I only pay $40 a month everything unlimited and this initial $200 phone will last me a long time. No problems with it and love the big touch screen.  Camera comes with a flash, plus a amazing crisp zoom, it takes panoramic photos, theres about 2GB worth of internal phone memory, it comes with a ram optimizer, 2GB SD card, millions of customization options great Android Ice Cream based phone. I bought this phone on Cyber Monday and got it with Prime shipping and within 2 days it was on my front doorstep. Awesome product I love it thanks so much!", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Boost LG730 Venice phone is TRULY a super product.", "Author": "J. Polack", "ReviewID": "R1OSPB470YQOJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had lots of phones.  After using numerous Motorola, Samsungs and others, I bought the LG730 a couple months ago.  My old Samsung had just died and the LG730 Venice was the only choice at Target for a Boost smart phone at 10pm on a Saturday night, so I tried it very reluctantly.  WOW!  Using for two months now.  No problems ever with the Android side being under-powered or slow.  No need to jailbreak the o/s in order to get apps to work.  No dropped calls.  Compatible with my SD cards, micro usb cables and chargers, small enough to go in shirt pocket, compatible with all my Bluetooth devices, great sound quality on speaker or regular!  Good screen.  Touch screen works well.  Works great with USB to my laptop to send and receive text messages, files, backup the phone, etc.  Could not be better, and with the price under $200, the service at about $45 per month, for text, www, and voice is superb!  I use the voice to text message constantly to send text without having to type it in and it works flawlessly.  Camera works great.  Built in flash.  I can't say enough good about this phone.  Its a real home run for Boost after they released numerous \"smart\" phones with limited features and abilities.  You cant go wrong with this one.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Boost has out!! I Absolutely Love It!", "Author": "Tommy  R", "ReviewID": "R3232G2D8QYJXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had numerous phones through Boost Mobile since the 1st Model that came out! Since then I've had many of them but eventually moved over and started with smartphones when the 1st Android Phone for Boost Mobile came out which was the Samsung Prevail which was a step up from any previous phones they had to offer! The LG Venice is better than most phones that are not pre-paid and that come with  Contract competitor service carriers! The 4.3\" inch capacative Touch-Screen is incredibly clear and vivid, especially when playing videos from YouTube and and sources! It has the lasted 4.0 Ice Cream Operating Platform that is super fast and has many different options available for customization and productivity! I get great reception and I'm told my voice is nice and loud and clear on the other end of the phone call, unlike my 2 previous Samsung Transform Ultra phones where others could barely hear my voice even when brand new! I was also lucky and got my LG Venice for a steal! Usually Priced from $229-$249, I bought mine on Amazon.com and only paid $155 right before Christmas! I have one more payment and I'll be down to $40 a month unlimited, which i would be paying more than double with contract carriers! So if you're looking into buying a Prepaid Phone from Boost Mobile for the first time, or you're a current and returning customer, I would definitely not pass this phone up! It has everything you need and more, I highly recommend this phone to anyone!!", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Large Screen In Slim, Elegant Body - Replaced By Moto G", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R3BX3NWRZNYX3X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LG Venice is a good phone limited by the slow Boost Mobile 3G network because it is NOT a 4G LTE phone and it can not connect to the high speed Boost 4G LTE network.  As of May 2014, the Venice has been replaced in the Boost lineup by the MUCH better Motorola Moto G, which is a 3G phone with a sharper screen, faster processor, and the newest Android software.If your neighborhood is served by the Boost 4G LTE network, do NOT buy the 3G Venice, instead buy a Boost 4G LTE phone that has ten times faster data speeds.  If your neighborhood does not have 4G, buy the much newer, much better 3G Moto G, which is the best 3G phone in the Boost lineup.The Venice runs all my favorite apps, such as Pandora Radio (using 3g) and Netflix (using wi-fi). The Venice has a single core processor, so it is NOT the best phone for demanding 3D action games.The front speaker is adequate when you are making a phone call in a quiet room, but can be shrill at maximum volume. The rear speaker sounds good at moderate volume levels, but becomes harsh when turned up to a loud volume.Music sounds great through high quality headphones or when streaming to a good bluetooth speaker.The rear camera takes good (not great) photos and adequate quality videos in bright sunlight. On cloudy days and indoors photos sometimes have muddy colors, with poor contrast and will lack sharpness. Locking the camera at ISO 100 outdoors and at ISO 200 indoors improves photo quality.Battery life can be great. You can get up to 24 hours per charge when you are using the LG power control bar on the drop down notification screen to turn OFF 3g, wifi, bluetooth, and GPS until they are actually needed. I turn on wifi a few times a day to download Gmail and check the news and weather, then I turn wifi back off.The pull-down power bar lets you \"click\" the screen brightness to 100% for outdoors and back to 50% level indoors, which greatly increases battery life. If you are watching Netflix at night, a brightness setting of just 20% work well and extends battery life.Using GPS navigation with 3G will drain your battery in about three hours. Connect the Venice to a high quality car charger (such as the Motorola fast charger) if you use GPS for more than an hour or two a day.Cases and Batteries: The LG Venice uses the same cases and batteries as do its siblings, the LG L7, and LG Splendor.Best Cases: Search Amazon for \"Black Perforated Hybrid Case\" for the LG Venice and LG L7.For MAXIMUM drop protection, which requires a thick, bulky, heavy case, search for \"Ballistic SG LG L7\" case or \"Ballistic SG LG Splendor case.BOOST MOBILE COVERAGE MAP: Before you buy any Boost Mobile phone, carefully study the coverage map at the Boost Mobile website. The map enables you to zoom in for a block by block view of signal strength, to see the quality of the Boost signal on the block where you live and work. There is ZERO Boost coverage in some states, and ZERO Boost coverage in most rural area. Check the coverage map carefully before you buy any Boost Mobile phone.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I can't beleive I waited so long to get this great phone", "Author": "first time mom", "ReviewID": "R52NH8EFHXL0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had Boost Mobile for over 2 yrs.  I had a Samsung Seek (almost smartphone) which was great for phone calls..I have a 3 year old, I am a single unemployeed mom.  I really wanted a good camera, video camera and I needed a GPS.  For $149.00I got sooo much more.  It was very easy to activate and my shrinkage plane only went up $5. I kept my same # and for $40  bucks/mo.

Crenshaw", "ReviewID": "R3PJB2LKC9RO9F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I picked this phone up in early December for $250 from a Boost Mobile retail store, just a few months of it coming out in October. I had made the switch to Boost (from Verizon to save cash) and the Samsung Prevail was my first phone; yet I was in need of something with more functionality for email and text. Prevail's a fairly basic device for one who don't want too much flair. So I went with the Venice. Looks nice and it's lightweight.I was satisfied with the Venice until February of this year when the phone randomly crashed on me. Of course I sent it back and it was working like new...for a month. From that point, my calls would drop and I lacked a consistent 3G signal. I did multiple resets within the phone and holding the Vol Down + Home + Power buttons but it didn't fix my problem. Yet my 3G signal is fine on the Prevail so that right there says it's not an issue with Boost.So I reached out to both Boost and LG on a replacement and Boost told me to contact LG about this. LG said that this defect isn't under the limited warranty; despite it being an internal issue with undesired functionality. I believe a wireless radio within the device is burned out and it's something that should be honored by the warranty. So now I'm stuck with a $250 paperweight...that I could use for a MP3 player I guess, since the Prevail isn't the flashiest phone around. But at least I can make calls without them dropping.I would strongly recommend looking into other phones. Anything from HTC or Samsung is a nice fit, like the Evo Design or Galaxy S3. Personally I don't trust LG or their devices anymore and this is the only product of theirs I own. I would expect better from a well-known company.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm loving this phone!", "Author": "Michelle Smith", "ReviewID": "R3SS593M6XWU53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung Transform Ultra that recently has been freezing up, randomly shutting off, among other problems. I originally wanted the Samsung S2 through boost, but balked at the price of it. Looked at the reviews for the Venice here as well as on Boost mobile and I was sold on it. I ordered the phone Monday(2/11/13) with the Super Saver shipping option and I received it today)2/14/13)!! Didn't expect to get this until next week.I haven't activated the phone yet, will do so tomorrow. I did connect it to the wifi in my house and it works great. Apps load quickly, games play smoothly with no lagging issues. The volume on this phone is nice and loud. Just about every other phone I have owned has had low volume issues. Not this one! The touch screen is nice and smooth. I love the screen size and the clarity of it.I really enjoy the Quick Memo feature. This allows you to take a screenshot of your phone, an option to add a handwritten note(using your finger on the touch screen) and then saves it in your gallery. This allows you to share the shot via text messaging, facebook and more.Definitely a must buy. Can't beat the low price. A much better deal than you can get directly from Boost. I'm glad I got this when I did as I see that it is out of stock now.Overall, in just the day I have had this phone, I am extremely please with it. I will update with more details once I get the phone activated.Update 2/16/13I activated the phone yesterday online which took less than 2 minutes. The clarity of phone calls is great, and the volume can get nice and loud when needed. Texting works great--nice and fast. The camera is pretty darn amazing--pics are taken just about instantly, no waiting like my other phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants a great quality phone for a reasonable price.  The battery keeps its charge for a decent time--when using it yesterday, I had it fully charged by mid afternoon and it lasted all night, with it needing a charge by late morning, and that is with using different apps.If you plan on downloading a lot of apps, I would suggest upgrading to a larger memory card as the 2gb card in the phone can get filled up quite quick.

I am not either of those and it is possible that my specific phone is a dud and others work well but I have met one other LG'er and she also said the phone is the worst. That said, let me start by explaining what is wrong with this phone; it gets no reception anywhere. I basically can not make phone calls. I live in Chicago and service is not the issue, I also have the same service as a lot of people I know and it works for them with different phones perfectly well. This phone drops calls every time I am on it. I also have had several occasions of \"I tried calling you all last night, why didn't you answer?\" and my phone never rang or registered a missed call. At this point I have stopped using the phone for phone calls. Awesome. Next on the list is text messages; when I go into my text messages it takes a good 30 to 60 seconds to bring them up. I have deleted them all and it still works the same way. I don't have a crazy amount of contacts in my phone maybe around 70 so that's not the issue either. If I get a text and go to look at it I better be patient because it can take a minute sometimes more and maybe if it's real crabby it will restart itself. Responding to them is not bad, that part actually works. Next up is the internet; I was excited for this phone as it was my first real smart phone and was looking forward to streaming music and podcasts. Well look who the fool is now says my horrible LG Venice phone, it's me because this piece of junk can't do it. It stops all the time and basically does not work, alas I have stopped trying to utilize this feature. I have also added a new lock screen because I read that when the lock screen comes on the music goes off, this did fix that issue but still this phone is totally incapable of streaming anything seamlessly. This happens on 3G or lightening fast WIFI I have at work or at home. I have had many phone nerds look at this phone for viruses, extra processes running, etc. and there is no reason it should be like this. A few other little quirks of the phone; the battery lasts about 8 hours, that may be normal for a phone but it seems a little ridiculous considering I have nothing running on it, my 3G is turned off as is WIFI (turned it all off a long time ago). Sometimes in the morning when I wake up, my LG Vencie refuses too. That's right it's frozen and will not work even with a restart. At this point I have to take the battery out and restart it. Fun times! Most often when I have to restart it it will not read my SD Card so then I have reopen it, take it out and reinsert it and then it will read it.I now laugh at the countless issues of this phone and can't wait to replace it, but I just spent $150 on it a couple months ago and it just seems so wasteful. It has caused me so many many issues it's unbelievable. I missed a phone interview call even though I had it in my hand the whole time. All of sudden I see a new voice mail sitting there even though the phone never rang. I have had friends mad at me for not answering, missed important calls and texts and can't use the best functions of a smart phone. Until I can afford a decent new phone I am switching to a more reliable walkie talkie, you can find me on channel 78.

For example when using the phone the mute button will turn on for no reason and the other person cannot hear you.  Then when making a call using contacts, the phone will routinely dial a different contact four or five contact away.  When dialing a number the phone will place the call before you have finished entering all of the numbers.  The hands free device I use will not connect to the phone for no reason.  I tried another headset and same problem.When using the settings, the phone opens the wrong item even though the opened item is no where near the button you touched.  Boost will not allow a return since they only offer a refund/exchange within 3 days.  LG tells me to contact Boost and Boost tells me to contact LG.LG will not replace the defective phone only repair the phone.  From what I have read from others who had problems with their phone, LG does not fix or repair the phone you purchased.  Instead LG will send you a different phone that has been \"refurbished\" and you will not have a phone for at least 7 days.

When I purchased this phone 2 months ago, I was replacing my old Samsung Transform. The phone is pretty, has a better camera, and has a more recent version of the Android software on board. The phone feels like a toy: The back is plastic, and it is very light and thin. This is great for those looking for that sort of thing, but I like durability as well, and this is just not the case here, so I bought a super-durable case for the thing. It runs programs very slowly. Load time was double that of my Transform. The camera is slow, has a really useless white balance function, and takes lousy pictures though it has over twice the megapixels the Transform had. After a couple weeks I started losing my cell reception. Often. At first the customer service (if you can actually figure out a way to get to a human) blamed it on the local cell tower. Once outside of the thirty day return policy time, however, they said it was my handset (phone). They had me do all the stupid things they normally tell you to do, take the battery out, look for updates, etc. No dice. Well, I've learned to deal with the unpredictability of service and then yesterday my camera stopped working altogether. It may seem trivial, but with children having a camera on the phone is important to me. Customer service referred me to the LG customer service which told me that they would take it for up to ten days, determine themselves whether the phone is defective, and either 1.ship it back at my expense, 2.try to fix it, or 3. send me another one of these. This would leave me phone-less the entire time, with no guarantee of anything fixed. Unacceptable.

There's also no text/charge LED...but on the nice side there's isn't a red glow in your eyes when charging at night. There doesn't appear to be a light sensor for auto screen brightness either. The back cover is textured but too slick - definitely hard to hold without a case. These are the items which remind you it is kinda cheap.The software (both android 4.0 and LG's additions) are very nice surprises. Usability is quite good and LG added some very useful tools like backup, power saver (automatically cuts power hungry components below a set threshold), and quiet time (disables sound/vibration by time schedule).

Amazon sent out a new one immediately; I didn't have to wait to send the old one back. The process was rather easy - credit Amazon.When I got the new one I noticed that some things were different which led me to believe that the first one I got was NOT NEW!  The first one: did not have an sd card, the battery was already in the phone and the decal on the outside-back of the battery cover was not there - All different with the new phone.So I am guessing that the first one was refurbished, used or something of the sort.

I ordered my phone on a Thursday afternoon using Free Shipping, 3 days later on Sunday night the package was shipped and arrived that Monday.I had the LG Marquee, bought this and gave the Marquee to my GF. I love this phone. The screen is big so I can enjoy web surfing, games, videos, pix and whatnot. Android 4.0 is definitely a great upgrade from Gingerbread (but gingerbread is still nice so if your budget calls for a phone with Android 2.3 you wouldn't be disappointed). I am in Atlanta so the 3G is excellent, when im on the go the Venice and Marquee both zoomed on 3G. I easily switched my phone over on the Boost Mobile website an was rockin in minutes. This phone definitey runs smoother with all my apps than my previous one & the Memo feature is great. I havent gotten a chance to really use the camera but so far so good, I love being able to just ay a word i.e. \"Cheese!\" and the phone takes a picture.As far as design I think it looks like an updated version of the very 1st iPhone. Had Apple kept gong wth the same color scheme I believe one generation of the iPhone would definitely look similar the LG Venice. The phone is very slippery so I would suggest finding a good case to keep the phone in when on the go. I like the home button and that you can use it to wake up the phone instead of havng to find the power button hidden in the top.WHY 4 Stars instead of 5:Front camera is VGA and that is very, very limited in quality. Some websites can be laggy sometimes, I thought it was the screen on my phone not being sensative enough but it always runs well on apps just lags a bit on certain big sites. Another thing I hate is that this phone probably will not be getting an Android update and I would rather not Root it.Hope this helps with you decision.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "martywaring", "ReviewID": "R251RG9OWC28XH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about 2 months ago & I LOVE IT!!

In a good way!Pros:*Inexpensive but delivers! Hardly notice any lag on it`s single core processor.*Screen resolution is not nearly as bad as people say it is, I actually can't tell the difference between the Venice`s display and HTC One SV`s (had that phone for about 2 weeks and it rocked! Just too pricey for it to seem like a `deal`)*Battery is not as bad as people say it is. After unboxing this Bad Boy and charging it to about 64%, ilI decided to customize my Venice as usual. Downloading fav apps. Setting up Microsoft Exchange and Gmail accounts. Browsing the web. Watching random cat playing piano videos on youtube...you know, the basics. I`m still at 37% and its been about 4 hours. I can see this battery lasting you a full work day on one charge. Ill update you once that day has played out!*LG perks like the Quickmemo feature and the say \"cheese\" function of the camera. Did I mention panoramic photos?Cons:*The front facing camera. So far the front facing camera does little to want you to keep using it. The lighting has to be just right. (Rear camera is good)*The charging (not discharge) of the battery itself. Basically I can see this device taking ~2 hours to charge up to 97-100%. Ill keep an eye on this and update you all later.*The feel of the device screams accident prone. It has a slick texture and could easily slip out of your hands considering how light this phone is. I would highly suggest a case ASAP.Overall great device for the price.

I had an HTC 4G phone and it started bugging out on me after having it for almost 2 years.  The battery was horrible.  So I was looking for a smartphone with certain must have's.  Enter the LG VENICE!!What I love:-I like big screens so this fit the bill.  However it is not at all heavy.  It's so light compared to my old phone and less clunky.-It runs smoothly, not glitchy at all.  I've had the phone for about 2 weeks now and have downloaded various apps and applications and it still runs smoothly as it did the first day.-Love the customization.  Mobile ID lets you have different home screens to fit a specific need (apps for the sports person, the mommy ceo and/or the fashionista etc)-The camera has a quick shutter which is essential when you have a little 6 month old who constantly is moving.  Catches all those precious moments.-Battery lasts up to 24 hours with moderate use (calls, text, a few apps).  About 14 hours with a lot of use.  LOVECons:-One major con is that it doesn't have an LED light.  When I charge the phone, I am used to having an orange light come on to indicate its charging then a green light to signify when its done.  Doesn't have one which I thought was odd.  But has flash for camera, ironic!-When I download apps the apps get put to the end of my apps, doesn't get alphabetized automatically, I have to do it myself.

It was a great phone for a beginner android user and lasted me well over 3 years. So it was glitching on me and I decided it was time for a an upgrade. After viewing phones and getting so close to another Samsung I was eyeing, I missed the opportunity and ended up with the LG Venice. I read really nice reviews and felt that this phone would take me to the next level easily. So I have had this phone for the last month and it has been a smooth transition. Mind you it is not an IPhone, nor is it a Samsung Galaxy 2, but this phone is a nice, sleek contender.Great basics: its a pretty phone, slim with a wide screen, clear colors, ok pictures, fast internet browser, really, really good sound...now to things that matters most. Difficult to come from, especially from after using a smaller phone: battery life. The Battery Life is almost dismal. I had learned from my other android that turning off applications, and extras that you don\u2019t immediately use is a must to keep the battery at a good level. Even with these practices on the LG, it doesn\u2019t help as much as i thought it would. Granted it is not as bad as having to charge it twice a day or every hour, but I'm used to even if i don\u2019t charge my phone overnight, it wont die over night. But with this phone if i don\u2019t charge it overnight it WILL die overnight, I mean DEAD by the morning. I have always lived by the quick task manager and optimize the manager often, i also live by the quick settings it provides to turn off and on my GPS, Wifi, even brightness, and this gives an easy access to the power saver. Which by the way, to give a HINT, use the power saver, it really does work especially when you are down to the last 30% of battery life, it gives you time to get your phone to a power source! So, lesson... Use task manager widget, quick settings tool bar to turn off Wifi and GPS and stuff, and power saver is the bomb also....Charge phone every night, overnight and invest in a car charger, if you want to use GPS (especially in a bigger city)!Other misc. issues: the alarm sounds for the alarm, which i use to wake up in the morning, are not loud enough. Really??... Cello, voice of nature, good morning...names for the sound that jumps you out of bed?? NO, more like keep you in bed LOL. One cool thing about the alarm though, is that you can do a puzzle lock to turn off the alarm, bad thing is I work the puzzle right through sleep, no help! LOLOther issue: I found this out later, but if someone sends me a mass text, you know the ones where you send one text to many phone numbers, I cannot read it in whole when i open the text message feed. I have to catch a glimpse when it does the preview on the preview header above the task bar. A pain, but not a big issue overall.SO... In Conclusion, I know it is a long read, but hopefully worth it, especially if you are going to dish out over 100 on the phone. There may be other smaller issues I have not yet found on this phone, yet, but over all there was not much to go over. I was thrilled when i got this phone and still am happy I picked this phone. Hopefully by heeding my guidelines on the battery issue, you wont be too mad about the issue also i hear there are apps for this issue and if you don\u2019t find what i do helpful, maybe these apps will help you.Well, I wish you luck on your next phone purchase and i hope i helped you lead to your next dream phone, or deterred you from something you may not be happy with. I know Im pretty happy with what i got!-Happy Shopping!!!", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Venice", "Author": "chelsea1", "ReviewID": "R13LTTUREORY9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it at least it is more reliable then my last one.

Worked fine for the first month, then started slowing down. Uninstalled apps I installed to speed it up- no difference. Factory reset- no difference. No dropping and/or damage on my part. Good starter phone for those new to Android.Tech-savvy, beware.Pros:*Inexpensive*Good graphics/display*Slim*\"Decent\" photo capturing (nice for a low-quality phone like this, a joke compared to iphone,  galaxy s 2+ phones)*Decent battery life (the slowness of the phone had me using it less, making the battery last longer)*Big screen for a basic phoneCons:*Super slow after minimal use*Constant freezing when opening apps (EVERY app- messaging, phone calls, photo gallery ESPECIALLY youtube, email, etc.)*Freezing when trying to hang up phone (screen stays black until other person hangs up)*Access to battery and SIM card- The flimsy back cover must be RIPPED off to gain access to the battery. I wish I was over-exaggerating, but I'm not. I have to stick my nail in the back (yeah, my nail broke a couple times) and pull it off, almost to the point of feeling you will break it.*To pattern unlock, it has a major delay which then causes the phone to think you did the wrong pattern.* Using the on-screen keyboard is a JOKE!!! When upright, delay is bearable, but only for someone who has absolutely no smartphone experience. I never, ever use the horizontal keyboard- it is so incredibly slow that a slow texter like myself is annoyed by it. I'd rather sign into gmail on a computer and type up a SMS message and send it that way. The delay starts at the very first word, and it is so delayed that the phone says you typed in words incorrectly (or skipped spaces, letters). The auto-correct function is useless due to this delay.*After 5th use of speech-to-text, it completely stopped working.****Could be seen as a pro or con, depending on what you want: very basic, light weight (I prefer something that doesn't feel like a toy)Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this phone, except maybe a child. My grandmother who just switched to a \"flat phone\" (this is what she calls smartphones) said this piece of junk is slow. I've had this darn thing for 6 months and I am about ready to trash it!!! Never again will I buy an LG electronic device!*If this is any help, I'm a 25 year old in college/mom/works part-time. I needed this phone for calls, texting, emailing, and basic photo capturing. I didn't care about downloading apps or anything fancy, but after 6 months, I can barely do the basic functions I need.

Using the manual Mrs.Spudman figured out how to configure her phone, add and delete numbers, used the camera, text, add aps, and do all those things that others mostly take for granted.The clarity of the screen is terrific with crisp text and graphics. Photos taken with the phone are not state of the art, but are certainly good enough to send via email and post on Facebook.One important feature for us is the speaker phone because Mrs. Spudman hates to hold the phone to her ear during those marathon phone conversations of hers. The sound coming from the phone's speaker is good, what one might expect from a cell phone's tiny speaker. Using bluetooth we sometimes use the phone with a wireless speaker for better quality sound. On a side note, the external speaker on our daughter's iphone is not better than that on the LG Venice.On a ten hour drive to Georgia we used GPS for the first time ever. Again the non techie Mrs. Spudman figured out how to set up and use the GPS which verbalizes directions with a pleasant female voice. The GPS is up to date and uses a Tom Tom system. The GPS feature is wonderful and got us to Georgia and back and helped us navigate around Augusta confidently. We had one hiccup on the way back home driving through DC. Not sure where th fault lay but we missed a turn and got lost on the city streets. Thanks goodness the GPS rerouted us and we were soon back on course. Can't imagine what we'd have done without the help of the GPS.We did notice that the battery lost power quickly on the trip until we plugged it into a power source in our car.  On our last night in Augusta Mrs. Spudman didn't charge the phone, so we had only 14% battery power for our drive. We kept the phone plugged in on the drive and by the time we reached our next destination, the battery power was almost up to 90%. We used  the \"Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger\" bought from Amazon. It's also a great product.Bottom line -  On the ten hour drive to Georgia we never lost our signal once. Boost has also been great, especially the diminishing monthly cost as long as one makes regular monthly payments on time. I like the phone so much that I WAS going to buy another one for myself.The internal memory on this phone has maxed out limiting what can be done on it. Also we got a message from Boost saying we'd maxed out our data usage. Mrs. Spudman spent an hour at Radio Shack with a helpful guy who got the phone to at least function better than a paper weight by deleting and moving stuff to the SD card.  He said the memory full problem is something he's been seeing with this model phone.UPDATE - Removing email has helped a lot with the memory glitch.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "jasmine", "ReviewID": "R20DS3EOE6DSZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone has great battery life, better than I expected, the phone is pretty big, bigger than I'd like.

I've completely quit using my ipod touch. This phone is so much better. I almost didn't get it because of some of the negative reviews. This was my first android phone and it does not disappoint. It hiccups every now and then (shuts off randomly) but not so often to where I see it as a big problem. I can live with it. If you're looking for a new phone with boost and don't want to pay all the money for the gs2 then this is a GREAT alternative!!*EDIT*I loved this phone for about the first 6 or 7 months and then it all went down hill from there.-MessagingThis phone does not send my messages half of the time. I end up with it just saying \"sending\" and my text never goes through. My friends will text me the next day saying what happened and I go to check my texts and it will still say its trying to send my text message. I talked to boost care about this and they said to take my battery out and reset everything but I'm still having this problem.-CallingMy phone won't ring when I get incoming calls. It lights up at the bottom but the screen will stay black but but when it FINALY rings its too late and cuts off. But the person on the other end says it just rang and rang until the answering machine popped up.-BrowsingMy connection will drop for no reason when I'm browsing the internet and say \"Unable to connect\" ESPECIALLY on chrome (although chrome may just run bad on the LG venice) but it will say I have full bars and have 3g. Google chrome does not like this phone. I guess cause its a little bit older. Chrome will crash for no reason a majority of the time when I'm browsing. So I usually end up using the default browser.-Battery LifeDO NOT get me started on the battery life. The battery is SO bad. I have to take my charger with me everywhere. If you leave this phone idle for just a few hours it sucks up ALL of your battery life. You could have nothing running in the background and it will still drain. I left this phone idle at work because I had a short shift my battery was at 100% when I started my shift when my shift ended about 4-5 hours later I had 20% left. No texting no browsing NOTHING! The only way I sort of fixed this is by turning on airplane mode but then I can't receive calls or texts...Otherwise it runs apps nicely sometimes the interface can be laggy. The keyboard is bad I suggest downloading the google keyboard.If you can overlook all that the this phone isn't so bad. I did tons of research before hand none of them told me about all of these problems.

My biggest complaint: battery life. I don't run WiFi and I ALWAYS close out programs I'm not using. (Task Manager is probably what I use more than anything else with this phone.) The battery life is absurdly bad, as in very few hours even when you're not using it and just have it on with no apps running.Next complaint is the speed and the clarity of calls. The phone is clunky in doing even the most simple things, including typing. The delayed response is as irritating as when you use slow internet when you're used to pages loading immediately. You can't run too many apps at once (which I wouldn't suggest anyway and don't on faster devices), and you can't run some others at all while in a call. YouTube has been pretty much useless for me, as I can search for vids but can't watch them (They just load forever). The calls are ALWAYS unclear and sometimes drop outright, but thats more a service issue for my area, I assume.This phone is great if you're new to smartphones, but not if you're used to higher quality ones. My pluses for this phone are the screen size and clarity and experiencing Android for the first time. Despite the phone's limitations, I do like the Android features, which makes me think I'd have a better experience with a better phone. Another plus is price. This phone was a good price and fulfilled an immediate need for an affordable smart phone (as my former one is a Japan-only iPhone and I don't jailbreak).So, if you want an affordable smart phone period and will mostly use it to call, the Venice may be for you, but I might suggest turning it off when not in use, as I've found the battery drains entirely too fast even while doing \"nothing.\"", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG Venice", "Author": "Shelley Lemmond", "ReviewID": "R2IDKLBQ4FUNT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this cell phone.

My first choice was the Samsung Galaxy II, but instead I decided to try and save a few bucks and I purchased the LG Venice. Mistake. At first I loved the phone, then I started noticing things about this phone I didn't like. First off, the back camera on this phone is excellent. The front camera is a piece of crap. My old Transform Ultra front camera was ten times better. Then I noticed when the phone did a media scan, it took a looong time, and your gallery, videos, and camera would be tied up. Also, when I got the phone I found out an upgrade to jelly bean was available. I did the update and the phone became way slower. I experienced dropped calls, it takes a long time for the phone to respond when you try to make calls. there is no light to let you know your phone is completely charged,it freezes. Many times the alarm won't sound if you set it, the keyboard is slow, and it will also turn itself off. I know now that I should have spent the extra money to get the Samsung Galaxy. I can't wait to get another phone.'Update:This piece of crap phone has gotten worse. Now I can barely hear callers, it drops calls, the icon you touch isn't the app that opens.So frustrated.

The back feels rather cheap but with the right case you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about durability (I had purchased the armor case on Amazon for a few bucks).  I am not a real big fan of large screens, but I must say the 4.3inch screen is mighty impressive (and not as bad as I thought it would be). Sharp edges can be a pro and con.  Pro for it helps with gripping in some cases, yet cons for putting it in a coat pocket can leave issues.  I would rate this section a C+Call/Speaker Quality: When listening to the person on the other end voices seem rather computerized well as people have told me that I can be heard crystal clear (I could also assume that boosts network would also have something to do with that.  Speaker quality is interesting.  At the lowest setting you could hear voices loud and clear yet on the highest setting voices are distorted and harsh which seems like the speaker wasn\u2019t design to handle such volume setting. People have a hard time hearing me when using the speaker phone. Listening to music is great so far no need of an external speaker.  I would rate this section a C+Features/Processing:  The boost ID gives it great customizing options that would otherwise render its features somewhat cheesy (download holo launcher and you won\u2019t have to worry that).  Screen brightness is great resolution is okay but when looking at HD videos it\u2019s excellent. The keypad/keyboard is rather corny and in some cases an inconvenience.  Its quick memo is great.  Google maps tend to lag behind other phone models. Camera is definitely not the best.  The 1GH processor runs smooth (for the most part). Using Play Store can be a drag (but once again boost mobiles network also plays a part in that.  I had downloaded Super Booster to help free up needed RAM which helps a great deal with performance.  I would rate this section a B+ with added apps (B- without)Battery: The worst battery experience so far with smart phones (I have had 4 so far).  On a full charge I can get about 4 hours of talk time.  Roughly about 6 hours with casual usage (surfing the web, texting, et cetera).  2 to 3 hours with heavy usage.  It\u2019s great that the phone comes with a traveler\u2019s charger (for outlet/computer usage) however the design is an inconvenience and I could see in the near future it will be shorted out rendering it useless.  I do not like the fact that I can not use chargers from other companies like Samsung or Motorola.  With my Droid 2 I can use any charger that would fit and no damage is done to my phone or battery with the Venice however not the same case.  I would rate this section a D+Overall I would rate the LG Venice a 7.5/10 which is a C+ in my book.

Another MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE, this will make you hate this phone. This phone automatically switches into Wi-Fi mode wether you want it too not, wether the signal is strong or not. The problem this causes is that if you attempt to make a phone call, it will take a long time to go through, the other is that you will not be able to access the internet, and also the Google Talk commands will not work. You will find yourself consistently switching from the on Wi-Fi Mode to the Off Wi-Fi Mode. The internal memory also doesn't hold much.

I had a hard case for the phone and never dropped it, etc., so I expected this phone and this brand to be much better than it turned out to be.  By December, it was dropping calls constantly; instead of receiving texts, it would ring once - and then nothing; the screen wouldn't lock and when I was on the phone, people constantly complained of a beeping noise as though I was hitting numbers, so I could only use it on speaker; then it stopped registering missed calls/voice mails.I have been arguing with LG about getting a refund but they are insisting that their warranty will only cover sending the phone in for a tech to look it over.  I tried explaining that this was my only phone and I couldn't go weeks without a phone and would be forced to buy a new phone because their POS phone didn't last 6 months so I felt a refund was perfectly reasonable to ask for.  They disagree.  BTW - they sent the phone back and when I called today reiterating that I wanted a refund not a POS phone, they told me the only issue they could find was a stuck button on the side.

The internet is sometimes slow even when connected to WIFI and 3G just sucks. Then, when typing, it takes a few seconds for the letters or even whole words to show up. The animation in apps is sometimes choppy. Now the biggest headache of all time has unleashed! The phone just cuts off for no reason at all.

One difference between the Samsung transform and the LG venice is that there is no LED indicator to let you know when a notification has arrived or when the device is completed charging, but that isn't a huge deal. Since this phone only has the onscreen keyboard it takes a little getting used to but can pretty accurately choose give me options for auto complete. Quicknote is a new feature with this phone as well, you can do a screen capture then use your finger or a stylus to make a note on that screen capture and share it by email or social media. It is a cool little feature but I have not gotten much use out of it yet.
