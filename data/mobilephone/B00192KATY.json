{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great \"Above Basic\" Phone", "Author": "Shopper", "ReviewID": "R1TRYNM8UFEPF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone for a long time and let my friend borrow it for about a year.My friend literally beat the phone up and it works perfectly fine (About 3 years of use!). The battery life is also still amazing!Once you get used to the phone's UI and all it's little features, you will absolutely love it. I am an avid Android user. I had the G1 for a year. When my G1 got stolen, the W610i was my back up. Switching back to a basic phone wasn't easy but I fell in love with this phone again once I relearned the UI.If you hate bulky smart phones and hate tiny basic phones, this phone is smack dab in the middle. Data plans on phones are overrated.Great basic phone functions.Camera is really slow.Great music player.Very bright flashlight.Very loud speaker.Doesn't use microSD.Front buttons are PERFECT. They never stick or wear and are easily replaceable if you decided to buy a new housing.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bought this for my teenage granddaugter and she has not put it down.", "Author": "Ann S.

Blevins", "ReviewID": "R16AFRIP6VX2NH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had owned a similar phone, which was damaged beyond repair. Couldn't find anything I liked locally. Everything is a mini computer now. I just wanted another phone that can make calls, text & picture message, and take photos. This one does it. Had a few problems connecting to the net when I first got it, but Sony has a fantastic web site that got me up and running super easily. This phone takes a decent photo, too. So, if your looking for a reasonably basic phone, I'd recommend this one.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GSM 850 / GSM 900 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900\nWalkman 2.0 Music Player, T9, TrackID, FM Radio, Image Viewer, Picture Editor / Blogging\n2.0 Megapixel Camera with Video, Flash, Autofocus\nExternal M2 Memory Support\nBluetooth v2.0 A2DP, USB, Infrared Port, EDGE, HSCSD, GPRS", "Name": "Sony Ericsson W610i in Black/Orange GSM Unlocked Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KzhjtilTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00192KATY"}}
