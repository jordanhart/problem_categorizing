It is very clear from day one that it's not about your screen size but about holding this phone in you hand and being able to use it. It came with iOS 7 on it and I do plan to upgrade to iOS 8 this fall. This is the 3rd iPhone model that I have owned and I don't intend to switch to anything else. It is very clear why people switch to this platform from Android, Blackberry, and Symbian. Nothing beats the best. It is stable, secure, and very long battery life. The battery that comes built in lasts all day long. If you are not used to the lightweight nature of the iPhone 5 and like the weight of the iPhone 4 series of devices, put a Moshi JuicePack Air on it and more than double your battery life while giving it a nice case and the extra heft that your hands are used to. It takes awhile to get used to how lightweight this device is and to not let it slip out of your grip. I absolutely love the metal texture on the back it is cool to the touch. Siri is now a true pleasure to use and is a very good assistant. I look forward to each update and the apps automatically updating keeps me in step with making sure that nothing crashes. The camera and microphone on this device are excellent. Filming movies in 1080p is easy and using the special effects and the wonderful flash are amazing. Because of the JuicePack Air which I charge every night, I leave home with 200% battery and never turn off my wifi and use this as my watch, stop watch, alarm clock, camera, email, messaging, and my flashlight almost everywhere I go. LTE speed is fantastic and I hardly ever have any problems on the AT&T; network no matter where I travel or roam. AirPlay with my AppleTV and AirDrop both work fantastically. I was able to pair the Bluetooth with several car models and use the speakerphone and iPod features with no problems. I have also tested USB in-car device playback and it was very easy to use just like it always has been with every iPod and iPhone model. As a primary computer with the dual core A7 64-bit and the M7 graphics co-processor you never miss a beat. I used this as my primary computer for 4 months when my Macintosh was stolen. I was able to get most everything done that I needed to do, including using iWork and Pages to find a job and file billing information. iCloud is a dream to use compared to other cloud based services that just don't quite cut it and each year it gets even better. I really love iCloud Keychain the most because it's synchronized with my Mac and remembers all my credit cards and debit cards safely. I have setup iTunes Match as well and absolutely love having it going with my 10GB shared data plan. Now all my songs, movies, and TV shows go with me everywhere, and take up no space on the phone at all. I have used Android (1.5 - 4.2) and Windows Phone 7.x - 8.x quite a bit as well as Blackberry 10. None of them compare to what I get on iOS 7. The only one that is starting to come close is Windows Phone 8.1 and with what will happen in iOS 8.0 this fall, Microsoft you must work harder. I'm not going to say that the other devices don't deserve a place but the best part about owning an iPhone is that it stays up to date and as many devices as possible can install the updates with no problems. There are some devices that cannot and there are a lot of people that have iOS hardware that do not know how to use it properly because they don't take the time to learn how or have someone guide them through it. It really is not hard to learn and is a lot simpler than most computers. I would highly recommend this phone to someone who doesn't \"get\" computers and wants their first smart-device. Also do not worry about privacy and your fingerprint. It never even leaves the device not once and no apps not even those from Apple gain access to your fingerprint data, it's handled by a service of the hardware directly, you can set up as many fingerprints as you want but you must always have a PIN code or password setup as a backup and don't forget it because you will need it every time you restart the phone after a major update or plane trip. Overall it's good to be an iPhone user, I never have the problems that other phone users complain about.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "The score I am hit to customer service, a staff name Racquel!!!", "Author": "Lei Z.", "ReviewID": "R3JKEGSICMKPP7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The score I am hit to customer service, a staff name Racquel,I buy this phone in a month ago, because of some reasons lead to the phone I haven't use!Finally I reflect the problem to think name is Racquel staff, he is very careful, and have the patience to help me to solve this problem!", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Was not unlocked as advertised", "Author": "Christian Pineda", "ReviewID": "R1JJU9R83UBV9Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone did not come unlocked as advertised.

Something has gone wrong during screen manufacturing and/or calibration. Screen is so sensitive to touch - sometimes it thinks someone touched it when nobody did.
