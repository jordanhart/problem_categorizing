Recently, the phone froze up while attempting to remove an app and I had to resort to the restore mode. Unfortunately, unlocked phones are sometimes plagued by errors while trying to restore; something I am beginning to understand is likely done on purpose to discourage the purchase of unlocked phones, but that is just my opinion. At any rate, the seller, Wireovia, immediately responded to my request for help and provided a thorough guideline of instructions with all links and programs necessary to completely restore my phone and then some. The final step in the restore included downloading a program that has appeared to stabilize the device. My appreciation to Wireovia for their great customer service and to their employee, Chris, who was very pleasant.
