One missed call from the right customer can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in missed revenue or commissions. (Although, believe me, most of our deals are not on this scale!)We chose Cingular due to their size after merging with ATT, but I was quite frustrated in the phones they offered.I quickly grew disenchanted with their Motorola phones and their poor reception....and believe me, it was the phones - not the carrier as many people had different Cingular phones and were getting good reception.  Problem was that these phones just didn't have all the features that I wanted.I really researched the phones and although the Nokia 7610 is only available online right now in most areas, it had all the features of a \"Smart Phone\" without all the bulk of a Blackberry.The Nokia 7610 is a medium-size phone that has Bluetooth AND USB connectivity to the Web, text messaging, a GREAT camera, to-do lists, several clocks for different time zones, a voice and video recorder,calendars, and a LOT of games - although I don't often play them.  It has EVERYTHING that I wanted - especially the great camera and the BEST reception with Cingular that I have found.  To date, I haven't read a single review that really COMPLAINS about this phone.  Finally....I've discovered a truly great cell phone.  Just be sure that you buy the leather case for it (forget the awful FlexiSkin one that leaves the screen totally exposed) as you won't want to drop this one!", "Date": "January 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "freshest style avail. im in love with it", "Author": "H.

It came with 1 64MB rsMMC and another 256 MB one.At the beginning, I thought the phone was great, it took to me almost 1 month to choose this phone among other nokia's(6630 and 6670).But the time passed and I discovered the phone had an operative system called Symbias OS, uncovering an unexpected expansion possibility of the phone so that I started downloading hundreds of Symbian applications and 3D games. I have been able to view Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF and text documents, e-books, e-news and more after downloading the appropiate apps.The Fun Area is the biggest one on this phone: There are hundreds of 3D-non-sucky- Symbian games, java games, N-GAGE games, NES, SNES and Game Boy games(after installing the emulators).Theres a app called SmartMovie that lets you convert your movies to DivX(MPEG-4) format and play them directly in your phone at full screen,including subs.Of course you can also play and listen to MP3,AAC,WAV and many other audio formats directly on the speaker or with the hands-freeThe Connecticity trhu Bluetooth and USB cable lets you share with other phones virtually all of your media(some times you need to change the file extensions to something non-commercial like .mid to .nid, .sis to .sij, or .jar to .jak, in order for the phone to let you send the file to other phones via BT) comparing to the annoying copyright protections added for free to all Motorolas, Sony-Ericsson and even Samsung'sYou can also download enhancements for the camera: camera games, lens-deforming apps for funnier faces, movie editors, MPEG recorders. The possibilities are endless.The bad part is that Nokia's motto is to leave you wanting more.This phone lacks a couple things I would have loved to have, like:-Internet access via Bluetooth connection with PC(older nokia models like 6600 were able to do this)-EDGE(a High Speed data transfer protocol)-FM Radio-Stereo playback-Push To Talk-Flash for the camera-Secondary VGA camera (for video calling)-WLAN for Wi-Fi Internet Access(the coming soon Nokia N80 will have it)", "Date": "December 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "I love that!!", "Author": "Estelle Bellamont \"Rich Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R2KDC2KNYUG1XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW, from the first time I saw it, I'm fall in love with it!It's Shape (like a leaf) is very very nice!

It is a little quirky though when you first set it up.It is more difficult to set up the speed dials than the Nokia 3220 or the Nokia 6010. You have to go under profiles to do it. On the Nokia 3200 or 6010 you just hold down the button you want to set up the speed dial on and it prompts you automatically to set it up. Not on the 7610.To adjust the ringing tones and the volume, you also have to set it up under profiles. If you just search under Settings and Sounds, there's nothing there and you will assume this phone comes with only one ringing tone. It doesn't.I got my phone with a Chinese (I should say Asian, I don't really know what language it is) manual, but I found the English manual online easy enough.In order to receive MMS you have to set it up on the phone. I haven't yet figured out how to get there, but I'm working on it.The manual does not give step-by-step instructions. It tends to skip one or two steps and you have to figure it out by yourself.There is no way to set up the Menu button on the selection button. That's frustrating.I don't listen to music on this phone and I'm not into ringtones so I can't say anything about that. I just use it as a regular good ole' phone.It is bigger than I thought, definitely bigger than my old Nokia 3220. The camera is better.When you take a photo though, it doesn't save it under Gallery like you'd think. It saves the photo under the Camera option. If you want to set up a photo as the wallpaper, you have to move the photo from the Camera to the Gallery and set it up from there. There is no option to set up a screen saver.The buttons are hard plastic. I don't really like that.The volume on the handset is good but the speaker volume is awful.All in all I do like it, even with the quirks.I do love Nokia phones and will keep buying them.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent but a bit pricey", "Author": "R.

I cannot compare it to the other's sice I have not used any, but this phone is way cool!!. The phone stands out in a crowd (specially the black and red one), the reception and quality of sound is exceptional and the picture clarity is magnificient due to its 1 megapixel capability. The video is also quite good. Highly recommended.", "Date": "September 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "Unique phone, thats packed with featues, and more.", "Author": "A. CRUZ", "ReviewID": "R2N5EMI5O8JC3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just updated to the 7610 from my Nokia 3650. Some of the applications were similar, so it didn't take long to get use the new phone. The 7610 seems to have everything that the 3650 had, and  more. For one, instead of a maximum of 9 second video clips, I get a FULL 10 minutes of video. The picture quality is a hell of a lot better to. On the other side, the megapixel does look better then VGA camera, but not as good as a real digital camera. But apart from that, the internet was one of the biggest sellling points for me. Not only does this phone have support for WAP, and xhtml, but also for HTML. You can view web pages on the phone the same way view them on your PC. The only real downside of this, is that Cingular charges $0.03 per kb sent and received. And some pages use up 64kb or more. And just to get unlimited internet use you'd have to pay $25 a month. After paying so much for this phone, one could start to regret having to pay so much just to use it. Another downside of this phone is it's reception and clarity. While the 3650 had decent clarity while calling someone,  this phone lacks that. And the volume of the call is always to quite, but I just turn on the speaker phone. Overall, I'd say this is more thena  decent phone, and it seems that every time I show it off to people they always be impressed.", "Date": "February 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "good but", "Author": "R.
