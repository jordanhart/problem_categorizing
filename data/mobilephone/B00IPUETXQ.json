Unfortunately, everything else about it is not. 3G is not compatible. Since there is only 2G on the phone, the phone goes in and out of service. Also, there is no way to change how off the screen touch is. The phone freezes a lot! I took this phone to my nearest T-Mobile store, and they couldn't do anything with it because the screen froze. Within a day of having this phone, there were so many issues, I sent it back. I would not recommend this phone.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "A super quadcore android device!", "Author": "CINDY BELL", "ReviewID": "RZ5U6QFJAI2DJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When you go to shop for a decent android phone you go crazy looking at the options and reviews.This one had none ,so I decided to have a go anyways seeing the terriffic reviews in some of their other phones.The quadcore processor lured me and boy I hit a jackpot.This is a state of art device with the following great features.An extremely fast MTK processor  which makes using aapps and toggling between them a pleasure.No freezing of apps, no delays and precision browsing.Super wifi connectivity.Long range and graet internet speed.Easy and instant autiomatic set up.
