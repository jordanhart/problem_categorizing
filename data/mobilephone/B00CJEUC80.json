My only complaint so far has been the battery life isn't the greatest, but its manageable. The camera works well, call quality is good, overall a decent smartphone for prepaid, definitely one of Straight Talk's better phones. One thing about the specs listed on this page...the phone has a 1 GHz processor, not 800 MHz. As the other reviewer has said, if you plan on getting this phone, shop around a little.
