However, I was not going to complain because I got it for a great price. However, within 4 days it stop working, I could not  see anything on the screen and I was without phone for 3days which is a nightmare because I have no home phone line. Like that old saying  if you think it is to good to be true it is. Don't buy this phone!!!!", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "don't bother.", "Author": "D.

Anderson \"Chastity\"", "ReviewID": "R10NQQR0ZDZJF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, BlackBerrys (at least the ones Sprint currently sells) aren't multimedia devices. Yet, the 8703e is a great phone and PDA. One thing that struck me when I first got it was how good the call quality/clarity was. I wasn't expecting such good performance in this area from a smartphone. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.One area BBs do well in is email (push email). You can set up to 10 separate accounts and have all those emails sent directly to the BB. Its a great way to stay connected (without having to check manually) when you're on the go. There are many other apps that also take advantage of 'push' services which really make the 8703e shine.Pinning: This is one thing that I've really started to enjoy and never even knew about previously. Each BB has its own Pin. If you get the Pin of another BB user, you can IM each other free of charge. Sites like pinstack.com have 100k plus users from around the world who enjoy quick conversation on their BBs.It's hard to sum up all of its features, but needless to say, I've begun to find my BB indispensable. I take it with me everywhere and continue to marvel at its usefulness.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "You Definitely get what you pay for.", "Author": "TT that's Me \"TT that's Me\"", "ReviewID": "R2GVCZCRBY4PC1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a backup phone for my daughter until she got her new one.
