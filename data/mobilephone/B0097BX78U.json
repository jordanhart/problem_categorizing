Its screen looks much brighter than an iPhone 4 with the same brightness setting.  Also all iPhones are easier to learn & use than any Android and every other smartphone I've used before.  And I've been using smartphones since the first PalmPilot many years ago.  Apple also requires all apps to do similar things in similar ways.  So this makes it much quicker and easier to learn and use an iPhone, compared to any other smartphone.  It also makes it much quicker and easier to learn an iPad.

The 1st, 2nd, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, and now the 5. By far (and obviously expected) this iPhone is the very best of them all. Not by just small margins, no, the screen size, increased speed, double ram, and thinner form definitely show up and are much needed. Standards now, in fact. My only gripe is the new charger port. While I can see why they needed to make it, now I had to buy new cords and chargers. No deal breaker though. If you are on the fence, and love Apple devices, this is the device to buy (perhaps even when the iPhone 6 comes out).", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good stuff", "Author": "Jroman123", "ReviewID": "R3S1SXZDYO6NIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iphone 5 is the nest thing that came out so far from apple.
