{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very pleased with purchase", "Author": "James Hurst", "ReviewID": "R1FOV1KI2CDS57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Moto X as an upgrade from my Galaxy S3.  I shopped it against the Galaxy S4, Note 3, iPhone 5S, HTC One X, and 2013 Droid Maxx.My smart phone history is iPhone->iPhone 3GS->HTC Thunderbolt 4G->Samsung GS3->Moto X.  I've also used my wife's HTC 8X extensively.I'm a fairly advanced user, working largely in the IT field.  I've rooted phones in the past, but haven't bothered since the later releases of Verizon's S3 ROMs caught up with most of what I was wanting.  I don't expect to root the Moto X.  I'm also fairly hard on phones, doing warranty or extended warranty replacements about once a year, usually for a cracked screen or water damage.  I run and bike with them in an armband or bike mount, and they often get sweat on, and occasionally get dropped.When looking for a new phone, I wanted something with good battery life, was VERY responsive, and that felt good to hold and use.  I went through three S3's in various states of ROM's, mostly from Verizon, and was never fully satisfied with how responsive or reliable the phone was.  After years of using these things, I've finally figured out that I'm just not going to play games on my phone, and that 90% of what I'm going to do is news, audio, e-mail, calendar, notes, text, diet/exercise tracking, camera/video, and social media.  Less frequently, I do techie things like RDP, run network tools, use office apps, check IP cameras.  Occasionally, I'll watch Netflix or read Kindle.  I say all of this so you understand my use model and how it relates to my review.  There are a lot of different ways to use phones and reasons to choose them, so the way I use mine heavily informs my opinion.  My app list: MyNetDiary, Endomondo, Evernote, Maps, Email, Gmail, USA Today, Audible, Spotify, DoggCatcher, Engadget, reddit is fun, Facebook, Better Terminal Emulator, PocketCloud, Skype, Ping&DNS;, WeatherBug, IMDB, Amazon, Kindle, Netflix, Pandora, NFL Mobile.My principle complaint with the S3 was battery life, followed by lagginess and reboots.  It is a relative complaint, because both were far better than the Thunderbolt that came before it.My top two choices for new phones were the Note 3 and Moto X - two very different phones.  The S4, to me, didn't differentiate itself enough from the S3 to get me excited about it.  I've used it and have friends that purchased it, and it seems to be a good phone - more responsive than the S3, with better battery life.  Despite that, it was an incremental improvement, and I wasn't very interested in any of its new gee-whiz tricks, such as motion navigation or eye tracking, and they didn't seem to work very well in practice.The Note 3 was attractive to me due to it's high spec sheet, long battery life, and better ability to do 'real work' via its pen and larger, higher res screen.  Ultimately, however, I decided real world performance for my apps (noted above) was more important than specs, and I also decided that my remote real work set (primarily e-mail composition, spreadsheet edits, network tests, and remote RDP sessions) was too small a part of my use case to merit the extra size of the Note 3.  The size was particularly a concern when wearing on an arm band for running and gym work and for one handed operation.  I also have a 7\" tablet, and a 13\" convertible ultrabook, which further minimized the need for a larger screen phone.So that leads, finally, to the Moto X.  Here are some things I really like about it, in order of importance to me, after about a week of use.  Some of these points may also apply to other phones - I'm not saying they are exclusive to the Moto X, but they are what is most noticeable/important to me after a week's use.Long battery life - I like to go on long, 7+ hour bike rides while tracking with Endomondo and streaming music.  The GS3 died after about 5 hours, and this one makes it with power to spare.  If I take it off the charger at 6:30 AM, and plug it in for bed at 11 PM, it has about 20% left after a day of normal use for me (mostly reading Reddit at lunch doing email and text throughout the day, and maybe an hour or so of other misc use of the apps above).  I also play audio (Audible, DoggCatcher, or Spotify) from it for about 90 minutes a day during my drive.Feel in hand - I got used to the GS3, and sometimes appreciated the larger size (such as if watching the rare Netflix item or using RDP), but didn't ever like the long thumb reach for one handed use.  The Moto X feels PERFECT to me.  I like the weight, the grip, and the reach.  This one is pretty subjective, so I suggest holding one in a store if you can.Rock solid up time and no operation lag - This may be partly due to my relatively limited app set, to the faster processor in this phone, or to the new Android build on this phone, but whatever it is, I like it.  Everything happens instantly, without stutter, and that is what I want.Low power background alert system - I didn't realize I would like this as much as I do, but I really like the way the phone puts alerts (e-mail, text, message, alarm) on the screen with swipe up to view, left to clear, and down to unlock actions.  It is efficient.App for texting on laptop - I'm sure there are other 3rd party apps that do this, but it was built in to the Moto X, and is the first time I've done it.  With the Chrome plugin installed, all of my texts and calls pop up on my laptop while at work.  This works well with my work flow so that I can quickly copy and paste information form there into Outlook or other documents that I am working on.Made a few miles from my house - As someone who works in domestic manufacturing, I appreciate the challenge that Google/Flextronics/Motorola undertook when scaling the old Nokia plant up in such short order to build 100,000 of these a week.  The phone didn't cost me more than an S4 would have, and I like it that it was made in Ft. Worth, TX, USA.Continuous voice recognition - This is by far the best voice recognition I've used on any product.  That said, it still hasn't made it into my daily work flow.  I have to think too much about how to phrase my commands when I want it to do things and usually still have to look at the screen to OK or approve whatever it wants to know.  I still put it on the list, because I am impressed with what it CAN do and because it is useful for dictating texts and e-mails, but it COULD be a game changing feature, and it still isn't quite there yet for me.  The continuous listening aspect is dead on for me, with zero false positives or need to initiate recognition manually.  Cool.If I didn't mention a feature in this list, it doesn't mean it was bad, it just means it didn't stand out or wasn't important to me.  The camera, for example, was adequate but didn't strike me as significantly better or different from the S3 or other phones I've used - then again, I've only used it for a few test photos.  Most of my camera use is work related, and I tend to use a DSLR for family stuff.  The flick action for launching the camera isn't 100% reliable and has both failed to go off when I've tried to use it and gone off intentionally in my pocket when not, so I do it manually.  I like the screen, but would have preferred 1080p.  Overall though, it has good brightness and viewing angles, and I think it was a good compromise if it helped get the battery life where it is.  I haven't really noticed a difference in call quality across my entire phone history mentioned above.  IMO, they all suck, and Verizon can't roll out HD voice soon enough.  Music quality is good, but I can't tell a difference from the others.I'll try to answer questions if you have them.  I like this phone and would like to see it do well.  The mobile industry needs more than two strong players - competition is good for all of us.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "What an Android (or any mobile) Phone should be", "Author": "Peter Marone III", "ReviewID": "R1KM4ZY6WHMV5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Original Posted Sep 5 on the AT&T; Moto X page as a VZW specific page did not exist**To start with, I have the Verizon Moto X - your network experience may vary, but the phone hardware/software are still relevant.This is absolutely the best Android phone, and I'd say simply best mobile phone, to date.Since the Galaxy Nexus, I'm convinced that the plain, unmodified Android 4.x OS is the best way to experience an Android phone. The plain OS is fast, and elegant in design. Unfortunately, the Galaxy Nexus hardware was a bit flakey and dated, and the Moto X was the closest to a Nexus phone I can get for VZW. There are a few Motorola specific apps preinstalled, but they are worth it when viewing the phone as a complete system.First, the phone itself - I love the design - the size, curve, feel and weight are just right. Even though it's not a hyped up metal case, the phone feels solid and fits nicely in the hand (I've actually had a hard time putting it down). The default Black \"weave\" color looks awesome. The phone is slightly smaller than the Galaxy Nexus, and shows that the trend of bigger smart phones does not equate to a \"better\" smartphone - just bigger. The display is certainly large enough, and looks very sharp and bright. More importanly, the Moto X fits easily in any pocket, and likely just about any hand. The phone is very responsive and quick at the OS, application, and network levels (especially if using wireless AC). Voice recognition is spot on, and works even when the phone is \"sleeping\". Battery life with general usage seems at least enough to last through most of a day - the battery isn't removable, but it's slightly larger than the \"extended\" life battery I had in the Galaxy Nexus, and the phone has been lasting between charges longer than the Nexus with the extended battery did.This is truly a \"smart\" phone unlike most others with that name. Using various sensors, hardware, and applications, the phone knows its position, orientation, location, speed, and will change how it functions based on programming and user-input. For instance, The Assist application allows you to set your sleep times, and the phone can then be configured to not ring, or only allow \"favorite\" contacts to ring during this time. When the phone senses it's in a vehicle, it automatically kicks into a \"driving\" mode, where you can configure Assist for things such as a autoresponse that you are driving and will message back, and read text messages/caller IDs to you. A meeting mode will examine your calendar info, and provide you with automatic silencing of phone sounds and other options. Especially useful for meetings is the Active Notifications functions - keep the phone face-up, and you'll get silent notifications on the lock screen that you can discreetly access with a single touch (turn the phone face down and the Active Notification feature turns off). The Moto X also can tell if it's in a pocket and turn off Active Notifications to save battery life.Voice control is a key part of this phone - you can easily speak to the phone (even in sleep mode) to place a call, send text messages, get information, schedule appointments - just about any basic function of the phone can be accessed via voice commands. Siri? Who the heck is Siri? :)I've used plenty of mobile phones and \"smart\" phones over the past 15 years (Motorola, Qualcomm, Sony, Kyocera, HTC, Samsung, Blackberry, among others). I took a close look at current VZW offerings (Nokia Lumina, HTC One, new Motorola Droids), and I am confident in saying that the Moto X is the best phone I've used or \"test drove\".Update - Sep 11, 2013.I'm really, really impressed with the battery life on this phone. I've been letting it (or trying to let it) run down to 10% or less before charging (which probably isn't necessary, but I'm an old school battery memory guy), and have been getting to 36+ hours between charges so far. My use is usually about an hour talk time, various text/messenger messages, facebook browsing, playing with the voice commands, email push updates, and for the first few days, download/configuration of various apps.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best phone I've ever owned", "Author": "cshuttle", "ReviewID": "R2AC8L7K21WQ79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, I was concerned about leaving the pure Google experience for something else. Other things that I was concerned about coming over to this phone were the radios, battery life, etc.I'm deeply pleased to say that despite my potential concerns, this is the best phone I've ever owned.The battery life of this phone is consistently over 1 day, the system never stutters despite having a less-than-cutting-edge processor, the contextual processors are really cool (the pulsing feature is especially helpful and very useful) and the things like twist to camera are very nice touches. I would also think that further updates in the future will further enhance the experience.Things to be critical about -- the \"ok google now\" commands don't work super well if you've got a keypad lock on your phone (which is, of course, expected). The camera could stand for some serious software improvements (which are coming), but it's still a little sub-par. Yes, it does not have 4.3 (soon to be 4.4) installed, but the \"big features\" like low-power BT and filesystem trim are backported to this 4.2 version, so I earnestly don't think there's a ton to complain about. Of course, this is Verizon, so I'm sure there will be an update sometime around 2015.Things to be baffled about (short list) -- There's no photosphere for the camera natively. I have no earthly idea why this is not included in the default camera, particularly since its been part of the ecosphere for about a year now.In short, my primary concerns around speed and battery life have been absolute non-issues. I would easily stack this up against the iPhone 5 in every sense (minus the camera). This device sponsors a \"vendor skinning\" that is not obtrusive or annoying; it's useful and complimentary. The best phone I've ever owned.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Sum Of All Averages with kitkat", "Author": "DonaldWhite", "ReviewID": "R1VS06K5DC41YW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My take on the phone after using it for a day or so.I am a google fanboy. I have google tattooed on my forearm. I really really wanted this phone to be a stopping point on my endless search for MORE. More power. More ram. More gimmicks. So i bit the bullet and ordered my moto x on verizon.com partly due to finding a 50 dollar coupon Verizon30.In short it fell short of some of my critical expectations.Speed wise. this thing is smooth. All actions feel extremely quick and responsive. This will be more than perfect for 90% of the people who will undoubtedly purchase this phone.aesthetically this phone is quite nice. the backing with its little Motorola indent is really nice to hold. it feels soft but durable. its actually quite a pleasure to use for any amount of time.The screen looks so much more vibrant than my galaxy nexus. and the active display i find to be actually useful. The screen only turns on the pixels it needs to display your notifications so it doesnt use as much battery life as youd thinkI Felt i should mention the NO SD Card Slot. I always thought this would bother me. But after the Galaxy nexus i found that i really didnt need it. In a age of subscriptions. I currently have Spotify, Netflix, SiriusXm, and Google All Access, i just dont store that much on my phone or the stuff i fill it with i hardly ever use more of a security blanket in those scarce offline times.\"ALMOST\" stock android experience. This is one of the unspoken heros of this phone. Although Verizon has installed their typical bloatware. Motorola itself has not messed with too much. I would have preferred STOCK. this is seriously the next best thing .Active Display. I love active display. for those who dont know active display is the automatic updates that get displayed on your screen while the phones in standby. With active display only turning on the pixels it needs to display the relevant information it barely uses any battery life. This is one feature i dont know how i will live without in the future.Now to my gripes.First is battery. This phone was touted to be one of the most efficient phones on the market with its specially designed hardware. It is not what i expected at all. While the always listening chip is great. and actually works well. The battery life is no better than any other phone ive seen on the market. i say this because most phones in which have the highest complaints also have the ability to remove the battery and add a bigger one. THIS phone does not have that option. and thus is crippling to someone who was expecting at least 18-20 hours on above average use. with sending a few text messages throughout the day and listening to a album or two on all access i got about 8 1/2 - 9 hours. This may be ok for most. but i believe a phone should be able to make it a full day.Especially this one with its \"ENERGY SAVING Chipset and Screen.\" In the day and age where outlets and usb ports are everywhere we look, there is still something unnerving knowing that you better bring your charger wherever you go just in case. <------See End of Review for update on Battery ---->And Second. and this is completely VERIZONS fault. and was almost a reason to switch to ATT. MOTOMAKER!!. Motomaker felt like a breathe of fresh air. being able to customize almost every detail of the outside of your phone. This felt important to me. It inspired faith in Motorola and in Google. it Screamed unique! BUT of course as usual, Verizon botches everything. Is it really worth it to wait 4 months after a phone comes out to customize it. a phone might i add that has mid level specs.Verizon really needs to get there butts in gear. i feel like they have screwed up every launch of every flashship phone in years. Either they don't have it in stores. or they don't update it. or they just plain ole don't have it period.Understand that this is the sum of all averages type of phone. The Peoples Phone. Mid level specs. Mid level build quality. MID LEVEL. it is perfect for the bulk of the market. A phone id get my parents and trust they'd be fine. For someone who uses there phone for more than that 2 texts a day and a phone call to the pizza guy at night. You might want to wait for something else or at the very least the price to drop to something like $150/contract - $450/offThe last thing i would like to mention is Motorola's track record with their software updates. They have been notoriously bad and we have yet to see if Motorola under the Ownership of Google will have any affect on that.UPDATE: Hell has frozen over. Motorola just updated the moto x to kitkat.  Only 3 weeks after kitkat came out.  Extremely impressive considering that one it was on verizon and two my girlfriends nexus 4 still hasnt been upgraded.UPDATE : Original Phone had a bad proximity sensor. So anytime I would make a call the screen would shut off and no matter what I would do would get it to turn the screen back on.. And thus you couldnt end a call or get to the dialpad. Also because there is no removable battery there was no way (to my knowledge) to turn off the phone to reset it. (UPDATE) A FRIENDLY COMMENTER BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT HOLDING DOWN THE POWER BUTTON FOR 10 SECONDS WILL POWER DOWN THE PHONE)Verizon did send me a brand new phone which works perfectly and gets much better battery life. i am now getting 17 hours of use on a normal day.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone is small package!", "Author": "RL \"RL\"", "ReviewID": "RU8KO0EPGXKQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please note you can get this phone at verizon.com for 30% off ($140).  Use coupon code verizon30.  This also works for some other phones.OK, so you got this far to look at reviews.  I have had this phone for 4 days and think it is an excellent phone.  Some background; previous phones are Galaxy S3 and iPhone 4s.  I researched and looked in detail at the Galaxy S4, Droid Maxx, HTC One, iPhone 5s and LG G2.  I ended up with this phone because of the size and still has an excellent 4.7\" display, the built quality and feel in the hand, excellent battery life, stock Android with some really useful add on features.After being very frustrated with the battery life and lag on the S3 I decided it was time to upgrade.  All the phones I mentioned are good phones.  They are all noticeable larger than the Moto X.  With the exception of the 5s which has a 4\" screen which I feel is just too small.  The Moto X has better battery life than all but the Droid Maxx and LG G2.  I get a day and a half with average usage.  This varies for everyone.  The Verizon version of the G2 is not that good because they redesigned the rear buttons in order to put in wireless charging.  This along with the LG UI and not being sure how the LG will do in the market and provide timely updates removed it off my list.  And with my demand for a long battery life that eliminated all the others except the Droid Maxx.  The Maxx and X are very similar phones.  The Maxx does have the best battery life but it is larger and heavier with the 5\" screen and extended battery.  If you are fine with that or prefer the larger screen that may be the way to go.  I felt the size and feel of the Moto X was better for me in comparison so I choose the Moto X.The negatives of the Moto X are that it is only available with 16GB at this time and it is sealed so you cannot add not add an SD card or change the battery.  The Maxx is also sealed but has 32GB.  This was not a deal breaker for me.  My plan was that if I was disappointed with the Moto X battery I would exchange (14 days) for the Maxx.  So far I have been very impressed with the battery life.  I have read some reviews that have complained about the call quality and the camera quality.  I have not had issues with either.  There is also an update to the camera software that will fix some of the issues that people complained about.  The call quality and speakerphone have been good for me.  It does have an excellent speaker.  Maybe not as good as the HTC One but plenty good.The additional features include the active notifications (screen blinks every 5 seconds to show notifications, Motorola Assist (detects when you are driving and changes settings accordingly), Motorola connect (you can see you calls and texts from your computer and respond), and hands free Google Now (you can access Google Now hands free and it will do various functions like calls, calendar events and Google searches).  You can read more about these functions on the various reviews of the Moto X and new Droids.Hope this was helpful and feel free to ask any questions.  Thx.An update (10-15-13): Still very happy with phone and the battery has been great and it charges quickly. I did notice that the screen can be difficult to see in sunlight. The auto brightness does not adjust well when outside, you will need to go into setting and turn up the brightness. Not a deal breaker for me. I was also going to recommend the case I got from Amazon but it is no longer on Amazon. It is nice if you want a very thin case with a good grip (Areser Ultra Thin Slim Fit Quicksand Hard Case + Free Stylus Pen for Moto X Phone (Sold by Areser Trade)).", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best UI and Hardware combo available!", "Author": "Andrew M. Juskelis \"Andy\"", "ReviewID": "R1CD1DXODKB0S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little hesitant to bite the bullet on the Moto X given my lackluster experience with Motorola hardware in the past (Droid Bionic and Razr M). However the $50 contract price with Verizon, and the fact that this is Google's first \"vertically integrated\" phone since the purchase of Motorola, sent me over the edge and I went for it.I am so glad I did. I'm not a \"spec freak\" by any means. This is hands down the best UI experience I've ever had on a smartphone. Screen flips are quick, the pulse feature is amazing, and I even have better reception with this unit compared to others in the past. The speaker is VERY loud, especially for being on the back, and the stock Android environment gives you the smartphone experience Google had in mind. It will make you wonder why the carriers were ever able to get away with their skinning and bastardization of Google's product. The hardware proves that clock speed isn't everything.Battery life has surpassed my Razr M by almost double. I'm a moderate user and can go 24 hours without a charge, but end up charging every night out of habit.If there was any one thing to nitpick on, which there barely is, it would be the \"pulse\" feature. It is liberating and refreshing to have the phone sense that I've taken it out of my pocket or picked it up off the table and present me with the unlock screen without pushing a button. However this tends to backfire occasionally as I've developed a bad habit of carrying too many things in my hands at once, including my phone in between two fingers. This of course registers as a screen touch on the unlock screen and can end up unlocking the phone when I don't want it to. But that is seriously the only negative I can think of at this time.In summary, this is the best phone available for people that value usability and design over arbitrary specifications.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola Finally Makes a Phone worth Owning", "Author": "Timothy Swann", "ReviewID": "R3SIU03T6K7F8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from Moto Maker (on Verizon, the only difference is the radios so this is relevant) during their holiday sale where the off contract price came down to $350. Since I've had this phone for a while now, and I am now equipped to write my review. I wrote one for the Galaxy Nexus(GNex) after that was released since I bought it the day it came out and my review received nearly 200 votes (mostly helpful), so it seems like people found my review useful. I've posted this review for all the different carrier variants since the hardware and software are all the same except for radios.Hardware DesignThe design of this phone is truly one to appreciate. The fact that I was able to customize the look of mine is not the reason I say that. I can say that this phone does not feel like you're holding an iPhone or a Samsung or any other phone for that matter. It does not feel cheaply made (and being made in the US, it isn't!). It had just enough weight and the part on the outside, don't feel like plastic like most Samsung phones. Don't get me wrong, Samsung makes very good phones, but they all feel cheap, but that's my opinion and others feel the same way. I happen to think the Moto X has a premium feel compared to my old GNexThe screen is much more enjoyable than my Gnex was. This is not to say that I didn't like the screen on my GNex because I did, but the colors seem better on the Moto X. Every user will have a different opinion though. Many people like the IPS Retina display on the iPhone and the best comparison to that is the LG G2, which has a great screen. The AMOLED screen on the Moto X is very good for me though.Continuing with the design near the screen, the rounded edges all around the front of the phone actually feel great. What do I mean by that? Since this screen is truly edge to edge, if you find yourself swiping from the edges a lot, you won't feel the sharpness an edge usually feels like.The mic is on the front of the screen and very noticeable, so when using speaker phone and turn the phone face down to have the speaker facing up, it results in the other person hearing an echo. Didn't have that problem with my GNex, but that is probably because the mic was not very visible on the bottom.I do have a gripe about the design of two things though. Perhaps it's because I'm used to have my GNex, but have the volume rocker and the power button on the same side (the right side), feels awkward to me. But Samsung has it correct in my eyes with the volume rocker on the left side and the power button on the right side. The other thing for me is having the micro USB port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack on the top. I don't like this part AT ALL. For those that don't have cars that have Bluetooth Streaming, this creates cord clutter. However, there are times where having the headphone jack on the top can be nice. For example, as a runner I take my phone with me on runs and use headphones. Since the cord doesn't need to go to the bottom of the phone that can make that experience better.SoftwareThe first Android phone I had was the Galaxy Nexus. So why do I say that here in this review. Well, I've experienced the software of other android phone through demo units and phones of friends. I don't like skinned versions of Android like what Samsung does to Android on their Galaxy phones. I do truly enjoy the stock Android experience. The Android experience is nearly stock android. There are some small Moto tweaks, but otherwise, it's the experience I enjoy.Active Notifications are truly awesome! Yes, this falls under software. Now what is that? Well instead of a notification light, a portion of the screen turns on when you have a notification, telling you exactly what app the notification is from. You can pick and choose what apps you want to show notifications through this feature. Now you might be wondering is the screen continuously shows this notification until you dismiss it. Well, you can dismiss it if you want to, but you can preview the notification and see if it's an email or a text or whatever app.Now for Touchless control. Some people may find this to be a gimmick, but it's actually not bad. I use it when in the car to make phone calls. That's about it, though occasionally, saying \"OK Google Now, what's the forecast for today\" is easier than launching an app. (call me lazy for that, it's true haha).Battery LifeI have been putting my phone through test of my everyday usage. That includes, streaming music in my car, using Google Maps for traffic conditions to and from work, texting, calling, checking personal and work emails, checking Facebook, taking the occasional picture and then some sports-related stuff too. I would imagine the average user might use their phone as much as I do in a typical day. Now, the verdict...it's very good. I was shocked at how well the battery lasted. I got more than a full day's worth of usage out of it (wake up at 5am to sleep at 10pm). That's 17 hours for me. That means most people should be able to get a full day's worth out of this phone before plugging in before going to sleep. Moto really did a fantastic job of optimizing the software, processor and screen to maximize battery life.CameraTruthfully, I haven't taken enough pictures to give a great assessment of this, but coming from my GNex, this takes far better pictures. The pictures I've taken have been in great lighting conditions and the pictures have come out great. If you want to get a good idea on the performance, you can google reviews. Keep in mind when this phone first came out, the camera wasn't great, but that was due to the camera processing software. They have fixed that. Droid-Life has samples of the before and after. They show that Moto fixed this. It's a 10MP shooter and should be good enough for everyone's every day camera taking needs.OtherThrough moto maker the phone came with Android 4.2.2. I have not upgraded to 4.4 yet becaue from what I've seen in forums, in 4.4, Verizon is able to block tethering for those who still have unlimited data (like me).

So I will admit, upfront, that I may be exhibiting extra enthusiasm due to direct comparison with that phone.  But I will also mention that I've been using a Droid Razr M as my daily driver--a phone I got from work.  I like the Razr M, it's a good size, with reasonable performance, and Motorola Smart Actions--a droid series exclusive app--is nothing short of excellent.  But, because it's a work phone, I couldn't really do much to make it my own.Enter the Moto X...Likes:Size--I have smallish hands, so I'm always taking note of how easy it is to hold something. The Moto X is a great fit in my hands, using it one-handed, or with two.  It's very comfy, and the material on the back of the phone is very pleasing to the touch, soft but grippy.Weight--this is also a subjective assessment, but it feels like this phone has heft without being heavy.  It has a sense of substance--like it's well made.  I believe that the same goes for the iPhone, but It's a fine line to walk--my wife swears her 4S is heavy enough to use a bludgeon for self defense.  I disagree, but then again, I don't use it everyday.Screen--I know that a lot of people look at this and say, \"no 1080p--no sale\" but I'm not interested in that spec chase.  This screen is bright, vibrant and crisp.  And it's using less juice than it's higher res brethren.  I'm not at all sad that it's 720p.  It's also a very good size--big, without being unwieldy.Active Notifications--this is a really novel, and really efficient, way to get quick snippets of important information from the phone.  You get good detail on incoming notifications, from a single message to several emails--all of them are easy to read, digest, and either take action on or ignore.  Well done on this feature.Android--I like iOS, I really do, and seriously considered the iPhone 5S, but the user-configurable keyboards are such a great thing, and ultimately, that was the decision point that pushed me to this side.  I am so much faster with gesture-input, it's just not even fair.  Apple really would do well to pick that up.  I've also spent a little bit of time tweaking this device to have it serve up the info I want, how I want.  It's really been nice getting it just so.  And truthfully, I didn't have do anything THAT complicated.  For folks who are looking for some good guidance, google \"lifehacker best apps for android 2013\"Voice control--I don't use this feature a lot, mainly because I don't enjoy the interruption it brings in most situations, but when I do, it's VERY good at recognizing my voice commands. I talk fairly quickly, but it still is quite accurate.Battery Life--this is all important...and subjective to how you use it...but I routinely get 2 days on a charge wihtout even trying hard.  Note--I'm on a limited data plan, so I'm actively avoiding intense activities like streaming anything.  I'm sure that helps.  But my day is typically web surfing, email, cameraKinda likes/ Kinda don't likes:Camera--it's not the best in a smartphone.  For that you go to the lumia 1020 and everything that comes with a windows phone (read: no apps)  But I have to be honest, this only needs to be as good as a cheap point and shoot.  If I know I'm going to take serious photos, I'm bringing out my dSLR.  No, it's not a great camera, it's a good-enough camera.Price--When this phone came out, it was too expensive. At the time, I bought it, it was still a little on the expensive side ($150) Who knows, it might be a penny phone by the time you read this.  I do think it's good value, and that $150 was well spent.No motomaker for big V, yet--I'm not on AT&T;, so this was a disappointment.  But I think I'll live.Definite Don't Like:Seeming lack of cases--My phone is rolling nude, because I just can't find a case that I like.  This is something you definitely want to be aware of.Bottom line, I recommended this phone to my Mom.  I wouldn't call her cutting edge, technologically, but she's no Luddite either.  But I felt confident that she would enjoy this phone as much as I have.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smooth phone that feels good in your hand", "Author": "R. Justin Chan", "ReviewID": "R1WGYCF72XNZSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I am loving the Moto X. It's not perfect, but it's the right phone for me. I initially bought a Droid Maxx, but then exchanged it for the X. Don't get me wrong, the Maxx is a sharp phone, but it's big. And after a few days of using it, I realized it was just too big.I really debated between these two phones, but even though the specs on the Droid Maxx are better ultimately I decided on the Moto X for the size/form factor: It just feels better in my hand with its contoured back and mid-size dimensions despite the plenty big 4.7\" screen. By comparison, the Maxx felt bulky, just a big Kevlar slab of a phone. A few things about the Maxx did give me pause, however:1. Wireless charging -- A cool feature other reviewers have liked, though it wasn't a deal-breaker for me.2. The battery life -- The battery on the Maxx is impressive. This one I still regret a bit, though the Moto X has plenty of pep.3. Storage -- The Maxx has twice the storage at 32GB, but frankly I sync most of my media to the cloud now and keep backups on my laptop.Of course, I looked at the other top phones, but I really wanted Google/Motorola's latest suite of software features: Active Notifications, Touchless Controls, the quick-launch camera. Speaking of the camera, all the latest Motorola phones are lacking there, though I read big improvements have been rolled out in a software update for customers of every carrier except Verizon, so hopefully that will follow soon (hint, hint). The Galaxy S4 has a good camera and tons of features, but it felt flimsy and plasticky, and I don't like Touchwiz's cartoonish design. The HTC One is a beautiful phone and I loved the look of the metal exterior, but it was slick and I know within a week I'd drop it. Recent HTC phones have suffered hardware issues as well.So the Moto X was the one. I love the overall design and, like I said before, it feels great in the hand. The black weave pattern on the back is stylish, and the small dimple in the middle of the phone is a good tactile reference point when holding it. The clean OS runs butter smooth. The screen is sharp and colors vibrant. I prefer the on-screen rather than capacitative buttons, though I thought at first the opposite would be true. And I do like the fact that it's at least assembled if not built in the US. I'm not some rabid patriot, but I do feel you should support smart efforts to bring decent-paying manufacturing back to the country.A few last points after using the phone a couple weeks now: 1) Active Notifications are just plain smart, and I also like how the time displays on the lock screen when you pick up the phone or take it out of your pocket; 2) Yes, the call quality is a little hit and miss, clear on some calls and choppy on others; 3) Stock Android runs nice and smooth; 4) The camera isn't great but I haven't found it as terrible as some are saying. 5) The Touchless Controls are real handy, though not perfect at interpreting what you say.(My phone experience: Droid X, HTC Incredible, Razr M.)", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "AntNewYork", "ReviewID": "RZENBZ1S5WGSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally replaced my origonal Droid Phone (4Years Old) with this Moto X.

So smooth...so responsive.  Soooo much better than my Galaxy Nexus it replaced.  I highly recommend it if camera performance is not a very important feature for you.-- Details:Motorola and Google really did a great job creating a phone that people actually enjoy using despite the specs that no one wants to talk about.  On this phone, creative engineering and emphasis on user experience beats out hardware specs.  Other reviewers have already done a good job discussing the great features like Active Controls, Touchless Controls, twist to start the camera, best in-hand feel of any phone on the market, ideal size, sweet screen (despite 720p), full-day battery, etc. so no need for me to go there.  I will add, though, that the Motorola Spotlight Stories feature is a cute and fun surprise.  Another testament to user experience.  Google it.I'll also say that it's interesting how at least two popular on-line smartphone reviewers have said they use this as their personal phone.  Of all the phones they review!  Think about it.  This phone is a testament to smart engineering and thoughtful UI design over over-hyped hardware specs.  I will likely stick to Motorola from here on.--Cons:Other top smartphones on the market take much better pictures.  If you want the among the highest quality pictures you can get on a smartphone today, do not buy this.  I personally think the low light pictures suck.  But excellent picture quality isn't that important for me on a smartphone.  Good is good enough.--Bottom line:Buy this phone...now...don't wait.  It's a true \"smart\" phone that's a joy to use.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not The Latest Hardware - But...", "Author": "Palm Trees \"Palm Trees\"", "ReviewID": "R2TCLCIL4SV7YK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't believe how much I love this phone. I've been running a rooted Motorola Droid Bionic and remain partial to the quality of the Motorola brand so even though I could have upgraded a couple of years ago, nothing excited me enough to buy. When I finally read the reviews of the Moto X, being a veteran geek who is also a spec-freak, I was frankly, disappointed and didn't even put it on my consideration list. Well, a one day special allowed me to get a super deal on this phone and with my Bionic getting older by the minute, decided to take a chance. Boy was I surprised when I set it up and started using it.First I'll point out that I didn't know about the new sync software that allows you to transfer data from you old phone to your new one via bluetooth. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was as well as how fast, and it got everything from contacts, music, video, texts and key application data and took around 15 minutes to complete. No wires, no PC, no pulling of online backups, just plain old simple.Second, I can't believe how fast this phone performs! I don't run benchmarks and don't normally subscribe to test results since I'm not using the phone for gaming or other majorly high-end tasks. And due to reading some benchmark test results, didn't expect this to be any faster than my souped up Bionic was. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I've yet to say to myself that I wished the phone was faster. Yes, it's that fast in day to day use. As well, I've now learned that I'll never own another smartphone without an Active Display such as this one has. A number of reviewers complained about the lack of notification LED's for texts, emails and Facebook so I was expecting things to be compromised. No, no, no! The Active Display is a new feature I'll never live without. Pick up the phone, it lights the display with the time, an unlock function and a list of what your phone has received. It'll show if you have emails, texts, voice messages, missed calls, software updates and Facebook updates. So obviously simple and useful, I can't believe this is the first phone to have it. I don't miss my Bionic's LED notifications at all.Third, concerns about the 720p screen where almost everyone has 1080p are the buzz in most reviews of this phone. I can say this, I love the display, it's depth of color and all. Some complain it's too color-saturated, but to me, it's better than some that claim to have much better color accuracy. It's like using Velvia film in an old 35mm camera. Rich and saturated can be beautiful and for me, a preference. Another point on the screen, it is way more accurate and sensitive to touch than the Bionic or even my original Droid. That makes navigating the phone so much easier, I'll never go back.Fourth, the camera isn't rated among the best when compared against the current crop of phones out there. But, it is still better than what I had on the Bionic and better than my wife's Droid 4 and my daughter's iPhone 5, in my opinion. The coolest part about the camera isn't the camera itself, but the \"launch\" procedure that allows you to open the camera and start shooting in mere seconds. A couple of quick twists of the wrist, like you're twisting a key in a lock, and wallah, camera launches without any other action required. This, to me more than makes up for it being slightly behind the cream of the crop cell phone cameras out there. And I believe it really isn't far behind the best of the best.Fifth, my Bionic had the upgraded extended battery that I upgraded to since I'm rarely stopped anywhere long enough during my work day for a recharge. On my Bionic, I got probably 30 hours before I needed a recharge. So far on this phone, I've gone 17 hours and still had 13% charge left, and without doing any power management which most other phones would need to match that. I'm not disappointed with the lack of a changeable battery at all.Sixth, lack of an SD slot was a big negative for me since I've had a 64GB microSD in my Bionic which was loaded with data, files, music, movies among other things. I expected I'd miss that, and to a small extent, I almost do. But, it only took a minor adjustment on my part to get used to pushing and pulling things from the phone as needed and so far, I don't really miss the extra storage capacity. I won't go so far as to say that having access to data on the cloud is a direct replacement for on-board storage, but it does help.Seventh, I expected such a tiny phone to have limitations with regards to the internal \"radios\". I can say I've lost nothing with regards to voice, WiFi, Bluetooth or 4G connectivity. The Bionic was praised for its' radios as are the Droid 4 and other Motorola phones, and this one doesn't disappoint. I still get signals with decent to good connectivity where my iPhone and Samsung brethren still can't. This surprised even me as it seems amazing that they can create effective antennae in such a small package.Eighth, I thought the smaller screen, albeit the same size as I had on my Bionic, would make me want to await a model with a larger display such as the Samsung GS4. Instead, I found I miss nothing and for the first time since I've been using a smartphone, I no longer put it in a case to sling on my belt. I tried and liked putting the Moto X in either a back or front pocket and forgoing any type of case. It also shows off the sexiness of this phone!Lastly, this phone is the first effort by the now Google owned Motorola where they did their best to keep the phone as close to \"stock\" Android as possible. To me, I find this to be way above the original Bionic Android \"overlay\" known as MotoBlur. Which, by the way, is way less of a change from stock Android than what Samsung does on their phones. The far cleaner OS, I think, is what makes this phone so fast. No I/O exchange between the overlay and the OS to slow the phone down!  Motorola continues to be my phone of choice and I'm so happy I jumped on a deal on the Moto X! I thought I was compromising just to get a great deal, instead, I find that I got way more phone than I ever expected! I'll never go back now that I have a Moto X! I'm so glad Amazon had this on sale! If it weren't for them, I'd still be using my Bionic and awaiting the \"next best thing\" in phones without knowing it was already out there in the form of the Moto X.Even hard core users are now coming around and being far less critical of the hardware specifications now that they've had a chance to live with the phone for awhile. If you're considering a new smartphone, please give serious consideration to the Moto X, and if you get one, I'm pretty sure you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was.

I'm very impressed with this phone and I looked at quite a few - Samsung, Apple, HTC, etc. - and went with the Moto X for a few reasons, not the least of which is that this phone is a pretty good indication of what Google has done - and will do - now that they own Motorola. It's American-made, feels great in my hand, works well, places calls, lets me text, and it's my GPS for my business.

First, a little background. I've been on the Android bandwagon since the original Moto Droid, then moved onto the HTC thunderbolt and then the galaxy nexus. I really have grown very fond of stock android and the moto x runs very near to stock android with some very useful additions, including active notifications, touchless control, and a suite of useful moto apps (Assist, Moto care, Migrate).First I wanna talk about active notifications. When you pull the phone out of your pocket and look at the screen the time appears on the screen and any notifications you have received. This feature alone makes the moto x amazing, think of how many times a day you pull your phone our of your pocket to see if you have a message or to check the time, I know I do it a lot. So this was such a brilliant idea.Next touchless control, the phone will have you train it to your voice saying \"OK Google Now\" and the phone will wake up and wait for you to issue a command like set alarm for 5 am or send a text message. Its really useful especially if your busy doing something and you want to send a quick text or whatever.I really like the assist app as it detects when you're driving and will read texts to you and automatically respond to those whom textyou to let them know your driving. Plus it had settings for meetings and sleeping, it's a great feature. The Moto care app is nice cause it gives you tips based on how you use your phone to help you improve performance or battery life for example, I feel like it is a great feature that is helpful for those new to android.As far as the performance of the Moto x, it fly's, its very smooth and handles just about any game I throw at it in stride. The screen, 720p, yeah but it looks gorgeous, and really who needs 1080p on a phone screen. I've also been really impressed with the sound of the speaker, it has a real rich sound. Phone calls are nice and clear. I am amazed with how good the reception for 4G LTE and 3G is on this phone, on all my previous phones, I very rarely could get any reception at work, I have yet to have a day at work where I don't get great reception. And the battery life has been fantastic, with my usage which is a couple of hours on screen time and texts and some gaming the battery has been making it through about a 15 hour day with around 25 - 35% left, and that's leaving the data on all day, couldn't even dream of doing that with previous phones, as my battery would just drain.If I have one gripe its the camera. It's not horrible, it's just that it doesn't always take the greatest pictures. Outside it takes fantastic pictures, but inside, if not in very good lighting pictures tend turn out grainy. I have noticed that if the lens get dirty the pictures will consistently be out of focus, so do yourself a favor and wipe off the lens prior to taking pictures. I will say I am impressed at how well the camera can see in low lighting situations, but unfortunately the low light pictures tend to be less than satisfactory, but really its a camera on a phone, I don't expect to it take professional grade low light pictures.In conclusion, I think the Moto x is a real winner. With all the innovative features that Motorola built into the phone to me it makes the Moto X one of the greatest smart phones in years.

My phone history includes DROID Bionic, Samsung Galaxy S Note II, iPhone 4/5, and now the Motorola Moto X. The phone is well proportioned and has nice combination of responsiveness, battery life, and useful features. Here are my personal pros/cons:Pros: - Ergonomics: For me, this phone is the perfect size and is easy to hold for one handed operation or calling. - Battery life: After about 24 hours, my battery life is just under 50% with moderate use. I think I could easily go 2 days without a charge.- Touchless control or \"Ok, Google Now\": I really thought this would be gimmicky, but I ended up really liking it. It is very useful when you are driving and don't have to activate any button to make a phone call. There are many useful commands you can use with it as well. Recently, my 2 year old toddled off with my phone - being unable to find it, I yelled \"Ok Google Now. Find my Phone!\" - the phone started to making a ringing noise which lead me straight to it.- Notification system: Very handy. Just pick up the phone and the black/white screen will appear showing any notifications and options to go the message or unlock. Nice not having to push the power button every time I pick up the phone. - Wrist flick for camera: Another thing I thought would be gimmicky, but have ended up using a lot. Two flicks of the wrist and the camera opens - works every time. Has never opened inadvertently. - Responsiveness: Overall, very quick to open apps, browse web, etc. - Build quality: Very subjective, but the phone does seem to be very sturdy compared to cheap/flimsy Samsung Galaxy seriesCons: - No expandable memory (or removable battery): This isn't a huge drawback for me now that I am using Google+ Auto Backup and Google Music as I don't have to store as much on the phone itself.Conclusion:This is a great all-around phone and has a unique feature set (for now).

My last two smart phones were the HTC Droid Incredible and the Galaxy Nexus. Both of these phones had issues with memory, restarting, stuttering and lagging after just a few months. Plus, I was charging both of them at least 3 times a day. In my Moto X, I haven't noticed many stutters or restarts. I do have some, and that's just gonna happen with any phone, but it is minimal. Plus, I regularly get to the end of a full day of moderate-heavy phone use wihtout even getting the low battery warning.I also very much like Stock Android. Motorola has added a few features to this phone, but fortunately they didn't alter Stock Android.The hands free stuff is great, if a little finnicky. However, my favorite addition is Active Display. This desparately needs to be on all Android phones. As soon as you flip your phone over, take it out of your pocket, or get a text, it will display the time and if you have any notifications. You can then simply tap the screen to view the message, while only partially powering the screen on, saving battery. Not only does it give me the information as soon as I want/need it and saving battery life for messages I won't reply to immediately, it also saves how often I use the power button, theoretically making that less likely to bust like on some phones. Plus, you can fully customize which apps can display notifications on Active Display. It's nothing short of revolutionary.In the past, I was always the first person to compare phone specs, and on paper, this one had me worried. The processor just didn't seem to have the same \"oomph\" as the other big hitters out there. However, Motorola and Google have done a fantastic job optimizing the OS and device to get the most out of the processor, without sacrificing battery life. It can hold it's own with the graphics heavy games.A lot of people have been ragging on the cameras, but I've had no problems. Granted, I'm just a very casual photo taker. But when I do take photos, I always open the camera by twisting the phone twice, like a door handle. This takes you straight into the Moto X camera, and is very handy for when  you need that pic on the go.Like I said, this phone performs great with excellent battery life, near stock Android, and that perfect Active Display.

I don't feel I've given up anything significant in usability; the screen is beautifully crisp.The feature that sealed the deal for me was the option to choose a wood back. I ordered mine the day they became available. When I showed it to a friend and artist with an iPhone, she exclaimed at how much more attractive my Moto X is, and how its curved back is much more comfortable in the hand.Web browsing is slick, and streaming video runs seamlessly. I have been able to set up email, transfer contacts, etc., with little fuss.Audio quality on calls has been completely adequate.The voice activated system works like a champ--I just ask the phone to dial someone in my contact list, and it does it! I can also ask it to look things up. If there's an unambiguous answer, the Moto X will speak the result, e.g. \"The drive to NYC from your location is 213.1 miles.\" Otherwise, links to relevant sites appear in the browser. The whole experience is just a pleasure.I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the photos I've taken with my Moto X. I took a few interior photos at night that look clear, with accurate colors and with no noticeable graininess. I also took a tricky photo of a sunset. I used the feature to select the area on which to focus and set the exposure. The result was a perfectly respectable, atmospheric shot; not quite what I would get in RAW mode on my DSLR, but pretty darned close.Oh, the feature to open the camera with a couple of flicks of the wrist took a little getting used to--the flicks have to be in rapid succession, within a second or so. However, that's a well-appreciated trick.I have been getting about 36 hours of use from a single battery charge.So far (a couple of weeks), I haven't run into a significant downside to this phone.

Moved from an iPhone 5 to HTC One.  I was really happy with the HTC One and not looking for a new device.  Then I read a couple of reviews of the Moto X and figured I'd go check one out to see what was up.  Right off, you see the screen is big, but the device isn't.  By a lot.  I was stunned.  So, I figured I'd buy one (off-contract) during the deals Motorola was running for Black Friday just to see what I really thought.  Like I said, best phone I've ever had.PROS:Big screen - small profile.  Can't say enough about this.  This has to be close to what we'll be seeing the in the future from particularly Apple.  It's small and big at the same time.  Without getting into specifics, the Moto X screen specs out poorly from certain standpoints, but screens are up to individuals.  It's only slightly smaller than the HTC One's screen but much smaller and lighter in the hand.  Up close, I think the Moto X screen is flat out beautiful.  And I read on it a lot.Battery - first smart phone I've ever had that I can unplug from the wall in the morning and I don't have to think about the battery for the rest of the day.  Usually go to bed with between 20%-40% of the battery left.Notification system - you gotta see it to believe it - best I've ever come across.  The hands free is terrific - pull it out of my pocket and I don't need to hit any button to see: 1) the time; 2) any emails; 3) any texts; 4) ANY NOTIFICIATIONS!  Espn shows just an 'E' icon - it rocks!Speed - the speed of the device is as good as anything I've worked with.  Just don't notice any hiccups and it's proven to be amazingly stable.  Never have to reset.Sound - love the speaker on this thing and the sounds Motorola have put on the stock device are easily on par with Apple.  Okay, it's closer to Apple than anyone else has ever gotten (though HTC always did well in this area and Samsung, well, details are an afterthought with them).CONS:Camera - but not as bad as some say.  The HTC One and iPhone 5 were much better cameras, but I've gotten used to the Moto X camera and can say it's okay.  I'm the kind who likes to take a picture of a model number on the back of a device to Google it later or take pictures largely for the data I can get off the picture.  That does not work so well with this phone.  I've worked around it and it's okay.  Could be a big deal for some.  Personal pictures of family/friends/events are good enough.  But if the camera is a big deal to you, well, that might be a deal breaker for some.  Also, it is a plus to be able to twist the device to automatically go to the camera.  Was easy to get used to and I use it a lot.  Unique and strong feature.Bluetooth - the iPhone 5 never skipped a beat when I connected it to my car's Bluetooth for music.  This (and the HTC One for that matter) lag occasionally.  That stinks.  It definitely happens when I turn on the hotspot for the kids to use in the car.  The iPhone 5 NEVER ran into this problem.It's got a big screen but it feels small in the hand.  The performance of the phone is outstanding and the hands free notification is super cool.

It beats my GS3. I was concerned after the first 2 days but now that I've owned the phone for 3 weeks, the battery life is stellar. I never worry about going below 50% during the day, even with about 45 minutes of talk, frequent texting, and regular email checking. The only thing that hurts battery life is intense gaming (Injustice, Modern Combat, etc)3) Performance - I have yet to see any lag.

In fact I had the first smartphone, the NeoPoint, back in I think 1999. Anyway, this Moto X has made the most significant improvement in my daily life.* Battery life is terrific* Active Listening actually makes it easier, quicker and more convenient for me to use a mobile phone* Active Notifications is probably the most innovative mobile phone feature to appear in the last 3 years and makes it extremely easy to access, preview and discard notifications* Fit and feel in hand is off the charts. I hated the S3 feel in hand. I always felt like I was going to break it or drop, which of course I did :).* Motorola Connect is a time saver as well allowing me to text via the chrome browser* Access to the camera via the hand twist is ingenious. I used the camera quite a bit today and it is a joy to use. Unusually intuitive and easy and it takes great quality pics. Not off the charts quality but very good.* The screen is excellent. I know the specs aren't HD and all that but I tell you this screen is awesome... bright and white and clear. I can't stand AMOLED screens because they have this yellow or pink hue to them and I can hardly see anything on screen outside.  Well Motorola has solved these problems somehow. The whites are so white and bright that I don't have to use full brightness and I can see the screen outside no problem. It is a joy to look at this screen. I get the best of both worlds, the white and bright of a TFT and the beautiful colors and depth of color of AMOLED. Very impressed!* Fast. I know the chip set is not clocked as fast at N5 and LG and whatever but I tell you the new X8 mobile computing platform is lightning fast. I have even read specs where in real world performance tests the Moto X beats these top of the line phones in performance.* Near immediate Android updates. This is a big one for me as well. When Motorola shocked the world and updated the Moto X with Kit Kat, as fast as they did, I said I am in. The next week I had a Moto X in hand.* The phone is cool looking as well. I didn't think the moto maker was a big deal and maybe bordering on cheesy. That was until I actually started using it to spec out my phone. I actually got into it. I was surprised. It was fun and I have a phone that looks professional but at the same time has a unique character to it. I went with the olive back, black front and orange trim. The white front looked great as well but that was too girly for me :).Basically the Moto X takes the reasons that a person typically uses a smartphone and makes them easier, faster and all around more enjoyable to do those things. At the same time Motorola appears to be committed to the software update process and giving their users the most up to date software experience.

I was very disappointed with the performance of the Galaxy S4 (owned for 5 months) in terms of battery life, UI, design, etc and needed an upgrade. I decided to pick up the Moto X and it is easily the best phone I've owned. (My smart phone history: Palm Pre Plus > iPhone 4 > iPhone 5 > Galaxy S4). The best thing about the phone is that even though it doesn't have the best numbers (display PPI and resolution, battery life, processor, camera), it performs like a champ! I bought the Galaxy S4 because it had all the numbers, but the only thing that ever stood out to me was the PPI.Pros:- Near-Stock Android Interface (much faster browsing the menus compared to TouchWiz)- Rounded Back (Feels amazing in your hands)- 4.7inch screen (in my opinion, the best screen size. I have average/small fingers, so it's tough using a 5in+ phone with only one hand)- Touchless Control (three speakers so the phone can be in any position)- Display (it might not have a high PPI or resolution, but it looks amazing. Not on par with my old S4, but the differences obvious)- Moto X maker- The phone doesn't have the best speaker (not on par with HTC One), but you can adjust all of the audio settings to make it sound way above average- Active Display (easily the best feature)- Driving Mode (this works near flawlessly.. Whenever I step in the car the phone goes into driving mode and will read me any texts I get, and let me respond without even touching the screen! Only flaw is that if I'm playing music it doesn't lower/mute the music so I can hear the voice)- UI (It's not loaded with bloatware compared to a lot of Android phones)- Camera (This is in most cons lists, but I think it's a decent quality camera. It's not even close to the S4 in terms of picture quality, but the fact that you can twist the phone twice to open the camera quickly is awesome! One big advantage this phone has over other cameras is the autofocus works almost flawlessly and the UI is perfect. I have not taken enough selfies to judge the front facing camera)- Battery life pre 4.4.2 update. Before the KitKat update, the battery life on this phone was incredible. I could use the phone all day and end up with my battery life between 60-70%.Cons:-  Touchless Control if you have a password (makes the feature useless because for most features you have to pick up the phone to unlock it anyway. The phone only recognizes my voice anyway)- Battery Life post 4.4.2 update (before I could keep WiFi and Bluetooth on and not worry about charging it all day, now even with the features only enabled when I use them, I am below 50% after 3/4 of a day.

I got my Contacts and Music easily.Android:  There are some nice customizable features that Android has.  I'm too lazy to get into it, but you can do some cool thingsCons:Voice Mail:  iPhone has this nicely laid out, but I have to dial *86 here?  WTF did I go back in time?  Luckily the Google Voice app is as good if not better, but why do I have to download an app just for voicemail?  And Verizon charges for Visual VoiceMail?

I'm sure there's some setting to fix this, but I haven't found it yet.  Just another little thing that isn't a big deal, but wouldn't even be a problem with an iPhone.That's it really.

Buy the developer phone and it will have none of my cons.i'm not doing a long review, but if you want to konw, go to reddit and look at the subreddit moto x to get an update of what people feel about the phone and how it really is to own one.Only thing i can add if you are researching this phone, a lot of negative things come up about battery life. The battery life is awesome if you get the settings right. By that i mean there is this one thing called the art cache(Android Run Time) that can be enabled on this phone that allows me to get days off a charge it has also helped some friends of mine on the battery side too. on a light day i maybe loose 30% after 12 hrs. on a very heavy day i can drain it in under 5 hrs, but that's using it as a gaming device.Get this phone!!I know you may think, 'well it's not the fastest processor' or 'it doesn't have a 1080p screen' or 'you can't remove the battery'.Remember back in the day of the just ipod? no video, no internet, no nothing. if it crashed what did you do? open the case and remove the battery? i don't tihnk so, you held down the hardware reset keys. Just like here. It's nostalgic to me. the non 1080p screen. Really? you can see the difference? wow. i still use 1080p on a 50' tv and i think the quality is absolutely fantastic. i don't need that compressed down to the size of my hand. not having that also allows it's weaker gpu to perform better than the others.not the fastest processor? i beg you to show me anywhere i need it. just because it's lacking in that aspect doesn't make it not the most responsive phone on the market ever. i think it very well may be. i have used it stock for over 2 months now. still acts like the day i got it. i have thrown it down stairs, no case on. and there are no blemishes at all. The stock android is not bloated down with other tasks so you actually do see an improvement on speed in almost all cases over the competition. go this phone!If you haven't tried google now or active notifications, they have changed the landscape of how i use a phone. i will only buy phones now that incorporate those features. i hope to achieve that is why google sold motorola.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Moto X better then HTC & Nexus", "Author": "John Paul Taylor", "ReviewID": "RA2HXJ856EWUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is super powerful.

Would have liked an option for 64GB but I can manage with 32GB.First off, this device operates flawlessly. I don't experience lag anymore. Overall it is just very smooth to use. On my Droid RAZR MAXX, by comparison Google Now was often slow to load up, search results from there where a test of your patience and the Chrome browser was just a nightmare to use. On the Moto X these things run butter smooth and I could not be more happy.Battery life may not be as good as the Maxx but I find it more than adequate and frankly, I like the form factor of this phone very much, that the trade-off was well worth it. The phone fits very comfortably in my hand. I really like the curved back as it makes it feel so natural. Also the smaller size of the phone as compared to some of the other Android phones was something I wanted.Regarding the screen quality. On my RAZR MAXX you could see jagged edges on text. On this phone the graphics are very sharp and I can't see any jagged edges. Essentially I find the screen resolution to be as sharp as I really care for. Perhaps a higher resolution screen would look nicer, but frankly I have no complaint about this screen.I could go on in more detail but to phrase it simply I think this phone offers for almost everyone an ideal Android experience.

Second, the small form factor is really appealing, it fits very nicely in your hand and I can reach all parts of the display comfortably, also slides into and out of pockets well. Button placement on the Moto X is preferred over the HTC One (the top left power button on the One is very awkward to reach) and the matte finish of the backplate is preferred over the slick plastic backplate on the GS4. Finally, I feel that this phone is a great value (I paid $100 for it with 2 yr contract on verizon).

Now that I got the Moto X, I feel like I now enjoy owning and using my phone. Here are a few reasons why:- Great battery life. I can easily go 2 days without charging if I don't have GPS turned on. (Not sure how long it will last with GPS on, as I don't use it that much day-to-day; however, if you leave your GPS off, you can turn it on again and it starts very quickly, which is another thing I like about the phone.)- Intuitive features you actually use, such as:  - The alerts that let you preview your notifications. These are fast and extremely convenient.  - Google Now. This is available in most other Android devices, but it's awesome and very good at understanding what you say.  - Motorola Assist: Helps you manage your calls and notifications when you're driving, sleeping, and in meetings.  - Nice camera. 10 megapixels, a lot of interesting built-in filters and editing options. Not top of the line, but solid and good enough to capture things if you know what you're doing. (I don't, but that's another story.)  - A lot of other little things, like the ability to turn off your alarm with one touch when you wake up a minute before it goes off. :)- Good hardware design that is fairly large, but still light and feels good in your hand.My bottom line is that this phone isn't as fancy and doesn't have the megapixels that the Galaxy S3 does, but it has features that make everything easier, and it also provides you with options you didn't even know you wanted but you very much do.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Built for the user", "Author": "Dylan", "ReviewID": "RE64BVAKGV7PD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone has been great and awesome video reviews are on youtube about it.  the thing i like most about it is that it has features that are obviously derived from user habits. for example, a lot of us use our phones to check the times and have to \"unlock\" and \"lock\" and put back in pocket to do so (at least for most guys). this phone has a built in clock that only lights the needed pixels when you turn it over or pull it out of your pocket.Also, picture editing is made really easy with the multiple options for effects right after you take a picture without having to download another app. and of course sharing them is rather simple. these kinds of things will make instagram obsoletei could go on. it's a great 4G LTE smartphone that isn't huge.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "SKapelar", "ReviewID": "R3TJUICU09KP3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not too big, not too small.

I cannot keep this phone for this problem alone.  The box should expand as you type, as it did on my HTC Evo.Another problem with the texting is they keyboard.  There are no arrow keys, so if you want to add to or delete part of a text you have to touch on the screen in that exact spot.  I do not have large fingers, and not once have I gotten the curser where I want it in the first try.  You have to keep adjusting it, and most of the time end up deleting part of the text to get to the place you want.With the exception of the keys on the top row, there are no second character shared on the keyboard.

Motorola specifically used a lower resolution screen to preserve battery life but they failed. No matter how I tweaked the settings it remained the same. Even returning it to the store to have an \"expert\" from Motorola adjust it nothing changed. Based on all the great reviews i thought i got a lemon. They refused to exchange the phone for me without charging me a restocking fee and the manager said the battery performance was the same as his moto x. I returned it for a Galaxy s4 (only way i could avoid the fee) and couldnt be happier. Battery life is better with a much better screen to boot. All the features on moto x are on s4 and even more so on s4. Be wary of an android phone with a non removable battery, you wont be able to do a hard reset on this phone as android phones sometime require with a battery pull.
