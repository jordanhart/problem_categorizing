The first thing Cricket told me was the phone should come with an SD Card, and mine did not.  Without that SD Card, I was unable to do lots of things, like use the navigator, or download anymore apps, or take more than 15 pics and 3 videos. When I notified the seller, they were kind enough to send me an SD memory card at no charge.  Once I received the SD card, I was able to download a few games, however, the phone kept saying error, force close or wait.  So, I had to uninstall those apps, so no game playing for me.  A friend of mine has this same phone, and the same thing happened with her phone.  So, it's not just my phone, it's the brand itself.  By the way, my friend got her phone for free with Cricket 3 years ago, and her phone did come with an SD memory card.The other issue with this phone is the touchscreen is terrible on it.  The top of the screen does not work, especially when the phone is turned 'landscape' style (side ways).  Not one of the top or side buttons on the touchscreen works at all.  I have to turn the screen 'portrait' style for it to possibly work.  And this is when trying to text message or play a simple game that I had to uninstall because the touchscreen didn't work.  Also, most of the time there is a delay when typing anything on the touchscreen.  For example if you're typing a text message, and you touch the letter 'r', the 'r' shows up after about 5 seconds.  It's quite annoying.Another issue with the touchscreen, is when I'm in my 'apps' area, when I would touch slightly to select any app, it would not respond to that app, it would respond to a totally different app.  When in my contacts area, anytime I select a contact, there is a picture of a phone and a picture of an envelope.  Anytime I'd select the picture of an envelope to send a text message to that contact, it wouldn't select it, it would just dial the contact.  There is another way to go about sending a text message, but the 'message' button does not work.  This is obviously due to the fact, that the touchscreen is not good on it.A few more things, last but not least, is when I finally received my SD card, I was able to send a video clip via email and text message.  When that contact received that video, it was blurry and pix-elated. Another words, the phone video and pictures are terrible quality. The battery life on the phone is horrible.  Apps on or off, services running or not, it doesn't matter, the battery life lasts less than half a day.  The seller was kind enough to send me a new battery and charger, but it is still the same issue.Don't waste your money on this phone.  Now that I have to send it back, I have to pay for my own shipping and I have to wait to get credit to purchase a phone that works.  By the way, my phone cost me way less than $70 with this seller, and now the seller raised the price to $72, what's the deal with that?", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "i would like a samsung galaxy", "Author": "Brandon Daniel", "ReviewID": "R25M4DD7XX8HUE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I think its defective or something and I cant upload pics as fast as my other phone and it doesn't have google play store to get more games or widgets etc", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cricket Huawei Ascend M860", "Author": "Ramon", "ReviewID": "RNWG8WD3VVWJP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do not like the phone i want a re fund my charger was broke i cant use the phone or nothing", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "A.

I discovered that not only does it have scratches but it's missing the cover that goes over the charger and headphone jack ports AND the back battery cover doesn't stay on. It falls off with the slightest touch constantly. That should have been included as information. I then discover that I could not get into the phone. I was unable to get past the homescreen passcode lock. The previous owner did not unlock it before packing it up. I had to request it. By that time, a cellular salesperson had helped me perform a factory reset. The bonus was the mini SD card they left in it. That was nice.
