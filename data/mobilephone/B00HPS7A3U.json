Wang", "ReviewID": "R2RHMN8SXA54WK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The spec of this phone looks good among all of the budget phone, and that is the reason I purchased it last Saturday. Unfortunately, my phone arrived with a faulted proximity sensor that every time when I make a phone call, the screen will directly go black until the end of the call. After did some searches on the internet, I figured out my situation was not a single case. There are some discussions about the proximity sensor issue across nearly entire Huawei's products line, including the G330, G510 and other phones. So, if you are interested on this phone, be careful for their poor QC, and carefully check your phone when it arrive.In addition of the QC issue, Huawei tried to build their own UI instead of the standard Android interface. Again, unfortunately, their-own interface is not that user friendly, and does not give many plus to this phone...The only reason that I will give this phone two stars, instead of just one, is the camera on the back. Its hard to find a phone with this price range come with the LED flash. Although the camera is only 5M pixels, the additional flash really helps to increase the usage of this phone, makes it easy to use indoor.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont waste your money  its a garbage", "Author": "Bayadi", "ReviewID": "R3TB6GEE15WUID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shipping was extremely slow. got the package, No user manual.The phone had a Chineese version of android (restricted). no google apps or media store or youtube and no way you can change that.internet is hardly working, and the phone dont seems a dual core 1.2 and the worst surprise the phone is only 2g on gsm networks (att,  tmobile)I dont recommend this phone. its a garbage,", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Went dead after 1 month!", "Author": "serena v nguyen", "ReviewID": "RUBF58RQF6OYZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It completely  went dead for no reason and no matter how I try to reset the phone, I can only see blue screen.

I was fine without the flash, though it would have been nice if there was flash. The phone is really cheap for about $120 and a decent sized screen. Of course, as an Android, the phone has a really bad battery. If I just leave my phone uncharged overnight and check it the next morning, about 10% will be gone--doing nothing! The phone is quite laggy due to Huawei's system on top of Android and the browser's search will always stay Chinese.
