That's when I was suspicious that this phone clearly was not a great one. But a new battery is inexpensive to purchase, and my daughter liked this phone. Then, she went to the Text Templates on her cell phone. Tell me, does any AT&T; cell phone have \"Hell no\" and \"Hell yes\" as a text template? NO. This phone was clearly used before.
