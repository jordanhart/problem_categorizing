This phone runs off the Verizon network instead of AT&T; but so glad Straight Talk offers it! I have no problems with my IPhone5 or service and overall there are so many things it can do. Well worth the money Apple makes quality products backed by a warranty. I was fortunate enough to find it in like new condition I would not pay the new condition asking price it is way too high.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "An outstanding Value with very minor concessions", "Author": "J. Crow", "ReviewID": "R2Y17CHPX6X19D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Straight Talk iPhone 5 represents one of the best values in pre-pay mobile phones. Here's what you get: an iPhone 5 that runs on the Verizon Network for 45 dollars a month. The phone has great resale value. Here's what you don't get: LTE Speed, a slightly different looking version of Visual Voicemail. Everything else is the same. The Verizon 3G speeds with the fast processor don't disappoint. I clock 2mbps consistently. This is a great alternative to paying 85-100+ a month with a major carrier. Call Quality and Usage is nearly identical to VZW.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lightning fast shipping from this seller! iPhone is awesome!", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "RN6BJ5X6HUKQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My opinion, this is the best way to buy an iphone......straighttalk uses Verizon network and is reliable!All for $45 a month unlimited!!!", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Straight talk yes, iphone nah", "Author": "Laura Davis", "ReviewID": "R3T6T4WTFMZO24", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The straight talk service was great but the phone was subpar.  Even with the newest update the iphone feels like a device from 2008.  The hardware is just average for a new phone. The screen is not the best compared to what is out there for less than what I paid for this phone. The screen size is tiny and hard to read at times. I don't understand why apple cant produce a larger screen, this phone was supposed to be a bigger screen than its counter parts however, its just a hint bigger, that's it. Very disappointing. I ended up selling this straight talk phone and getting the Samsung s3 at walmart which uses the sprint towers which is fine for me. I hope that one day apple wakes up and produces something truly new and advanced but for now its blah.If your bound and determined to get an iphone pay less and get the iphone 4 or 4s. The screen size difference for the 5 is a joke and any other differences minute.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I phone 5", "Author": "Duwanna Rogers", "ReviewID": "R13NEH2XS2PSA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great.

It showed up at my house with dents and scratches all over the sides. Then, I go to activate the sim card and the phone doesn't even read it. I explain to this seller that it is not working and i want a refund for the product and they gave me one million alternatives. I emailed them yesterday and they have yet to respond. I wouldn't recommend purchasing a phone from this seller.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent but no hotspot", "Author": "Pez Dispenser", "ReviewID": "R2IE9FMGOC32B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is good. The screen is longer than the iphone 4 and it seems to be pretty dang great. 16GB is more than the average user needs. I do wish that you could use this phone as a hotspot but unfortunately you can not. Other IPHONE 5's can indeed use the phone as a hotspot for other devices. This is good if you are abroad and need to shoot a quick email from your laptop. I understand the reasons behind straight talk stopping this service but it is still annoying", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Left un Happy", "Author": "Tester", "ReviewID": "R17VWLYI4FIIXA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had the phone less than two weeks, the phone actually starts giving problems such as screen twitching.
