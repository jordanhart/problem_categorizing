The only reason why i got it is because I got it with the plan. But i highly recommend the international, unbranded version", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R22ECMY73YPPQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a freedom that comes with this phone, the freedom from worrying about water damage.  I've jumped in a lake with the phone in my pocket, drop it in a hot tub, and rinsed it off when it got oil on it, with soap!  All the while the phone is fast, easy to use, and very integrated with Sony.  I'm very happy with this phone even though I would prefer the Z1 for the headphone jack (when I run I do have to worry about water on the Z since the cover has to be opened where the Z1 has a way to seal around the jack).  Oh and if someone thinks it gets too hot (most phones tend to) I just dunk it in my glass of ice water  :)", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$600.00", "Features": "water resistant cell phone\nHD Display\n13 megapixel camera", "Name": "Xperia Z 4G LTE for T-Mobile C6606BK", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BbqAdHjeL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ECGKS2S"}}
