{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HTC One Wow!", "Author": "Sage Collum", "ReviewID": "R1NA7388NM3XKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the HTC One m8 less than a week and am still figuring out how to do navigate it, so I haven't tried all the features yet.  (It's my first smart phone.)  I was afraid it would be too big to fit in my pockets, but even with a case it fits, barely. It is quite smooth and I thought it might slip out without a case,  If your pockets are small, you'll need to find another way to keep it with you.  It does fit comfortably in my hand, and my hands are probably average for a woman, but I probably won't be using it one-handed very much.Love the blue color.  I hated so much to cover it up that I've ordered a clear case.  The screen is bright and clear.  I find that I can read text and recognize icons more readily, since definition is better than on my old phone's screen. The HTC's sound is sharp and clear. My hearing is less than perfect and there are a couple of people I always had trouble understanding with my very old cell phone, or even in person.  I've talked to both of those people this week and had no problem. There is a setting that boosts incoming volume for hearing aid users.  I will probably disable that because volume is now so loud I have to hold the phone away from my ear.I had been using my Kindle to keep shopping lists, especially for items I purchase frequently, which meant I carried it everywhere; an index card box to store contacts; and a paper calendar for appointments etc.  Now I'll be able to carry all that in one small device: my new, beautiful HTC One. And as much as I love my Kindle eReader, I look forward to being able to pick up my reading away from home without toting it everywhere.  I've already checked and the HTC provides a very satisfactory reading experience with Amazon's Kindle for Android app.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Heather Whitaker", "ReviewID": "R2UN98K1MRP5FP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this phone!
