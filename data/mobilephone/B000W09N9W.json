ONeil \"TheBucket\"", "ReviewID": "R2VKJL2EXB7CSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review won't be the highly technical sort that you might read on Amazon and other sites.  This will be pretty simple and straight forward.This is a nice phone.  It does anything and everything you could imagine a cell phone could do...and then some.  As an avid user of a Treo (Palm) for years, I was ready for a new handset, and my new job required a Windows Mobile platform.  After quite a bit of study, I made the switch to the HTC TyTN II...with no regrets thus far.The description will give more detail than I could ever give, so suffice it let me highlight a few things:1> Is a great PHONE. So many of these PDA phones forget what they are first and foremost. While I really liked the form and function of the Palm OS on my Treo, it left a lot to be desired in it's ability to catch and hold a signal. This TyTN II does that really well.  Perhaps it's a bit of a carrier issue too, but I've had very few dropped calls in the 2 weeks I've had it.2> The internal GPS works really well.  If you're all about reducing the number of \"things\" that you carry with you, you've now got a very capable GPS strapped to your belt.  Is it as feature rich as a stand-alone GPS? Probably not, but I downloaded the TomTom 6 maps of the US and Canada and it works great.3> It has a cool feature that lets you take a photo of a business card, and then export that to your contact list with fields populated.  Kinda cool and works pretty well.I recommend this phone highly. It's a few bucks, but if you rely on your phone as a business tool like I do, it's worth the money.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great phone.", "Author": "John Puhoff \"SOFTICE\"", "ReviewID": "R3ITP9IA4ZISNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone/pda.I recommended previos version of that phone HTC Wizard to couple my friends and now they threw away their pdas and only use this type phones. The only couple negative things (minor ones) about this phone are1) When using GPS batter dies very fast. I'm talking the entire batter will be dead within couple hours of using gps so if you want to use GPS on that phone you better buy car charger.2) Speaker is not as loud as on previos versions of that phone. For example HTC Wizard had 2 speakers this one has only one and it's very small. I wish HTC made the speaker on it a little bit more powerful. It's really hard to hear if somebody is calling so I have to use both vibrate and sound just in case.Other then that the phone is great.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best phone I have had so far!", "Author": "Sahra Badou \"Bibliophile\"", "ReviewID": "R1K2N54XRH8MLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really a great phone and one that is very easy to use if you are used to the Microsoft Windows Operating System.The nice thing about this phone is that the screen can be operated either by touch (your finger on the screen), by the included stylus (pen you use to directly touch the screen), and with both a virtual and a real keyboard. The keyboard is under the screen and it slides open form underneath it. The keyboard is quite big and very easy to type on. My keyboard was the QWERTY type. The virtual keyboard is also easy to use with either finger or stylus tapping, with the latter much easier. As comparison, the virtual keyboard on the Apple iPhone is much better and easier to use.The color screen is large and very clear. I love the opening screen (or welcome screen) where you are greeted with the time and date, your email and SMS/MMS inbox, and the number of missed calls. On the lower screen you have your Windows Live and Windows Messenger command screen. At a glance you can see whether you are online or offline, and your online friends. Below that are your appointments. So at a glance, through only the initial screen, you have all the information you need.From the initial screen you also have direct access by either finger or stylus tapping to your speed dial (favorite numbers), the weather, the launcher (where you have different settings for your phone, like tilting the screen or changing its brightness), and ringer or vibration options.Setting up my email and SMS/MMS was really easy, with most of the steps automatically done. Syncing with your windows computer is also a snap.This is really a very user-friendly phone. Among some useful features are GPS, Bluetooth, and two cameras. The GPS is really easy to set up. I have Destinator 7 on my phone, and it works great! I used the GPS in my car and in between high buildings, and I was always able to receive a signal, giving me continuous GPS coverage. The GPS antenna on this phone is really powerful!The two cameras are used for video conferencing. The image is sharp, and it is very easy to switch between video call and a normal call. You can even put the caller on hold, or switch off the camera from your side.I did have some problems with the speakerphone, but I may have resolved this problem with software update.Overall this is a great phone, and I love it! I wouldn't switch to any other phone in the near future.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "This thing... is awesome. :)", "Author": "Ronn Michael Cantu", "ReviewID": "RMHHAYJWRAXM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first, as stated by the guy who gave 3 stars, this phone arrived from Amazon configured for southeast Asia and not preconfigured to work with any North American carriers.However, after a long and tedious trudge through AT&T;'s online forums, I was able to find the instructions on how to manually enter the information to get this PDA online.Since then, it's been one amazing discovery after another. I haven't used the phone yet, though just poking around, there is a lot of different options if that's your thang, but to me, the bread and butter is in taking advantage of third party programs developed for the Windows Mobile OS.For example, I was incredibly impressed with the way google maps mobile is able to locate restaurants, hotels, post offices, the dmv, and even more obscure things like an Army Surplus store I was looking for. I even had the option to get driving directions using my current GPS location as the starting point. Google maps accurately gave me directions from the shoppette parking lot on Fort Hood to a store in Killeen.A friend of mine bought an AT&T; Tilt and comparing the two, the TyTN II is noticeably heavier, but she said the difference in speed between the two is stark. She would try to start a program and had to wait whereas my TyTN was quick.A word of note, the only included IM program on this phone is MSN Messenger, but there are third-party products available.I really have no structure to this review. Other than the difficulty in getting the phone connected in the beginning, this phone has done nothing but impress me over and over again. I just felt I had to say something.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "tytnii has some major issues for such high end device", "Author": "D. sharp \"d s\"", "ReviewID": "RUM09UJM0972J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the tytnii a couple months ago and found the phone suffers from some major defects including poor speaker phone,bt implementation, as well as lack of proper video drivers.  I am unsure if the speakerphone issue is related to software or hardware design; but the problem remains unresolved.  Even the cheapest cell phone i have used in past, still had a decent speaker phone.With regard to the video problem, HTC has so far indicated that it will not release video drivers that allow for the full use of the cpu. If you are thinking about buying this phone do your research before making any decision otherwise you will be disapointed as the phone is so far plagued with problems; some of which htc will not be fixing.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Phone and PDA of 2007", "Author": "Roberto Kiersz \"Danny Boy\"", "ReviewID": "RQ25V1YG5148H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the kaiser since November 2007.  It has almost everything one could desire from a smartphone:  The speaker sounds great, even being so small and  against a surface.  The cameras work fine. The GPS is awsome, can detect the satellites in seconds.  With the Garmin Mobile XT, it is unbelievable great.  The buttons are well distributed, you have a scroll wheel, very useful.  Even though the lack of the drivers to better performance, I use Core player TCPM, and can see movies perfectly, without any delay.  I use the kaiser for work and joy, and it is amazing.

The keyboard is so comfortable that I stopped taking the laptop to many of my meetings, I can manage with the HTC.

Brown", "ReviewID": "R1C075HT5EXR2M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone that's packed with features. I bought mine unlocked and I've been using it for about a month now with T-Mobile as my carrier. I simply moved the SIM from my old phone to the HTC and it worked beautifully. I particularly like that the phone has an internal GPS receiver which is very handy since with it you don't have to carry a GPS unit with you when you travel, you can just use the phone. The phone has excellent voice quality and works really well in fringe areas where other phones (like my Motorola) don't work well. The built in keyboard works nicely, even for someone like me who has pretty large hands. One negative is that the phone's video display is a little slow, so I wouldn't buy it if you want to watch videos, but overall it's an excellent phone!", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "HTC TYTNII", "Author": "Lara", "ReviewID": "R1D79JROIVOUF1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this PDA based on rave reviews from other users but I've been sadly disappointed by its performance so far. To start with, the phone came with a sound defect so I couldn't set the ringer or use any of the sound functions. Then it constantly 'hangs' while using the email and Office functions making it quite frustrating to use. Its screen display is also not very inviting to use.

Beta\"", "ReviewID": "RP9F1E5UD4431", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update (oct. 2011): Well, I have been working with this cell phone for 3 years !!!!. YES!  HTC: Congratulations.  This cell phone has passed the proof of time under really really tough conditions.  I have traveled around the country, it has been in airplanes, boats, cars, motorcycles ... I have dropped it at least 20 times; YES, it also has passed through splash (water, black coffe) tests ...... HTC ... Congratulations !!!  BUT ...  cell phones have become smaller, lighter, more interactive, and now I am Mac user and I am migrating to Apple, Yes Mr Steve Jobs (RIP) you were a genious.So, if you are thinking buying an HTC don't doubt it, this are guarantee of passing the toughtest tests.I Bought it in june 28th, so I have test it 4 months. I live outside U.S. (Colombia). This is now my #1 cel phone, but I also carry another one (Nokia 2630) as second cel phone.Great things:1. Signal: Superb, I have had many cel phones before, including Nokia which I thing it has a great signal, but HTC TYTN II has much better signal. This one sustains signal in elevators while my nokia can't.2. Works great as PDA, so I don't miss anymore my Palm Tungsten E2. Change from Palm OS to Windows Mobile was a little traumatic but it didn't take me long. It has been a little work to recover all my information but not impossible.3. Screen: Touch screen works really well. Tilting (40 degrees) screen is nice and comfortable to work with when you are writting over the table.4. Sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main reason to buy it for us who don't like front keyboards, this makes the phone a little bulky but is great.5. Plenty of buttons: Has plenty of buttons that make it easy to operate.  The 360 degree 3 way jog wheel paired with oK button (left side) is fantastic, great option to operate the phone while you are driving.6. Setting e-mail/sms accounts was really easy and fast.7. Bluetooth pairing with mobile headset Plantronics VOYAGER520 PLANTRONICS VOYAGER 520 BLUETOOTH HEADSET is absolutely great.Good things:1. Processor: 400 Mhz, works oK, it is not super-fast but certainly it is not slow.  Phone turns on fast (less than 1 minute to operate).2. Platform: Windows mobile 6 is good. Until date I have had to re-start the phone 3 or 4 times due to system fail (unable to detect end call), besides this it has worked well.3. Camera 3 mega-pixels:  Has good definition, works precisely.4. HTC Home screen is nice, very interactive. Weather update is unaccurate for me (I live in Bogot\u00e1 but weather seems like Cartagena), but that is resource problem [...]Not so Good:1. Camera: Does not has flash, so don't expect to get good insides pictures.2. Battery: Weak point, don't expect your battery to last more than 24 hours, and much less if you use it heavily. Requires car charger, charge through USB.3. Speaker: It is not so loud.4. Stylus: a little bit small in comparison with stylus of palm tungsten, but it is oK. (Recommendation: I have over my table my old stylus, so I use it frequently instead).5. I bought a SanDisc 8GB memory and it works oK (phone comes with 1 GB)I have not problems with delivery, in the box I found:1. User manual in english. You can also find manuals in many languages at the HTC web page, which I think is really good.2. AC adapter: ok.3. USB Sync Cable: Very important!!!!, because not only synchronizes data BUT also let you charge the battery during day.4. Pouch: Fits perfect, it is nice. It is not leather material. It only has a slip-over belt clip on the rear, so if you are planning to secure your device (metro, bus, etc) I would advice you to buy a leather case with belt loop slot (I bought: Horizontal Leather Case with Belt Clip/Loop for the HTC TyTN II.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Agasean", "Author": "S.

According to what I can find on the web, it has memory management issues.  It does just lock-up periodically where you have to maintain it like most Windows devices (reboot).  Sometimes this has required removing the battery.Also, the phone does not come with a complete set of software.  You get to roam the web to find other software (some free, some not) to make the phone truly capable.  Language support for Windows Mobile leaves a bit to be desired.

HTC has mentioned that while they advertised the hardware as part of their selling point, it is up to the consumer to discover whether or not the stated hardware will actually be used.
