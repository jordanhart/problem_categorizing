Then it started malfunctioning, the screen  would not turn on after it turned off either manually or due to inactivity.  The phone was still responding to the dedicated camera button and the Walkman would respond to the Walkman control button on the headphones but the screen was not coming back on. So the phone was on,  it was just the screen. So it needed to be rebooted this worked for a few days then  Most of the times the reboot would only work while the phone wad plugged in.  The problem became more common, at times 2-4 times a day, huge problem because you don't have access to your phone in an emergency!I did some research and found this is a common problem with several Sony xperias, I got this phone in June 2013, it came updated to the latest software version and this problem is still present!:@ Sony's solutio. Is to send it in to a repair center and wait a few weeks for a possible solution- no thank you!I found what worked for me:I installed an antivirus, and it indicated the factory installed app EA was misbehaving, I stopped and disabled this app and turned off the phone crossed and my fingers and turned it back on!  Phone works, screen works, all is well!  It's been a week now and I've had no problems!  After two weeks of this phone randomly turning itself into an expensive paperweight, the screen now comes on everytime it's supposed to like every phone should.I still gave this phone 4 stars because it is an awesome phone but that factory installed app takes one star away for misbehavior!To fix:Settings> APPS > swipe twice to  \"ALL\" list, locate EA app, touch STOP then DISSABLE.This phone is still worth it,  I would still buy it and just DISSABLE that app right away!I hope this helps someone!", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "William Rine", "ReviewID": "R2VQFBJYTWHO03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything I want a phone to do. has wide array of frequencies for use on most any net work except CDMA.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Jhon Ewards Clociel Mata", "ReviewID": "R18A2V715TGTJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent, fully corresponds to the Description Phone, Interface very Quick, Easy Handling, Comodo, right size, the quality of the screen is very good", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderful unlocked phone", "Author": "pemphix", "ReviewID": "RR8HY28HT5W0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old phone was dead. This phone has truly been a godsend. It did come unlocked so I dont have all the carriers advertisement apps. It still works very well with my carrier and is a truly fast phone with beautiful graphics. The only complaints  I have are the battery which is pretty average for a smartphone and the speaker when playing songs. It is a great  phone in every other way.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Xperia T LT30a... solid smartphone", "Author": "fj1965", "ReviewID": "R1R7OXPGXVBWHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wasn't sure how the phone would perform, but so far I'm really pleased. I like how sturdy the phone feels, not cheap and plasticy. Video looks very crisp and sound is nice. Same goes for calls. The T is pretty much the same as the Z except the Z is waterproof and has a quad core processor. I'm not sorry that I went for the T, instead!", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, condition up for debate.", "Author": "Lewis Carriers, INC", "ReviewID": "R114A3GBEGE8IQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is great, the seller got it here in two days. The only real problem is the condition. It was described as very good. The screen was unscratched and the hardware is perfect, but the case is pretty beat up. You cant tell with a protective case, but in my opinion it is good condition. That being said, I would definitely buy from this vendor again.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.55\" touchscreen - scratch-resistant LCD - 16 million colours, 1280 x 720 pixels\nGoogle Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)\n1.5 GHz Qualcomm Krait MSM8260-A Dual Core processor\n13 megapixel camera with auto focus and 16x digital zoom, pulsed LED flash\nTalk time (up to): 7 hours: Standby time (up to): 450 hours", "Name": "Sony Xperia T LTE LT30A Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-UvSM21wL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BNR5950"}}
