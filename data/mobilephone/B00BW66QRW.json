Then I always get some random \"SAFE MODE\" crash thing at least once per week.I upgrade to the BlackBerry Z10 on launch day, and I am glad I did.  The browser is quick, displays on a nice size and silky smooth screen.  You just keep typing and flicking the words when texting and emailing really speeding up your time.  You at least have to demo the keyboard to understand how truly amazing it is.I love the HUB, and the ability to not be disturbed by a text or email while I am in an app, playing a game for instance.  I can just slightly slide my finger up from the bottom and see which applications (text, BBM, facebook, twitter, email etc) has an alert and if I want to go ahead and see what the email is or reply to a text I slide over and my app doesn't have to shut down, (just minimizes) it continues to stay live, and I can switch right back and continue with no lag or waiting for it to start back up.The hardware is quick, the all new platform is optimized and doesn't require huge specs to run, however BlackBerry opted to put a dual core processor AND 2 GB of ram in it... more than plenty when the OS runs so smooth.  The phone feels extremely light.  However, it's built nicely.  The back has a very nice texture to it, like silk.  (It's a rubber type coating)You can add up to a 64GB MicroSD card (it states 32, but if format the card in the phone a 64 is fine), so add that to the 16GB built in the phone, you can get a lot of pics and music stored.  I love the fact they use a sd card and we don't have to pay increments of $100 more for each doubling of storage like my previous iPhones.The music player synced directly from my iTunes and it works just as good, if not better.  The sound quality is very nice, slightly louder than my previous iPhones.  It shows artwork and you can create playlists, etc.  Although Slacker radio came preinstalled and I find myself listening to that because when you minimize that app, like the music player AND YouTube, you can still hear it and adjust the settings while doing something else.Pics can be arranged in Albums, etc and you can see them in different sorts, like date taken and stuff.  Only thing I seem to miss, I don't see the ability to show \"GPS\" locations like the apple iPhone as to where a pic was taken.. yet.You can plug the phone in the PC and use it as a mass storage device, no more fooling with iTunes, however BlackBerry does have it's own mini version called \"Link\" and for a first version it's not too bad, I didn't have any issues syncing all my old pics to it, I could even arrange them in folders outside of the phone prior to.Apps for a first gen phone are starting to pop up daily, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedn, Foursquare, and all the popular social networks alike are baked in (Most even in the HUB).  Newer apps like eBay, Kindle, Angry Birds Star Wars, New York Times, and WhatsApp are here and Skype, CNN, and many many more have announced apps soon.  The OS has only been out in the market for 2 months, and it's already showing decent developer support compared to the launches of new OSes from Google or Apple.  However you can port your own Android apps if you like and they can run off BlackBerry's OS.I only have two current issues.  And this is mainly a Verizon's Issue.1. The latest OS that gives you battery tweaks and the ability to have newer apps (like WhatsApp) hasn't been released by Verizon yet.  It also causes some of my Android apps I have installed not to be able to use Verizon's cell data connection but I can use them on WiFi.2.  Since the new OS isn't available, all the battery fixes BlackBerry released after the first week of the official launch in February aren't available and I feel as if I could get a little more battery life left at the end of a work day when Verizon pushes the update.I am very excited to see what the future brings into this new OS.  It's off to a great start, as long as Verizon pushes the updates timely.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly a \"game-changer\"", "Author": "Daniel J.

I switched back to Blackberry specifically because of the Hub.  My phone is used 95% for communications and this is the most brutally efficient communication device in history.Pros are many, but my favorites are...#1) The gesture user interfaceUse it for a few days and then try to use any other device and you will understand what 'phantom swiping' means.  So smooth, so efficient, moving between apps and functions with no home buttons, no looking for back arrows.#2) The HubAll communications in one place. This isn't Android's notification center or the old 'unified inbox.'  You can read and respond to all your email accounts, your texts, BBM, WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more....all from one place....all WITHOUT OPENING ANY OTHER APPS.  Amazing.  Saves me seconds per communication, 100s of times per day.#3) The browserI don't know what to say. It's blazing fast and the best on any device.  Google it.#4) The keyboardBest on any device.  And, yes, I tried EVERY KEYBOARD on Android (Swiftkey was the best...and Blackberry built theirs on Swiftkey engine.)  Learns the words you use most and starts to predict those. Up to three language prediction AT THE SAME TIME.  Tracks your mistakes and subtly adjusts the virtual location of the key so that all of a sudden, your fat fingers are much more accurate.  Wow.Cons.#1) Apps.  Most are there, many are coming. A lot of developers took a 'wait and see' approach, some even came out and said 'no.'  Well, things change.  It's selling so well (with many more BB10 devices to come this year) that they are all jumping on board.  I do use the browser for web access to a few things that have no dedicated apps yet.You will notice I didn't say 'battery life'?  It's solid and comparable to other smart phones.  I get 10 hours of heavy use and make it home with 30%.I also didn't say 'immature operating system'?  It's the best out-of-the-box operating system I've ever witnessed on any device (phone, computer, etc) in history.  It's STUNNING in it's stability.

The underlying Z10 OS has about 100,000 lines of code versus 3,000,000+ in Androids to get similar things done.

My gf has an iPhone 5, but after reading reviews on Amazon I had to play with a z10 in person before making a decision.  Man, I am glad I chose the z10!  It has a larger screen than the iPhone 5 but isn't ginormous like the Galaxy S4.  It fits nicely in your palm and is very light.  Aesthetically, the phone is very sleek and definitely has the cool factor going for it.  One of my favorite features is that the phone has a sort of built in case with a hard plastic back and strong screen.BB10 OS makes iOS seem pretty dated.  The Blackberry Hub is an awesome feature and a very easy way to consolidate all your emails, texts and social media updates.  The swiping gestures are very intuitive.  The browser is extremely fast.  The keyboard is perfectly sized and even remembers where you hit each key so that you make fewer mistakes.  All in all, I'm very happy with my choice and would highly recommend this phone.

I was a Blackberry user several years ago and then switched to Android and frankly BB didn't come close in terms of functionality, performance or customization. But this new BB Z10 is much better. Why? Because it's finally like the Smartphones that have been kicking its butt.The Good+This BB has the same ease of use in setting up accounts that you would expect. I set up Yahoo!, Gmail, and enterprise with just a few clicks. I also set up Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox (all built in). All these messaging systems, along with BB Messenger, are in the BB Hub, which is found on any screen by swiping right on your screen. You get all the notifications from all your messages in a unified inbox. If you want to view specific services swipe right again and you can edit your hub or simply click on any of the services to view only those messages.+The camera is outstanding! The time capture is something that Google will be ripping off, er, emulating ASAP. You take a picture and it actually takes 10 in a row. You can then move the slider back and forth to find the best pic (you know for blurriness, closed eyes, etc) and - this is amazing - you can find the best pic of each of the faces from DIFFERENT captures, select the best, and then merge them together. So if me and my wife are taking pictures of ourselves (for Facebook of course) and I'm blinking on capture 1-9, but am perfect on capture 10, then click my face on capture 10, and pic the best of my wife from any of the others and then merge and you have a perfect picture. I can't say enough about how awesome that is!+Functions like you expect with all swipe and touch controls.+Dedicated BB screen for apps that are currently being used. And all other screens to the right are you installed apps. No app drawer, which is nice. You can easily create folders on your home screens by simply dragging and dropping. Apple users will love that you can create folders from EVERY icon, unlike that magazine rack icon that can't be messed with on iOS. Apple users will also feel right at home with the constant home screens lined up in rows.+The keyboard's predictive text is amazing. It learns what you type and will start to select likely words for you and allow you to choose them by simply sliding your finger from below to above the word. Or you can ignore it and continue to type.+Processor and RAM is right on target. 4G LTE with Verizon makes this one run as fast as it can.The Bad-I don't like the lack of back screen. I never got used to having to swipe off the app I was in (ala Palm Pre, swiping up). I wanted to simply go back one screen.-I missed swipe keyboard. I like the predictive text and for button pushers that's great but for those of us who swipe it was a slower way of writing.-There are 100-150k apps as of launch, but that is still way below Android and iOS. The good news is that BB created a conversion program to convert Android to BB apps and is actively pursuing the top apps. In fact, they have more at launch than Windows or Android did. Good start, but it will be a while before I get all the ones I want and use daily.Overall, this is a great phone. I recommend it to Apple users who like the walled garden and look of their home screens and also to enterprise users looking to continue with BB. Casual users of Windows or Android may also like this. But for those of us who are heavily invested in Android, hacking, have a ton of apps, etc it may not work for us. A worthy competitor.

The Z10 has a brand new operating system and it is sleek and modern.The main strength of blackberry has always been its unified inbox. Called the \"Hub\", this inbox has all your texts, emails, and other notifications. 3rd party apps can also give you notifications in there, so I get whatsapp messages, new york times breaking news, and weather advisories in there. Combine that with the iconic red LED from blackberry, and this ensures that I never miss a notification.The phone has very good specs for a 2013 device. It has a dual core Snaspdragon S4 with 2GB of ram. The OS is buttery smooth and I have not experienced any slowdowns at all.

This is phone is for someone that always has an app and three web tabs open, and need to go between the three constanly.  The hub is great and customizable for your messaging needs. I only have text, phone calls, and Gmail on my hub (dont use BBM).. Peek and flow really does allow for you to check other things or notifications on the phone without closing anything out.  The second best thing about the phone is the physical feel of the phone. I feel like I have an actual smart phone in my hand, not a plastic toy.

Yes I've had BlackBerry phones in the past, but I've also had a Droid (was very unhappy with) and I use an iPod touch daily.  Like many Blackberry users I was waiting for the new Blackberry and while I wish for the company's sake it had come out sooner it was worth the wait for me.Some of the things I love:1) The HUB.  Its as amazing as any previous BlackBerry user expects.  I missed a central message feature so much when I was using a Droid phone.2) The gesture of sliding your finger up to exit applications/go to home screens.  This is just awesome.  I didn't realize how awesome it was until I started using the phone.  I hate how on my iPod I often have to click the home button over and over just to get out of a program.3) The touch keyboard.  While I still miss my physical QWERTY keyboard from my last BB the Z10's keyboard allows me to buzz through texts and e-mails without making me crazy over typing mistakes3) Just the right size to hold in one hand and allow you to use many of the features with one hand but large enough for use with two hands4) For those of you still using the phone as a phone, the call quality was good.  Running water and other background noise often times picked up by phones was only noticable when pointed out.5) I like the look of the UI.  The fonts, colors, how the calendar looks, etc. Nothing's overly \"bubbly\" or super saturated like some other phones I've used.  It just feels clean and fresh.I know some reviews say they struggled with the built in gestures.  I had no problems, there was no real learning curve except one unique to picking up any new device.  I find myself trying to use BB10 gestures on my iPod or Kindle Fire because they are more intuitive.Would I like more apps?  Yes.  Do I want to give up everything my Z10 has to offer just so I can get a better app selection?  No.  The Z10 has all of the main apps I want to use daily and new apps are getting added daily.I'm probably not saying anything that other reviewers haven't already said but I still wanted to add my voice to the other happy Z10 owners.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Same review I left on eBay and I'd still buy this phone.", "Author": "Silence Dogood", "ReviewID": "R3SNFK6VH573IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was apprehensive to jump from a BB 9900 series running OS7 (not iOS 7, BB OS7) to a Z10 running BB10 because for me the 9900 had a good OS and I loved the physical keyboard.  It also had phenomenal build quality.  I didn't have any interest in changing platforms either.  I've used but not owned an iP4, 4S and 5 and came away unimpressed to say the least.  I also currently own a Sony Xperia SL running Android 4.2 (I think that's the version loaded, it's either that or 4.1, either way, it's been demoted to a toy for the kids for the most part).  It's a nice phone with a decent OS but messaging is lackluster.  Plus I'm not a fan of the stock keyboard.  After several months of indecision and instead of using my upgrade discount, I decided to find an unlocked Z10 on eBay.  As soon as I received the unit, I charged it up and was ready to play.  I had to wait to receive a new SIM card so I used it on Wi-Fi for several days which worked perfectly.  For any reviews where the user is put off by the gesture based UI or couldn't grasp it, I simply don't understand.  I had the phone in my hand for less than a minute and all but mastered it.  Swipe up, down, left, right, flick words into emails, BBM; the whole thing for me was very intuitive.  I pick up the Xperia some days trying to swipe everything on it, then I realize I have to deal with lowly back and home buttons.  BBRY gets a lot of flack for their app selection but once again, I don't care a lot about apps.  I've browsed through Google Play countless times just seeing what apps are available and truthfully, for me, it's annoying.  There is simply too much junk to filter through.  Along the line of not caring much for apps, I always read, well there isn't a native Instagram for BB10.  I loaded Instragram on my Xperia the first day I got the phone, which has been at least 9 months now.  I have used that app a total of three times because I have no use for it.  I also don't play games on my phones.  I have enough stuff to do without playing Candy Crush or Angry Birds all day.  My main uses for a phone - calls, messaging and internet.  The Z10 and BB10 pretty much leaves the other major OSes in the dust with those.  While I apparently don't represent the norm anymore, for me, a BB still handles my needs for a mobile device.  And once again, as has been my experience with the BBs I've owned, the build quality is quite good.  I especially like the textured back panel.

My old iPhone is a trooper and still going strong after a few years of use but I wanted a different experience from iOS so gave Blackberry's Z10 a shot.  First things first it is a great feeling handset.  The phone feels just right in my hands and the backing is easy to grip.  The Blackberry OS is smooth and fluid with no lag or delays and much more intuitive than even iOS.  It takes maybe a minute to figure out the gestures and get going.  Blackberry's Hub is a great idea with great execution on the Z10.  This phone makes multitasking insanely simple.I liked that the handset was well built.  Even after a couple of drops it did not crack, chip, or appear damaged.  My 18 month old daughter got ahold if it after eating some Cheerios and the screen and body wiped clean with nothing more than a damp towel.  The OS is smooth and the browser is really fast.  The two best features in my opinion are the virtual keyboard (simply amazing) and the phone itself.  Blackberry did a great job on call quality with this phone.  My calls were all clear and crisp with no dropping.What I did not like is the same thing that everyone doesn't like about the phone and that is the lack of quality apps.  I am a quality over quantity person myself and having said that the quality of apps are pretty low along with the quantity.  Blackberry advertises over 100,000 apps for the phone but most are international apps and otherwise not particularly useful here in the United States.  Most of the apps that you can download are simply browser bookmarks such as the Youtube app.  Blackberry's Travel app is absolutely wonderful but you can get the same thing if not better using Google Now.The other things I did not like about the phone are that the camera is pedestrian at best and moving photos from your phone to computer is absolutely archaic.  All I can say about transferring photos is good luck.  It is not a simple plug in to the computer and transfer like the iPhone.  You have to download Blackberry's program and click your heels together while facing west reciting \"Oh Canada\" to get the transfer to work.After a few weeks of use I wound up returning the phone to Amazon and went back to my iPhone 4S.  I wish the Blackberry Z10 was better.  I want it to be better but it simply is too limited to replace my iPhone and I am back to the drawing board for a new phone.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Z10 review for you smart enough to buy it here instead of paying more", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1WUSMASLSW6V1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having been a long time blackberry user, I have been patient to pass judgment. I was excited about the much needed overhaul of the OS that would come with this device.The Good:- The device is really fast and moves about the web faster than your average computer. The videos on the display are certainly HD quality. The keyboard is the best you will find on any device. I also have a playbook and like it, I don't mind one bit the touchscreen. The form and build is very nice with the Z10 being certainly an executive looking device more so than others. Calls are clear and the LTE does seem to be different in a good way than what I previously had. Email is flawless as always with blackberry. The apps that are actually made for Blackberry 10 (not just android ports) are absolutely great, but the problem is they are few.The Bad: Battery life is not good. I would stop short of saying terrible, but not as good as it should be. I will say that for the first time ever, I now carry a charger with me! The device seems to have some quirks, which will lead me to my next point. Iside-loaddeload apps, which I do, then you have access to far more applications then you do through the extremely limited App World. I am tired of Blackberry boasting a large number of apps, when most are useless. App World lacks access to the basic news apps, and I did discover that ESPN, Score, and some other android ports are rendered practically useless on this device. I used several of the side load apps and they usually work well, but I have wondered whether it causes some of the issues with the phone rebooting and such.The conclusion is that I expected more with all the hype and by the way if you liked how Blackberry Bridge worked with your Playbook - forget that because text, email, and bbm were removed. Thank you for that Blackberry.

Super fast browser including Adobe Flash Video support. Camera has time shifting to pick the right image. The new BB maps supports voice control. As long as you have a cell signal, who needs a stand alone GPS. Plenty of APPS and games. While iPhone has thousands of APPS, how many does anyone load? Rather have a good APP than 10 crappy APPS. I prefer the Z10 over the Q10 as I can zoom the screen to read the text easier without putting on the reading glasses.

That said, the phone itself is okay.  It's user experience has a couple notable features (such as the hub which I enjoy), but it is less polished and a tad less sophisticated even than the iphone 3gs (if far more powerful and with infinitely better a camera (no doubt equivalent to the modern iphone and equivalent.))Most notably, my individual phone is a little on the broken side and I may soon be forced to send it off for maintenance or replacement.  Something with the battery or the connections to the battery is itermittent... causing, regardless of how well charged it is, spontaneous reboots at times.  Once, it even just plain died while still at 90% battery, forcing me to take the back off the phone, yank out the battery, wait a few secs, and put it back in.  Thankfully, that got it to boot back up again, and it hasn't done it since... though it does still spontaneously reboot from time to time.  The only good I can say, on that front, is that it's happening less as time goes on.  Still, a coworker has the same phone with which he's never once had either problem.  So I still suspect mine is just a bit of a mild lemon.  Reading forums suggests I'm not the only one, however.So yeah... mixed review overall.

It's veru easy to navigate around the screens, after a few days practice.  Nice, solid feel to the phone, big screen, large virtual text keys, protected glass bezel.  I use it mainly for calls, texting, FB messages, and going online to look up information.  Games, photos, music, and videos I did very little on the Droid, partly because of the smaller screen and poorer camera quality (it was a four-year old Droid); I may do more with this phone with these types of activities.  If so, I will revise my review to include them.Battery life has been criticized by other reviewers and I must admit it had me considering exchanging the phone for another Droid after the first couple of days:  less than 6 hours on a full charge the first day (with no usage - I just placed it in a drawer until it drained), 7 hours the second day, 9 hours the third day, and now, the fourth and fifth days, it's gone 29 hours on a full charge and still has 20% charge showing on the battery icon, and I'm using it pretty heavily today.  I'm now happy with the battery life (and relieved!).  Also love that I can open the back of the phone and change out the battery and the optional memory card, and I can charge a spare battery and the phone at the same time on a fairly inexpensive charging dock.Now, on to the APPS.  I don't use a lot, but a few were very important to me on the Droid - some are either not present for the BB Z10 or they are inadequate, others are just now coming into the app store, or BB has done a work-around.(1) PdaNet - for free tethering for my Mac laptop.  The company's BB version does not work on the Z10.  (Neither for that matter, does any other app.)  and, from correspondence with them, PdaNet's developer junefabrics does not yet seem very interested in developing an app for the Z10.  I want an app to work with my unlimited data plan - the reason I paid full price for the phone in the first place, to avoid the restricted plans with extra $ attached to them.  The unlimited data plan at VZ requires monthly fees for tethering and for mobile hotspot on the Z10.  This is the one single reason I might eventually go back to a Droid, on which PdaNet DOES work.  We'll see.(2)  My gmail works at least as well as on my Droid - thanks to a BB workaround provided that I just purchased.(3)  My very favorite game of all time just yesterday showed up in the BB store!  Wasn't there when I checked the day before.  Yay!  I play it on the computer and iPad but never played it on the Droid because of the small screen.(4)  I use IPCam Viewer on the iPad and used it on the Droid.  It seems to work great.(5) Facebook app not very user friendly yet, though it seems to be getting better with today's update - still can't post comments, though.(6)  Audible just 2 days ago decided to cancel their support on Blackberry devices and for their Audible BB app.  This is very disappointing, but not a deal-breaker for me with regards to my new phone (though it will probably result in my cancellation of my Platinum Audible membership under another account).  I don't understand Audible's reasoning with this decision.(7)  LastPass and Xmarks.  Both great apps; I've used them for a number of years on my PC's, Mac's, and Droid phone, and now they also work great on BB Z10, even though they apparently are still android versions.(8)  I use Dropbox.  Works fine on the Z10.This discussion leaves out plenty of commonly-used apps because I don't use them, at least not yet.  Others can discuss them.(9)  There is no AllRecipes app yet for the Z10, but I can easily log in through my Browser to get to my account and its shopping and recipe lists.All in all, I'm finding the apps on the BB Z10 to be more than adequate (except for the tethering issue) for my uses.

For anyone with an older Blackberry, you can get paid for trading in your older Blackberry for a newer model. Check out the link below.[...]Switching devices is simple. There are apps that can be installed on iPhones and Android phones from [...] The same app can be downloaded from Blackberry World. There are multiple ways to move your data from an old Blackberry to the Blackberry Z10.The Blackberry Z10 is a great for business and leisure. The Blackberry Flow allows me to navigate smoothly and quickly in between tasks with one hand. It is easy to quickly minimize an app and start a new one. I can minimize the NFL Mobile app and open the StubHub app with my thumb. The Blackberry Hub is a centralized location for messages and is always easy to get to with one or two gestures. It is easy to switch between text messages, e-mails, calls, etc. from the hub. The smart keyboard and gestures help me quickly type what I need, so I can get back to performing other tasks. When typing, I do not need to press a button to switch between text and symbols. I can just swipe a finger up or down the keyboard. The words that the smart keyboard predicts are very accurate and easy to flick up into my sentences. Once you learn the right gestures, it is easy to delete multiple e-mails. When I'm ready to lock my device, I can just press the power button at the top of the device and the screen provides me an option to lock the device.The browser is smooth and fast, especially in the 4G LTE areas. Adobe Flash and private browsing can be enabled in the browser. Video clips from any website can be viewed. The browser supports HTML5. I can open multiple tabs and save my favorite pages as bookmarks. The reader feature puts the text and graphics from the website in an enlarged and easy to read format. The best way to describe the reader feature is to say webpages are converted into a e-book format.  Google Maps is accessible through the browser.  It is easy to share webpages from the browser with the share icon, which is available from most screens on the Blackberry.I love the voice control feature on my Blackberry Z10.  If I do not have time to look at the Blackberry and type, I can use the voice control feature to make a call, send an e-mail or text, schedule an appointment, search the internet and take notes.I love that the Blackberry Z10 has Near Field Communication (NFC).  It was already easy to share information with the Blackberry Z10 via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE), e-mail, text message, BBM, HDMI and Skype.  I can also share files from my Blackberry Z10 by tapping another Blackberry 10 or any NFC enabled device.  Unfortunately, you cannot tap and share with friends that have the expensive iPhone 5S because the iPhone 5S does not have NFC.The Blackberry Z10 has a built-in screen shot feature, so there is no need to download a third party app. Capturing a screen shot on a BlackBerry Z10 device is simple as holding both the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until you hear a shutter sound. The screen shots will be saved in the camera picture gallery.The cameras are great. The Blackberry Z10 quickly takes beautiful pictures with either of the two cameras. The time shift mode allows me to find the best facial expression from those memorable moments. I enjoy using my Blackberry Z10 to Skype with family and friends. I like that I can switch between my two cameras during the Skype video call.The BlackberryZ10 is great for listening to the music stored on my Micro SD card.  Of course, I have albums from artist like Alicia Keys and Gyptian on my Blackberry.  I used my music on my media card to make my ringtones. My Blackberry Z10 can play music using earbuds or through any of my vehicles' sound systems.  Blackberry Z10 has Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) with aptX(tm) enabled, so sound is exceptionally great via bluetooth.  I can also download TuneIn Radio from Blackberry World to listen to local and international radio stations from my Blackberry Z10.Parents will like that the Blackberry Z10 has built-in parental controls, so there is no need to download a third party app. Parents can set a password to access the parental controls, so that the children cannot change them. Phone and text messages can be limited to just the individuals in the contacts. Parental controls allow parents to turn off features like the camera and video, Facebook, Twitter, uploading to YouTube and purchase content just the name a few. Content restrictions can also be set.My Blackberry Z10 has many other security features. My Blackberry Z10 makes it easy to encrypt the data on my device and my Micro SD card. If my Blackberry Z10 is ever stolen, Blackberry Protect allows me to track or wipe my Blackberry from a remote location.The Adobe Reader app is great. It allows sharing via e-mail, BBM and NFC. I can navigate the PDF by using the bookmarks. I can zoom in and out of the text and images. I can even enter comments, signatures, highlight and strike through text and click hyperlinks. My changes are saved automatically upon exiting the document. It is great for conducting business on the go.  Blackberry 10 devices have a built-in zip file feature that allows me zip files, which is convenient when I need to attach multiple large files in an e-mail.The phone call quality is great on the Blackberry.  They phone has many features available from the phone app, such as dial pad, phone history, voicemail and contacts.  The dial pad has large keys and is available when I need to use it with an automated system.  It is easy to switch between phone, speaker and Bluetooth.  These options are available during the call.There are two minor things I think you should note. There was not a holster included with the Blackberry Z10, so you will need to purchase your own.
