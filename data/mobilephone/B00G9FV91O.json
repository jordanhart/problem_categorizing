{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone with one potentially major consideration", "Author": "Bradley J Rehmus", "ReviewID": "R19I233PIB46SK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*scroll down for an important heads up prior to purchasing*I was torn on how to rate this because I am very ambivalent (in love the device and disappointed with one aspect). Previous reviewers mentioned many of the specs which truly standout. The battery is simply incredible. I do not use it as much as some smart phone junkies, but I use it consistently and never have it run out in one charge. It's wonderful knowing I can spend time playing videos, music, constantly checking scores or social media and reading news or ebooks - the screen is just large enough for me to do so comfortably making my Samsung 2 7.0 tablet practically obsolete. The camera is excellent and despite all the reviews and information I read prior to purchasing, the speed of the processor still took me by surprise.The screen is absolutely gorgeous. I am very impressed with many of the features such as 'smart video' where the forward-facing camera detects your eyes and pauses the video when you look away. You can also take video simultaneously using the main and forward-facing cameras (picture-in-picture style). This device can also use facial recognition with the forward facing camera to unlock your phone. I'm not sure how much use I will get out of these last two features but their novelty impresses me.The rear-buttons grew on me in under a week and I prefer them hands down. I love being able to resume from sleep by double-tapping and as others have mentioned, never find myself accidentally turning the screen off or accidentally adjusting the volume which is quite important in my job because I can't accidentally turn my ringer on at work. Pocket dialing also seems to be a non-issue for me and I adjusted to the change almost immediately.*heads up*The ONLY reason I give this less than 5 stars is because in some areas, there are significant problems connecting to sprints new tri-band 4g LTE networks. Instead of utilizing simultaneous voice and LTE (SVLTE) like previous models, they are utilizing enhanced Circuit Switch Fallback (eCSFB). When you are using LTE, it has to change over to CDMA to receive calls and text messages and this can seriously hamper your ability to consistently use their LTE networks. Theoretically this will work seamlessly eventually and in some areas already does. In other areas (such as here in Portland), this is lacking. Sprint is majorly overhauling their networks to ensure corrections, however this will take time. If you are someone who relies on having LTE data speeds, you should research the 'eCSFB gap' and see if your area has corrected this problem, will soon or may not for some time. Since I primarily use wifi for data (given it's ubiquity in Portland) and 3g speeds often suit my needs, it hasn't been a huge issue but it was disappointing to spend what I did for this phone to learn that I may not immediately have reliable access to LTE data performance as I expected.If this concerns you, search 's4gru' and/or the 'eCSFB Gap' to learn more about this issue and if you could be affected prior to purchasing if this is an issue pertinent to your phone selection choice.As indicated by my overall rating, I still don't regret this purchase and love this device however I am a bit disappointed that sprint wasn't more forthcoming about these issues and has been slow to offer concrete timetables of when they will be resolved in many areas. If and when this situation is ameliorated, this device will absolutely get five starts from me.I also recommend the 'high gloss clear' case by Diztronic for the white version - protection without bulk keeping a sleek, gorgeous phone looking good and remaining pocket friendly.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast, excellent display, good reception vs others", "Author": "Dan A \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R1GSRYMO9I63US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am rating this based on my experience with the device, even though it's my wife's phone.Pros:- Excellent display screen- Super fast- Nice photos from camera- Amazing battery life- Cell reception is better that the galaxy SIII when side by side- 32gb storage internalCons:- Size, but this was expected, not great for most pockets.- Car charger that can do the 1.8 amps that the wall charger does is impossible to find.  Still looking.- Battery not changeable (not a big deal, since we have a portable battery pack charger to keep it going for days)- No micro sd card slot (not a big deal with the 32gb internal space)Other:- Button layout was a slight learning curve.  It's not a con, but it's not a pro either, just be aware that the layout of the hardware buttons is something to get used to.  I will say though, once you accommodate yourself to it, it's pretty easy to work with since the phone is large.  There also hasn't been any accidental volume changes or powering on the device, which is a plus.  I accidentally hit the power and volume keys on my Galaxy SIII all the time.Since this is my wife's phone, I haven't used it as a daily driver, but the battery lasts all day (usually around 20% left by 6 pm), when her old Galaxy SIII would die by 2 pm.  She uses it heavily for Facebook messaging and talks about 2 hours a day on it for her business.I would recommend this device to anyone who wants a fast device with a large screen.

The screen is simply amazing with great colors and resolution.  The device is truly speedy with fast response times.  The screen is quite large (5.2 inches) which works great with videos and reading web based content.  On the other hand, the device had some serious call quality issues which not all LG G2 phones are experience according to online forums.  Some versions are having call quality issues while others are fine.  In my case the phone definitely had call quality voice issues which included crackling, screeching, and problems understanding voices.  I tried changing the volume settings, turning off/on voice enhancement for call etc and nothing seem to work.  Be sure to read about the issue with online forums to see how others are experiencing this issue.  Its apparently being experienced across the board with Verizon customers as well.The phone also has an interesting optically stabilized camera with 13 megapixels resolution.  Its work very well in daylight or in environments with plenty of light.  At night time the images are poor due to  a great deal of noise reduction used by the camera.  The video recording capabilities were pretty good but not great for a smartphone.While the call quality is an issue, the rest the of the phone works great.

Almost as good as a regular point and shoot.5. 32 GB of internal storage.6. The buttons on the back are great once you get used to them.Cons-1. Can be difficult to operate with one hand.2. Software bugs.3. No MicroSD card slot or removable battery.4. Quick Remote can be much better.5. LG launcher could be better.6. It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don\u2019t use a cover.Having used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.Pros (continuation)1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the \u201cnight\u201d mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don\u2019t think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.Cons (continuation)1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesn\u2019t have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesn\u2019t receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You can\u2019t take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.In conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don\u2019t think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isn\u2019t. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT LG SMARTPHONE SAMSUNG BETTER WATCH OUT", "Author": "ENMANUEL RODRIGUEZ \"erodrig\"", "ReviewID": "R2HNYYWU4OP0M8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent specs on this beautiful design smartphone coming off the galaxy s3 i decide to go with this lg g2 and is fantastic , easyt to use and for now im testing how long the battery lasts , but overall great phone which finally sprint supports the tri-mode lte network is fast", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really good, fast, long battery, nice screen phone!", "Author": "Jonathan Gurrola", "ReviewID": "R18474J118RSE9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like the phone.

It's fast and capable, and has great battery life. The screen is amazing, too. Big, but amazing. I say big because I'm coming to the G2 from an HTC EVO 4G LTE (LTEVO). That phone is significantly smaller than the G2. I'll try to be as detailed as I can be about the G2, so bear with me. First, it's plastic. Shiny plastic. It's a fingerprint magnet, to be honest. The good thing is that it's well designed and doesn't feel cheap. It has a little heft to it, and feels really good in the hand. Personally, I like the pattern that covers its back. It looks like a fabric weave or something similar to me. It's not as pronounced or iridescent on the white model, but still very noticeable. There is a thin, chrome line going around the sides of the phone. I think it is a nice accent. I don't mind not having the home, back, and menu buttons on the actual face of the device. I also like the placement of the physical buttons on the back. It works out perfectly for my hands and they feel very natural where they are. I do not have to stretch my fingers or search for them, they just seem to always be right where I want them to be. This and the lack of face buttons were huge issues for me, coming from standard bar shaped devices for so many years. I eventually decided to go ahead and take a chance on the G2 after seeing the whole package this phone has to offer. Please note that the Verizon version (VS980) is different in dimensions and features. The buttons on the back are also smaller and shaped differently. The Sprint version (LS980) that I have is supposed to be the same as the AT&T; (D800) and T-Mobile (D801) models aside from the lack of a microphone hole on the back, but in my experience, some accessories that are made for the latter two do not fit mine. The Fosmon cases, for example, do not fit my Sprint model correctly. The Incipio Dual Pro case I also bought for it, does. It fits in my pockets with no problems, and doesn't seem to move around much when in there. It also doesn't turn on in my pocket. I've seen some people say that theirs turns on in their pockets when pressure is applied to that area, but mine does not. For those that do, I recommend putting on a case of some sort. That extra thickness might make a little space between the back buttons and the wall of your pocket. Just a thought. The screen is very responsive, and the animations are smooth and seemless. The added bloatware doesn't seem to do much damage until you add a good number of apps. It also depends on the apps themselves, of course. The TV remote function works without a hitch on my TVs, and all of the sensors function well. I like the camera a lot. It takes clear, sharp, and well-lit pictures from what I've seen so far. It also doesn't lag or freeze up. The front-facing one is also good, and takes good pictures in my opinion. You can change or adjust most everything about the UI, and although it may take some time to look at everything and get used to it, it's pretty simple and straightforward. The speakers on the bottom are very good, but I would like a little more volume. As far how it works as a phone, call quality for me is good, but I think that I have to hold it a little closer to my face when talking on it in the normal position. I can hear everything clearly and loudly, but it seems that the party on the other end of the call cannot every once in a while. I change the phone's position and this is fixed. I can now get Sprint's LTE everywhere in my house and outside, something I could not do with my LTEVO. And my G2 keeps it's LTE signal literally all the time when I am at home. It also works very well with my WiFi, and never once disconnected from it for unknown reasons. I haven't had a chance to try out its NFC capabilities yet, something that did not work on my LTEVO in any way. That's about all I can think of for right now, but as I said, I absolutely love this phone. I will try to edit this review as I learn and work with my G2, and keep it up to date.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "james cochran", "ReviewID": "R29RFR0NAT2CKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been the best phone I have had.

Jimenez \"biglexlost\"", "ReviewID": "R2L1D2IBDU2LJ6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I absolutely LOVE SO MANY things about this phone but at the same time there are things that I absolutely hate. First and the BIGGEST issue is the keyboard. This is the BIGGEST problem with the phone. It will work like a charm then all of a sudden out of no where it will go bananas when you're typing. If you go to type \"and\" for example you will end up with \"aaaaaaaaannnnddd\" wtf?! I did tons of research and the best thing I found was to NOT use Swype . That is just unacceptable considering it is a necessity for me to use Swype to type. Swype is the ONLY reason I switched to a non-qwerty hard button phone. Switching the keyboard input to the LG keyboard did resolve that issue for the most part but I just can't stand typing without Swype since I had grown so accustomed to it. This keyboard situation was more frequent then not when using Swype making me almost go bald from pulling my hair out from the frustrations of it.  A second issue I have is the fact that it boasts this 13 Megapixel camera and quite frankly it sucks. It is HELLA slow!!! And will only take pictures worth keeping with lots of light. Don't try taking a pic at a concert or the club b/c that's just wasting your time. The video quality is good but don't try recording at a concert or any loud even because that's yet another waste.  Another bad thing is the lack of a micro SD card slot. It gives you 32G of built in memory of which only about 26G is accessible. This isn't too bad but makes it a pain when it comes time to, for example, take pictures off your phone. I also liked using my digital camera to take pictures then swapping the SD card in my Galaxy S2 with the camera one and uploading some lovely high quality pix taken with my real camera right on the spot instead of having to wait until I got home to upload any of the pictures taken with my camera.  Lastly for the bad, my phone tends to randomly drop calls. Now I don't talk on my mobile barely ever and if I do it is only for a few minutes so for it to randomly disconnect me >50% of the time I AM on phone talking, I couldn't imagine being a frequent talker and having this happen all the time to me.  Now here is the \"bad\" part...there are so many great features of this phone that make me torn to get rid of it. First the Quick Memo app is just AWESOME! It has come in handy so many times I have lost count. If you are talking to someone and need to quickly write a number down to then text or call them Quick Memo is your go to!  The screen is an amazing 5.2\" and looks SO DANG SHARP and beautiful when watching youtube videos, movies, etc. For having such a MASSIVE screen the phone itself is impressively small. It is about the same width as my S2 and just a 1/2\" or so taller which isn't bad considering the screen dwarfs the S2's and is the size of my wife's entire iPhone 4. I put her iPhone on top of my G2 and the iPhone looks like a toy.  You can also do things with the QSlide feature which helps you multitask easily while viewing an app in a small window on your screen. You can adjust the transparency and move it around the screen at your own free will. I use this feature frequently with the calculator.  The LG G2 is also incredibly fast and snappy. It rarely lags even with multiple apps open and running at the same time. I noticed the biggest difference from my Galaxy S2 when it came to things like opening a game. It was 75% faster at the least!  The G2 ALSO has another awesome feature of the QSlide which would let you, with the use of a three fingers action, swipe up to 3 apps to the side to be saved to return back to. So if you had to send a text but needed to reference a website to get info to text you could swipe the web browser a side then open your messaging and you could then switch between them without losing your place in either. This feature has come in handy quite a few times too.  The Sprint version has the 4G LTE which I liked more than the Sprint WiMax. It switches over to 4G when it's accessible and goes back to 3G when it is not. I noticed drastic speed changes versus always using only the 3G and having to turn on the 4G when you wanted faster speeds. This would kill your battery like there was no tomorrow and the coverage was very limited.  Lastly I wanted to mention the 3300mA battery. This is a beast! It doesn't appear to make the phone any larger but gives you at least two times the battery life versus an iPhone or any other standard 1500-1800mA battery filled Android. I am an average user and I can have my G2 last me a minimum of 1 1/2 days. If I don't use it much I can go two days on the same charge no questions asked. One bad part is that it is built into the phone so there is no buying a second battery to have charged to swap out in those just in case moments.  Hopefully that helps you get a better understanding of the LG G2 from Sprint. I would say if you don't mind using the regular keyboard (not Swype) and don't talk on the phone too much, this could be a great phone for you!", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "this phone kick ass.", "Author": "Suresh Shrestha", "ReviewID": "RLKM5DUH6005H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing phone and I love it.

It has an amazing battery and a beautiful screen.The only thing I can find wrong with this phone is the software. For instance the camera is laggy and the overall UI can be slow at times. This can easily be fixed by LG with a software update because the hardware on this phone is great and should be able to handle any software as long as it is optimized. Now, LG isn't exactly know for providing timely updates so who knows when these issues will be fixed.BIG CON: THERE IS NO GROUP MESSAGING! You will have to get a different messaging app because it is NOT supported on the sprint variant. This is another thing that can be easily fixed with a software update but who know when they will fix it.Once again I repeat that this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone.

MORENO \"Robfactory\"", "ReviewID": "R17YR2KHPCHJHE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG G2 has been called innovative.It has won design awards.However, it has failed to become a mainstream phone.I did a review 2 months ago comparing the HTC One and the LG G2. In this review I went over the basic differences between both phones. I didn't give a conclusion because I had the phone for two weeks and I had not customized it the way I wanted. This included rooting the phone and doing several tweaks.I will note the stock and tweaked versions of the review.Screen:Well, I'm two months in with the phone and this will be a full on review of the device. The first thing you'll notice about this phone is the 5.2 inch screen. It is a full HD 1080p IPS display with 423 ppi resolution. This is housed in a 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 frame. The G2 is one of the thinnest if not the thinnest bezel smartphone in the market. This makes the screen look rather large compared to same sized phones with larger bezels.The colors of the screen are overly saturated. This is something that has become common practice. It makes images pop and also makes images brighter and the cost of losing real life image quality. In no way is this phone supposed to replace a tablet or E-Reader, but as a commute reader, it will be more than adequate.The screen is also part of a new technology called Graphic RAM (GRAM), which caches an image when the screen is static. This means when the screen is not being refreshed on a new image, the CPU and GPU do not have to be used. This can enhance battery life, according to LG.Pros:1. Amazing screen to bezel dimensions.2. Good viewing angles.3. Good under sunlightCons:1. Over Saturated colorsBattery:The phone's non-removable Li-Po 3000 mAh battery is one of the main reasons I switched from the HTC One. I often go out of my provider's reach. This causes the phone to search for a signal and drain the battery rather fast. Not only that, but I also leave the GPS, data sync (GMail, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, tumblr, LinkedIn, Google Offers, TuneInRadio, DropBox, Box, Google+) on, while using the MP3 player.On a regular 6 hour outing with reception coming in and out, using the camera,editing photos, uploading stuff to social media and listening to music, I would drain the battery about 40%. So the phone still has 60% of battery life left.Battery Tweaked:After rooting the phone I used a couple of ROMs and MODs.Currently, I am using furnace-0.0.7 kernel. This kernel has different optimizations which include tweaks to the voltages, CPU overclocking, fast charge, and battery extender among the many.While using all of the software above, I have managed to drain the battery 30% in 13 hours. Leaving the phone with 70% battery life.Pros:1. 3,000 mAh2. Need I say more?Cons:1. Not removable. Then again, you won't need to.Camera:No camera is perfect. In fact, all cameras have a compromise. This is especially true when it comes to mobile phones.The bad:The OIS on the 13-megapixel camera is not this good. In fact, the camera has had several issues. First of, the camera depends too much on software stabilization and denoising, it then uses the two-axis optical image stabilization and multi-point auto-focus to help produce a stable picture.Here is where the problem lies. Rather than using the hardware stabilization more and then the software, the pictures at times come out as if they were painted. This is more evident in night time photos. The over processing and software stabilization makes the pictures come out oddly Van Gogh-esque, which is not a compliment.Modes:The phone's software is very much like Samsung's Galaxy line. Click on Mode and it will give you a graphic example of what it does and an accompanied text explaining it.The best mode for daylight photos is Intelligent Auto (IA). However, for some reason, LG made the software default to normal.Now my questions is, if you taut IA as being a great feature and the best of all the camera settings, why not make it the default mode?Another issue with the way the camera software is that it doesn't keep the previous mode selected.For example, I'm at a sporting event and choose the Sports camera mode. I take a shot and go back to my home screen. If I want to take another photo, I have to go to Mode again because it goes back to Normal as default mode.Night mode and image stabilization are a problem on this phone. As stated above, since the phone depends on denoising software and stabilization first, and then the physical OIS, it softens the photos to a degree where it looks drawn.Click on the photos below to enlarge.Focus: Not for the rapid photographerOne thing you'll notice is that the focus on this takes a while. If you try to hurry the shot you will get something like this.This is just unacceptable performance from a high end phone's camera.However, don't let this discourage you.The Good:The rear volume - acts as a camera activator when the phone is on standby, it also lets your capture a photo once the camera app is up and running. I found this useful for taking candid shots.Multi-point Auto-focusThis is something I wish more companies would use. By letting the camera have multi-focal points you get a cleaner picture. And yes, some companies have used the multi-face tracker, but not on random objects.DaylightWhen there is a good amount of daylight, this camera is amazing. The shots are clean and clear. The colors are very accurate. It doesn't help that the screen also accents those opaque colors at times. Depending on the scenery, I usually pick between Dynamic Tone Range (HDR) or IA. The only time I pick Normal is when I don't have time for the menu.Either way, here are some shots: I use the Wide Angle setting which is 10 mega-pixels.Since you get 13 mega-pixels (10 for Wide Angle) you get a lot of details per shot. This enables you to crop and edit a photo without much loss of definition. It also allows details in depth.Camera Pros:1. 13 mega-pixels2. Quality under good lighting3. Intelligent Auto setting4. Volume (-) camera launcher and shutter.Camera Negative:1. Low light capture quality2. Focus set time3. Camera UI's lack of keeping the last Mode setting.Tweaked Camera:I've been using Xdabbeb's Camera Mod. This mod enhances focus times, night time shooting quality, overall image quality, it adds 1600 ISO and it lets hardware stabilization become eminent in the process. For information click on the link.Video:The version of the phone I have only has two noise cancelling microphones, which is ok, but could be better with three. Since the third microphone would have been in the back of the phone and capturing the audio from the front.The video above will go over the different video features.It's pretty neat that the camera is able to support 60 frames per second in daylight and well lit areas. This gives the recording a more realistic view and flow.This setting will only be available on 1080p.I wish they would have set it for 720p and lesser quality videos.By recording in 1080p 60 fps you will soon realize that the files are rather large. So be careful when filming videos that you do not fill the phone's drive.Asides from that, I noticed the video quality to be quite good. You get Normal, HDR Recording, Live Effect (which makes you have funny faces), Dual Recording (use both front and rear cameras in one shot) and Tracking Zoom, which is explained in the video.The Negative:The video camera lacks a clear focus. In some phones you are able to click on the screen and get a visual mark of where the video is trying to focus. Sadly, this phone doesn't have that. I've noticed that when I zoom in to an object at a distance, the video will quickly lose focus and become useless. This is something I wish they would fix.There's no slow motion.Tweaked:By using the same Xdabbeb's mod, we get more options in the settings menu. We are able to use 60fps in 720p videos. We also get better focus times and anti-shaking. This is on top of the OIS.Pros:1. Good Quality Video2. 1080p 60fpsCons:1. Lack of focus notification2. Digital Zoom and the lack of focus speed.Camera Overview:The camera's quality and details are great. It's a really good 13 mega-pixel camera if you are going to shoot landscapes, have the camera conveniently set up to take a shot, or are taking regular pics.The major problem I have with this camera are the focus times. They are horrible. That, and the optimized image stabilization algorithm. I mean seriously... if you have the hardware, depend on that rather than the software which is making most low-light photos come out as if they were oil painting.Audio:Phone now days have become more than just phones. They have become point-and-shoot cameras and mp3 players. This phone is able to playback MP3/WAV/FLAC/eAAC+/AC3/WMA files. They make a point in their presentation to mention this is the first smartphone on the market to feature 24-bit/192kHz hi-res audio playback.At that definition the sound is quite good. Especially if you have a good pair of headphones /earphones.The only drawback to this is that a regular track can be more than 100mb. The average person has about 3 hours worth of music on their phone. That would be a total of about 8GB-10GB.Calculations based on this scale.Storage:This is a perfect entry into storage. The US version of the G2 has a fixed 32GB hard drive. The drive on this phone is actually quite fast and sufficient for most.However, there is no expandable slot. This leads to the issue of why are you going to have a hi-res player when the hard drive space is limited? After all is said and done you get about 24GB of HD space. You add apps and cache storage and that's about 22-20GB left.CPU and RAM:The phone has a 2.26 GHz Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon\u2122 800 Quad-Core Processor, which is the latest on the market. It also has 2GB of RAM. This is enough to power any top of the line phone and tablet.Buttons:Having the Volume +, Power On/Off , Volume - on the back of the phone has yet to be a negative. When I use my mobile phone, I usually have my index finger next to the camera lens. I realize it has taken some getting used to, but I like it.Features:KnockOn:The major software feature this phone has is the KnockOn feature. Tap the screen twice with your finger and it wakes up the phone from standby. It's a feature I use quite frequently when I have the phone on my car dock or bike dock.QSlide:This feature lets you use defined apps on top of your current screen. It's a feature I really have not used.QuickRemote:I found LG\u2019s Quick Remote software to quite complete and easy to navigate. However, the IR Blaster is quite small and you have to point the phone directly into the TV.Final Impressions:The phone feels the same as a Samsung Galaxy S3/S4. It is made out of plastic and nothing on the phone is removable. Since the phone is mostly screen, I would recommend getting a case for it. If it falls chances are the screen will shatter. The G2 I possess has a silicon case that adds a bit of heft to it. This makes the phone feel sturdy on my hands. Also, choose the white version. The black version of this phone is a fingerprint magnet. Plus, the white phone looks nicer in my opinion.Do I like the phone?Yes, I do. The phone has many advantages: battery, screen, audio, and image quality.The two main negatives are the lack of expanding storage and the camera quirks.If you set your phone to create and use high quality media, you have to allow the capacity for it. It would have been easy to allow for a microSD slot like in the Asian markets.The camera suite leaves a bit to be deserved. In my opinion the HTC One has the best camera suite. The Zoe feature is amazing and something Android mobile manufacturers should imitate. Having said that, the image quality on this phone is amazing. I actually could go out and say it is in the top two in most Android categories.Overall, I would recommend this phone and give it an 8.5 out of 10.Pictures taken with the phone and edited with VSCO CAM or SnapSeed, Or PicSay Pro, or Pixrl-o-MaticFor photo samples go to my site robfactory . come", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "F*@$ing Amazing!!!", "Author": "Jered Bonneau \"Dont Tread On Me\"", "ReviewID": "R3UUY403J6HD88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone, has an amazing cammera with awesome modes.
