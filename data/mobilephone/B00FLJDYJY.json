{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Important About Unlocked Note 3 Phones", "Author": "Ryan Lewis", "ReviewID": "R34IVNDCJQ4L0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone. But before you buy the unlocked version their is some information you need to know about the different models of the phone(s). The Galaxy Note 3 was released in many country's on every continent. Although anyone can buy the phone from any country; each model was made to work on different frequencies. In this review I am going to go over each model of the Galaxy Note 3 and the services recommended for use with them.But First everyone may be asking about the Region lock attached to the phones. Yes before the phones are unlocked their are region locks attached to the different models forcing them to only accept SIM cards from their designated country's. But after unlocked the Region locks are removed. Does this mean that all models will work everywhere, no, but I will be going over if the phone will work in your region after the locks are removed in the model descriptions below.Second the different levels of service. Depending on your area and the service towers available their you will get different letters to indicate service level and the speed you're getting. Below are the most common levels and their average speeds in order for your reference during the Model review.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal avalible for the data internet conection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I still recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to comfortable able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (360P recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be also flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like netflix(Recommended 460P), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that most 2010-2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable it is not LTE but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on their phone this signal is more than enough to give you a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal that everyone is going after. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Now for the common phone models:1. SM-N9000 3G = International/Made for Travelers: This is the international model. This one has a dual quad core processor running at 1.9 GHz Cortex/1.3 GHz A7. The reason for the processor being change is because this phone is meant to work everywhere their is a GSM signal and kicks threw the different processors to maximize signal strength. The N9000 CAN NOT to 4G speeds of any kind. This is due to most country not having 4G signal and that a lot of county's run on different cell frequencies. By removing the 4G radios this phone can pick up way more cell frequencies then the other models. This phone is not made for people looking for Data speed this is made for travelers whom want a reliable way to have cell service no matter where they are. Don't despair about the data or processing speed this phone still has Wi-Fi connection available and can breeze though 3D games; you shouldn't even notice a speed difference when doing tasks.2. SM-N9005 4G LTE = European Model/International: This model contains the regular 2.3 GHz Snapdragon Processor. This phone unless unlocked is Region locked to only European SIM cards, after unlocked their is no region lock. Although this phone is an LTE phone it can only get LTE frequencies while in Europe. When you take this phone out of Europe it will get international signals but will not get LTE, when this phone is in the USA is will get H+ (Reference above) signal maximum.3. SM-N9002 3G = China Model/Select Counties: This model is not LTE or 4G compatible. This was the First generation of the Note 3 released and is considered the Beta. With all the same hardware as the LTE version this phone will still preform flawless tasks.4. SM-N900W8 4G LTE = China Model/Select Counties: This model will only get LTE in select counties and I advise you check with your service provider to see what signal you will be getting. This model is completely subjective as to what frequencies of LTE you will be about to get. Example: Imagine you are in Europe and you are in a city and get LTE. Then you move to another city and you lose LTE this is because the first city runs on an LTE frequency the the phone can get but the second city although may offer LTE to most cell phone; does not offer LTE on a frequency this phone can't run on.5. SM-N900A 4G LTE = USA AT&T;/Worldwide: This phone is International but you need to consult AT&T; to see if you city or county can get LTE service or not. This phone once unlocked will work on Straight Talk, Solavei, T-Mobile, and any other GSM based network. Note: When using T-Moble, Solavei, or other services that piggy-back on the T-Mobile towers you can get LTE service but depending on your area you may not get 3G. If you live in a 3G area consult your carrier to see is the frequencies for 3G match up with this phone. (This review for the AT&T; model can change at anytime due to AT&T;'s bootloader)6. SM-N900T 4G LTE = USA T-Mobile: This phone when unlocked can get all USA frequencies. Example: You will have no problems using a AT&T; SIM card with this phone and even get 4G LTE threw any service whom provides is. The N900T model is the most versatile model out of them all and if you plan on getting one I recommend going to a T-Mobile store and purchasing this model outright. Unlocking this phone is easily done threw calling T-Mobile and even using YouTube for an unlocking video.So out of all the models the N900T is the most versatile, but unlike the N900A (The second most versatile) the N900T is harder to find online already unlocked so you will most likely need to buy if from the store and unlock it yourself.I hope this review has helped with you decision about what unlocked version to buy.If you have an questions or addition to the review please leave a comment.Video review of phone Specs and features coming soon.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "it didn't work in Europe.

I thought it was a near perfect phablet, except for just two main areas for improvement: Screen resolution/sunlight legibility, and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed. Now that I have the Note 3, things are much much improved.Lets make this review simple and straight to the point, with a few comparisons to other phones:PROS:1) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen. And WOW, what a screen it is!There are a handful of improvements:* The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p(from the Note 2's 720p). You can noticeably tell that it is crisper.* You will also find out that it is a lot brighter. This screen has been technically measured to be the brightest screen of any phone, and just now bested by the Samsung Galaxy S5. For us geeks, that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max(as tested by DisplayMate).* Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2. The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels(velvety deep blacks). I can finally use it in the bright sunlight now!* Touch input response is lightning quick. This means when you touch something, it responses nearly instantaneously. It even beats the iPhone 5S, the previous champion, and is only just bested by the HTC One M8.2) This phone flies, almost literally. The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag, and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart's content! This phone is AWESOME for gaming.3) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note. Too much to describe all the functions, and you can do without it for most functions. But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4) All those software features! Granted, you can do without most of them for day-to-day things, but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use. The are also too many to go through all - there are literally over 30 features! One of my favorites is the Smart-Stay feature, which uses the front camera to monitor that you're looking at the screen and won't dim/turn off, which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages, etc., holding the phone up with one hand, and your other hand is pre-occupied. No more having to shuffle your hand and risk dropping the phone to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up. This is especially and specifically useful for me when I'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app. Also, there are tilt and hand-gesture features for when you want to scroll web pages, emails, zoom in on photos, switch to the next or previous photo or music track, answer a phone call, etc. etc. etc!5) The sound is noticeably louder as well. It doesn't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One's dual stereo speakers, but by itself it is louder. This is useful when you are in a noisy environment, and having one loud mono speaker is more useful than having two expansive speakers that space the sound out wider and making it harder to hear. As good as the HTC One sounds, I hate that for most things like music and video, it is so darn soft and frustrating. I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use. Although the new HTC One M8 has much improved and louder speakers than the older M7.6) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it, and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I'm in bed at night. The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME. I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20% will already be gone. And when I charge it, it trickle charges like a turtle! With the Note 3, being able to replace the battery is an added plus, and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly, usually from 20% to full charge in about 2.5 hours. But even these two advantages cannot compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place. from about 10am to 2am, with heavy usage, I usually end the night at about 30%, which is actually quite amazing since I am on it constantly - phone calls, checking emails, web surfing, checking sports stats and news, and spending hours using my Pulse News app.CONS:*There are few things you can nitpick, like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy, not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones. The plastic back nice a nice leathery LOOK, but it is still cheap plastic and feels just like it. Thank goodness most of us cover our phones with cases, so in that aspect it's not a big deal, just that for a $700 phone it should have been made with much better materials and craftsmanship. With rumors of a new Galaxy luxury line, this may be changed very soon though.*The Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. There is a minute, but noticeable lag when you open certain apps or switch between apps with the multi-tasker. Luckily, being Android means we'll never have to settle. My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look, is Smart Launcher Pro. Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I can't think of much else really to fault this phone, except for the fact that simply for what it is: It's a niche machine that's half tablet/half phone - it will not satisfy you as a tablet replacement(I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range), and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it in one hang, and do all the things you need one-handed(I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S). But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is, then there is no better alternative, period. Samsung dominates the phablet market, and that's because this is a nearly flawless multimedia machine with an excellent, crisp, brilliant screen, powerful hardware, useful software, and AWESOME battery life. If you like big phones, you will NOT be disappointed!", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "like what I expected", "Author": "donny prasetyo", "ReviewID": "R32WT0AEADGB55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I wanna thanks to Amazon for delivery on time this is a lot of money to buy cellphone and this is first time I buy cellphone online, and this is my review about my cellphone Samsung note 3 all very good like what I expected that why I give 5 star but still one thing annoying me I don't find the guarantee card because I buy little bit money to have that but it's ok I hope can be review for anyone thank Amazon.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad cell phone", "Author": "Marvin Muna", "ReviewID": "R3VL559O07DAB7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1) The condition of the box was damage due to the way it was packed.2) The phone Camera and battery does not workOverall if this was a new phone why dont the Camera work and the battery doesnt hold a charge beside the way it was shipped.This is so inconveince being overseas in Afghanistan", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "super phone", "Author": "Emilio", "ReviewID": "R2QYRVL68UJRBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i  had a galaxy ace before this so it is a big change for me, is fast , iam using this cell in guayaquil ecuador and i just went to my phone operator, change the sim card and it began to work normaly , no blocking problems, excelent interface, and delivered just in time, seals were ok.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "thank you", "Author": "Fabian Quintero", "ReviewID": "RIPIUGJKORYPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i choose this rating because it's the phone that i wanted but because it is not for me but for my sister she needed the international version with the spanish language input in the settings and this phone even though it is unlocked does not come with that but only english languages and asians languages like Japanese, Korean, filipino and so on, thats not what i was expecting from the international version if the phone was for me i wouldn't mind this issue at all. so i would recommend the phone for anybody except those who do not speak english.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$579.99", "Features": "FACTORY UNLOCKED INTERNATIONAL", "Name": "Brand New Samsung Galaxy Note 3 III N9005 32gb White \u2605 Factory Unlocked\u2605 International Version", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cF6KNI7FL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FLJDYJY"}}
