This phone finally looked promising combining a rugged design with solid performance. Its specifications are exactly what I wanted: a good processor, a lot of ram, decent battery runtime, microSD slot and even Ant+ support (for heart rate monitors etc.).I especially like the feeling that everything is well thought through, for instance the charging dock, to preserve the water protection of the USB port.Actually I planned to install a different system (CyanogenMod) on it directly, but I gave the Sony firmware a chance and even like it so much, that I'm going to stick with it for now.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Gabi", "ReviewID": "R2E2FPYZP4WJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, stylish, fast, great pictures under water. the apps are great.

Held \"Bob H\"", "ReviewID": "R2V3O1WCZMX36C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came with ICS out of the box, but needed latest update which it auto acquired via wifi.  Be sure you do a HARD RESET (Factory) after installing the update to get rid of the T-Mobile Mobile Network setting.  It will cause you problems on AT&T; with tethering assuming you have that provisioned on your plan (confirmed bug by Sony).Then the phone defaults for mobile networks are the wap.cingular APN  BUT ... If you go into settings and have it 'load carrier' settings you get the phone APN.  BUT ... it won't work (can't use phone APN) unless you have your Acro S provisioned by AT&T; as an iPhone device.  You might need an iPhone IMEI to do this.  It makes a huge difference using the phone APN vs. wap.cingular in speed.  I regularly see 5 Mbps during the day and have had 7-8 Mbps late evening.  Only got 2-3 Mbps (on average) using wap.cingular lucky to see 4 Mbps at night.My phone shows in my AT&T; account settings as:  DataPro 5GB for iPhone 4S Personal Hotspot", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent cell phone", "Author": "castillor", "ReviewID": "R3P9HE8T9NGFDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was made \u200b\u200banxious to get this phone, to open the box and see it I liked its size because it is a cell phone not too big but it is small. The colors in the photos are wooww look surprisingly like the pictures, very sharp and very bright colors. The phone has good signal on calls, I call like call me and hear my cell phone perfect. The battery has an acceptable duration. The operating system is android is switched on upgrading to a new version. Let's see how it goes behaving the phone over time.

It can handle whatever I throw at it. Good reception and call quality. Music playback quality is excellent, even over Bluetooth. Nice camera for a smartphone. The screen is very clear, but it is LED and not AMOLED if that is what you're after. Jelly Bean update is coming soon, hopefully Sony won't mess it up. Sony integration with Android is not intrusive, which I like. There are some useful apps bundled with the phone but nothing super exciting. Walkman music player is good. May be the phone is a little bulky for some but I have no issues with that, and it is water proof. Included charging dock is a nice touch. Uses standard size Sim cards, can be more convenient in some cases.Some complaints:- smallish camera/power/volume buttons that can be difficult to operate- soft buttons take some getting used to, it's very easy to hit Home instead of the space key when typing in portrait mode which hides the app, annoying- one of the reasons I got this phone was the microSD support, however I'm not having much luck with it. I have 2 SanDisk cards one 64Gb and second is 16Gb, both would randomly unmount and/or generate write errors if saving photos to them. Yes I know 64Gb is not officially supported, but the 16Gb is, I don't exclude the possibility that the card is the culprit but it passes all read/write tests on my PC.- the body of the phone is not that drop proof, make sure to buy a protective case, speaking from experience, the phone took a light 1ft drop to a hard surface and sustained noticeable damage.- the screen is glass but has a factory-installed plastic shatter film that scratches easily, so you'll want to install a screen protector from day one.- aftermarket accessories for this phone are hard to find- unable to use the supplied charging dock when the phone is in a protective caseIf you're after a plastic protective jacket for this phone and don't plan to switch the Sim and microSD cards often I highly recommend the \"Melkco Poly Jacket TPU Case for Sony Xperia Acro S\". Very good quality and tight fit. What makes it especially good is that the plastic is nicely trimmed around the power/volume/camera buttons which makes it much easier to operate them. You may have to order it from outside the US. I had mine shipped from Hong Kong for $15 total.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent device", "Author": "geek451", "ReviewID": "R2AETZYA7NCAUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this device primarily as a replacement for my subsidized Motorola Droid 2 Global.  That device is off contract this month, and was looking for an unlocked GSM-Based device that I could run on Straighttalk or similar service in the US.  Important features for me were as follows:Unlocked GSM serviceUnlockable bootloader for potential customizationUSB OTGHigh quality displayHigh quality cameraBattery lifeSome sense of ruggednessI would say that it has lived up to my expectations thus far.  I love the Camera.  With average use, I am getting a bit more than a day out of the battery.  Sony needs to be commended on their approach to open development platforms.  They did provide the unlock code for the boot loader within the hour I requested it.  The skin they provide to the Android OS is lightweight by default.  While some feel the specs of this device are a bit behind, it has handled anything I have thrown at it.  The software runs well and I am please with the performance.  No lag or general slowdowns observed yet.While I like the device, it may not be for everyone.  I have larger hands and some people may feel the device it a little thicker.  I think that mostly has to do with IP57 water proof rating.  One complaint that I would have is that the waterproof doors do get in the way and are a tad annoying for any wireless peripherals, including headphones.  Luckily I have a nice bluetooth stereo headset.  Another item which could be considered a con, is that the volume rocker is lower than it might otherwise be.Everyone should also be aware that this phone is not yet compatible with TMobile's (or there MVNO's) 3G networks in most US locales.  I hear that T Mobile is in the process of migrating their 3G HSPA networks to the standard frequencies this device supports within the year.  Otherwise you would be stuck to 2G rates for data.Overall I would recommend this device to most people.  It has a premium feel and feature-set without the price tag of a premium unlocked device.  Between the display, camera, and what this device can save me a month (prepaid services  around $50/Month).  It will pay for itself rather quickly.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0093HKPRY"}}
