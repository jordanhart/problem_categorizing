{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not a NEW Phone", "Author": "IzziB99", "ReviewID": "RDGLZPH8OE598", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was advertised as a NEW phone but it's not, and the supposedly NEW battery is useless also. I had to use the battery and cord from my old RAZR to charge it up because the ones in the box did not work. Also the phone was full of pictures of people's cats and dorm rooms saved in 2008. I'm very dissapointed because I paid for a new phone and got a used or refurbished one. I love the RAZR phone itself because it's a really good product but I don't feel that I got what I paid for. Also by the time I found the pictures and figured it out, it was too late to return it because this dealer only accepts returns within 7 days! I will never buy anything electronic from Amazon again.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT a quad-band phone", "Author": "A.

Not sure who is at fault here, but this is annoying.  I use AT&T; and I'm not getting 3G coverage in my house (which I normally do).TigerDirect's website has a clear listing of features.  So I'm not sure who fudged the description here.  To top it off TigerDirect is reselling from another company called [...].  Let's see how the RMA process goes.The phone is good, everything came shipped nicely and timely.  It would work well on T-Mobile's network.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "awsome razr", "Author": "Amanda Pace \"amanda pace\"", "ReviewID": "R3PMLR9Y1F2G6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't purchase my razr v3xx from here but rather from a pawn shop. Its awsome, I have had no problems with it at all.  I had a regular v3 a couple years back and did not realize when i purchased this one, it was an upgraded razr.  I was very happy.  I switched from my LG shine to the razr v3xx and I am very impressed.  It has the same exact features and then some than my shine and the screen is longer and wider.  The colors are brighter as well and my lg shine is brand new well 8 months old.  I like the rzr a lot better as far as the buttons and resolution colors.  Much sharper.  The shine is really nice but too bulky for me and i dont like the sliding issue with it.  I drop it a lot so the razr is much better for me.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Refurb sold as brand new", "Author": "JTA", "ReviewID": "RB4PT2HAU3RRV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Motorola Razor is a great phone. Have had four of them. Can't buy anywhere but Amazon. Bought one in Dec to replace a tired one from March 2009. Everything was great until, while walking on the beach, got hit with a small wave!!!!! Phone got a little wet, screen never came back. Ordered the same phone agin from Amazon, different supplier. Was defective, things missing, feel it was refurbished sold as brand new. Returned within 30 days and a stand up supplier(Brown Box) issued a credit plus the shipping. Now bought a LG Smart Phone which has shown me to be partly stupid!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waste of time", "Author": "Luis Acevedo", "ReviewID": "R350FA0W1OWB3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "item didnt arrive on time. phone did look new but didnt work how i expected it to. phone kept on freezing and turning off. tried removing battery to reset it but problem continued.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "crappy phone!", "Author": "WALDEMAR ROBERTO RUZISCKA", "ReviewID": "R3ZPRQCJLQ1JU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "at the beggining it worked fine but after 17 months of use it started do drain the batteries power in one single 30 sec use.
