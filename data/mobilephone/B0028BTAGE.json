{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A brilliant phone for music... if not lagging a little phone wise", "Author": "Raoul Yeates \"MISH\"", "ReviewID": "R2GJ16ON3UJDPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The 395 is for all intents and purposes a walkman... I had the opportunity to use this phone for a week and within that time found things likable and some not. Firstly, the good stuff... This phone is LOUD! compared to other walkman \"esque\" phones sone produces, this phone is capable of blasting music at literally half the level of the others and still is louder. The slide system is quite easy to open close... as well as carrying the basics everybody who wish for music to have in a walkman phone... bluetooth, m2 memory card, headphones etc. Call quality is pretty good and that volume helps a lot.Now the not so good news... The first thing you'll realize is just how smooth this phone is... it doesn't inspire confidence it'll stay in your hand... not to mention the phone is a small phone so in large hands like mine it tended to feel like it'll fall out. Also the keypad though nice to look at for its smoothness isn't the best thing for text messaging people... also not an advantage with big hands. Sony designed this phone to be more basically a music phone than feature ridden and you will find that out when trying to download themes... these isn't any, or at least I was unable to... doing some digging it seems that many others were unable to do so as well. Also, Sony Ericsson was a bit stingy with the pixel quality of the screen... it really isn't the sharpest LCD to look at and at 176 x 220 sizes, you'll feel like you were watching an old Motorola v600 rather than a New Sony Ericsson w395. The menus are all basic, and some of the commands are a little dull. The camera isn't the best quality at 2mp, but it does its job.All in all, if you are looking for a phone in which music is your priority, and not so much the screen quality and features, then buy this phone without hesitation... you'll thank yourself for doing so. But if you are like me who needs a slightly bigger phone and more image quality and features phone wise, then try another in the walkman range... the w760i and w705a are good alternatives in that sense.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phone crashes when playing music", "Author": "Vinicius C. Brito", "ReviewID": "R3GKJ2S4FTFCRY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a good phone, but you won't be able to use its great speakers. Sometimes it plays 2 songs then crashes, sometimes 4 songs then crashes... but it's very consistent in crashing. Reseting it won't help and there's no firmware update available for this phone. Piece of crap. You can text and call people, though..", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "First cell phone purchased on Amazon", "Author": "Sudhin", "ReviewID": "R244POFCCEKVAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the fist time I purchased on Amazon.com.
