{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Working Man's Phone", "Author": "Jburk", "ReviewID": "R3RGHL8AE5A617", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the Motorola Tundra because of my fascination with the survivability of my possessions. I could make no sense in purchasing pricey phones that require extensive plans to function properly which are prone to breaking. I wanted to buy something that could weather Hurricane Katrina after dropping it off the top of hotel with the relative functionality of new-age phones. I got mixed results.This phone is in no way for the technologically savvy type of person. In the way of technology the Tundra sticks to the basics with Stone Age internet, a pixilated camera, slow texting, and no fun things you can do with it to pass the time. What it does promise is great reception resulting in very few dropped calls, above average battery life, and large buttons that are easily navigated even with a gloved hand. Where the Tundra's strength is just that, it's strength.The Tundra is unmistakably a working man's phone with its steel gray, hard plastics surrounded by the studded rubber exterior. I feel I have tested, intentionally and unintentionally, its durability to near maximum. From party tricks when I overhand threw it at a wall to accidentally filling its joints with sand to pouring water over it when it was closed the Tundra had confirmed time and time again its rugged boasts. This is not to say the Tundra will look brand new forever, but rather it will do its job even after much neglect and abuse. My only suggestion is to look up the difference between waterproof and water resistant because it is not the former.It is evident just by looking at it who this phone is for and who it is not for. If you are someone who is tired of dropped calls or bumping your phone the wrong way and shattering the screen then this phone is for you. If you enjoy reading emails, playing games, and having full blown conversations via text message then you really want to look for something else. If you come to the conclusion that it is right for you I can promise you will not regret toting around your cellular humvee.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "modern bigamy ;-)", "Author": "Patrick Wilmes \"ReverendEvil\"", "ReviewID": "R2LEM3FME7ET6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it has been a long wait until my tundra(s) arrived over here in Germany, but it was worth waiting!to be honest, I am the kind of guy who needs a phone to write mails, SMS and all kinds of long texts while I am underway.During the last 12 months I had several \"typewriters\" that were quite nice, including Nokia's E5, HTC Mozart, BlackBerry Bold and recently the Nokia E7, which is the best writing device, but what they all had in common was the fact (imo) that they all have poor speech and talking quality. Don't get me wrong, I love all of those phones, but when it comes to the simple phonecall, they all drop the ball. Bad voice quality, and even worse coverage and signal strengh.Since I like the \"old\" clamshell design (my second mobilde was the v.3690), I was always thinking about getting one of these again, just for old time sake but could't really decide.After having seen the \"Tundra\" on a few episodes of \"NCIS\" I got curious and gathered some information and yes, ordered one.and to be honest:***the Motorola va76r is by far the best mobile phone for making phone calls, talking and just speaking.The quality of sound is perfect, voices are cristal clear and I often forget that I am on my cellphone, since it sounds even better than my Siemens Gigaset cordless DECT Phone! (no kidding!)***a little con point on my list is just this one that it is nearly impossible to hold the phone between Your head and Your shoulder (e.g. while writing something down or grabbing something with both hands), but it's fine to me!another point is of course the very limited or lets say constrained ways of convenient writing.so what I decided to do is: I ordered an combi-SIM from T-Mobile (Germany), and know am carrying my Nokia E7 and my Motorola Tundra.At first it took some time getting used to it, but I consider it as one of the best ways to get the best of both worlds! :-)So my recommendation, if You don't need mobile internet or are dependend on a \"typewriting\" cellphone with a display as large as an iMac, if You are just looking for a plain and simple cellphone with an extraordinary voice quality, a phone that can even take a drop, a punch and other hardknocks, then grab one as long as they are still available.Definitely one of my best decisions when it comes to Cellphones....and Yes, it even works over here in Germany ;-)", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone!", "Author": "Fireman", "ReviewID": "RAASKSUD4Q6UA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, I love this phone!  It gets GREAT reception, the speaker phone is just as good as using the phone normally.

Wait a minute, that's not always a good thing!  OOPS!  Hopefully she won't read this!  The camera is not as bad as some of these other reviews say, at least I'm happy with it.  your opinion may vary.  I do miss the QWERTY keyboard, but at least this phone works and no more butt dialing!  All the AT&T; listings in the address book are a pain, but you do learn to get used to working around them.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good phone, but not for texting.", "Author": "K. O'Connor", "ReviewID": "R1TGNBF4Q2VGSU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I sought out a phone that was more function than fashion because I have a talent for dropping, washing and displacing my phone in the oddest of locations.  And I absolutely didn't see the sense of carrying a computer with frivolous apps around- for which I'd pay plenty - when I had everything I needed at home.  What I wanted was a sturdy, shock resistant phone that received great reception.That's what I found with the Tundra from Motorola.  The keys, which are large enough to be comfortable but not as large as a Jitterbug, are protected from the front of the case.  Having already tested some of its claims, I find it sturdy and small enough to throw in your pocket when need be.  Some people complain about the 3/4\" antenna, but it's never bothered me at all and lend itself to calls with clarity and a noise dampener.The phone is browser-ready for the internet, but I don't use it, so I can't comment on that.  The camera is at the low end of the spectrum and is more an \"in a pinch\" feature than a quality accessory.  And texting... This is where I have my only gripe.  I knew before I purchased it that it wasn't designed for text messaging and I wasn't bothered because I didn't text as a rule.  However, I didn't count on the frequency with which everyone I know would be texting me.  The Tundra is absolutely, 100% not the phone for you if you text a lot.  It can be done, but it's a letter-by-letter process, and the anticipatory library it supplies is absurd.  If I type the letters \"the,\" rather that offer \"there\" or \"they'll,\" if offers something like \"therapy\" or \"theatrical.\"That said, the Tundra plays on its strengths in the areas advertised.  As a utility phone with the toughness to back it up and good call quality, you can't go wrong.(And AT&T;, get over yourselves.  No one needs 7 irremovable AT&T; numbers programmed in before all other contacts.  At least you could put them in one folder or something.)", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I guess \"unlocked\" means \"used\"", "Author": "E. Cutler", "ReviewID": "R2MSRIAJOMD2DM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My only gripe is that the phone isn't new.  It looks good (no scratches, etc.) but it arrived full of the previous owner's music and Christmas pictures.  Also, while the manual advises using only Motorola brand batteries, the battery wasn't a Motorola.  This worries me because I have had very bad luck with aftermarket cell phone batteries.That said, I realy like this phone.  Having had quite enough of cell phones that are the size of my thumb, I was relieved to find that it has some \"heft\" and the keys are easy to use. The rubbery case won't let it fall out of my pocket.  Voice quality is the best I have ever heard.  I wasn't expecting the loudspeaker to be so good. You can just lay it on your desk and play music while you work. Don't laugh - you really can!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, durable, phone", "Author": "Melissa Bruce", "ReviewID": "R2O2M2Z5DHJJ3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband is a contractor and needed a phone which was durable, got great reception, and had good sound. After checking out the written and video reviews (search YouTube for these), we went with the Tundra. He's had it for several months now and is very happy with it. The durability is as-advertised - he actually dropped it off a roof onto a concrete patio with no noticeable damage to the phone. It also takes decent pictures when he doesn't have a camera with him, and downloading them to his laptop is a snap (plug it in, drag & drop). Highly recommend it.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola Tundra & Advantage Wireless", "Author": "Oliver Klozeoff", "ReviewID": "R3Q6M2V7YGZ0C5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in an area where Alltel was purchased by At & T and we had to convert to a new cell phone system.  I have always been used to Motorola products and have a familiarity with their software.  I am in construction and for years used a Motorola E815 (incredible phone) but could no longer use it as it wouldn't accomodate a SIM card.  Our local AT & T facility didn't handle the Motorola Tundra or the Sanyo Tahoe so I purchased a Samsung Rugby.  This was not a good phone for me.  Not a user friendly phone, couldn't hear and many of the programming functions are controlled by two push buttons on the side of the phone . . .every time I would answer the phone, I'd change some or several programming functions.  Dropped the phone alot . . .it was plenty tough enough but overall, I was very disappointed and frustrated.  I read the reviews on the Tundra and mostly it was equal to or better than the Samsung Rugby with the major complaint being that the flip hinge fails alot.  I purchased one from Advantage Wireless off of Amazon.com.  I had a few minor problems with the phone . . .I emailed Advantage Wireless and they immediately sent me a new phone and a prepaid label to return the other phone (excellent service).  For me, the Tundra is a much, much better and user friendly phone.  It is thicker and a little heavier than the Rugby, but I like that.  The programming features are much easier (due to my familiarity to Motorola Software?)  The reception is excellent, you can hear much better on this phone than the Rugby.  It's much easier to plug into a charger (from the bottom instead of the side).  Some have complained about the small antenna but it's perfect for me as the phone fits very securely in my belt holster and I use the antenna to get the phone out.  This phone also texts much easier than the Rugby.  I've dropped it hard several times and it's tough. If you like Motorola products and need a military issue phone for simplicity, toughness, long battery life and good reception . . .this may be the phone for you.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product for A Great Proce!!!", "Author": "John Vasquez", "ReviewID": "RFR0SDP5PSIZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a refurbished Motorola Tundra VA76r from Great Value Cellular because I did not want to pay almost $250.00 for a new one.

What you don't get with these phones is any sense of security. You can't drop them, you can't use them in the rain, you can't put something heavy on them, you can't thrown them to your friend, you can't use them in any non-luxurious environment.

I am kind of rough on phones because of my job, and this one is one tough phone! I have heard complaints from others about the antenna that sticks out of the top about 3/4 of an inch, but it seems like it is a small thing to get the reception and clarity most of us want from our phones.

I wanted to find a phone that could handle being caught in a rainstorm or at least an amusement park water ride, but didn't want to spend the big bucks for a SONIM phone.Compared to the old RAZR, the voice quality, both with and without the speakerpohone function, was far better than the old RAZR.Per Motorola, this phone was supposed to be water resistant. To that end, the USB charging port, battery cover, keypad, and external buttons are all sealed. However, as I learned to my chagrin when water splashed onto the phone, the upper half of the phone where the output speaker and speakerphone microphone are located, as well as the exterior and interior display screens, are definitely NOT water resistant. It took 3 days in a plastic bag with dried rice (as a desiccant) sitting inside a sunny window in order to get rid of the moisture from the displays. Fortunately, the phone appears none the worse.In looking at some Motorola discussion boards  [...]it would appear that Motorola is aware of this.Since Motorola no longer makes this phone (does not list it among the phones you can buy, per their website), I am wondering if this was one factor in their decision.This weakness is the only complaint/disappointment I have for this phone (and I don't mind the size or weight).", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "At least two tin cans and string don't have the horrid screeching noise Tundra has", "Author": "K.

This was Motorola's attempt to port a Linux-OS to a ruggedized flip-phone format. The first phone I received had a screen defect, so I replaced it. The second phone appeared fine for a few days and then promptly started to die, here are the various problems:- Phone would spontaneously dial keys, even on a call (usually it would dial just ######, but this made using voicemail or other services impossible and made conversations impossible). Saw a tech, no stuck keys, software issue.- Battery would last 15 minutes. Got new battery, same issue. Motorola does SW update, fixed. Week later, same issue.- Trying to take off battery cover nearly broke phone. Yes, I know it is a rugged phone, but it does have to be serviceable, right?- Phone was made in the era of iPhone. Apps were all horrible. AT&T; would give you a driving app for $15 a month, XM would give radio for $10 a month, browser was a small screen WAP browser. No pro email like Blackberry connect or Exchange Activesync at all.Alright, enough whining. What was good:- Reception.

The reviews on different Tech review websites said that this phone had by far the best sound of any AT&T; compatible phone. I was tired of garbled sound and thought it would be worth the money.

None of the phones I have heard, especially the smartphones have this quality.  Signal picking; Latest smart phones no match for this.

I still have this phone unlocked and will use it when need arises.U should buy this if your objective is just talking and NOTHING else, no texting, internet, calendar, fancy ringtones and all the teenager crazy stuff.

They quickly replaced the first cell phone we received and when the second had the same problems, quickly refunded our purchase price upon return of the phone.

Labeled water resistant but as a dishwasher in a restaurant at the time I sat it away from me but just a couple drops got on the screen and then problems started happening quickly. Hinge slowly worked it's way loose and never stayed fully shut so it could open and shut itself on incoming calls, cable strips in the hinge for the camera came loose and the camera only worked when i opened at an exact angle while closing the flip; camera didn't even work when it was closed. Loud speaker and ear speaker went out few months afterwards do to high moisture in the air and the broken hinge.. Works great and is very dependable for the first month and then after that it all depends on how YOU take care of it.Hope this review helps you with your decisions, I'm not aiming to steer you away from choosing this phone but this was MY experience with the Motorola Tundra.

We use a java application & besides the Nextel handsets, it only works on a few other ruggedized phones and that was our primary concern (our drivers are out in the weather & are hard on handsets).  We decided on AT&T; due to their promised ability to handle PTT address book sync feature which has not worked on Nextel for a while.  Handsets work well in general, but about 5% either broke due to drops with the hinge open or other hinge related issues in the first 6 months.  PTT sometimes does not work well - sound is muddy, so driver has to place a call instead which takes longer (this is probably an AT&T; issue).  PTT address book sync on AT&T; did not work well.  Some phones get the updated info, some do not.  No way to tell from their application & AT&T; website the address book gets sent from is run by a third party, so finger pointing ensues.  Ruggedized handset is OK, but not as good as Nextel.  This handset has GPS, but it does not keep track of GPS satellites well (about 85-90% is all).  When we grab the coordinates of the handset to a web app we use, the data may show it as being hundreds to thousands of miles off from their actual location (the handset software doesn't do any error checking on GPS - I have an iPhone 3GS & it may lose GPS signal, but apparently it checks to be sure that its' data isn't way off from the last satellite \"fix\" so doesn't exhibit this anomaly).", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tundrastruck!!", "Author": "PigPen", "ReviewID": "R2ORFR92U497IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work in construction, with all the associated grit and grime......this Tundra takes the dirt and knocking about that comes with that.
