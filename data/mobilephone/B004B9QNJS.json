I'm very glad I did. This phone is intelligently designed, versatile, has a lot of memory, and very few cons. The display is big, bright and crystal clear. I have froyo (2.2) which seems to have resolved a number of problems earlier versions had.One bit of advice: before you download any app or upgrade, read the customer comments. They will usually tell you better than anything else whether that particular app or upgrade is a good one. Some upgrades only install more advertising. It's also a good idea to read permissions.A lot of people have battery drain issues with this phone. Disabling Background Data under Settings/Accounts and sync seems to help with this problem.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "GPS does not work, Camera is meh, Samsung support is poor", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "R1GXH4AFVC6R85", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I actually purchased this product when it wasn't so old. A recent problem with my phone has made me decide on writing this review on the Samsung Captivate. The phone isn't too bad as it was pretty quick to run everything, took very nice video, and made and received calls perfectly well. The problem with this phone is that there are a few problems which absolutely no phone should ever have to deal with and Samsung has a history of insulting users of this phone for over a year. As for the problems, let's begin.The BIGGEST problem for me is the fact that the GPS does not work. A few people claim it has worked for them, but take a look at the android forums and you'll see customer after customer complain that their GPS has never worked. When I originally purchased this phone, the GPS would take a minute to triangulate my position. Sure this would be okay if it actually kept that triangulation. However, this phone will continuously drop the GPS signal. At times it would put me 10 miles away from where I actually was. It has become apparent that Samsung released this phone knowing that the GPS did not work. They promised updates for many months. When they did finally release the heralded 'gps fix', it turns out the update never actually fixed the GPS and Samsung simply stated \"it will be in the next update\".The second problem was the operating system updates. Samsung refused to offer the latest versions of the Android OS for the Captivate. The Captivate was one of the premiere smartphones; a smartphone that people paid hundreds of dollars for. So while other companies (and in fact, other Samsung phones) received the Froyo and eventually, the Gingerbread and Honeycomb updates, the Captivate was stuck with Eclair. I believe only in the past few weeks was the Captivate updated to Gingerbread and it was a year after Froyo came out that Samsung passed it on.The third, albeit not too important problem is the camera. To be blunt, it's pretty crumby. There is no flash and the quality is lacking. Not too important as it is a cell phone, but surely Samsung could have done better on a $500 product.To see other problems, simply check out the android forums. There are a lot of problems with this phone that should never have occurred. There is nothing overwhelmingly horrible about this phone, but the fact that there are problems which no modern phone should have is beyond excusable. This is my reason for giving it 1 star as no one should bother to buy a phone that the manufacturer never bothered to polish up and support.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very GOOD!", "Author": "Gio", "ReviewID": "R2776ZFPG9YST1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is really the best mobile I've ever had.It has all the modern functions and runs great, smooth, beautiful..Though AT&T; is really ruining it with all the bloatware and stuff..Runs flawlessly on ECLAIR (Android 2.1).

I wont talk about it much because there are excellent reviews about it here... but I'll say good things and bad ones:1) GOOD ONES: The 4 inch AMOLED screen is far up one of the best of the market! android system works great! 16 Gb of memory that ensures you of thousands of apps to download! and I actually got the cell phone UNLOCKED, ROOTED and upgraded to Android Gingerbread 2.3.3!!!

No flash with the camera...Excellent cell phone for new android users like me... very accessible price vs. other cell phones on the market (Especialmente si usan CADIVI!! jajaja) and it was shipped two days after I bought it via UPS!! it arrived like 3 days before the shipping estimate!!

And this time its not an Apple:-)", "Author": "Prash Chopra \"Prash\"", "ReviewID": "R23MOBUVJR8RFH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's a minimalist who jumped from a bulky Sprint phone to the magical Motorola Razr and then wooed by the half bit Apple. My first Smart Phone was an iPhone 3GS, and then a natural upgrade to an iPhone 4 (not the S). And to be direct: I would never have know this beauty (Captivate/Android) existed had I never sought some 'free' air (open source platforms).It does what you expect: whether you go by specs (1 GHz CPU, a GPU core, AMOLED hi res screen, a sleek design that stands out..), by user experience (bright clear icons, fast response), or by developer satiety (more control over the software/feature, freedom to install OS versions - supported or custom).In objectivity, the iPhones have always set the bar too high in user experience and the quality of both hardware and the software. So I am not a be-grudged Apple departee - in fact I keep looking for features I liked from iPhone on the Android. However, I have been very positively impressed by what the Captivate (with Android 2.2) offered right away.I took one star off the rating, because be all the great that it is, Android on this cool piece of hardware still is an edgy phone mostly for the geeky ones. There are things you can tweak, software you can write yourself, that opens a 4th world of creativity. However, not everyone may want to do that and may want to trust a closed-form Apple-is solution that just works right out of the box - the same way - everyday.And now to my opinion on an iPhone v/s an Android smartphone (specifically the Captivate):An iPhone will be smarter than you are, eventually making you a dumb-er user (since it will take away most of the thinking away from the user, really - they are SO GOOD with UI:-), whileAn Android phone (esp Captivate), though not as smart a phone as an iPhone4, gives a heaven full of creativity, blissful moments of tweaking the SW, settings, and Apps, and in my opinions makes you a smart-er user.So depending upon your taste, if you like your smartness replaced reliably, you may like the closed-environment iPhones. However, if you want a device that augments your intelligence, try out the community-spirited Android phones like the Captivate - you might just start enjoying enabling phones all over again:-)[Updated 3.01.2012] A word of caution for 11th St Wireless customers. I paid $19 more from them hoping they will ship me a genuine phone. The box was genuine. The phone is great, I love it. But I think they cheated on the headset. The box says (as it should) that it has a stereo headset. But the one I was shipped in the box (NEW) is *MONO*. It is cheaply made and no Samsung mark on it. In fact it looks NOTHING like the real ones that show in customer pictures above. I contacted 11th St Wireless re: this. They came back and said they sold me ONLY the phone and I should talk to the seller I bought the headset from. WHAT?!? The headset comes WITH THE PHONE in the package, in its box!!! I have requested clarification, pending a negative response I will contact Amazon directly to rate them out negatively. Please everyone BEWARE and be aware of what you are getting in the box!  Still loving the phone though, it has MIUI on it now:-)[Updated 1.30.2012] A word of caution: The first time I bought this item, the seller was OEM Planet. The price looked very competitive. I paid 2 day shipping too. But beware: I had items missing from the box (data cable, CDs, headphones, all missing), and the unit looked used (scratches). 11th wireless was an excellent seller, whom I used upon returning the first item. The second time, I received a box that was more authentic looking, with a real manual in there and the complete kit.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Root and install a ROM!", "Author": "T.

I hands down love the ease of Palm's contacts/datebook/memos. As an on-the-go OS, it was second to none...back then.  With their aging system and poor upgrades, it was time to switch.  I narrowed it down to the Android OS based on the fact that the Palm Datebook software company had released a calendar version compatible on Android.From Android, I researched and felt that the Samsung Captivate was the highest quality product for the value. This is what I have found:  the packaging is minimal, the phone, earphones and charger. There's a small quick start book and that's it which ended up causing problems (more on that later). Phone charged and turned on easy - I was blown away by the AMOLED screen and the graphics capabilities. Crisp, clear - the pixelation quality is amazing which I think Samsung has really worked on to their benefit.The transfer of contacts from the SIM card was simple, though there is no way to delete the contacts from the SIM itself on the Captivate - I ended up copying them into Captivate, taking the SIM out, putting it back into my Centro and deleting it there. The phone itself is easy to use, with clear listening, a plus from the Centro where sound quality was consistently poor.Now for some of the bad stuff: there are NO instructions for how to use the features on the phone. My swype was turned off and only after extensive research was I able to figure out how to turn it on.  Other features are equally a mystery and I spent a whole weekend just trying to find stuff.The original calendar is useless - absolutely none of the ease and organizing capabilities that makes the Palm phones lovely for busy people.  Of course, ATT is terrible and I had to download the sidelong wonder machine app to bypass their no third party apps policy.  Once done, I downloaded Plimical which is comparable but still not as easy as the Palm calendar.Texting is much easier on a QWERTY keyboard (even with swype) and I have learned my lesson - the next phone will have a manual keyboard.Quick take:Graphics/screen: GreatRingtones: Like nonePhone quality: GreatEase of use: FairWifi: GreatCamera: GoodAll in all, I think a decent upgraded smartphone to transition to when you are resistant to change.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung el mejor telefono android que he tenido", "Author": "Jonny Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "RHKSHW92YX7LT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Al recibir el samsung captivate me lleve una grata sorpresa, la pantalla amoled se ve muy bien, el tel\u00e9fono luce muy bien, me gusto el touch wiz con el que viene, no me gusto el que at&t; desabilitara la posibilidad de instalar aplicaciones fuera del market, pero esto quedo solucionado una vez que instale el rom de cyanogenmod 7, ahora uso el android 2.3.4, el tel\u00e9fono funciona muy bien, definitivamente me ha gustado este tel\u00e9fono samsung en especial la posibilidad de actualizar el tel\u00e9fono es algo que estaba buscando, despu\u00e9s de tener 2 tel\u00e9fonos motorola android, me queda claro que no volver\u00e9 a comprar un tel\u00e9fono motorola mas nunca, aunque los tel\u00e9fonos son buenos, motorola tiene una pol\u00edtica especialmente mala en relaci\u00f3n a la actualizaci\u00f3n de los tel\u00e9fonos.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "weak, bad reception", "Author": "Narodi", "ReviewID": "R2FP2ZDY4M7G3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "disclaimer: didn't buy it on amazon and I live in the middle east.CONS:In my country, the reception couldn't be worse with this phone; I don't get many calls and messages even when reception show good ratings.the speaker is very weak during calls (music volume is ok)the gps never locks and i can never use itIt restarts or turns off many times randomlyPROS:looks nicelite weightbuilt quality is goodvery good screenI was very close to smashing it on concrete walls with the frustration it has caused me", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fun in the palm of you hand...

Este vendedor no es confiable para nada!The first product arrived faulty, did not recognize the SIM card, or when he came to recognize the signal after a few minutes it was completely, I made the call and actually told me to return the phone that I replaced them (For a moment I thought excellent ! Sure I'm in Venezuela and told me I have to pay a shipping price considerably, but not lose the entire cost of the phone) did not, They sent back another phone and the first thing I see is that accessories are not new, you could tell it was really used the charger and other accessories were not in the original bag, after all this I thought that because the phone was working, I would not pay attention to the condition of the accessories and began to use. The phone worked properly only 2 months, then started to fail again, until it run out of signal, then a defect in the screen. After this happend I simply change the SIM card to my old Nokia and i had signal again, That was the end of my excellent new Samsung i897 phone, Now is a $ 200 paperweight on my desk.

Last night i tried charging my phone but the phone just would not charge i tried using different power outlets but still the phone would not charge. i connected the data cable to see it there was a problem with the cable itself but when i connected the cable to the computer the phone began charging so the problem is with the AC adapter that the cable connects to. This phone is just three weeks old and i have had so many issues with this phone. A friend of mine has the same phone and he has never had the issues like what i'm experiencing.I purchased this phone from Wireless Experts, Inc but it was fulfilled by amazon.

Its funny that the box included a plastic tray that doesnt even fit the phone. It's also worth mentioning that I bought two of these phones, and the charger was not the same for both (which leads me to think that one of them is not the original charger). Phone came with two small scratches in the back. One of the edges of the screen showed small remains of silicone, which was really weird, and also made me think that the screen was probably replaced in the past.I tried to forget all those things because I really needed the phone at this moment, but my real surprise came when I turned it on and tried to make or receive a call. No sound at all. People cannot hear me, and I cannot hear them.

I like this Captivate variant most because it does have a nicer build and is more durable than other variants.My main reason of writing this review is to praise its audio quality, particularly the headphone's output. The Galaxy S variants (that use the single core Exynos cpu) come with Wolfson DAC, this is a high quality sounding audio chip that is also found in iPhones, except now you get the same good sound quality with the freedom of Android. The bonus side to this is you get a microSD slot, so you have plenty of space to load your lossless music files that otherwise wouldn't even fit in most other phones. I haven't heard an Android phone with as good sound quality. The closest one is the Samsung Galaxy S3 international version (not the US carrier locked versions), which also have Wolfson DAC, but right now not as optimized by 'third party developers' to reach its full potential, and of course it does cost more and Samsung build quality has gone much down hill since this Galaxy S.This device is quite versatile in the software department as well, if you do a bit of research you can install the latest version of Android to it with some work and patience. There is plenty of life left for this little device and its durability is an added benefit.Another good thing about it is with an unlocked version, you can use it on T-Mobile and get 3G, since T-Mobile is beginning to support the 1900MHz band which this device support.Cons:-lack of front camera, some apps still let you do video chat with the rear camera though-no camera LED (not for taking photo, but would've been convenient to use as flashlight and monitor heart rates)-this is a well known fact, Galaxy S units for the majority have very poor and unreliable GPS performance (I owned more than half a dozen units, I know.)-take good care of the microUSB port, it is not the most durable, fortunately there are external battery chargers", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not that great", "Author": "Jodie Kinney", "ReviewID": "RU5ILCT1KBZAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was expecting more since i had heard so much about this phone but it wasn't as quick as i thought it would be.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchased UNLOCKED Captivate for T-mobile plan", "Author": "Ambar", "ReviewID": "R2UGG00AIPK0PY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this came SUPER fast...

The camera  has 5 mega pixels and has many shooting modes and it takes great pictures the auto focus is extremely good zoom could be better but still it shoots great crisp photos the phone also has a great screen very bright but battery consuming. One of the biggest cons would be the processor I think the phone is a bit too slow for some apps and androids operating system doesn't help it leaves programs on the background running and makes the phone crash so you need to download a app called system that lets you manage your apps and se your cpu, ram memory, cpu clock and many other useful things. This app helps a lot but still its not the best because no matter what I did I could not play GTA on my phone with out some lag so this is not a phone for those people who like to play on their phones but every thing else It does a great job. Camera, Gps Google voice the screen are all pros to the phone the cons would be the battery processor and the charging input is kind of annoying up there.oh and don't buy from Sold by: Young Kimbrough (seller profile)the package came all wrapped with paper and it wasn't the original box it was a crappy Chinese box that said Samsung.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good starter smart phone", "Author": "Seyolai", "ReviewID": "R3T40I5LBHVCSK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I didn't want an iPhone or a hulking large phone so I chose this as my first Android/smartphone.

The slot simply was not flush with the outer casing, so my cable would not fully plug into it. I actually modded my old Samsung data cable to fit the slot.

It comes with a single processor, it has no camera flash (led) and no front camera either. I also have to mention that GPS sucks (I don't use it much, then this is not that important to me). However, the vibrant colors on display are unique. It's slim and comfortable.I like the phone as it is, despite of not being the fastest one I could get. It's an old phone now and it lags with new apps available.

From all of these 3 parties, I received nothing but excuses about why they \"could not\" stand behind their product either through a refund or a replacement. Samsung told me to send the phone in for a repair! I did not buy a USED phone, just to send in the device to be repaired. By BLUTEKUSA, BUY.COM was well aware of the fraud committed on its website. Buy.com did nothing about it. The phone's battery also begin to OVERHEAT and the phone kept suddenly SHUTTING OFF! The product was useless! The customer service from all 3 parties was POOR!!!!
