{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sensation-al!", "Author": "Chronic242", "ReviewID": "R3NI64JOU8BIWG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I would like to mention that I purchased the unlocked version because I do not live in the U.S. and I do not use any of the carriers available there (T-mobile, AT&T;, etc), and regardless the service is GREAT! It is not surprising to me though. I pretty much expected it, considering the fact that I owned a HTC Touch Pro 2, and the service was awesome as well. My previous LG  viewty phone would hardly ever get me through to the end of a call, I almost always had dropped calls with it. I would also like to mention that I also owned two nokias, a samsung, and a motorola. NONE can compare to my HTC Sensation. I feel rich just holding it and the HTC sense feature is so fun and efficient!My Pros:-Awesome GPS and Navigation system-The clarity of the 8 MP camera is amazing, and its autofocus is to die for, it is so precise-The internet speed is great!-The vibrant screen!-ANDROID OS is a plus!-The blinking light to let me know I have a missed call, a new facebook message, and/or a new chat message-The fact that I can incorporate ALL my emails into one window, and choose a default email address from which I can reply to all emails- It just has so many options for me, expecially when it comes to editing files and I feel as if it is so easy to use for anyone that is not really tech-savvy.- Honestly though, hands down, best phone ever!!! All my previous phones have either broken, and got tired of me over-using them, with this one, so far so good.My Cons:- The Battery Life can go by really quickly. I charged twice already for the day. I am a heavy user though, I check emails, and use social networks as well as take pictures/videos, edit work files and listen to the radio. I need to invest in a car charger.- I wish there was a camera button on the side of the phone, so that one click and bam, I can take a picture. But it is not a major deal, and I don't really miss it as much. I guess when you're used to something, you tend to miss it for a while. with this phone, I have to click unlock, and drag and drop, then VOILA, the camera is on. A few extra steps that I feel might make me lose my camera moment. I don't know, I am still on the fence with this one.- The memory... It comes with an SD card, but when there are no apps running, I have 467MB of used space and 91MB of free space, and I panic, because I need space to store my work documents, so again, I have to invest in some storage for this baby.Regardless of my cons, I love this phone, and I am glad I got it. I was scared to purchase a phone that did not have a physical keyboard, this is my phone FULL touch screen phone, and it was a choice between HTC desire Z and this, and the keyboard is so accurate, even with me typing fast, so no regrets. Love it!", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "The HTC Sensation is great phone!", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R291TQF7C6JI4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the HTC Sensation for about 3 months now, and I find the quality of the phone to be excellent in these main areas:  audio - I can be heard clearly even outside on the street with extensive background noise and I can hear the other person just as well; display - this phone has one of the largest displays I've seen in phones, it's great for movies or video games; the visuals on the phone are clear and sharp, the colors are rich and are accurate to the subject.  This phone has an extensive feature set and you can customize almost everything on it, I've just scratched the surface of its many features.  The 8 mp camera feature is excellent, it takes pictures that are true to the subject, I haven't had a problem like red eye or shifting of the colors in my pictures.This phone has extensive Internet apps, my Internet connection has been really fast and the built-in browser works extremely well.  I've been able to surf the Web, use the map application successfully as a GPS to be able to tell which way to travel when going to a destination, and I find this particular feature to be helpful in locating where you are and the streets around you.  In addition, it's a handy tool to have when you're trying to locate stores and places to eat.However, you should be aware that if you use the phone extensively for Internet applications and for numerous voice calls, you will drain the battery and will have to charge it very often, possibly daily.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "eB", "ReviewID": "R3DVAUYL47S0SE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little difficult to set up, otherwise the processer is super fast.

It work well and offers solutions to most if not all the questions that the end user may have. There is one major problem though and that has to do with the battery life. It is atrocious. Something needs to be done about this. The battery barely lasts for eight hours and that is with minimal use. If this is corrected then it would be the very best.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPhone vs. Android", "Author": "Moe", "ReviewID": "R20J03EUX7DRS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the amazon tradition of writing a long essay/short novel to review a product, scroll down to the last paragraph if you are interested in the short version of what i have to say. The following is an introduction to why I bought the HTC Sensation in the first place.Since 2009 I was the proud owner of an iPhone that came as a substitution for my ever-growing need for PDAs (I don't remember how I had any work done before iMates and Palm Pilots). After I got to learn my way around an iPhone it became impossible for me to imagine functioning normally through a whole day without the frequent click on the home button and the scroll to unlock. I trust most readers here are familiar with the \"at-home\" feeling of that. Hold on, this is a review of HTC Sensation not an iPhone so keep reading. iPhones introduced me to a whole new world of apps that I didn't think doable and that made life a little bit easier after every \"buy this app\" click. I was really satisfied. Of course there was the not-so-uncommon occurrence of a complete freeze of the interface and the battery that needed charging every two hours and the awful quality of the headsets and USB cables.On March 2011, I was bored to tears in an international transit passenger lounge somewhere (I spend 10 months a year flying international), I stop at the little duty free electronic store and have a chat with the attendant. Up till this point, I had a completely functional iPhone, mind you. To save you all the technical mumbo-jumbo, the HTC sensation had 4G capabilities and it works on all major cellular carriers bands (unlike iPhone that wouldn't even get lousy 3G on t-mobile due to incompatibility).So, I bought it solely for the fact that I could connect to 4G (which, for those of you who have never connected to the net via 4G, makes 3G feels like an old fashion dial-up connection and good old 2G Edge is like holding two cups tied with a tight rope).During the following 2 weeks I ran experiments with my iPhone and HTC, both were working on the same carrier (t-mobile, U.S.) and suffices to say the iPhone has \"accidentally\" dropped on the ground and shattered.Now, to summerize why I've given this phone 5 stars.I love that the phone never ever stalls.I love that I switch carriers and my phone is always fully responsive and it has all functionalities.I love that I can update the operating system by downloading it on cellular data (4G, 3G or even Edge) and not having to go to a wifi spot with my laptop to spend the next half hour downloading those large apps and and the frequent system update (that's on iPhones, on HTC I had only 1 system update over 10 months).I love the wifi hotspot that allows me to connect to 4G on my Sensation and then browse the Internet on my laptop with a speed that's much better than the average wifi spot.I love that I'm in complete control of my phone so I can actually stop apps from running in the background (a feature that is extremely helpful when you have business meetings over the net and you don't want anything to go wrong just before the CEO goes insane and commits suicide on live webcam).I love the widgets on the interface.I love the graphics and animations of the wall paper.I love the short-cuts they have (with a click you can see all your pages/screens).Most of all, I love the mini USB plug which makes life a whole lot easier charging all your devices with one charger than going to Wal Mart in the middle of the night to find an iPhone charger.The list of things I love about the phone goes on and on. From a long time user of smart phones and PDAs, I think this device is the Perfect smart phone.Now, the bad. The other reviews mentioned disadvantages that I think more of a personal preference rather than a real drawback. However, the battery is the worst thing on the short list of this device's negative features. If I don't connect to the Internet, the battery lasts for 5-7 days. As it is, I always have my 4G, wifi and Bluetooth on. I end up charging the device every night (sometimes twice a day).The second worst thing is the app store. Compared to the apple app store, the HTC app store is shameful. It's getting there but the number of the apps is by far inferior to the apple store.Aside from this, I highly recommend this phone for business purposes and for pleasure (not as entertaining a device as iPhones but all in all).", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my Android Phone", "Author": "benedicm10", "ReviewID": "R3PYFDNOZ96PKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My HTC phone arrived after 3 days of ordering my product, almost a week before the expectation arrival date. Everything was in the box, as listed on Amazon. The only problem I had so far was setting the Language when I started up the phone.

Speed at a time shows little lag but, you can over come it in many ways. One of them is as mentioned under.Ergonomics are good once you get a good hang of its size in your palm. Using it as regular GPS, voice recording, photographs and video's are best values you get out of it. That is what it is built for.So this animal now has ICS Ice Cream sandwich.

I was blown away by the interface, speed and capabilities of this phone, and how much it made my Blackberry look like a \"dumb\" phone. I use the phone to hold all my music and use it in the car via bluetooth for calls and streaming music. THIS PHONE HAS A DEFENCTIVE DESIGN THAT AS UNRESOLVED BY HTC: The bluetooth is version 3.0, and apparently does not work as intended - terrible background noise and hiss for the other caller to the point of being unusable.  HTC has recognized this as a defect in the phone, but has not posted a fix as of the writing of this Review. (Web search \"HTC Sensation bluetooth noise\"). I figured I would just get a Galaxy II, but it ALSO HAS BLUETOOTH NOISE ISSUES! (Do they even test these phones prior to production? This is really a HUGE but completely avoidable flaw). This is a complete deal breaker for me. I ordered a Blackberry 9900 to replace it - They use good old stable Bluetooth 2.1.  I imagine that the issue will be fixed in a future update.  If you dont use bluetooth, this is an excellent phone - very pleasant to use, and the apps are unbelievable!", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's ok for the price", "Author": "Hammondagyei", "ReviewID": "R149BGCRTYTFXN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the phone but it had some scratches that needed to be addressed or pictured right.

I love the features on it, however in less than six months the phone started to malfunction first the speaker then the touch.

I think the only thing on the phone that was like new was its apperance as it was in prerfectly good condition with no scratches - even now.Overall it is a great phone.
