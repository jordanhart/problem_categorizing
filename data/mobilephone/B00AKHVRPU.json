They are only accessible via \"Organizer\", from the Main Menu. You''ll need four, five, or six key presses from the standby screen.There is no option to disable Network Name Display, and it is not on a very nice position on the standby screen. as it occupies the middle top area of the screen, with middle alignment. If you're into customizing your screen, this is a great frustration, and you just have to design around it.One needs an extra key press when exiting keypad lock mode. It depends on what the current screen is, pressing Unlock may have to be twice, before the final confirmation \"YES\".is available and functional.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GPU MTK 6253\nMessaging SMS, MMS, Email\nBrowser \tYes\nRadio FM radio\nGames No", "Name": "New LG A290 Triple SIM Unlocked GSM Phone - BLACK", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21PZp7aFtPL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AKHVRPU"}}
