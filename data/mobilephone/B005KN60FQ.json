This phone works for us because it doesn't require data with verizon. It has an extra large keyboard inside and a touch screen outside.  This phone stores alot of pictures and takes decent video for storage on a micro sd.  The battery life is excellent and replacements are available pretty cheap online. This phone isn't supported anymore by Verizon, but address books can be retrieved from storage from Verizon with backup assistant which is a free download. This is not a smart phone and it does not have GPS capability, but works if you text alot which we do.  One of these days us older folk will join the 4G generation...but not just yet:)", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "Virginia Rowland \"Ginger\"", "ReviewID": "R10L0O3BV1DPW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a few days and so far I really like it. It isn't a smart phone, but I wanted a touch screen phone and did not want to add $30 a month to my phone bill for a data package to support a blackberry or smart phone. This phone is a little larger, and I like that. I don't use it for email or Facebook, and I only go online ocasionally, the gps is handy, so if you aren't in the market for a smart phone, but want a bit of an upgrade, and can't find what you want at Verizon for a lot more money, I recommend this phone. I'm over 50 and technologically backward, and I was able to figure out how to use this one quite easily. The screen is large, outside and inside, and the keyboard is realy nice. I just wish I had thought to shop for a phone outside the verizon wireless website before I went ahead and ordered from their limited selection and settled for one I knew I didn't want just because it was free. Next time you are ready for an upgrade, look around on Amazon.com and try out something that they dont offer anymore!! I'm glad I made this purchase. So far, so good.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "not too big", "Author": "C. Chang", "ReviewID": "R1HDECS30ICY52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My kids always remark on how big this phone is but its pocket sized and fits well in my purse and is easy to find. Its 4.5 inches long.  I like the touch screen in the front which locks either manually or automatically after a few seconds of non-use. The keyboard is what sold me on buying it in the first place. Its QUERTY, back lit and a joy to use. Texting is very easy. The 2.5 x 3.5 screen is large enough to actually see. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no place to attach a lanyard or strap to. I was used to leaving the strap outside my purse and pulling on it to answer on my old phone. But it receives well, is easy to hear and keeps a charge. I don't really use it for anything other than talking, keeping and taking pictures for my contact list so I don't usually have to recharge for two days at a time.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone and Provider!", "Author": "L.

You see I live in Montana where rock climbing is basically a religion. Anyhow, I am getting off topic. This phone is sturdy, yes, but also innovative - the efficient touch screen at the front of the phone enables me to not only scroll through pictures, but write text messages as well! Great for rock climbing!I bought this phone when it first came out in 1947, and am still finding uses for this phone to this day. Take yesterday for instance when I was rock climbing and a pack of savage black bears began repelling down the mountainside like a scene out of Twilight - I merely took out my LG Voyager VX10000 w/ full QWERTY keyboard phone and used the front touchscreen to initiate a high-powered laser beam to instantly annihilate the threatening bears, while doing that, the inside screen of my LG Voyager VX10000 w/ full QWERTY keyboard phone began to brew me a fresh caramel latte!

I paid to send the phone back and in about a week I received a replacement phone. I was happy because the phone looked like it was in great condition.  Unfortunately I was not able to activate it on my Verizon account because the phone was already activated by another Verizon customer.  Verizon could not do anything to help me.  When I contacted the company they instructed me to try to activate the phone again.  I did so and I still could not activate it on my Verizon account. I contacted the company again and I asked them to pay for the return shipping this time which they did.  After that, the representative that responded to me was not too keen on sending me another replacement phone and paying for the return shipment if I had to send the phone back a third time.  After asking twice about a replacement phone for the replacement phone they told me that they were out of stock but if by chance they had one when they received the phone I was returning they would send one. I finally asked for a refund and got it.  After more than a month from the time that I initially ordered the phone, I ended up with no phone and I had to pay for shipping and insurance for the phone I sent back. I ended up loosing money.
