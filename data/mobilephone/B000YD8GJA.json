The only reason why I am getting a new phone is because after 4 years the plastic on the front cracked and is chipping.Over all this is a great phone, I've dropped it and its been fine.

I've been using mine for years. It's been dropped, chewed on, drowned, stepped on. The cover has a few scratches, the silver paint is showing some wear, I'm on my second replacement battery, but it keeps on working.When I got it, I regularly drove through seriously rural areas in east, northeast, and central Texas. This phone isn't fancy, but I can call for help from the middle of nowhere.Two complaints: The connection for the charger is starting to get a little loose. Sometimes I have to fuss with it a little to get it to charge. Also, I don't know if it's from being dropped so many times or what, but the sound isn't great unless the phone is fully charged. When that happens, I use the speakerphone.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not into Smart Phones!", "Author": "Mschloe", "ReviewID": "R194486PEMWWMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nothing against a smart phone, but for my husband and I, we are looking for something simple to operate and dependable that works well.  This is just what we wanted.  We originally purchased one of these phones about 7 or 8 years ago and have never had an issue with it.  It still functions extremely well and we use it almost on a daily basis.  Now we each have one of these phones and couldn't be more satisfied with the quality of this Motorola product!", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola V551 GSM Mobile Camera Phone (Blue)", "Author": "Dave Hartigan", "ReviewID": "R3QCC7WI3SGPWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's hard to find this phone but here was the one I was after.
