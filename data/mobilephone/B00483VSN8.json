{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dinosaur", "Author": "Boo", "ReviewID": "R1VN2CV72I7GWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVE this phone. The reason i titled  it \" Dinosaur \" is because AT&T; doesn't make them any more. Because I didn't buy it through an AT&T; supplier, I can't download pictures. This phone is the only kind of phone my husband and I care to carry. The color on this one is not a red red, it is a burgundy which is such a pretty color. I will continue buying this type phone as long as I can find them. If I wanted to use my computer, I would carry my lap top with me.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "very dissatisfied :(", "Author": "lilmomma87", "ReviewID": "R3V0GCS7SRGEHF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was told it worked like brand new and when I received it....it wouldnt turn on and no indication it was charging! definitely not ordering anything else from this retailer!
