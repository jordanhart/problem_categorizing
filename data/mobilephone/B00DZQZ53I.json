The product itself is not up to meet my needs. It's way to small to accommodate my fingers. When you want to txt you have to turn it side ways, the whole phone. Then find something to tap your message out. It's really not a good phone for anybody that has to multitask either.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DZQZ53I"}}
