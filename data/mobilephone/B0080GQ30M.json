{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Delightful! (by a very happy iPhone user)", "Author": "Luca Cascianini", "ReviewID": "ROOAJ0C0TKZV9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the S3 yesterday, since I owned a iPhone 4S here the comparison:DESIGN: Galaxy S3 design is stunning, the feeling on hands is incredible. The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier);SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you wont never come back, impossible.OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower.BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM;GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success;CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference.S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull.USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :)APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users. You wont regret, there is a world outside iTunes :)", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Anne P Collette", "ReviewID": "R2Z8U7SVB3RJ7Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had no problems thus far with my phone and have had it for over 5 months now. My only complaint is that I bought the international version, and everything was in French. That was to be expected, and I would have been fine with it, bc all you have to do is go to \"settings\" and change the language. That was a problem, though, bc I didn't know what the French word for \"settings\" was. Anyway, thanks to Google translate, I finally got it all figured out:-) I do wish that the retailer would have sent a user manual in English, though, bc the user manual that came with the phone was in about a dozen languages except for English. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the phone. Thanks and God bless.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I9300 Galaxy SIII Unlocked & Straight Talk", "Author": "Rick Holcomb", "ReviewID": "R31AFXHI7VZX71", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice phone.  However this is my first time doing either a smart phone or an Unlocked phone where I had to install a SIM card.  Make sure you know what your getting into.  The SIII uses a micro SIM GSM.  Make sure you select a carrier that uses microSIMS or are willing to cut a full size to a micro.  Cutting tools available on Amazon.  I'm using straigh talk.  I don't know if I would recommend tham.  They are ddeceptive about what carrier they use to provide their service.  In the case of GSM, AT&T; or TMobile.  TMobile sucks for me.  But Straight talk doesn't offer an AT&T; compatible SIM card any longer.  You can find them on Amazon if you look, for a price.  The only issue I had with the phone is that it is the international version, which was not stated in Amazon advertisement.  Minor, issue but all my temps are in centigrade and I can't figure out how to change it.  I would check the manufacurers web site for any unlocked phone to insure your getting a US version and to dertimine what SIM it needs.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "better than iPhone", "Author": "Laura Veras", "ReviewID": "R2I9N9HIJ8YEIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I' m completely satisfied with this phone.
