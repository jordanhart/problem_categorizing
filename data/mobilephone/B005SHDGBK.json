So I purchased one after my last phone broke. It turns out, this Motorola XPRT was defective right out of the box. So what does Motorola do to make it right? They have me send it in for repair instead of replacing it, leaving me phoneless for 6 weeks. Perhaps it's a good phone as the other reviewers state, but I can't comment on its performance because I have not been able to use it yet. Want to take a chance? Go ahead and buy one, but realize you are buying it \"as is\" as basically, there is no warranty and Motorola will leave you without a phone if it is defective. Needless to say, I have purchased my last Motorola product.UPDATE: After keeping my phone, supposedly for repair, for over 3 weeks, they sent a new one, unactivated and with the back cover missing. Imagine that... bought the phone on July 3rd and as of this date (August 18th), I still don't have a working phone and Motorola will NOT do anything to make it right. I ended up having to buy another phone (Samsung Replenish) and ate the money I spent on the Motorola garbage. Do yourself a favor... not only avoid this phone, AVOID MOTOROLA completely. If it comes defective out of the box, you are stuck without a phone for however long it takes for Motorola to repair it, which apparently takes weeks or even months.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great replacement thus far", "Author": "AJ Johnson", "ReviewID": "RXTC49U1PO5GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this phone, had it for two years and was walking the dog when he yanked the chain and it dropped and shattered.

I wish I had stuck with HTC and the Windows Mobile OS.I do think that it is more likely due to the fact that it is running Android, as I've owned an Android phone before and my experience with Android then was awful, I had hoped that they would have improved over the past couple of years, but apparently not. I haven't installed very many additional apps and it still crashes, loads all kinds of parasitic zombie programs in the background automatically in spite of closing them that bogs it down further and drains the battery faster, most of the garbage/zombie apps that come with the OS can't be uninstalled/disabled even if you don't use them. The few other apps I use, for example, a banking app and Facebook, the developers apparently don't test their work as they are riddled with bugs and every update seems to make them worse, part of my job involves programming and I rigorously test my work before distributing, it is simple pride in workmanship for me. The e-mail app is also very buggy, don't use on a company e-mail account as it will pop up an invalid password error randomly for no reason, and with mine, three invalid login attempts will lock the account and make you call IT to unlock it, another coworker with a different Android phone had this happen as well and removed the company e-mail account from his phone due to this, so an \"F\" for any professional use. The keyboard also will sometimes double-type letters as you are typing and the touch screen is not very accurate.The OS and most basic bugs are the worst and most annoying part, occasionally I have to fight the camera to save the pictures correctly or when it does actually save it the file is corrupt and then you have to fight with it just to delete the corrupted file, I've tried different SD cards with the same result and I've experienced this before with the Android OS camera. The flash timing on the camera is random and stupid, sometimes it takes 4 attempts to get a good picture in low light conditions because of poor flash timing, and sometimes the camera app will not load and pop up an error saying that \"sorry, the camera is unavailable right now\". It just has an accumulation of some of the most annoying and inconvenient issues that are inexcusable in my opinion as my HTC, and in the past, my Palm phones rarely ever had any issues. I will never buy another Android based phone again. The phone itself is unimpressive and feels cheaply built and it seems the issues go hand in hand between the phone and the OS. This is just the tip of the iceberg on this phone, it will just irritate the crap out of you after a while and on one of \"those days\" make you want to drop it and stomp it into the ground, there have been times I've wanted to.I know trying to resolve these issues will just be a hassle and I'm just waiting for my contract to end so I can switch carriers, as my signal at my workplace has tanked with no resolution in sight, it isn't the phone in this case as several Sprint customers that are my coworkers have noticed the same issue for the past couple of weeks after having relatively good reception prior to now. I work a lot of hours and use my phone a lot at work and it is within city limits and for how much I pay per month I shouldn't have to deal with bad reception, especially since it has degraded from being decent before. I wish I could just return the phone in exchange for exiting the contract early.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "XPRT Sprint cell phone", "Author": "Jean Price", "ReviewID": "R32ZEDUVYAGBN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this phone  my other one just like it died so I was very happy to be able to get another", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!", "Author": "Jeanine Joyner", "ReviewID": "R3K0QWBOPE5UZN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone put my sim card in and it wouldn't work.

The staff there was helpful, but this phone doesn't live up to... well, any standard or claim whatsoever.It's so terrible, where to begin?!Let's start with reception. There is none. Other people with sprint in the same place will have a perfect connection, but not my phone. It drops calls and has terrible quality. It rarely seems to be able to send out text messages, sometimes telling me \"text message not sent\" the moment I press send. And good luck typing on the keyboard!!! Every time I hit a letter it repeats. Offteeen mmy teext messsages lookk likee thiis. Trust me, it's not my fingers who are at fault.As far as when I'm near wifi, once it's finished taking so long to connect to a signal, browsing is brutally slow. Waiting for simple things like google.com and facebook.com to load, I'm pretty sure I could go off to graduate school, get my PhD, and come back to find it half loaded. (If you have a problem with hyperbole, get this phone. You too will be tossing it from the 18th floor balcony in no time.)One of the big reasons I chose this phone was the camera. Like loading a website, loading the camera takes forever and a year. I have missed very. slow. events. waiting for my camera to load. Such as a railroad arm dropping ontop of a waiting ambulance. (Being a paramedic, I found it amusing the driver let the arm hit the rig.) The arm dropped, the train passed, and the arm raised and traffic began moving... all before I was able to take a picture.Not to mention, when I am finally able to snap a shot, the quality is terrible. I had a 5 megapixel camera in 2005 that had better quality. (I realize it is a bigger CMOS in a camera, but still, that was 8 years ago!) Don't even attempt low light shots, or bright light shots. You pick up nothing or get complete washout.Anyway, there are no redeeming qualities for this phone. Once I purchase another, which will be soon, I will enjoy burning it. :-) Stay away!!!", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Xprt", "Author": "Whitetiger \"d(-_-)b\"", "ReviewID": "R3JEC9XP63UE4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a decent phone, i like the weight of it, verses some other candybar phones.

For me its more of a comfort thing, and i feel better with the replinish, tho it seems a bit long, and cheaper made, the xprt has more memory, faster processer, glass screen not plastic, better battery, the battery on replinish sucks, as most smart phones do i guess.

Motorola Blur widgets are nice, and the phone works fine with Office 365.It took forever, but this is the best of the successors to the Treo 755.  It doesn't have a fine tip stylus, and the calendar alerts don't pop in your face like Palm, but I have tried Palm, Blackberry, Later Palms, Samsung, and this is the best one.I thought about buying it on ebay where it was slightly cheaper, but I have gotten burned on cell phones there before, so I paid about $40 more to get it on Amazon, but it was well worth it, and the box was actually new like the listing said.4 stars instead of 5, because to this day, Palm is the only company that really wanted people to remember everything and so they put the calendar alerts right in your face.
