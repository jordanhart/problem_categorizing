I don't recall my calls being dropped but what Iv'e had a major problem is with memory! I have 0 apps downloaded, about 50 pictures, 400 texts and I find myself making memory for this messed up phone at least 3 times a day. Battery used to be fine, but I now have to charge it a minimum of 2 times a day (depends on my daily activity). I would not recommend this phone to anyone who likes to download apps, watch videos,etc. Perhaps this phone is ideal to those individuals who want to learn how to use a touch screen or upgrade from a flip phone, whatever the case is.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "sucks", "Author": "helga", "ReviewID": "R1R81KDI962QQ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is not good.
