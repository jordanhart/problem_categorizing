The new Tracfone was purchased in the same geographic area (ZIP code) as the original Tracfone so I was hopeful that transferring the old phone number, air time, and service minutes to the new phone would be straightforward.After I entered all the data on the Tracfone's Customer Support web page, the system came back with a message to CALL Customer Service to request a new SIM card.I called Customer Service, and after 15 minutes was able to explain the situation to a service representative. She had to get all the data from me again, call Tech. Support numerous times while placing me on hold before she was able to create a ticket for Tracfone to send me a new SIM Card. The entire process took over 30 minutes. When I get the new SIM card I will have to go through the same procedure again to finally ACTIVATE my new Tracfone !The problem with Tracfone's Customer Support is that their systems are extremely cumbersome, the representatives have to call their internal Tech. Support people to resolve most issues, and the whole process is extremely time consuming.Secondly, Tracfone cell phones available in my area are very inferior quality; they do not offer high quality cell phones that last.

Bought this one because batteries were too expensive for the other. Anyway, I'm quite pleased with the phone, especially it's reception & battery life. Samsung phones are well known for having great battery life, plus it's also an overall excellent brand.I got the phone from an Amazon seller, for $6.99 + $4.99 shipping, which was $8 less than the same phone from the TracFone site itself. Had a problem with the proper screen on my old phone showing up for the online transfer of my phone number & minutes, but a quick call to Customer Service got everything working less than 5 minutes after the call was over. And I was able on a Sunday to get a rep quickly. Plus got 60 extra days to what I had w/o adding another airtime card, simply for activating the phone.This phone is perfect for those who has a home phone, and needs one for personal/occasional use. I use it for my personal business, this way, when a call comes in, I know it's for me. And it's a very simple phone, which is exactly what I wanted, plus it has Double Minutes for the life of the phone. Too, one can look online for promo codes, which can sometimes triple a 60 minute card, making it 180 minutes.I've been a happy TracFone since 2010, and their ads aren't misleading. The customer is totally in charge of their usage, many users only has to add a airtime card only every 3 months. Unlike all other prepaid services, which requires a airtime card monthly. And so far, I haven't needed to contact Technical Service, which is good also.I highly recommend this phone & the TracFone brand for those who wants an inexpensive, no BS, cell phone experience.Cat", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE my Tracphone", "Author": "Colleen Dunning", "ReviewID": "R2RK7ZZHDDAOEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I got rid of our cell phones to lower our monthly spending about 2 years ago.

Recently moved back to the Houston, TX area and find I need one. If wife and I go shopping she disappears and I have to wander around a \"super\" store to find her. Now I can call her cell and get an idea of where she is. In addition I have great grandchildren I need to take fishing and might need the phone while we're on the lake or creek, just in case.The double minutes aspect is great, I bought 400 minutes to start with and it doubled to 800 plus an additional 20 that came with the purchase. I can surf the web (not that I want to), take pictures, etc. All with a device that didn't exist when I was born 74 years ago. I love modern technology. My first cell was in a bag, weighed about ten lbs, and I had to find a hill top to get any service.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best pay as you go phone.", "Author": "Leonard", "ReviewID": "RV9NNKYZIO959", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those of us who don't want to blow serious money on an expensive cell phone this is definitely for you.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "melinda92545", "ReviewID": "R28JFTJXLZAQ4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish I had todays new models but this phone works for what I needed it for It is a sturdy phone.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung T245G prepaid phone (tracfone)", "Author": "Dr. C.

I called Tracphone to get a new phone because my other one got dropped in the toilet. After about 4 days, I received the new phone. I followed the instructions on activating the new phone. It showed only 10 minutes. So I called customer service to try to transfer my original phone # & leftover minutes of about 350 to new phone. I could barely understand the lady with her accent, but she was pretty nice, and it was kind of funny because after EVERYTHING she would, \"and by the way m'am\"!!! and by way m'am are you still there?.. was kind of funny kind of annoying. So was on phone with her for about 15 minutes. She said turn phone off, wait about an hour then check it. So I did. Still no more than just the 10 mins on phone, but, it showed as the old phone # I needed, so that was cool. So I called again and spent probably an hour on the phone with a lady this time with a heavy accent. I think even she got confused! I read her this serial # & that #etc.... And she says, \"ok m'am a new SIM card will be coming to you in the mail since the one on your new phone is broken, I'm sorry that happened.\" I said, \"what? I didn't say that it was broken, alls I want are my remaining minutes from the other phone!\" She said \"well m'am call us back if a few days when you receive your new SIM card.\" I said, \"but I JUST got a NEW phone with I would think a brand new SIM card already in it! I don't understand this process. Do You?\" She said something to matter of \"i sorry m'am, call us back when new SIM card arrives or you can buy more minutes in meantime.\" AAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGG", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "star performer", "Author": "tom esposito", "ReviewID": "R3ALNTU1VNZB4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "a basic phone that does everything its supposed to do;display is clear and buttons function without fail;a  real star performer compared to other popularlow-cost phones.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an upgrade for me.", "Author": "J.

It does what I want.  If we lived in a world where no one sends text messages, I would rate this phone more highly.Unfortunately, folks WILL send text messages, no matter how many times you tell them not to do it.  I never send a text message, so I can't speak to that, but folks insist on sending them to me.  When the incoming call arrives, it displays the phone number of the sender so you can decide whether to pay the fee to read the message.  This is an important feature, as I get a lot of spam text messages.HOWEVER, the numerals are WHITE on a YELLOW background.  This is illegible!  And there's no way to change the color scheme!  I have tried multiple times, and had others try to change it for me, but it's not possible!So if screen your incoming text messages, think twice before buying this phone.P.S.
