I got the phone a week earlier than I had expected which is a definite plus (I'm in The Bahamas). She is happy with the phone, but just has to get used to the windows 8 OS. I haven't had a chance to fully test it, but so far it is functioning exactly as I expected. Perhaps, after a few weeks of testing, I'll be back with an update. But as for now, I would certainly recommend this phone.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "Jose Ruiz", "ReviewID": "R36CG4IRD3OEJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very Good!", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nokia Lumia 520 Unlocked GSM Windows 8 OS Cell Phone 8GB - Red", "Author": "D'veed", "ReviewID": "R2541Y9BB0I2V1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You cannot say enough good things about this little phone. It's a Nokia. It's a Windows Phone with OS 8. It may not be so new, or super powered; BUT, it is inexpensive, FAST, highly customizable, with the ability to upgrade and use the most modern apps in the Windows' store; and I LOVE it. Nokia apps are fantastic! This phone is a perfect back up to my main Windows phone (I want to be able to be with a phone if anything ever happens to my main phone, quickly) It is so good I bought one for my wife and one for a friend (they make GREAT presents).", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "All was ok", "Author": "Penelope", "ReviewID": "RTT2Q7ACDW0RA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the cell phone it works perfect the only thing that I don't like it's thatthe box doesn't bring headphones", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$120.99", "Features": "Nokia Lumia 520 Red (Factory Unlocked) 4\" IPS LCD , Windows Phone 8 , 8GB    SHIP Worldwide", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 520 Unlocked GSM Windows 8 OS Cell Phone 8GB - Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yj56LkgiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D86OUKE"}}
