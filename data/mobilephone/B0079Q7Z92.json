{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Lily Brewer", "ReviewID": "ROTXD3576JWTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this as part of a tracfone bundle that came with double minutes for life.  Thus far, I like it pretty well.  It uses CDMA (that's the Verizon etc. network, rather than AT&T;) and the reception is comparable to that of my old Verizon phone in the same areas. I live in a rural part of Maine, so reception is paramount and it truly matters which carrier you choose.  For my own cell phone use habits, this phone pretty much has everything I need as I don't browse the internet on my phone and have an ipod if want download apps. (This phone is not capable of using apps).  The only deficiency this phone has that really bothers me is that there is no micro SD slot, so if you want to transfer data directly to your computer that way, you're out of luck. I just spent an hour searching LG forums and their site hoping this was some kind of mistake, but it doesn't look like it is. I'm not sure how this will work for pictures yet.  However, I was able to send the contact list from my old phone to this one via Bluetooth, so all is not lost.Lastly, if you are particular about this kind of thing, you'll probably want a case for this one, it seems like it will scratch easily. So here it is, a list of the pros and cons.Pros:It's afordableGood reception in this rural Maine and rural New Hampshire.Slick look and easy interface.Bright screenThe camera is comparable to the 1.3 megapixel camera on my old phoneIt's pretty lightweight for its sizeQwerty keyboardMinutes and airtime are conveniently displayed so I'm never left guessingDouble minutes for life, which is a necessityCons:No microSD card.  Bluetooth works for contact list transfer, but I'm not sure about other data yet or if you can transfer it via USB.No idea how much internal memory the phone hasAccording to the tracfone TOS, if you don't keep your service active, you will lose your phone number, so you must add airtime BEFORE it runs out.  It can be reactivated at any time, but they will assign you a new number.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty decent, actually", "Author": "S. B.", "ReviewID": "R1QGOB0GS7ZYUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is in some ways much nicer than my previous non-keyboard phones.Pro:1. keyboard is much nicer than endless repetitive button pressing only to go too far and have to cycle through the extended character set all over again. Keyboard is small but with the right technique it can be mastered by most.2. better speaker phone audio than many3. has bluetooth- of course most do now.4. adequate battery life. For me at least.5. CDMA- can access Verizon networks even though mine is a Tracfone- essential for coverage in some areas.6. price is right!Cons:1. no external memory. But internal memory seems pretty adequate.2. no MP3 player. But I want a phone not a toy, so not really a complaint.3. poor camera. But better than no camera I suppose. Hardly a deal breaker for someone needing a cheap basic phone.Bottom line: This is a really decent cheap basic CDMA text friendly phone which works fine even in outlying areas. Perfect phone for me- I am quite happy with it. BTW- the gel covers here on Amazon which might be labeled for LG UN200 Saber are a PERFECT fit.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD CDMA PHONE", "Author": "B.Bob", "ReviewID": "R4OCNGNI74BU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quality and easy to use phone and camera.  Very comparable to the LG500g GSM but wider reception area via Verizon.  Both phones have less battery life than the LG290c and the 290c seems to be more sensitive thus better reception in remote areas.  I find this phone easier to use for text messages with a full keyboard than the 290c.  If you need a CDMA phone and want a full keyboard, I would very much recommend this phone.Update July 18, 2012 - I have used this phone in many locations since I purchased it.  It does a very good job on the Verizon network, much better than my similar 500g GSM phone.  I also used the camera on an accident investigation and the pictures were very useful...only wish you could directly down load them or put them on a memory card.  I have no negatives to report and have found the keyboard easy to use with my \"fat\" fingers.  For a basic + phone, I highly recommend and well worth the cost.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is an older model with few bells and whistles, but for basic communication needs, it gets the job done.", "Author": "Janice Copeland", "ReviewID": "R2JC7444FOJHWY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this model because I knew it would get good reception in my rural area, as opposed to some others I've had.
