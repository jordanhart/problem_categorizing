{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone, non-modern OS", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1ZH9ENBAA69L5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Aspen itself is a pretty neat phone.  It has the Windows mobile feel, battery is decent, and there aren't many reasons for it to shut down randomly.  I used it in the U.S. so there was no data option but it does work with AT&T; as a call/text type cell.  The wifi abilities allows you to use the internet so that helps but some wifi routers are too complex for you to sign in with.  I used it at my college and for some reason I couldn't always get it to connect.  It worked at my home and work though fine.The plastic on the outside takes away from the business feel of the phone.  It seems like it should feel heavier but doesn't.  I like the heavy feel of Nokia phones if that helps with understanding what I am saying.  Camera is decent along with the software and features.Problem with this phone is that Microsoft stop using Win Mobile 6 starting this fall meaning you can't back up your files through Microsoft's system.  This was a bummer b/c I wanted to update my contacts for email and cell but couldn't.Overall good phone but there are better ones but those cost more.  If money is tight and you want a business phone check out the Aspen or look at so of the other smaller business smartphones.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "A GIFT", "Author": "nicole hoyte", "ReviewID": "RUBFHCAM463P9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THIS ITEM WAS A GIFT BUT I HEARD NO NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS FROM THE RECEPIENT SO I GUESS THAT IT WAS WELL RECEIVED.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1M2Q4M3JL3UFM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's been over a month with this phone and I'm very happy with it.
