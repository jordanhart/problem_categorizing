{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great product, great price!", "Author": "Desert Gypsy \"A Brooklyn Girl Out West\"", "ReviewID": "R2UEORQ4H9T6O2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I guess am a rarity in that I have very little need for a cell phone. I basically only need one for emergencies and some light use when I travel. I bought this phone for twenty dollars at Walmart; it came with ten dollars of phone usage credit so essentially I paid ten bucks for the actual phone.The plan I chose allows me to refill in fifteen dollar increments or more. For that I get charged two dollars for any full day I use the phone for a phone call;the calls for that 24 hour period are UNLIMITED.I get also get charged two cents for each text incoming or outgoing and that is separate from the phone calls.Verizon has been very reliable service wise and I never have trouble getting a signal. We had a blackout in my small town recently and it was such a relief to be able to have service when the landline cordless units were down.The only quibble I have with this phone is that if I activate the phone by adding fifteen dollars, often I'll have seven or eight dollars left on the account and that amount does NOT roll over at the end of thirty days. For me, it's a small price to pay though for the convenience factor and no contract.I think one of the better things about this phone is that even if you use it every day, at two dollars a day, the maximum charge is sixty dollars a month - no extra taxes, hidden fees, etc. You'll always know exactly how deep you are getting in with the bill since it shuts down the ability to make calls if you have reached the limit of how much money you've applied to the account. The same goes for texting; it simply deducts two cents for each text.A simple product, a simple calling plan - works for me.Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "easy breezy", "Author": "Bettie cheek", "ReviewID": "R3H6P0FW4BF4I6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my cell phone died and i dreaded getting another - but i went on line - did some 'research' got this phone, and after using explosives to get it out of the package !!? - found it to be simple to set up and change my old verizon pay-as-you-go number- did it via customer service - I am 72 and i would say less than savvy about most technology - don't like trying to figure it out-  but this was easy - and so far phone set up easy with simple functions -probably more than i will use - but so far so good -- oh yes - i got a sexy little cover as well on amazon !! --bright colors so i can find it in my purse-- Oh and it was very inexpensive--what else do you want? yayyy amazon and verizon", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "ehh", "Author": "Mostlee (Cleric) \"Everquest fan\"", "ReviewID": "R33CC411UGO52N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is what it is.  I bought one of these at a local discount store (20 bucks) when I was having big trouble getting through short phone calls and texts.  I had no bars 80 percent of the time and have since learned it may have been the work of an illegal repeater, but I digress.  Since I have no land line, I rely heavily on cell phone use and I needed something reliable to handle whatever would normally come my way.As a phone, it's great, although it takes getting used to if your downgrading from an android.  I programed in my frequent contacts, but couldn't find a way to assign a ringtone to specific contacts.  I attribute that to my impatience and/or lack of knowledge of the phone.What little I found of sounds or ringtones would be difficult at best to use.  Normally, you would pick a sound/ringtone you would like and the phone would play a sample for you.  The Gusto didn't do that.  Each ringtone has a number or a brief description and I had no way of testing it unless I asked someone to call me, in which case, that would eat away at what few minutes I had.As for the signal, good and clear and reliable.  Texts went out MUCH quicker than with slowski Sprint 3G network!  I liked the signal strength so much with this phone that I even considered upping the experiment to give Verizon a try with a contract.  Quick research, however indicated otherwise.  I know you can't get something for nothing, but I'm really not willing to pay as much as Verizon expects you to pay for a 4G, let alone a 3G phone.  The billing structure seems high to me.  Some reviews of service paint a dismal picture as well and that I won't get into.  Besides, most of these plans end up with totals pretty much the same as others.  Except for Virgin Mobile and their older model phones.  Some, not that much older.Anyway,  If I only needed this as a phone, I would say it's a keeper.  As for texting, it's tedious using the alpha keys to spell it out.  Brings back memories of when I started my cell phone adventure with Cingular.  Phone: good, Text: poor, extras: poor.  Cost (at a local store): good.  P.S.

This review is for the Samsung U360 phone only .... not the service.I hated my previous cell phone where I was constantly changing operating features whenever I would accidentally touch one of the buttons on the side of the phone .... which was almost every time I answered it. This phone is a better in that regard ... but not perfect. Fair.This phone has no ability to down-load photos onto my computer .... so it means I won't be using that feature. Unacceptable.The charging jack, which looks like a micro-USB connector but isn't, is difficult to open and looks like it will break off at any time. Poor.The phone can't be used when the battery runs down and you plug it in to your charger. Poor.The battery cover seems excessively difficult for me to remove and re-install. Poor.The menu features seem to be organized such that you're required to skip over unimportant features to get to important ones. Poor.The ability to add contacts is unintuitive and requires too many steps.  Poor.My first new phone died within a week. It was replaced free but the failure is a bad omen. Poor.Battery life at \"idle\" seems to last for days. Good.I think it is often hard to understand the callers' voices. Poor.The keyboard is far less than ideal. It is difficult to move your selection bar up and down. There doesn't seem to be a delete key so it can be difficult to correct typing errors.

I got the prepaid plan thinking it was nice because I would only pay as I use.  I have to admit I do like this part about it.  For me, that is what I was looking for.  However; shortly after getting the phone, I kept getting calls from companies asking for an Anthony.  I am not Anthony and I don't know anyone by that name.  So, they recycle the #'s.  The problem with this is I am charged $1.99 each day a call is made to or from my phone.  It is just a 1 time fee, so if I get 5 calls, it is just $1.99 for the first call and all others are free.  I don't feel this is my fault since the company decided to recyle the #'s.  So I called verizon and asked about getting my money back.  The first time this happened, the customer service rep, had no problem refunding my money.  Fast forward to today.  I have received 2 calls within 2 days of each other asking for Anthony again.  So, I have been billed $3.98 because of the recycled #.  I have advised the company they have the wrong # twice and that unless they want to start refunding my money for the call to my cell phone, they need to remove my #.  So I called verizon up again and asked for the money back.  I ended up having to get the supervisor involved who told me they will do it this time but in the future, they will not as this is not their fault.  REALLY???!!!!!  They chose to recycle the #'s, so it certainly isn't my fault.  So, just be cautious.  They said they could change my # but have no guarantee it won't happen again.  They also told me I could pay for the $50 plan and have unlimited access.  If I wanted to do that, I would've stuck to my old plan.  Not very good customer service at all and they weren't even compasionate about my needs.  If it continues to happen, I will be done with them and maybe look elsewhere.  I would not recommend going with them since they have the I don't care attitude.  If it happens again, they will be reported to the Better Business Bureau as this is not the way to run a business!

Savini", "ReviewID": "R38J54T0FHET3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bounced around on prepaid for several years. I had another service with an android phone and when I moved cross country it barely worked. It dropped calls, lost signal, dead spots etc. I know that Verizon's coverage is unmatched, and decided to go back to them via prepaid. $50 unlimited really is great from Vz, considering I still remember back when I was on a Verizon contract with the same style device paying $120! Android was fun a first, however, I did not use the apps and the extras hardly at all. I mainly make calls and send texts. I went with this phone because it was ultra cheap (fifteen bucks at WM; considering it comes with ten bucks free, its a five dollar phone!) and this was a good way for me to try out the Verizon prepaid with little investment. This phone is basic, but its durable and dependable. It has a nice body style with a matte grey, brushed finish. It does not feel cheap and plasticy like other lower end prepaids. The buttons are very large, and there is a shortcut key to messages and voicemail. Texting is tedious with the keypad after using swipe/touch however it gets the job done. The menu icons are large and look older, and prepaid-ish. Where this phone shines is call quality, which is clear as a bell. Stellar signal, no dropped calls or dead spots etc. Also the battery life is amazing. It lasts ages, like a week at least. I think for the price and the Verizon service its a great deal, and overall for a basic flip phone I think its really nice. I think someone older who like large buttons, or someone who mainly wants voice/text would be very happy to own this phone.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Phone", "Author": "jcarvers", "ReviewID": "R3LTQ3U1KRZEKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I puchased this so I wouldn't need to take my Blackberry with me on vacation.

Morris \"On The High Desert\"", "ReviewID": "R1L11H9GQDSEK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd had Alltell for about 3 years because it was the only signal I could get out here in the desert. My plan was simple... add 10 bucks every 2-months and get charged 10 cents for every minute used. I never use any minutes but since I was dumping the useless 35 bucks a month basic land-line plan with Qwest I thought I still should have a phone for emergencies and all was fine until along came Verizon. To be fair, they let me continue with the same plan even though I had a braded Alltell phone. Late last year, they sent me a text message that they were no longer going to service former Alltell customes, or their phones, but I could switch my account over to a Verizon branded phone within the next 30-days. Off to Best Buy and they matched the 9 buck price Wallyworld was offering so I was all set. Stopped by the Verizon store and I was number 30 in line so I left and called from home, the transition was easy but the plan changed to 20 bucks every two months. I already had about 250 bucks on my account... that's money, not minutes, so I was unhappy to have to keep adding more money for minutes I'd never use. If you don't add by the time they state you will lose all your money. I said I was going to cancel so they wavered and gave me a full year before I would have to add again. I love the phone, Verizon has a super strong signal out here but I'll likely sell the phone with about 400 bucks in the account and buy another and just add 100 bucks for the entire year and be done with it. Hopefully, someone on eBay will give me 50 cents on the dollar.
