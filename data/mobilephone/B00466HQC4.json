{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic deal (used to be, at least, but not any more)", "Author": "G. Lorge", "ReviewID": "R1CF9EMJBP9FIH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "EDITED ON 2/15/2012Since my original review I have received a couple of comments informing me that T-Mobile has dropped their web daypass option.  Furthermore over the past year there has been an explosion of cheap android phones released to be used on cheap pre-paid plans.  Given these two changes to the market since my original review, I no longer feel that the T-Mobile Comet represents the best value in this segment and have lowered my rating to a merely \"average\" 3 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Between home and the office, I spend a lot of time within reach of a land line and a computer with internet access.  So as much as I may have wanted a smart phone previously, I just haven't been able to justify spending upwards of $80 a month for one.  I've been waiting a long time for a carrier to offer a smart phone with a pay-as-you-go pricing model - and after about two weeks of use I can say that I am very happy with the T-Mobile Comet.I've been using T-Mobile's 10 cents per minute pre-paid plan for several years - previously with a cheap, extremely basic Samsung t209 phone.  While I wouldn't really call T-Mobile's call quality or coverage \"great\", I would definitely say that it has been \"good enough\" for me while living around Boston and San Francisco, and the price has certainly been reasonable.  Historically I have spent about $10 to $12 per month on average on my cell phone bill.  I also have family members on the same plan who spend even less.A lot of reviews that compare the Comet to iPhones or other Android phones that can be purchased for $100 to $200 dollars (or even for free) along with an expensive post-paid plan and a two year commitment really seem to miss the point.  A $100 phone on an $80 dollar per month plan is going to end up costing more than $2,000 over the lifetime of the two-year commitment.  On the other hand, a person who purchases a $200 Comet and spends about $20 a month on average in prepaid minutes and web access is going to spend about $700 over that same period.  Is there *any* smart phone out there that's good enough to justify the 3x price difference?  For my needs, definitely not.The real utility of this phone and T-Mobile's pricing structure is the ability to purchase a \"Web Day Pass\", which gets you 24 hours of data access at the cost of $1.49 on the days you need it.  As I mentioned before, I don't need internet access on my phone most days - but there are times when it can be a real life saver.  For example - when you're out on the road in an unfamiliar city, use it to look up restaurant reviews and save yourself an unpleasant experience.  Or use it to get directions if you're lost.  Check prices and reviews on Amazon when you're shopping, or retrieve some important piece of information from your inbox or the web that you forgot to write down before leaving the house.  Having access to the web in any one of these situations is well worth the $1.49 cost.I should note that if you're a bigger talker than me (i.e. you have friends) and worry that paying 10 cents per minute would add up pretty quickly, then you might also want to look at T-Mobile's pre-paid $30-per-month plan which includes 1,500 minutes and 20 MB of data access.  20 MB isn't a lot, but you could probably stretch it a long way if you were to lay off the youtube and use it sparingly.  If you do happen to use up your 20 MB before the month is over, then you can resort to buying Web Day Passes to get you through the rest of the month.I should also note that for a few dollars less you can buy a Nokia Nuron, which probably offers a roughly equivalent set of features, but without the advantages of running Android or having a capacitive touch screen (I've read that browsing the web and using the touch screen in general on the Nuron can be quite painful).  Or, for a few dollars more you can buy an LG Optimus T which according to CNET is considerably nicer than the Comet.  Both of these phones should work on the T-Mobile prepaid plans, and therefore offer excellent value.A couple of other features that I have found useful are the ability to make Skype phone calls over Wi-Fi, the Google Voice Search feature (it's surprisingly accurate), and the ability to store and play mp3s (it comes with 2 GB of storage, and is expandable to 32 GB.  Sound quality over headphones is not as good as an iPod though).  One negative that you should be well aware of is that the camera is a piece of junk.  This is something that I read about in almost all of the reviews - but even then I was surprised at just how bad it is.  Think late 1990's web cam, and you should have an idea of just how bad this thing is.Overall, though, I think that this phone and especially T-Mobile's pay-as-you-go plan is a fantastic value, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is a) not a millionaire, and b) doesn't have their monthly cell phone bill paid for them by their employer or parents.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good enough to be called good, and for a fair price", "Author": "A Customer \"customer12345657\"", "ReviewID": "R12ID8VZXNGQFN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Comet is probably what a lot of people are looking for.Most \"smart phones\" I have previously tried had annoyed me by being either a little too cheesy or way too expensive.  There are a lot of impressive touchscreen phones which always made me think, \"that thing could be WAY cheaper if only they toned down the features somewhat.\"  There are also some super-cheap touchscreen phones which made me think, \"this phone could be a lot better with only some minor improvements\".The Comet seems to be in the lonely area right in the middle, where the the quality is just barely good enough to handle the most work likely to be thrown at it by most people.  And for that, the price is well below all of those \"Cadillac-of-phones\" phones.The Comet's acceptable features:Display:It's not a very high resolution (240x320), but the pixel size is larger than average.  So it isn't as large and sharp as better phones, but you still get a good deal more physical space than \"normal\" phones.Touchscreen interface:It uses the \"capacitative\" type, which means it is a completely solid surface which (somehow) knows when fingers are physically touching it.  It does not use the cheaper \"resistive\" type, which have a flexible surface which must be pressed down to work.  It isn't quite as perfectly sensitive as an iPhone, but much more reliable than resistive screens which have different levels of resistance in different locations.Keypad/text entry:The medium screen size might be a little annoying for tapping, but this phone uses \"Swype\" typing.  Plunk your finger on the first letter, then drag your finger all over the keyboard to each letter you want, and the magic Swype system figures out which word you want to spell.  It works way better than you think it will.  Other than the brilliant invention itself, the cool thing about Swype is that it is completely compatible with simple letter tapping if you don't want to use it.  Either type one letter at a time, or \"Swype\" the whole word.  You don't need to \"change modes\".Sound quality:Not bad, and not great.  Kind of right in the middle, which is fine.Physical build:It's not slim like the latest Apple or HTC products.  At exactly 0.5 inches, it is right about the same thickness as most normal phones.  However, it feels very solid and has no creaks or squeaks (yes, even the battery cover holds still).  The various body panels also fit together fairly close with no excessive gaps.Camera:Well, the camera kind of sucks.  Sorry.  At least it captures pictures fast.Processing and stability:Most of the time, it operates just fine with no annoying delays.  If too much stuff is going on, like multiple browser tabs loading or too many background applications, it starts to drag a bit.  But it never quite freezes or crashes like the Nokia Nuron, which is probably the next closest option for a cheapish touchscreen on T-Mobile.The Comet is manufactured by Huawei, the same Chinese manufacturer of T-Mobile's older Tap model.  The Tap was actually not bad for its price range, but the Comet has a sleeker design, stronger processing, better touchscreen technology, and of course the more competent Android operating system.Recommended add-ons, free from the Android market (icon on the home screen):1. Opera Mini or Opera Mobile.  Similar (Mobile is the \"better\" one) alternative web browsers to the standard Android browser, although Android's is pretty good too.  If you try one of these and like it, Android is smart enough to let you set one of them as the \"default\" browser.2. Any application killer/manager.  These things are just little programs that let you view a list of applications running in the background, and close them.  For some reason, almost all \"smartphones\" are idiots when it comes to managing currently-running applications.  A bunch of different managers are available as free versions.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for T-Mobile Prepaid Customers", "Author": "GI", "ReviewID": "R2UCPWYJL7PKUU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a T-Mobile customer for several years now. They have the best prepaid (pay as you go) plan in my opinion. The minutes do not expire for a year, and T-Mobile notifies you via text message a few days before expiring, so you can add time and roll over your prepaid minutes. Take that AT&T;! I typically use about a 1000 minutes per year ($100.00).I previously had a RAZR phone (which I loved), but wanted a device with more features. My favorite thing about the RAZR was that it's size and weight were very comfortable in my pocket (a guy thing). This phone is just a tiny bit larger and heavier than a RAZR, but it's not noticable. I can walk around with this phone in my pocket all day and not even notice it. I just removed the SIM card from my RAZR, and inserted it into this phone. Your phone number, prepaid minutes, and account don't change.Now to the phone. I've had this phone for about 6 weeks and I'm very happy with it. Like I said, I keep it in my pocket, but this phone has a glass screen so your keys etc won't scratch it. No screen protector is needed. Also, the fit/finish on the phone is very good. The battery door shuts tight (no rattles), the buttons seem firm, and the connectors (micro usb and headphones) are tight and connect well. My only complaint would be the placement of the volume buttons. When I first got the phone, I tended to press them whenever I held the phone, but this is something I'm getting used to.The call quality is great, and the speakerphone is easy to use. The phone also supports an in call dialer so you can enter PINs etc during a call.The main reason I got this phone was to replace my MP3 player. The phone OS (Android) has a built in music player and FM radio. Both work very well. The device is easy to sync up with your PC music libraries, you just connect the phone to your PC with the provided USB cable, the phone prompts you to turn on USB sharing, and the SD card shows up as a removable device on your PC (like a USB drive). You can use windows explorer to copy, delete, and move files on the phones SD card. If you wish you can also use Media Player or a similar software package to automatically sync your music libraries. One thing to note: the phone comes with a 2GB micro SD card. This will probably only hold about 40 albums or so. I upgraded the card to a 16GB one.I also have set up the device to acess my WiFi router at home. I was able to set up my email accounts (hotmail was almost automatic, att.net a little harder). I don't use the phone for email on a regular basis, but once the accounts are set up, you can access email whenever you connect via WiFi, or buy a one day data plan. I suggest you also get a gmail account, with this you can backup your contact list to your gmail account. If you ever lose the phone, or it breaks, you won't lose all that valuble contact information.Web browsing is reasonable, but expect to scroll around quite a bit, the screen is small. Text entry is a little challanging (again small screen), but if you flip the phone to landscape it is much better, even with my fat fingers. And certainly, it's much easier than the RAZR which used the old numeric pad entry system.Android runs pretty smoothly, I haven't noticed any lag on the phone, and the WiFi connection is fast and stable. I can use it anywhere in my house.As far as battery life, smartphones can drain batteries quickly if you don't configure them correctly. I suggest turning off Bluetooth, WiFi, and background sync (a real killer), and only enable them when needed. This is very easy to do (system app, settings). Also, don't use live wallpapers. They are cool to look at, but drain your battery. When I'm only using my phone, I don't have to charge it for several days. If you use WiFi or Bluetooth, be prepared to charge the phone daily. Also, when I use the music player at work, I charge the phone daily. All smartphones are like this. You just have to be aware.Overall I recommend this phone noting the limitations I discussed above. The phone is a great phone :), the music player and WiFi connectivity are a big plus, and the size is just right if you don't want a brick in your pocket.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive Debut", "Author": "J. Brock Angelo", "ReviewID": "R2Q9Y22252HYHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wrote a similar review over at T-Mobile, so thought I'd post it here too.This little guy is perfect for someone who uses a prepaid phone (not a smart phone) and has been using an iPod Touch to supplement their smartphone need. It runs Android 2.2 (Froyo) and it does an amazing job. Here's what contract smartphone users wouldn't like:The screen is small. Smaller than an iPod Touch 4G, but not too unlike the iPod Touch 3G. If you're coming from an iPhone 4, this screen will not feel as responsive, sharp, bright, etc. But that isn't to say its even a bad screen. Its just not a $400 screen.Out of the box, its fairly responsive; but like most (non-Apple) tech toys, you've gotta customize it a bit to get it running smoothly. I would recommend going into the Android Market and downloading LauncherPro. Think of this as a program to \"re-theme\" your home screen. Though that's not exactly what LauncherPro is. It will allow you to tweak a lot of the settings, and has a noticeably faster response than the default launcher.The battery on this puppy sucks. No other way around it. ** UPDATE: ** on average the charge lasts about 48 hours. ** If you are out in the woods all day, and are not near a car or power outlet, this won't do the job for you. The cable that comes with it is a mini-usb cable, and it includes a usb-wall adapter. If you are near power, you can use the included mini-usb cable and charge from a usb port on your computer or a wall outlet; or you can buy a usb car adapater if you don't have one already. I like mini-usb because its widely compatible with car chargers, computers, etc, but you have to make that call for yourself because the juice will run out each day.So what can you do about the battery? The same thing that I did on my iPod Touch: turn off all the extras. Turn off the GPS, turn off the 3G, turn off the bluetooth, and the auto-dim screen brightness. You can even go in and turn off vibrate for very specific things like: vibrate if on silent, don't vibrate with text, don't vibrate with new e-mail, etc. I don't think the battery thing is hopeless.Another question everyone wants to know: do I need the data plan? NO! This is a pre-paid phone, and that includes data. A daily web pass is just $1.49. If you plan on buying the web pass every day, you should upgrade to a nicer phone on a contract. If you are rarely going to use data because you are always in a wifi hotspot (like me), this is much more economical. I was an existing T-Mobile prepaid user. Before I turned on this phone, I put my sim card in it. It boots up, registers the device, and you are in business. The nice thing is, there isn't any way to accidentally start using the 3G. If there is wifi, this will slurp that up first. If there is no wifi, and you turn on the 3G, when you try to browse the web it will tell you that you need to buy the day pass for $1.49 before you can do anything. And when the day is up it prompts you again. I like that this is clear, and up-front. I'm much more likely to use this knowing that it is well-defined. Also if the wifi and 3G are on, it will use the wifi first if you don't have the day pass already.To me, this is a slam dunk. I don't use many cell phone minutes, and I am always in wifi. I would say it is definitely a strong entrance for smartphones in the prepaid market.Good luck!", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing prepaid smart phone.  Wifi works without network", "Author": "Optimist", "ReviewID": "RHK9LQVBRA3V2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking to upgrade from a flip-phone to a state-of-the-art smart-phone without 70 to 100 dollars a month charges, this one is great.  For less than the price of two month's service on a contract phone, this prepaid phone gives you virtually all the modern features.  And - if you have WiFi in your house/office, you won't even need to pay minutes to use the web (or the GPS/maps, or watching youtube, or playing music, or taking pictures, or getting directions to gas/food/lodging, or virtually anything this Android 2.2 phone has to offer !)  I've been playing with it for a day now, doing all of these things, and have not spent a penny of my prepaid money, except for the two one-minute test calls I made to try out the phone.  Of course, I will use some of these 3G things outside of my house/work, and will then have to use $1.49 for a \"day pass\" to the web.  But hey - even that's cheap if you don't do it every day.Those are the main points I wanted to add to the reviews.  But if you're interested in performance, here's my summary of that as well:1)  Voice sounds fine2)  Can't comment on coverage, but their map seems to show good coverage in most areas3)  The Android 2.2 user interface is great (I'd never used one before, but am an advanced computer user).  It probably is missing some things like the double-finger thingie for zooming, but who cares?  Just double-tap on a picture to zoom in or use the + icon that popus up momentarily on the screen.  Photos look great on it.4)  Taking photos is not great in dim light, but is fine otherwise5)  Have not taken or viewed any videos, except YouTube - which works fine.  Frame rate might be a little slow, and 16x9 videos are compressed horizontally, but otherwise its awesome.  (Youtube comes up in landscape mode - otherwise, the phone can operate in either portrait or landscape and the gravity vector sensor works flawlessly - with just the right delay)6)  Sound quality from the speaker is quite nice for such a small speaker system.  And volume seems pretty good.7)  It is plenty fast.  Dragging your finger to shift between screens is smooth and has no noticeable delay.  As one reviewer commented, it is a little slow booting up, but in theory you'd only do that once a day.  And I can wait 1.5 to 2 minutes for that.  Once it's on and sleeping (screen blanked, phone in standby), it comes on in about 0.5 seconds by tapping the button on the top.  Tap it again and its back in standby in 0.5 seconds or less.  That little button brings it in and out of standby with no fuss.8)  There's a popup keyboard of course, but you can also search the internet by speaking in words to the Google search bar.  And it works great without any training.  How cool is that?9)  GPS shows my house exactly where it should be on my street.10)  Size is small, but that's fine or even good.  I have had virtually no trouble using the touchscreen or reading the text - even though my eyesight is no longer the way it was when I was young.  And there's always glasses if you need them - just like reading a book.11)  Its an Android OS - so there is so much there that I better stop now.  There's no way to cover everything!So if you've been holding back on buying a Smart-Phone due to not wanting to layout $1K to $2K per year in contracts, but have been curious about learning what all the fuss is about.

Adobe requires 600 MHz or above, or something close to that, to run Flash 10.1, on top of Android 2.2. So Flash videos and other Flash content on websites do not work.

But I had to wait for 2 weeks since my order was back ordered (no wonder given the promotion).When I finally got hands on this little thing, I realized a versatile gadget just arrived!To sum up, it has (almost) all the features high-end smart phones brag about: android 2.2, mp3, wifi, bluetooth, gps, tethering, camera, etc.I don't want to repeat the known features one by one. Here are a few things I am really pleasantly surprised.1. Tethering: once connected to 3G of Tmobile, Comet can be used as a portable Wi-Fi hotspot. I bought a one-day web pass from Tmobile for $1.50 and tried this feature out. It works like a charm. My can easily configure the wifi name, password within Comet. My laptop nearby then sees strong signal so it can connect to Internet through the phone. A quick speedtest reports 4000kps+ download speed also. I will never need to pay hotel $20 for Internet access anymore, ever!  The downside: T-mobile does cap the speed once you reach certain quota (30M?) per day. I did notice the speed drops later on.2. GPS. The default Navigation app works perfect. On a road drive, Comet can quickly pick up GPS signal and pinpoint my location in the map. Destination input becomes as easy as a builtin google search. The Navigation app shows not only map, but with detailed lane information, and with colored roads to indicate traffic information (the similar traffic layer in Google map).  The app also gives out voice instructions about turns. Comet can easily serve as a backup/(even a replacement if I buy a car holder) to my old Garmin 255W GPS.  I think Garmin  should really worry about this:  where is the market for a dedicated GPS device when even a low-end smartphone can have comparable/better GPS functions integrated?Enough positives. Here are some downside:1. the battery can be better. If you turn on GPS, 3G, use camera quite often, the battery will drain out in 5 hours or less.  But this maybe a universal problem for all smartphones.2. The speed is slow sometimes.

Much more seriously, when I have a long phone call (ten minutes or more) the phone gets so hot that I have to hold it away from my ear.  I have no landline to use instead.When I called in the first week of January, I informed T-Mobile of the problems, especially my worry about the heating up.  The customer service rep agreed that I needed a replacement battery and one would be sent right away.  The battery never came.I called again.  I was told that they didn't have any batteries in stock, and they told me to go to a local store, get one there and that the cost would be credited to my account.

From the store I called T-Mobile tech support.  Joe, in tech support promised me that he would order one as soon as we got off the phone.  On Feb 10th I got a text message that the equipt. order was being processed, that I would get the battery in 3 business days, and I would get an E-Mail with a tracking number when it shipped. Guess what, folks -- no E-Mail, no battery....Last Thursday (the 24th)  I called again.  I was told that the order had been placed by Joe, and they had \"no idea\" why the battery hadn't been sent. They put in a new \"rush\" order, promising to get the battery to me by today, Wednesday, priority shipping at their expense. On the 26th I got that same text message saying that the order was being processed, and that I would get an E-Mail, etc. Well, guess what -- no E-Mail; so, the only thing I can believe is that, once again, T-Mobile is not sending me a battery. Clearly there is something very wrong with this battery/phone. T-Mobile's failure to correct the problem after repeated requests from me leads me to believe they simply don't care.  I am beginning to wonder -- is there something wrong with the Comet itself and T-Mobile is stalling me?

Rourke \"word4word\"", "ReviewID": "R32YDJ6YM0EBQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I might have chosen another, but it was my upgrade time with T-Mobile, and got the Comet for next to nothing. Prior to this phone, I tried to make BlackBerry-land make sense, first with the Pearl, then with the flip 8220. I took the plunge and went for a totally new experience. First off, (and I have to be honest), there IS one non-insurmountable negative feature, namely the keyboard being small and hard to tap the right character. Luckily, the Comet has the \"landscape\" option, which nearly doubles the size of the keyboard, but it is still on the small side. And that \"Swype\" method of input nearly drove me over the edge while trying to learn it. For a user to type quickly and correctly, he/she must have the layout memorized, and use a swiping method to spell the words, change case, use alt characters and wind up with a legible message. I choose to use the Android keyboard, in spite of its size. But it lets you save each word to build a dictionary which makes each additional message/email much faster, with practice.Slightly bothersome is the camera, but I didn't buy this phone to be a camera, so as long as I know its limitations (no flash, but 4 choices of alternate lighting conditions) I can live with it.PRO'S: the sides have a non-slip, rubbery type of material which makes it easier to hold. It comes with a ton of apps, plus there are literally thousands of apps available on the Android network, There's no complicated download scenario; you just push an \"install\" button and go your merry way. Multiple simultaneous downloads work quietly in the background and when installed, you get a notification. Be careful when exploring new apps, as many of them are not free, but if you find one you love, the majority of prices run from .99 to $2.99. There are some that are quite expensive, but you don't get tricked into buying something that causes you to take a second mortgage on your home. One of my favorites is the Scanner Radio which lets you listen to multiple events: airline control tower, police, and several more. Also, the Comet can be configured to talk, so you don't need to read emails, messages, notes, etc. Just kick back and a very nice lady reads the info to you. There is so much more to the comet: GPS (fast and accurate and free), many music players that let you upload and download songs (mostly from other users collections, but not far removed from the pay for everything download demons).I think I've made my point, and DO recommend the Comet for a first Android phone. I hope you will download and print the 65-page PDF user manual. It takes you step by step from beginning to end, so by the time you are done you will have a sound understanding of the phone. And then, guess what? The manual covers only the beefy basics, and further exploration will yield many more features and gadgets. It's a fun phone that you can actually use as a portable game-base. And it's a sophisticated work-horse that meshes beautifully with your PC and network.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT!", "Author": "Muntz", "ReviewID": "R3BCMEB6E1FW4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Tmobile comet is a great little phone. I was actually surprised by the size of the phone at first. Compared to my old sidekick, this thing felt like a feather. But it is a solid phone, and the screen, while much smaller than other smart phones, seems to fit this phone perfectly. The size does make traditional keyboard texting tough, especially with fat fingers, but the new swype technology eliminates the need for traditional typing. The inbox holds ridiculous amount of texts messages, however, I found that if I allow it to hold 300 messages or more the phone tends to slow down a little. So limiting the number of texts that the phone saves will keep the phone running smoothly. No dropped calls, bluetooth works great, wireless is very strong.

I think I'm faster at typing now on this phone than my old phone with predictive text, and I was pretty fast before.I really like the directional button in the middle bottom. I'm really not ready to go 100% to a touch screen, plus the directional button makes using applications like Kindle for Android a lot easier to secretly use during boring meetings than if I had to swipe the screen every time I wanted to turn a page.It slowed down a lot for me as soon as I put a bunch of applications and other stuff on it, so I had to be pretty vigilant about cleaning off the stuff I didn't use from this phone. There's only 256 MB of memory total for the phone to use, and not everything can be moved to the SD card.

Tmobile officially will give the unlock code if certain conditions are met, but my practical experience with them, and I saw reflections of this on the web, is that it doesn't happen so easily. After wasting hours (I think without exaggeration) trying to get the unlock code from them, I gave up on dealing with them, and I resorted to unlocking services online. The cheaper services aren't able to unlock it - [one of them charged me, and claimed that they would reimburse me, did not give me back the money until I was about to report them to paypal, then a message popped up that they would immediately give me back the money - no questions asked - and they did!]. Finally for about $20 I was able to unlock it with cellunlocker.net but it took them I think around 4 days to get me the code (but it was over the weekend).The phone works nicely, except of course as mentioned by many before the camera isn't very good - the objects appear remote and it doesn't capture their details - [and that's why I only rated the phone a 4 because I think that nowadays a camera is kind of integral to a good phone], and although it works smoothly, I'm kind of disappointed with android 2.2 and the apps (e.g. a song that you have in the regular music app. can not be sent via bluetooth! - on the web I saw people trying to figure that out. there are however other apps. that let you), I was expecting it to be a more computer like operating system, where I can find all my files and songs etc., but it doesn't work that way, you can just use apps.. Hopefully they'll improve in the near future. From what I understand this phone has almost all the functions, capabilities, and features as the other smartphones that are being sold for much much more, so it is kind of a service (of course very soon with the growing markets I'm sure all the prices are going to come down).

I was really excited when it arrived, and since it was my first smartphone, I was really impressed.  For $100 (no contract) I got a device that could run some apps, store a few music albums, basic email and VERY basic web browsing.  It can also create, connect to, and tether via WiFi networks, with or without encryption.  It also supports bluetooth, although I never used this feature.  Of all the features, however, the best one was the GPS navigation.  The included Google navigator will play your music in the background and interrupt the music to dictate directions to you, so you'll never get confused with a map.  This alone was immensely helpful for me, although it basically requires an unlimited data plan.I would not recommend this phone if you want a fully functional smartphone.  The Comet can run apps and store whatever you want it to, but it won't be handling 3-d software, dynamic web pages, nor will it be able to handle too many apps or too much music.  The battery is minimal; it must be faithfully charged each night unlike many other phones.  Last of all, my T-mobile comet just broke after 7 months of almost never dropping it.

So I chose a cheap phone.Well it seemed to work for he first few days then the battery started wearing out within 24 hours I wasn't on the internet and hardly talked on the phone. After 4 days of hoping it was a temporary problem with the battery I decided to return it. I would finds apps running that I knew I wasn't using, I see now that just hitting the back button alone isn't enough even if you don't connect to the web. I find that also tapping the phone off button helps, at least I am not going back and finding apps running which is probably a major reason why the battery is wearing out so quickly. I returned the phone for a replacement after a gruelling experience with T Mobile customer service.Their customer service is iffy. I suspect that they returned the same phone to me because it had all the same apps on the home page, a brand new phone comes with no favorites set on it alreday and certainly not the exact ones I had on it.

This phone is an early android model (2010 i believe)so there is not a lot of memory so your phone starts lagging if you download many apps but you can expand it to 32gb! and transfer data and application memory into your memory card which is good. I believe this phone is for the kind of people that aren't big on apps but still need the basic ones like google maps, perhaps a chase app, a weather app,.. i would not recommend this phone to people accustomed to downloading a bunch of worthless games, and apps such as how to make pasta recipes from scratch when you've obviously never even boiled an egg in your life(so most teenagers pretty much--this phone is not for you). The speakers on the phone are pretty loud although the mp3 with headphones is definitely not as loud as an ipod, but I guess that's a good thing. You can open up word documents which is great and although the phone lags sometimes if your running too many applications it is not that bad.

And of course with the 'voice input' set to show the mic on the keyboard, most of the time I can just speak the message I wish to send.Most smartphones are just too big for me to want to tote around all day.

I had shied away from e-books, but with the aldiko reader installed - and after choosing the proper font - reading books even on the Comet's tiny screen is no problem at all.The downsides as most other reviewers have mentioned - the camera sucks.

Now I'm saving up for another. Over the year apps have updated and become larger. With the phone's miniscule internal memory, and all the apps that can't be moved to the SD card, I have had to remove all the apps I want to use in order to make space for the apps I don't use but CAN'T remove (even with root). I'm struggling to keep the minimum amount of space available - once I get the \"low space\" warning, everything stops working - and every day one of the irremovable apps updates. I then have to uninstall the update, but I can't remove the app and can't stop it from updating so before long it updates itself again.Without being able to use any apps I want to use, the phone is little different from a dumbphome, and when that one app updates even grooveip won't work. So basically I end up using my computer to make calls and the phone has become a paperweight.If ALL you want to do is make regular phonecalls, it works for that. But $10 phones at walmart will do that too.ORIGINAL REVIEW:4 starsWhen I decided I wanted an Android phone that worked with T-Mobile prepaid, I thought I would have to spend about $400 on an unlocked phone. I was overjoyed to find this affordable T-Mobile prepaid phone! It runs all the apps I want to run. Barcode scanning apps, games, streaming video, streaming music, etc. all work great!Not only is it prepaid, thanks to the wifi and GrooVe IP, I am barely using any prepaid minutes! T-Mobile prepaid already had my phone bill at $15 per month, and this phone has taken it down to about $3.I do have two issues with this phone that stopped it from being 5 star. One is that the volume buttons only work at certain times - I can't just press them while on the homescreen to turn sounds up and down - and getting to the software volume controls is cumbersome. This may be a flaw of Android and not the phone, though. I have a tablet with an older version of Android, and the volume buttons work any time, so I'm not sure. The other issue is that if the screen is on while I'm in a call, my face presses buttons. However, that is easily solved by using speaker phone, and I prefer to use that anyway.These issues are minor, and the great price of this phone added to the fact that it is Android and has wifi makes it totally worth dealing with those minor annoyances.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "good small web phone", "Author": "pascal", "ReviewID": "R2P9DO8SVA5GLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light weight and size for a web phone.Battery use problem fixed by turning off background data (Menu->Settings->Accounts&Sync-;>BackgroundData).Android 2.2 is competitive with Apple iphone software (previous Android versions were too slow and inconsistent).Includes wifi, useful at home or work, so I only buy an occasional day use web plan.Total cost will be less than $15 a month over two years.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good idea - disappointing results", "Author": "William K. Fry \"Keven\"", "ReviewID": "R1GX479WT7B7CB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about 10 months, and have used it only for infrequent texting and very little talking. I thought it had great potential to supply what I needed in a phone. I have had particular problems which I wanted to show in a review for others to consider before buying this phone - the T-Mobile Comet.The major problem with this phone is that it has very short battery life. I have several games installed on the phone which I considered playing while riding the bus, but quit because of the heavy drain on the battery whenever the phone is used, because if the screen is lit, the battery drains quickly.I use Task Killer to eliminate as much as possible functions working in the background. Then I open the \"Running Services\" and stop everything possible from running - all to conserve battery life. WiFi is always turned off as is the sound. I never access the internet with this phone. Still I have to recharge the phone within 12 to 14 hours or the battery will be completely drained.I have two batteries, the original and a recently purchased back-up battery. This issue is the same, regardless of which battery is in the phone. The only function I keep running in the background is Bluetooth.One other issue that is very annoying is the use of texting with the Comet. The keyboard is on the touch screen, and is so small that it is practically impossible to type on it without frequent erasures for incorrect letters.Swype is my method of choice for texting, but I frequently have to re-send texts with corrections for the many errors created by the stupid choices that Swype makes in word selection. It seems to often prefer words that don't exist when not giving me a list of words to choose from when I swype some simple, common word such as \"to\". It also has the very annoying habit of opening a stupid dialog box every time I choose a word other than the first choice in the drop-down box. All-in-all, swyping is a very slow way of texting, whereas it should be faster than typing.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rooted and Custom ROM", "Author": "toy4x4", "ReviewID": "R1BVC43O8HG7H8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First thing I did was root the phone and then install Fusionideosgoogle \"Huawei Ideos U8150 custom rom AndytheAndroid\"Much faster but I did not expect a high end device.

This thing is like a junkie when it comes to using data.  I got the 1500 minutes/30 GB data plan.  I burned up all my data allowance in 2 weeks without barely using it.  The only way to really control the data usage is to turn off data completely when your not using it or get the unlimited plan.  Even that has its drawbacks.  Turning the data on and off seems to make the phone unstable.  It takes forever for the data to come up when you turn it back on.  Turning the phone completely on and off seems to help once in a while, if you don't mind waiting 10 minutes for the phone to fire up each time.
