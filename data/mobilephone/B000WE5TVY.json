{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, but...very raw.", "Author": "Val Cosmos \"Citizen of Universe\"", "ReviewID": "R1HFIYBG6R43QO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got it. And these are the problems:-Keypad buttons are too hard to press, i have a sore on my thumb already.-Equalizer settings on MP3 player go to default each time I start the application. Very annoying!-No capability to work with files like on  W810i before. Files have very limited  options to assign.-Flash in the camera sometimes goes weak, so the pictures are very dark.  Other than that the phone is good, i like the sensor buttons on the bottom of the screen. But i need to get rid of it. Unless they release the firmware that will correct all the bugs. I think i can leave with the sore on my thumb, women might find it a trait of masculanity. Lol.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "5.0 mega good", "Author": "D.

Great photos, full frame video lots of extras for the price.  The phone MSS and Internet had to be unlocked by Sony though, in order to use it on AT&T.; Touch screen works well but not as multi-functional as the Iphone. Make sure you get a case and the 4Gb micro card for extra files.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "5.0 MP CAMERA\nHSDPA 3.5 G\nBLUETOOTH\ntouch screen", "Name": "SONY ERICSSON K850i UNLOCKED W/ 512 MB CARD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nF7kORZlL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000WE5TVY"}}
