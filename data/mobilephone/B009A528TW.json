It was shipped on the due date, except it was late at night. Also, when I was calling the person on the other end would hear a buzzing sound when I wasn't talking(so it malfunctioned). But it has a radio, and you can put 2 SIM cards in at one time! I didn't use both slots, but I guess it could be handy for some people. Also, as you can imagine, it is very hard to text! I have a flip-phone, and it isn't any better. I'm looking forward to getting a smart phone or an iPod, because I love to txt. So overall, it isn't a bad phone, as long as it doesn't malfunction on you!", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009A528TW"}}
