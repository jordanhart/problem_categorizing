{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for a good price", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R1IVDA4MSJVGTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this phone.  I bought it because I had work in South Africa for 3 months and needed something that I could put a local sim card in.  I like this phone so much that I think I will keep it and use it when I get back to the States.-Calls are both reliable and clear which I think is the most important thing(it is a phone first after all)-The keyboard takes some getting used to but I think I now prefer it to either a qwerty(takes up too much space w/ too small of buttons for fingers like mine), a touch screen(same finger problem) or a regular keypad.  I don't have excessively large hands but I def do have \"man\" hands so I find many things are not built with me in mind.  If this is not your case then you can disregard this part but I find that many of the men I work with and my friends tend to have similar issues.-I didn't really want a flip phone either but now that I have one I am becoming a fan(no pocket dialing or key locking etc.)-Battery life is good.  I turned on the music player and left it on speaker to see how long it would take to drain the thing and after 4 hrs and less than half the battery gone gave up.-Camera isn't that great but is more than adequate for a phone like this.-I like that I can turn off data services and keep wi-fi on so that I don't get clipped in the US for a blackberry plan and can still use data from wi-fi(obviously not as great if you don't have regular wi-fi spots but if data is that important to you then you can always purchase the plan)-The screen isn't that big(it is more than adequate though)  It is bright and crisp-Interface is good and I like having a smaller phone with the blackberry ball-Music production quality is really good and doesn't drain the battery(see above) plus the ability to expand the memory is nice.-Basic memory included is really not adequate if you are going to actually use this as a blackberry or music phone but I picked up a microSD 4gb for less than $10 and am so far happy so plan on buying a card-Phone seems pretty durable but I haven't had it that long so I will update this as I go-I have read some reviews about the phone being to slow or not working etc. I think this is prob a hardware issue that would be covered as long as you buy one with a warranty.  I think it is also the effect of the 1 in 1000 customers who get a bad phone to be unhappy enough to write a review while 999 ppl who are content won't.-This is NOT a smartphone but it does do what you need it too.  Personally I don't want a phone that is too big just so I can do inadequate work on it.  I can do the basics of what I need to while on the go and if I need to do something serious I will sit down and pull out my laptop.  That is my preference though.All in all a great phone for a reasonable price.  I would highly recommend it to anyone either traveling or just looking for an unlocked phone in the U.S.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry primer...", "Author": "Tomasa Tomasa", "ReviewID": "R2ING1MPK58DB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background: If you do your research on this phone (and other BlackBerry's) you will note that many people talk about the bugs/problems, etc. Many of these complaints are hardware based (bad chips, etc) NOT software based (although it may seem so).Make sure that if you buy it, you can return it (if bad) with no hassles/restocking fees (example: Amazon and sold by Amazon).Condition: Mines was like new (with covered screens), original box, USB cable, power cable, original CD (there's an update online), headset and small instruction booklet (does not look original). Mines had no software/hardware issues (no rebooting, no Bluetooth issues, no slowdowns, etc).The advantages in general of the blackberry's are the great screen (geared for text readers) and the keyboard.The bad is the Blackberry \"WiFi situation\": they want you to buy the \"blackberry internet plan\" which is a hookup with your cell phone provider. Cell phone providers will have different names for this plan but note that it will cost you in the US around $15-$20. If you have a prepaid plan they will tell you the plan is not available (unless you have a monthly plan). I don't recommend this plan (if you can get it) because I consider it a ripoff. That will probably be the biggest issue with this phone (and all blackberry's).The workaround: If you want to use Wi-Fi they will use a combination of WiFi and GPRS/EDGE. For example when you try to use the BlackBerry GMail app from Google you will be able to install it halfway but when it tries to connect it will tell you, you need a connection. If you disable your data connection (GPRS/EDGE) you will get the same result and so on and so forth with different applications.To get around this BlackBerry Wi-Fi situation you have to get applications that are not exactly BlueBerry approved (and you will probably not see in their new store) that allow you to use Wi-Fi ONLY and not a combination Wi-Fi/GRPS/EDGE (again they use EDGE/GPRS to check if you have the BlackBerry Plan if you don't they don't give you access). For example for GMail I use LogicMail (uses Wi-Fi only), UberTwitter, Opera Mini, Yahoo Mail (you have to use their website) with the Opera Mini browser because you won't be able to use it with the BlackBerry browser (these are the only ones I found that I installed).Final review: Great phone, almost perfect form factor and screen (recommended 7 point font), almost perfect for SMS/MMS/emailing. Wi-Fi, Keyboard is better than a standard number keyboard but NOT better than a full keyboard (of course). If you can deal with the Wi-Fi issue (and sub par and very limited apps compared to the IPhone or even Windows Mobile phone) then this is a GREAT phone!", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buying a smartphone without data plan", "Author": "Sarvana \"Shine\"", "ReviewID": "R2CSUMG1SWJNB7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initially I was looking to buy a smartphone from cellphone service providers. Now a days pretty much of them are making dataplan as mandatory. Then I found this unlocked phone in Amazon, price seems to be acceptable compared of other websites. I never had problem with any of the Amazon site products. So I ordered one.BBPearl is very stylish phone, has all the necessary features, I liked the keypad size, feature to connect Wifi and display. It requires extra care since even small scratch will spoil the look of it.

Behrens", "ReviewID": "R36730WVXFA3NN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this as an upgrade for my Motorola Razr V3t.  Initially I liked this phone, the UMA (Unlicensed Mobile Access) was a huge win for me, as I have crummy cell coverage at home and at work, but great 802.11b/g/n at both locations.  The predictive text is nice.But after the newness wore off, the more I began hating this phone.  Here's why:1) At least a 2-10 second pause when you're dialing a number before the phone responds, and even then it somehow drops a digit or two.  You're just better off pressing a number, waiting for the phone to think about it, deleting the numbers, and then dial what number you wanted in the first place.2) Battery life is miserable.  The battery on the Razr lasted far longer than this--and it's a shame, especially when you look at the battery sizes.3) Crashes frequently.  It isn't a surprise anymore when I take the phone off the charger in the morning to find that I have to remove the battery and force a full reboot of the phone--and then the 15 minute wait for it to be usable.4) Bluetooth a)It died on this phone, and luckily it was under warranty from T-Mobile, so they replaced it--after a bit of fighting with them over it. (Included completely reloading the phone from a base image and so on..)  Apparently it was a known issue by RIM (obvious on their forums), but no real action from them to fix it. b) The amount of time it takes to sync with a paired headset is crazy slow.  No other phone that I have used takes this long to sync with an already paired headset.5) Boot times is crazy... my old 486 PC boots faster than this phone.  And even then it's far more responsive than this phone.6) Web-surfing over wi-fi is slow.  My old Razr did a better job than this, and a web browser on it was an afterthought at best.7) If you are a mac user, the blackberry desktop at least works, and allows you to sync with the address book and iCal, but the Blackberry app world isn't useful from a web browser on your mac.  As all of the downloads require ActiveX.  I sent a complaint to RIM about this and they told me to contact my carrier.  Lovely.So in the end if you get this phone for free, and needed a phone, I suppose it can function for ya.  But at the first chance you get I would give it away.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Less than expected", "Author": "Leonel Alberto Rincon Ocando", "ReviewID": "R11VD05VBIZQTM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The OEM Shop is missleading customers by declaring this article new when in fact is a remanufactured product. I've been using this cel phone since the december 20th and from the very begining is has been slower than the BB pearl 8100 I used to have, even though this one is supposed to be a better phone. Today I decided to write this review because finally I realized that is a very bad phone. Since january 17th is having trouble, it started to \"think\" showing a clock on the screen and it just stays that way for hours (like a not responding PC)and is happening more often ever since. I take the battery off and then restart it but it just doesn't work. Today I had to try reinstalling the software and all, so lets see how it goes, but for time being I'm not satisfied with this product.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst phone ever", "Author": "Z\u00e9 Ricardo", "ReviewID": "R2OJHCO4SFX4RN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was pretty excited to get offered this phone for free as a replacement for my Nokia 6086 - we use T-Mobile hotspot@home and needed a phone that would be wi-fi compatible and allow me to continue to use that service. (Actually for a few hours T-Mobile stonewalled and told me that there were no more phones available that could do this. When I threatened to quit, they offered me the Blackberry 8220.)I can safely say that I have never hated a phone so completely and so acutely that it simultaneously made me want to smash it to bits and then shove a knife into my own forehead myself out of utter frustration. I suspect that I could not actually stand on the street and successfully smash it to bits because this phone will generally not let you do anything that you want to do, and its Byzantine menu system would somehow prevent you from doing any of the intended damage whatsoever.Let's say something positive about this phone. The wi-fi works most of the time pretty well. When I get home, it automatically connects me to the wi-fi network so that I can make my calls without them counting against my monthly minute limit. And generally, as a phone and text messaging device, it works.I have nothing else positive to say. I dread picking this piece of crap up every time I need to make a call, because:* The software is incredibly slow and clunky. There is a slight delay when you're punching in numbers to dial (Note: this is geneally understood to be the primary purpose of a phone. Touch tone phones from the 1970s do not have a delay, but you will find this one particularly infuriating.) Every command seems to be beamed off the dark side of the moon before it is executed.* You will never find the setting or icon that you are looking for by logic. There is no logic to when you have a menu, what you can do in that menu, or how to find what you need to do. Try changing your ringtone and you will see how much experience with this piece of junk software that Blackberry has designed to actually get there and do it. It's one of the most basic things that phone users need to do, but they have buried it quite effectively.* The battery life is abysmal. I have taken pretty good care of this battery but if I don't plug it in every night I would have almost no juice left by morning, even if I hardly talk at all during the day and just have it on standby.* There are two options for texting, prediction and double tap. The prediction is so painful to use because you have to switch between keys and the scroll wheel CONSTANTLY that I use double-tapping. Which takes forever to type anything in.* The phone's time will slip behind from real time over the weeks and months. Ask the phone to get the time from the network - it will do it for a while, then start forgetting it again.* I don't use it to access the internet - I did get a free month to do that, and it was very very very slow, even when there was apparently a strong network connection.* The pictures it takes look pretty junky, even on the highest settings.* Making the phone silent takes a few steps, and there is no way to select a custom profile so that, say, it vibrates AND rings for calls, in case you are mowing the lawn or something. You have the menu option there under Advanced to potentially do this, but the phone does not let you.* When you missed a call, there is a little red light that comes on - but just for a while. After that you just glance at the phone to see if you've missed anything - it always shows green, so that you have apparently missing nothing at all. Nice feature. Then when you open the phone, you have to say OK to notifications of a missed call or a voice mail. You say OK, but that does nothing. It is so incredibly annoying to have to say OK every frigging time for no purpose whatsoever. When this happens, I want to take a Philips head screwdriver and hit that OK button on the screen really hard, for once and for all. It will never again ask me if that is \"OK.\" This phone is not \"OK.\"", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Piece of junk!", "Author": "Oscar Lopez", "ReviewID": "R333BFUEDRUP2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "worthless ...if you are interested in a flip phone, you are better off buying a prepaid phone at target. overpriced piece of crap! stay awayyyy!", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I was expecting from Amazon.", "Author": "Stacy Lynn", "ReviewID": "R2O3M1ABZEYFB0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Description clearly says this phone is unclocked.

But as far as making and receiving calls and sending and receiving sms messages it works great.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Well rounded phone.", "Author": "Jonathan Tilley", "ReviewID": "R1CX2TIB18YP6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been through quite a few Blackberries in my time.
