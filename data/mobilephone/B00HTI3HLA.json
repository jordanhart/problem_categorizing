{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dont know what the big deal is.....", "Author": "janel", "ReviewID": "R1HVXAL40HNARA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about two weeks ago. It said I would receive it with standard shipping in a month. I received it in a week. When I opened it the box said it was an android note II. A Galaxy Note II is somewhere between 300-400 dollars and I refuse to pay that for a phone. This phone was well priced and I have NO problems with it. It works good for straight talk. I also purchased the straight talk sim card so it would work. there were instructions it was very easy to do. Now the transfer process did take about three hours but as soon as they did the transfer this phone was able to call out but I still received calls on the old phone untill the full three hours was up. I have no complaints. I can download from google play, both my cameras work. One of my friends just bought this same phone. So far it was a great deal for people who dont have to have the name.....", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "carol salsbury", "ReviewID": "R3PORAB4ITQZYF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i gave this a 4 star just because my home button broke, i was going to send it back and get a refund, but i have changed my mind maybe i can buy a new button for it, it works just as a cell phone would, texting ,calling, game play , pictures are great, internet, bluetooth, it does not feel fake at all, slightly heavy,at this moment it works better than my atrix 2 , i would buy from this buyer again no doubt.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Clone of a Clone=)", "Author": "Chris Swiontek", "ReviewID": "R1NCHL1M5Y8JB3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "first off...this is a android 2.3 os phone {not 4.2.1 or 4.0 anything} ,it runs on a hacked firmware called MocorDroid ,that is used to give FAKE SPECS when you look at the properties of the phone.The  firmware is modified to lie about  its processor ID and available system ram . this  ISNT EVEN A REAL \"STAR\" cellphone ,its a clone of it made by \"CUBIT\"  the ACTUAL spec of this phone are as follows:  -Arm Cortex -A5 SINGLE CORE cpu  - 256mb of system ram {not 512mb as seller listed}  - 127mb of internal STORAGE! {not 2gb  as seller listed}  - NO GPS! {the phone DOES NOT even have a GPS chip in it at all }  - THE Camera on back is actually VGA 300K/640X480 interpolated / not 2mp as seller listed {very bad image quality}  - The Front camera is actually 320x240 pixels /  NOT 2MP as seller listed  - Records video at 320x240 pixels at 15 frames per sec /NOT 2MP VIDEO RECORDING as seller listed  - NOT A \"Star N9000 I9220 cell phone\" / as seller listed ! {it is actually a \"Cubit N9770\" PHONE!}  - this is a Spreadtrum based phone!  nOW....is it worth $99.98 {what i paid without shipping from this seller}....Maybe? i mean really,what do you expect for less than 100 buks? so in that aspect ,i dont feel so bad buying it, but i was really EXPECTING THE STAR PHONE this seller is actually advertising . {i should have known it was to good to be the real  thing at this price, the real \"star I9220 \" this seller is FALSELY advertising is about 50 buks more} i Guess this seller didnt think  people would notice or care  because it was so cheap in price, but I NOTICED!Cosmetically , it looks IDENTICAL to the real this, but inside ,its not even close.if u just need a cheap 5\" phone to make calls and look fancy ,this would do , But otherwise,save up your money and buy a REAL \"Star cell\" from a seller who ACTUALLY HAS THE REAL THING.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "worthless", "Author": "Myasia Gregg", "ReviewID": "R3Q1QQXLUZ0KO4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I  HATE this phone it is not a good phone it is a clone of a clone my friend has dual phone that's similar to this one but it works way better and you cant really tell that its a clone so I wouldn't recommend anyone getting this crap and the front and back camera sucks and there is no phone cases to fit this crap", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "gosh", "Author": "traci dargan", "ReviewID": "R3VRE9AHYZ2Y3I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone move slow while on internet and any other things that has to use internet service.
