{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Old Faithful", "Author": "Finney", "ReviewID": "R24Q065XANUMOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service.What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone).The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color.The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine.The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch.The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it.I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone \"flair\" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well.This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERIZON BUYERS BEWARE OF OLDER PHONES", "Author": "Roger Williams", "ReviewID": "R3CD4BYNT4DA46", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon.Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for \"Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..\").If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not.NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone.NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought. Different products, exact same problem.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "no problems", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R23UJ0XYXH90TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything as expected, no problems.

I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does.  The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple  things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages.  I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store.  So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon.  They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone.  I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing.  As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new.I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network.$80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love the Light Weight Slim Design of the Verizon Wireless Razr", "Author": "Monica", "ReviewID": "R66C368OYVMMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this phone always have since Verizon first came out with the Motorola RAZR V3m.Nice and slim fits in my jeans pocket nicely.Great sound loaded with features.GREAT!

My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone.  We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time.  I \"upgraded\" both phones online without any issues.  We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones.  I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans.  We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone.  I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to.  I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans.  Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly.I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones.  Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now.  Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much).  Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones.  It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from \"Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)\" to \"Legacy/unsupported phone.  Don't waste your time to try again\".  If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet.  If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end.  Again, my online \"upgrade/replacement\" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine.  I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones).  At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant.Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars.  Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "it worked", "Author": "brent ja goebel", "ReviewID": "R2YZURZ604BCZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it came in the mail very quickly but its a mediocre phone i know it was going to be but its all i  can afford", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "RAZR's are the best", "Author": "Kathe J Bachtel", "ReviewID": "R3V0KIMBOSH26X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can find no other cell phone as durable as the RAZR.
