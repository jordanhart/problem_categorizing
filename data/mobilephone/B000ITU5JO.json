I needed a simple, easy to use phone as a carry around cell phone. It was veryinexpensive,  and simple. I use it and don't have to worry about loosing it or dropping it. It meets all my needs in a dirt cheap phone. I do wish it had better volume. It's not loud by any means. That is my only complaint.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "IT WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD!", "Author": "Hal Croft \"TRUCKER HAL\"", "ReviewID": "RE1Q433A7AENS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "IT DOES WHAT A CELL PHONE IS SUPPOSED TO DO - IT'S A REALLY GOOD, A LITTLE BIT BASIC, PHONE!", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
