The extra 8 GB is good for music, media files, etc.I use this phone primarily for work because we push email, calendar, contacts from work email to the phone via a mobile solution.  The problem is that the phone has only 25 MB of primary storage so I cannot keep more than 3 days of email on the phone; otherwise memory will be low and you can't do anything with it when it runs out of primary storage.If you are buying this phone for entertainment uses, it is great choice.  If you are buying it for professional related use such as work email, it is not due to the 25 MB of primary storage.  You need to ge a phone with at least 64 - 128 MB of primary storage in order to store some decent amount of email on your phone.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good value for its price", "Author": "OnlyShopOnline", "ReviewID": "R89TITVSUN1FD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got immediately going with this phone..

Totally worth it.. Graphics are too good and 3-D sound quality is awesome. There is some lag in starting applications (eg: Yahoo Go!) but it is not significant given the size of certain applications.

M.", "ReviewID": "R2ARAAB3GI17CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was amazed when I learned that I could buy this jewel at such a low price! So I immediately ordered it, and I was very satisfied at how fast it got here. The phone itself is amazing: the wifi is a huge plus, and the Symbian operating system is something that I wouldn't be able to live without.A few pros:- WIFI!!- quad-band, so you can basically use it anywhere in the world (needs SIM card)- amazing set of features for a low price- great battery life - up to 3 days if I talk for approximately an hour, use the wifi a little bit and play the game boy advance emulator for a couple of hours.- very cool design- nicely built, the sliding mechanism seems solid- the music quality - simply extraordinary!! (this should have been the first one in the list, the music part of this phone is incredible. The speakers are very loud for a handheld device)- the hands-free is really good- 8GB of memory. Why would you ever need more?!- the screen is perfect, very big and good enough even for watching videos on it. Web pages are easily read, even if there is a lot of text.- the gaming aspect - it's very convenient to have those gaming buttons on top of the screen. They are comfortable and do not seem prone to damage.- The operating system - you can install anything you want on this phone! To list a few, you can have Google maps, Youtube, Skype, and a whole bunch of emulators (Game boy, Game boy advance, NES, SNES... whatever you can think of :)- the SIP option - you can call for free over a WLAN network. I am listing this one here because it is a big plus, although you will also find it in \"cons\" because I could not set it up.- the speed at which it does everything. You don't have to wait for anything, you simply click on it and it opens. I previously had a Symbian 7 phone, and it was painfully slow compared to this one.- the ability to synchronize all your contacts and text messages, etc, from your old phone to this one. There is a pre-installed app on the phone that does it all for you, in a flash.- the second camera for video calls, although I don't know when I'll actually get to use that one.- the N-gage games! How could I forget this one :) They are pretty good, and there's a whole bunch of new games coming up, so if you are a gamer you will enjoy that.Cons:- I had trouble synchronizing my Windows Media Player playlists with the phone. Either I could put my songs in a folder on the memory card, but without transferring the playlist file (so I only had a huge number of songs, but not arranged in any order), or I would have the playlist file, but all the songs would go directly into the root of the memory card, which would probably slow down the phone eventually.- the buttons are not very convenient for typing text (compared to my old 6600); also, I keep pressing the \"play\" button accidentally, which is annoying because it starts to play music loud all of a sudden and startles everyone around.- the camera is quite bad. This is not a problem for me, since I don't use it anyway, but if you want a nice camera then do not buy this phone. It really takes crappy pictures, with bad colours (kind of greenish), and quite flaky. I even feel like the front camera for video calls takes better pictures, even though the one on the back has a higher resolution. The flash is useless, too. The videos it makes are pretty good though, with a nice framerate and not choppy at all.- as I already mentioned, I could not set up the internet calling. It always says \"registration failed\", while everything works fine on my PC. However, you need to have a wifi network in range to be able to use SIP, so it's not useful for everyone - so probably it won't matter to you that much. It is nice to use it at home or in the office - you could save quite a lot of money by calling over the net.", "Date": "April 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "WHAT A NICE PHONE - GET ROLLED", "Author": "Mario Moran \"mono_maister\"", "ReviewID": "R2EKSQ3XSZXEWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice product, a very nice phone (or should I say \"very nice ALL-IN-ONE PHONE\"?), I gotta tell you, it worth every penny, first days I was a little upset because I didn't get into it, but now... seems to be a nice solution for a lot of things, what I have installed in my AIO PHONE:1. Skype2. MSN3. Office Viewer4. Lots of games (metal gear solid acid for mobiles, fifa, etc)5. Internet using WiFi corporate network (you can specify the type of encryption, open/shared, IPV4 y IPV6, sutnet, gateways and DNSs)6. Yahoo Chat7. Google Talk8. Bluetooth connectivity is really awesome9. Opera Mini and the built-in brower (both are good)10. PDF Reader (this is nice if you need to open/read something while you're traveling)11. You can synchronize it with Windows Media Player what is nice too, because is easy to find WMP already installed in your computer (against the ipod/iphone-itunes, you have to download it and is a little tricky)12. ETC.Of course, not everything is PINK, and has some cons:1. Is just a bit bigger and heavier than the w810, but if you think you're getting WiFi, you forget that.2. I guess... is easier to use a sony ericsson, but every feature included in the N81 worth to learn something new.3. The storage (8gb) is built-in, and it has not any slot to expand the capacity, but again, I guess 8gb is enough space for applications, games and music.4. Since I'm an IT guy, I like to keep my gadgets UP-TO-DATE, but the Software updater is not available for Windows Vista, so, I gotta wait  the release, of course, it does not means the phone does not work, but sometimes when you update your software, some enhancements in performance and new features are included, the updater is only supported by Windows XP.5. The realplayer is the player included with the phone, and only plays mp4 and 3gp, the resolution on the screen is nice, but, sometimes, when you're trying to watch videos from YouTube.com (yes, you can watch streaming video too) the player get fuzzy... and you should close and open again the video in order to get a better display.That's my experience with the N81 8GB, I hope it will be useful for you.

The unlocked phone was the best option for me.The WiFi connection is huge for me. I'm able to get away without a data plan from my provider and just leech off WiFi hotspots.The MP3 player is awesome, Camera is adequate, web browser is fast (although navigating full web pages can be a hassle- full pages don't scale down very well.- .mobi sites are fine.)One frustration I found was the video playback. I found out that it only comes with the ability to play videos in Real Player format out of the box- which is terrible. Luckily I soon discovered you can download a mobile version of the Divx player from Divx and now it will play .avi files fine so you can rip and encode movies from DVD for it fairly easily.Also, text input via the phone keypad is tedious. If you're doing anything like blogging or email you may want to get a bluetooth keyboard. I have an ThinkOutside Stowaway that works great.Another plus is the availability of applications for the Symbian s60 OS.Overall it's a very good quality full featured phone.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "AWSOME PRODUCT", "Author": "Pablo Linares", "ReviewID": "RQO9B32A2BEHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just bought my N81 GB a feew weeks ago and I really have to say it has exceded my expectations. What a wonderfull gadget!Every single minute I'm learning more how to exploit it the most.From the design to the look and feel of the interface. Everything is almost perfect.Before buying this product I was evaluating other possibilities, as an HTC Touch. But the requirement of having to use stylus to type SMS decided me to go for this one. The overall build is quite robust, considering it is a device that needs to be handled appropiately.Will resume some CONS and PROS:CONS (most of them S60 related)-Music Player always running on background (since it is always sensing the multimedia keys - can be solved by using an external task manager app for Symbian)-Alarm Snooze time: the default is 5 minutes and was not able to find how to change it. Nokia 6131 on the other hand has this feature)Sure, you can get another Alarm application for Symbian.-Music Files: When you upload them, no matter what specific folders you enter them, Music PLayer will show the entire list (this would include MP3 ringtones and funny sounds you might have uploaded!), unless you create specific Playlists or rely on the ID3 MP3 tags.-Contacts Syncronization: Default Nokia PC Suite for N-Series will only syncronize with any contact management application in place (Outlook / Outlook express / etc) but will not give the chance to use a Nokia one. This can be solved anyway by using the standard Nokia PC Suite.PROS:-Design-Features-Cost/Benefit ratio-Gaming Platform-Sound quality (built in stereo speakers)-OS (Symbian) and all related Custom Apps-Divx Playing-Most of the CONS can be overcameIn conclusion, this little gadget has everything a phone with the same characteristics should have and even more, with a great potential of expansion due to the Operative System type.

I wanted to unify the two items in one single device, but if you read my review, you will find why is that I did not stay with Palm OS.One thing to say also is that I bought it for business although it is not advertised as that, I took the chance and I am very happy with it.Pros:There are many features I would like to review but among my favorites are:- Outstanding battery life even when you connect to the internet via WiFi- 8GB internal HDD- Easy to open keys, lock-unlock button at the top as well.- Screen and Menus completely customizable, so you can decide if you want the calendar in the root menu or in a Agenda folder, for instance.- The center key has 4 quick access ways, so left takes you to Messages, right takes you to Calendar, up takes you to Modes like Silence -meeting etc., down takes you to Clock -international times and alarms.- WiFi is great and fairly easy to set-up.- Bluetooth is great, I can synchronize my calendar and contacts, anniversaries, tasks, meetings, with Microsoft Outlook, and share info with friends, also I use a Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset, which works great with.- Synchronyzing with the usb cable allows you to back up your pictures, music, videos- You can use the phone as an external HDD to carry info, PowerPoint presentations, etc.- You can have your POP3 mail, save as many as you want, decide whether you keep them in the \"phone\" memory or the HardDrive memory.- You can open attachments with the included QuickOffice and also PDF files.- You media manager is great, photos in albums, music playlists and you don't need special software like itunes to manipulate them, (have you tried to retrieve your music from and IPOD to your computer? You can't)Cons- Buttons to music in the front are to tight and hard to manipulate.- It can be tricky to save some access points in WiFi, but you can learn how configure them.- Bad quality camera, not because it has 2megapixels, but because they are 2mp terrible sensor, but not important to me.- It is not as slim as other phones, but non of them with internal 8GB HDD- Gizmo, my wife and I have same phone, we tried to configure the VoIP and it seems that if we are under the same IP- (same house connection) it rejects one of the users, which is awkward since Skype does not give you this issue.- Not compatible with Skype yet (coming soon they say)Overall, the Cons I have had so far are livable with, but the Pros are great and easy to use.

Chinese guys' N81's are made in Finland, but here in the States, we're buying phones that are made in China, i seriously doubt if we've been fooled... please prove me wrong cos i haven't called nokia help center yet", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Its an ok phone!", "Author": "Ernesto Motta", "ReviewID": "R2TN2LESI9MSE5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its an ok phone that would be my starting title!why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone.This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac.com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application.Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw  i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama.This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you.This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc!Overall ill give this phone a three stars just because i came from a Ferrari to a Toyota and i think ill stick with my hacked iphone meanwhile nokia comes with a better phone that actual competes against apple's iPhone.Cheers, Lads!", "Date": "February 20, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
