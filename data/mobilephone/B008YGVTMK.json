The phone was fully charged and had little to no \"wear & tear\" ...JUST LIKE THE SELLER IMPLICATED. The phone was shipped USPS and I had to sign for it, which I found great! Seeing as it was an expensive purchase I liked that the package didn't sit out in the rain or sit around for someone to take.Regardless...I got exactly what I expected....

I bought a Blue Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 SCH i535 from Discount Electronics. This seller advertised this used phone was in \"Very Good\" condition. NOT TRUE! The charger Discount Electronics sent was incompatible. It wouldn't fit in the phone to charge it. The battery and back phone charger increased the phone's thickness, so much so a standard case I bought from Best Buy wouldn't fit it. This pre-owned phone was not in \"Very Good\" condition. It had more used, after-market, generic, and refurbished parts than Samsung parts. When I filed an A-Z claim for a refund, they sent me several rude emails through Amazon saying things like \"What you did was harmful to my business and was completely unnecessary...\" They tried to charge me a restocking fee. When I returned the phone via FedEx, they claimed I never sent it, therefore it was never delivered. FedEx investigated and confirmed it was delivered.  I spent way too much time on this, and I still don't have a phone. Thank goodness Amazon refunded my money. I recommend against anyone shopping with Discount Electronics. Their products are shabby and the customer service leaves much to be desired.

Now my last phone was used but ive never had this problem with any Verizon phone where it just stays on the start up screen, i am very upset at this phone for the simple fact that i really did like the phone until it decided to try this bullcrap now i have to go into verizon on my own time and fix your bullcrap, if it doesnt work properly i will expect a full refund.
