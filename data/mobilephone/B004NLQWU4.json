It does not do the web well. The 3G on this phone is pretty slow on AT&T; when compared to the iPhone, and the interface is not touch screen. If you want those things, you should buy the iPhone. It's a cool phone, and you can play sweet games about birds and tweet a picture of the panini you are eating for dinner on Twitter, no problem.After a week, I am in love with this phone. It takes good-enough pictures, does Gmail pretty well, has great bluetooth connectivity, and plays my music. I can tether my iPad and computer to its data connection (AT&T;) at no extra cost. The data connection is not fast but it gives me the web anywhere when I want it and, more importantly, its limited connectivity/non-touchscreenness helps me forget the web when I'm with my family.As a former iPhone user, I used to make fun of people with feature phones. Now, it seems like I'm more aware of actual life when I'm out getting my pizza party on with the wife and kids. Instead of sitting face-down in some Facebook with stuff going on around me, my phone stays in my pocket and my attention stays on what's important.It's not the phone for everyone, but it helps me be a better dad.If you feel distracted by your technology, but still want to retain some connectivity (for work or even with other gadgets), this is not a bad choice.

Fischer \"merryisme\"", "ReviewID": "R7Z11M953FA2M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, I love this phone;It was everything I wanted, without all the \"smartphone\" junk and expense I wouldn't use. I didn't want to get stuck in another 2 yr contract, and have to buy a data plan with AT&T;, just because I had to have a new phone. I researced for weeks, with no cell phone, ended up buying a gophone, LG Encore (touchscreen horror story!) and using it for 2 weeks before I settled on this phone. So I didn't just jump into a new phone.  This phone is great as far as sound, dialing, texting, if ALL you want is a simple phone; If that was all, I'd give it 5 stars, so if you want to get a good, plain phone, at this price, go for it. You can stop reading now.  However, if you want a phone you can use to take and then send or ever receive multimedia messages, keep looking. The camera, although a 3.2 mp takes grainy, blurry pictures.  My biggest issue with the phone is that I can't ever receive or send anything except text messages. Forget the cute Christmas pics I was supposed to have gotten from friends and relatives! I had the phone for about 3 weeks before deciding there must be a problem, since I had more than 1 person ask what I thought of the pics they had sent! This phone IS NOT UNLOCKED to receive multimedia (mms)messages. Believe me, I have tried! I have spent literally hours on the phone with AT&T; tech people over the last 3 days, trying to see if it could be set to receive mms. Every tech rep was extremely helpful and made calls, searched the web, and did all they could to try and help. After the first 2 days of working to find the problem, we even decided to return the phone and get another one (Amazon advertises the phone as unlocked for mms as well as web access). I received the new phone yesterday, and after letting it fully charge, went through the whole ordeal of set-up again. Then spent another hour on the phone with a tech, same thing.  This phone WILL NOT accept, or send, multimedia messages, and you CANNOT access the web (though it is supposed to be unlocked to do that and is advertised as such), IF you use AT&T; services (I can't speak for other carriers), be aware this will not work for you.  One last thought, since I'm sure many of us might assume it is AT&T;'s fault, since this is not their phone maybe they just don't want to put in the codes needed. I also had a conference call with Nokia. The rep I spoke to was very rude and refused to help or assume any responsibility from Nokia. I had called Nokia and been told to have the AT&T; tech person do a conf call with me and they would be able to help. When I got a tech person on the phone and called Nokia back, their rep was unbelievably rude and a huge waste of time. Nokia refused to help at all. I now have to either keep a \"dumbed down\" phone, or go through the process of trying to find a good phone all over again! So, buyer be aware!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia C2-01 Unlocked (T Mobile Users)", "Author": "littlebigman", "ReviewID": "RFY388PW5EQC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Nokia C2-01 after reading reviews and being an Old Sckool kind of guy when it comes to phones. I need a Phone to Talk and Text, I got a Laptop for the rest....I use T Mobile Prepaid. When I first set up the phone I had a Problem. I could Not send or recieve picture messages. The only way I could get internet was through the Browser. The other functions like OVI store, Nokia.mobi, Home, and Web Services would not work.\"\"So here is how these Problems can be FIXED\"\", I went to T Mobile online, go to bottom of the page and click on Contact Us, a new page will come up, on the top left click on Get Support Online .Now when you do this you will need your T Mobile PIN number, NO problem if you forgot it, the Live Advisor will help you set up a new one. After all the confirmation of who you are, The Live Advisor will send you a message to the phone and with a code (1234), open the message enter the code and \"ALL is FIXED\", just to make sure the live advisor will tell you to take a photo and send it to yourself. Yea send it to your own phone number, I did not use my area code and it worked, I got my own picture message. After doing this my Nokia C2-01 worked 100% all issues with sending picture messages, and other functions were FIXED !Personnaly the only time I \"might\" use the Web Browser is to check my Lotto Numbers, if you do the Face Book thing this phone is not for you because the screen is to small.I also bought on Amazon the \"I Talk\" phone case it does the job and all opennings are perfect, there are some on ebay , But I have noticed all cases for the Nokia C2-01 mostly come from England (Royal Mail) could not find any here in the USA and there are some from China(ebay). The only thing I could find sold here in the USA are Screen Protectors, \"don't forget them\".Head Set (Headphones) I bought this Nokia C2-01 new from Amazon, for the few $$$$ more why buy a used one? Anyway the phone came with a Nokia Head Set (headphones), This phone only works well with is own brand the Nokia Head Set that came with it. I have several Head Sets and my favorite Skull Candy Head Set, but they do not work well, they sound awefull, must use the Nokia Head Set !\"Volume Control\", are the other people that write these reviews about poor volume control \"For Real\"......This Nokia C2-01 Earpiece has Excellent Volume and Excellent Volume Control settings. .....Heres what you do....go to Menu, go to Settings, go to Navigation Key and select a short cut for the Volume Control on the Navigation Key (up or down or left-right, you pick). This little phone can get loud and the Media Player there is a different volume control that works well for the Media Player.This Nokia C2-01 is small, light and sleek, never had a problem with number keys being small for my Man hands, Has USB and Memory Card slots on the side. Head Set and Charging Jack on the top. Camera works, 3.2 MP for 1536x2048, 2.0MP for 1200x1600, 1.2MP for 960x1280, 0.5MP for 600x800, 0.3MP for 480x640, and 0.1MP for 240x320 this is a phone not a 14.1 MP Sony Cybershot, OK....Signal is Excellent, I work in a Hospital and never lost signal anywhere in the building. There is a Lanyard Slot on the top left side but you have to open the back cover to string it up and use it (if your into using a lanyard). Battery life is Excellent, charge last a long time. Good choice of ringtones. comes with 4 games Sudoku, City Bloxx, Brain Champ. , and Block'd .Media player is Great for this small phone, I use a 8GB micro SD memory card , listen to music with headset or speaker, I got a usb cable and the phone sync'd up with NO problem with my hp laptop music , photos, etc..and charges This is a Nice Simple Little Phone that gets the Job done.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "best unlocked phone", "Author": "solly4", "ReviewID": "R1D6ZERZT49GX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to use it for my roaming simcard,the moment i put the simcard its worked right away,i wil purchase more to send it to philippines for my mom and dad very simple for them to operate.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted!", "Author": "Bradley Turner", "ReviewID": "RPU064O9YCVZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looks great, great touch of keys, loud ring and low cost,  Also very easy to use, and I can use it with my T-Mobile pay as you go plan!", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little phone!", "Author": "SpaceNabbers \"JRR\"", "ReviewID": "RLN4KKPSL74IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so happy to be back with a Nokia phone! My first two were Nokias but my last one wasn't and I really disliked it, so it's super to have another Nokia. This little phone packs a lot into its small size, and the predictive text is excellent (my previous phone's was dismal, to be kind). I found all those tiny qwerty keyboard keys too small for my fingers anyway. This Nokia is much more user-friendly, being quite intuitive. The screen is also nice and bright, and has an auto-lock feature that's nice, as well as some other features not available on my S*&^%#g phone, which I absolutely HATED. The only downside is that the sync software for the other phone didn't sync anything of substance, so I have had to transfer it all manually (still doing it). I love that I can also take this phone with me to Europe, where the technology is so more advanced than here in the States. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants to be free of a \"smart\" phone (even though this one could be if I wanted it to) with the full keyboard so it's a more manageable size. Sound quality is superb, and my bluetooth earpiece works flawlessly with it. Even the FM radio comes in clearly.

Fuller", "ReviewID": "R1ISYO297TBNHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was looking to replace a 7 year old Nokia that finally gave up. I was surprised to find out that Nokia still made the candybar style non-touch screen phones. I don't have a data plan with my ATT service, so I can't comment on the internet features.  Added a 16GB microSD card and loaded it up with music. The overall interface is simple and intuitive. The built in media player recognized a direct copy/paste of my iTunes library without issue. No issues syncing up with Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit. The Nokia Ovi PC software worked fine and allowed me to finally back up my extensive collection of contacts.  For a basic little phone it is feature loaded without compromising the primary function of being a phone. If you want a good PHONE, this is the ticket.  I do recommend the purchase of the plastic skin that covers the back of the phone.

Previous phones I have owned usually lasted about 3 days.Camera - It takes very nice pictures if the light is good and you hold it still.Data - It is easy to connect to a computer with a micro USB cable (not included) to access the microSDHC flash memory card (not included).  I recommend buying both a micro USB cable and a microSDHC flash memory card when you buy this phone.Samsung USB Home Travel Charger with Detachable Micro USB Cable for Galaxy S 4G T959V, Vibrant Plus, Vibrant 4GAmazonBasics 8 GB microSDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card with SD AdapterButtons - The buttons have a nice feel.  They are good for the occasional text message.  The predictive text works pretty well for typing with only 10 keys.Media player - You can load MP3s on this phone and play them through the included earphones.  It also plays FM radio.  You can also select MP3s as ring tones.Charging - Charging can be done using the included adapter or through the micro USB cable.Compatibility - I use T-Mobile pre paid.  I put my SIM card in, and the phone worked right away.  It will not send pictures, but I have read that you can contact T-Mobile to enable picture send if you want it.  Since pictures cost $.25 each to send, I choose to keep this feature disabled and upload any pictures directly to my PC.Nokia Suite software - This is my only complaint about this phone.  This software is confusing and difficult to use.  It will allow you to put some extra games on the phone, but many of the games will not work without a data plan.  Downloading music and backing up the phone is not intuitive.  The software needs a Windows Explorer type interface to show you exactly what is on the phone, and it needs a simple copy & paste feature.  It also does not provide access to data on the SIM card, so you cannot get a simple list of your contacts.Overall, this is a great replacement for the old phone that came with my T-Mobile pre paid plan.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "pleased with purchase/service", "Author": "Ana \"Ana\"", "ReviewID": "R28B0BXHRFT5BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product as described.

This phone fit the bill. It is very simple to learn to use straight out of the box, has a surprisingly decent camera, and immediately worked with the three different SIM cards from three different countries and companies.Battery life on this phone was also excellent, going at least a week between charges even when I was sending and receiving dozens of texts a day (I rarely used it to call people as air time is too expensive for many Africans to afford, but I did make and receive a few international calls from/to Ghana and found the quality of these calls to be surprisingly good).The one issue I had with the phone was that I was never able to access the internet despite being on a 3G network. I was never able to determine whether this was a problem with the network provider or with the phone itself. This wasn't a big issue for me as I had other ways to access the internet, but I wanted to note this as others have complained about the same problem with US providers.Overall, I was very pleased with the value and quality of this phone.

But I wanted to be able to text and drive like the old days.  I wanted buttons and T9.  I wanted a phone that would get a better cell connection; at home; with the iPhone, I have to walk out into the street to make a call.  I wanted a smaller, less slippery, less needy phone for sailing and biking.  So, I bought the C2-01.  I moved my number to the Nokia device and put a new number on the iPhone.  Here are my observations after a precious day of fidgeting:1) The Nokia phone seems crufty.  And slow.  It's not because of any defect in the function of the phone.  It's just very far away from a modern design.  It's my fault for thinking I could go home again, maybe.2) There's a problem with email that people have been complaining about online for years with Nokia phones. It doesn't appear to have ever been answered.  One can set up their Internet connectivity okay, but still be unable to make the Mail application return anything but \"Communication error. Try again later.\"  I can't get to the ovi store either.  I can surf the web... that leaves me with webmail as an option.  That's a really painful prospect on this tiny screen with its clunky interface.3) When you go from an iPhone to something else using the same phone number, your iPhone (iMessage) friends won't be able to send you messages on your new phone.  I haven't figured out how to fix this, though I've tried a number of online recommendations, including unregistering the iPhone.If I conquered the email issue and the iMessage stickiness, I'm not sure it would be enough to make me feel good about my phone experiment.  As a minimum, I will swap the phone numbers back. Will there be any point to keeping the Nokia phone then?  Probably not.UPDATE >> I hunted and pecked until I figured out the solution to the email problem/ovi store problem.  Once you've got Internet connectivity through the web browser, go back into SETTINGS/CONFIGURATION/PERSONAL CONFIG/Options/New -> Access Point.  Under Bearer Settings, type the name you chose for the Web (internet) access.  Back out and activate the new 'access point.' Mail and Ovi should work.
