{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pink LG 840G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)", "Author": "Rebecca M. Grant \"R.M. Grant\"", "ReviewID": "R2JEXQDKPKF5ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item for my mother because I have a similar item and absolutely love it.  My mother (who is 84) was very jealous of mine so I got her one for another Christmas present.  Well, mine is a snap to use and although a \"smart phone\" is a little hard for my mom to figure out, it is a great item.  I am walking her through the usage, even though it is VERY easy to use.  I especially like the triple minutes for life feature.  People, as long as you load minutes prior to when your service date is up, with Tracfone you do not lose your minutes.  Please consider this item......much, much better than a contract and ,really, I can't seem to use the minutes up to tell ya' the truth.  I wish mine was this adorable pink!!!  Tracfone does everything the contractual phones do.......internet, text, pics, drawing program, etc..  Great product!!!", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Big upgrade from old lg flip tracfone", "Author": "QC consumer", "ReviewID": "R1YKOGJLIR2PHT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My old Tracfone died and I wasn't ready to dish out the big bucks for an Android or Iphone, so I bought this one. It's NOT a smartphone, but is somewhat similar to one. It has many more features than my old LG flip phone from Tracfone. I've had it a few weeks now and love it. The voice quality is very good, the camera is just okay, it's easy to use most of the features but haven't figured out how to use the internet part yet. Went to Starbucks to get free wifi and noodle around with it, but not much luck. Will have to ask for help on this I'm afraid. I'm very pleased with this phone so far and would definitely recommend it. I also bought a decorative case and clear screen protectors.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best little phone that isn't an android", "Author": "Genny", "ReviewID": "RKV7UWW72OOIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best little phone out there that isn't an android. No, this little baby still runs on a java platform. Therefore, it is still a little limited, but so easy to use. It incorporates the touch interface which operates much like a standard android. Touch response is about 4.5, on a scale of 1-5. Its only real shortcoming is the limited apps it can run, but I don't want my phone junked up with all that mess anyhow. I check in on facebook now and then, which costs you zero minutes if you use the wi-fi function. But even if you use the minutes, it generally uses less than texting a picture, but that depends on how long you stay on and whether you look at pictures while you're there. Picture texting seems to go on the size of the picture, so you can use anywhere between 1-3 credits sending a picture. Balanced out with the other features, this isn't a big deal to me. Triple minutes helps defray the cost and it is way cheaper than any contract phone. Memory is expandable with a micro sd card, up to 32gb, should you wish to keep your music and pictures on it. The camera is so-so, but it's a phone camera, what do you expect.All around, I'm happy with this little android-that-isn't...and that's coming from someone who has owned an android before. It's so much fun to use and I don't see the need to upgrade for a while. I would highly recommend it.4/11/14:Important tip:I failed to mention in my original review that you should turn Wi-Fi off when out of range of any Wi-Fi signals. The phone will continue to search for the non-existent signal and it will drain the battery in a couple of hours. If you're within range, you can leave Wi-Fi on all day and it won't do this.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "High tech for me", "Author": "Elaine Flynn", "ReviewID": "ROD5ES0AG9Q7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was very easy to understand. Was the first time I've ever text. Triple minutes you can't be. I was able to take pictures of my grandchildren and send them to people and I understand how to do it. I had looked into getting an iPhone besides the fact the phone itself was so expensive there is no way I would pay $80 a month for the service. This is perfect for some one who does not need or want to be on the phone all the time! I have already talked about 10 people into buying this they should give me a discount!  I even bought three for gifts and everybody is happy.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG 840G", "Author": "JustNetGirl", "ReviewID": "R2TTB5PA3JX4TL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for emergencies. It fits perfect in my purse. I bought discounted minutes online, set up was easy. Received triple minutes and extended expiration date. So I paid $19.40 for 230 min and 150 days of service. Comes out to around $4.50 a month for service. Call quality is great, better than the big network I was in contract for the past 10 yrs. No talking over each other. Texts are easy to send and receive. Pictures came out fine. I was able to set it up with my home network wifi with no problems, but don't really plan on using it for the web. I like the fact you can have your minutes and service days on your screen, so no guessing what minutes you have to use or days left.It's good for a basic touch screen phone. The only thing I don't like about it is the maximum time for screen light is 60 secs. Also the buttons at the bottom are halfway hidden by a black band. Still it's a great little phone.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone that works well and was priced right.", "Author": "John Rupp", "ReviewID": "R2SB1QVZOPX8SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this cell phone for a young girl relative and it has worked out very well.

Couple this with the book LG840g tips & trics available on Amazon and I'm off and running!The first phone I received had no sound.  I emailed, received a response within an hour, and the replacement arrived 3 days later withe a preprinted, prepaid mailing label to send the defective phone back.  Incredible customer service!

To text it's a touch key pad, which I know it's the thing now & my fingers are slim yet I continuously have to edit as more than one letter gets touched. I prefer the key board way for texting. I dislike how I cannot set 10 minute snooze intervals it's 5 minutes or 15...wtheck.
