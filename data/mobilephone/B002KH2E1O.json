{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Reliable and easy to use phone", "Author": "wrc22", "ReviewID": "R2VQ45T3WS5QW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia makes phones that makes using easy and intuitive. The case is shiny but with nice brushed look. Keypad has not worn like most other plastic coating. Screen is nicely colored and not too bright. Very light in weight and size feels snug in the palm. Fast charging through USB or electrical outlet. Bluetooth holds reliable signal. Easy to connect to PC or Mac to manage data and import/export photos and/or contacts.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Phone For Nerds Only", "Author": "James Zelenka", "ReviewID": "R21JI1R3UDZ7DL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After downloading all the latest firmware I find this phone to have stunning capabilities but it is oh so complicated to use!! I believe an entire one semester class would be required to learn how to effectively use ALL this phone is capable of. I finally had to shuffle most apps to hidden folders and remove the SIM card so it would be usable as a mere gps trip planner/mp3 player/wifi information/and streaming entertainment gizmo. One tap on the wrong key and you'll end up streaming data off the cell tower and the meter will spin wildly until your prepaid account is empty! Best to buy a separate basic cell phone, preferably a net10, and use the E52 for everyting else. It's kind of like having a fabulously complex watch that tells everything but the time!!! Even so it's still an amazing device and a better music player than any I've ever seen or heard, with proper ear buds.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Ready for Prime Time", "Author": "Effortful", "ReviewID": "R2A2I8J3HQVA9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is not really ready for release: the phone shuts off without warning. I've had the device for two weeks, and it has shut down ten or more times. The software appears to still be in the beta stage. This is intolerable for a business phone. Moreover, the device was shipped with an installed memory card that contained a number of applications and 4 of the 6 installed themes. What manufacturer installs themes and applications on the memory card? This is just careless and sloppy. Additionally, the battery is so tightly placed that one can't remove it with a fingernail. One has to tap it hard upon the palm the get it out. Things like this just show that this is not yet a properly developed business phone.UPDATE: May 15, 2012:Shortly after the review given above, I shoved this phone into a drawer and moved on. Periodically, however, I would remove it, update the software that Nokia continued to provide, find that the phone was still unstable, then put it back into the drawer. About six month ago I took it out and found that there was another update: amazing, since this phone came out around mid 2009. After that update, the phone finally became stable, and I started to use it. A few days ago, another update came (Version 091.033.c00.01). My God, Nokia is still updating after almost three years. I now use the phone as one of my daily devices (the other is the inimitable N9). The E52 is fantastic. Granted, it is not for avid video watching: the screen is small. However, it is fast, has free navigation with text-to-speech voice navigation, voip support, Skype from Nokia Store, Gravity, et al. I notice that it is now only available as a used device. Too bad. It took Nokia more than two years to finally get it right - perhaps that is why they have struggled of late, yet if you need a solid, small, light-weight business phone, get this device!", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Symbian / S60 3rd Edition, Feature Pack 2\nGSM 850 / GSM 900 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900\n3+ Megapixel Camera, A2DP, Bluetooth, Calendar, Camera\nCandy Bar Form, Edge, Email Client, FM Radio, GPS / Location, High-Speed Data GPRS\nMegapixel Camera, Memory Card Slot, MP3, Speaker Phone, Symbian, Video Capture, Video Clip, Wi-Fi", "Name": "Nokia E52 Unlocked Cell Phone w/ GPS, Wifi, Bluetooth, Symbian / International Version", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31McWQFFohL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002KH2E1O"}}
