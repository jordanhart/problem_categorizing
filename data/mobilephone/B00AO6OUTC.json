This is by far the best phone I have ever used including many Samsungs, iphone, droid x, droid, htc, etc.  Very thin and light for the size but still one of the most durable phones made by any manufacturer.  Gorilla glass holds up great, kevlar backing is super strong and it's water \"proof\" as well.  I don't even use a case with this phone it's so tough.  Samsung(body) and Apple (screen) products generally fall apart with any abuse.  Good camera, fast, big bright HD screen and good battery life make this a winner!", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great device, long battery life, nice and sharp screen colors", "Author": "Michael Fogel", "ReviewID": "R3HFQYGSVTC91J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Long life battery, nice and sharp screen colors, great and easy MMI, work fast even when loaded and running with few app", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm very happy with this phone", "Author": "Ulises Rojas Perez \"Fan Huinday\"", "ReviewID": "R1DYQOHUPXITM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "-Cheaper than iPhone or galaxy, but this phone looks great and get the job done.- Much more design than the popular ones but since engineering point of view is better designed and manufactured, very good materials, fast and easy to use, I'm very happy with this phone", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "By far the nicest phone I have ever seen", "Author": "nicholas clinton", "ReviewID": "R17ZA4B4HGB37M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I considered iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, HTC One, but those phones aren't even close to the quality of the Motorola.
