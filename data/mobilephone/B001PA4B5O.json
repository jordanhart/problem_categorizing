Don't order from this seller", "Author": "SoCal Jen", "ReviewID": "R2RT94VN4EKN5H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone through Amazon because AT&T; no longer carries this model and I loved the phone. The one I bought from AT&T; worked perfectly for two years until it was dropped and the screen shattered. This one stopped working right after the 30 day return period. It wasn't dropped or handled roughly, it just stopped working. No warranty, no customer service options, nothing. I've ordered from Amazon for so many years that I was lulled into a false sense of security, believing that I could trust sellers associated with this website. I should have known better, it says \"No Warranty\" right in the description. Unless you want to pay full price for a phone that only works 35 days, stay away from this seller!", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ratings", "Author": "Davia Jackson", "ReviewID": "R1PKYGGNQRM2JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone too.
