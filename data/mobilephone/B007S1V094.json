{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for unlimited talk and text. Web access so awkward it is useless", "Author": "Say Play \"SayPlay\"", "ReviewID": "R1WGZ4X9WIENZO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this Verizon phone because of the prepaid plan for 50$ a month for unlimited talk, text and web. That seemed to be a great deal. Also the prepaid plan has no contract to keep you bound to this service.Unfortunately, the web access is almost useless, as the technology to  get there and move around is very awkward. Access is extremely slow and filled with landmines that blow up unexpectedly and you land somewhere  Verizon tries to sell you ring tones etc. (This happens repeatedly) Meanwhile, back at the web, you haven't gotten anywhere and are still waiting for a connection with your fingers crosses that you won't be side tracked again.I attempted to go to my Gmail account and found that I could get onto a Google search page, but not sign into my Gmail. If email is important enough to you, there is an option for Verizon \"Mobil email\" which I assume make it easier to send and receive email, but the charge for it is about 7$ a month.From my point of view, if you talk and text to the point that 50$ will save you money, it is a great deal. The web access is all but useless.The sound of the phone is good and clear with un-muffled sound. Conversation is easy to hear and understand.The keys on the phone are smaller than what I have been used to, but think that most women would find them workable. I frequently find that I am using the tip of my thumb nail to hit the keys, as opposed to my finger tips. If you are a man with even a medium size hand, I recommend that you handle the phone before purchase to see if it will work for you.I found this Pantech phone at Best Buy in October 2011 for under 60.00$. Verizon charges 35$ to get it up and running and is capable of allowing the use of a different existing number that is yours, like a home phone number you are ready to terminate.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "amazon is the cheapest for this phone", "Author": "Nancy Marie Cohen", "ReviewID": "R1EB32DU97TXX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it looks exactly like a blackberry, the camera could be better (but works good), there is a lock on the keys (so you don't have to worry about accidentally calling people), there is enough room for your fingers to text. the screen is not too small, i didn't try the internet. overall, i don't have anything to complain about.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Primary Message phone", "Author": "Gary Knotts", "ReviewID": "R17K9D6X04VYFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone does what its designed to do well, If people want a smart phone they should buy one and stop compareing feature phones like this to iPhone and the like.There or worse phones out there.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone to get me through.", "Author": "W.

I went from an android smart phone to a prepaid \"dumb phone\" and I am liking the phone for what I use it for- texting and talking (mostly texting).  I like how small it is and thin also.

Well i was at first Now im NOT!", "Author": "Bree", "ReviewID": "R2SSQGWSBUX086", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recieved this phone today , purchased it off ebay .. i WAS Very skeptical about getting a phone offline , especially ebay . there are a Bunch of scandals with any site tday when it comes to electronics but i talked to my seller and he took some hesitation away from me as i asked if it was or wasnt a refurbished phone , etc.I had the pantech jest phone txt8040 phone since dec. of 2009 or 2010 i cant remem. its been a while so wanted to upgrade .. A con with this phone is that is does not have an MP3 Player! and it has less choices of things than i had with the pantech jest .. i Love the keyboard and the pinkish-red color of some of the keyboard keys .. and i Love how small my phone is. When i recieved my pantech jest phone it was tiny and cute but this phone is Way Slimer and just the right size for me ..If you mainly Text and just Text then this is the phone for you .. i dont do anything else But text so i have the 20$ messaging bundle .. i dont talk on the phone or use the web so basically i got this phone just to upgrade .. in a texting manner.. my pantech jest was giving out on me with the battery and etc.. i wished this phone had a mp3 player but i can use my jest phone when i wanna hear music so thats not that big of an issue for me ..You cant do much with this phone & its really not a phone i would pay 50 $ a month for! The features suck lol so like i said thats why i only got this phone to text.. um the screen is way smaller than the jest phone and thats another dislike for me .. the picture taking looks very annoying so i think ill continue to take pics with my jest phone and transfer them to the PC with my SD card and then send the pics to my caper phone by email .The pictures i already sent to my caper phone looks very weird in my phone being that its soo small .. But other then what i said this is a perfect phone for a preteen .. since i know teens my age do more then text. im 17 , almost 18 but this phone works for me because the other stuff isnt really important to me , im use to just texting anyway.The Camera on this phone SUCKS .. if you take a full photo the phone is in your face and you have to back up if you dont want the phone in you face.. with my case the phone looks Hideous lol and its just very wierd looking!  / its complicated ..& its Not a smartphone! its a basic phone!**This phone comes with 10$ Airtime .. But if you transfer you original verizon number to the caper , you Will Not get the 10$ airtime** You'll have the same balance that you had before the number transfer.I'm just updating my review .. had this phone for two days now and um i dont like it at all . . at first i loved it but now that i founded out that the camera sucks i just really dislike the phone now ! It already is a downgrade from the jest i at least thought i could take nice pics with it but i cant . .", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have someone set it up", "Author": "Art2Photography", "ReviewID": "R32LOTHTVGT11U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this cell phone, only problem I had right at first was setting it right ! I went to a local Verizon store, where they help me set it properly, they did it for me free, took maybe 10 minutes, all they had to do, was do a data transfer from my old flip phone to newer Pantech Caper cell phone.What this did was transfer all of my old phones data, contacts & photo's. I thought at first I had lost all of that stuff, only thing we did was after the Verizon associate did something, we had to keep the phone close to each other, this new Pantech Caper cell phone has Blue tooth same as my old flip phone so they could talk to each other and transfer everything.Boy was I happy, I had a ton of phone numbers and emails, house address with cell / house phone numbers and everything you would ever think to have in the way of contacts on my flip phone, now I have on my Caper, plus I have all of my photo's too :o)I'm very happy with this newer cell phone, so far a lot easier to operate now than other cell phone, plus key pad a lot easier to text and type in info. The cell camera is adequate for the screen size, its not a fancy expensive cell phone, but for the money it is a pretty amazing pre paid cell phone. I would recommend anyone who wants a prepaid cell phone, not smart phone, but prepaid account like I have to buy this cell phone, I would buy another one in a heart beat, no second quessing that one :o)  if it had a data card it would be perfect just about :o)I have a lot of friends who own, fancier cell phones with expensive cell phone plans, I use my cell more for a phone than play games or texting and surfing the internet, I have a tablet for surfing the internet I have with me if I want to do that kind of thing, lot bigger screen and easier to see and do things.So this phone is just what I was looking for.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE THE PHONE!", "Author": "gladys trimble", "ReviewID": "R1V9ZEGJYER2JN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FOR JUST A BASIC PHONE IT IS A GREAT FIND.

It looked really cute and reminded me of a blackberry cell I used to have! I imagined it to be an awesome phone. WRONG!I love the way it looks. But it is a thin plastic, cheaply made. Which isn't a big deal, but isn't very durable.What I hate the most is the way it works and the screens display and options...First of all, there doesn't seem to be a camera button. You have to go to your pictures, click options, then click take a picture just to get to the camera...which doesn't have a good quality at all, and right after you take a picture and hear the shutter, it doesn't even take the picture until a few seconds after the shutter... And which my last 2 pictures I took, I went back to look at them and they didn't even save!!!The phone also randomly dropped my call when I had full service, in the middle of talking to a Verizon Representative to help me with this thing. Ironic!If you don't have the unlimited plan, you'll eat up your minutes fast. Way too easy to accidently hit the browser button, which logs you onto the internet and takes forever to load, if at all, but you know what? As soon as you hit that button, even if it doesn't LOAD you onto a webpage, it immediately starts counting that towards your minutes!Everything on the screen is crammed and so oddly arranged and the options are just plain weird and make no sense...
