I would say it is a great phone for anyone who would like an android phone, but would not plan to overuse its features (lots of apps, running widgets 24/7, etc....).  Becoming more android savvy, I am replacing mine with something with more oomph.  I have been disappointed in how little android saves to the memory card and instead to the phone itself.Camera:  It takes wonderful pictures....in good sunlight.  But as does any cell phone camera.  The videos are ok, and you can save a send-able file or one however long you like.Battery:  The battery lasted apprx. 10-12 hours a day on average use, 6-8hrs on heavy use, and probably would've lasted about 2 days on light use (only for phonecalls).android version:  This phone currently does not run froyo but it does run android 2.1, which works fine.My phone became slow mostly because of the games and widgets I wanted to use.

At first, this phone ran fine.  After about a year, it slowed down to a snail's pace.  I'm not a heavy phone user and I only have a few apps.  I don't use VZ navigate because the phone crashes before I can even type in my destination.  The touch screen is a bit off and I've calibrated it recently - can't touch the letters/numbers I really want or else the letter/number next to it will appear on the screen.  This makes for some painfully slow text messaging and with autocorrect on, I've sent a ton of messages with random words inserted.  My favorite contacts screen seems to shuffle my contacts around periodically so I'm always calling the wrong person.  This happens so often that it has become a running joke amongst my friends.

However, you have to know what you're buying. Does this droid run like the new iphone? No. However, is it a reasonably priced decent smart phone? Absolutely! Here are some of the reasons I love it:1. Easy to Use and customize  From the first moment I turned it on, I went through a sort of \"tutorial\" that allowed me to become familiar with the phone and calibrate it for my touch :). Also the very first day I started customizing it, with the easy of access Market widget programmed into the phone you can easily download apps to customize the look of your phone.2. Decent Battery Time  Does the battery last forever? No, but in this day and age what does? Realistically this battery is amazing, I use my phone as a mp3 player- which it has great sound quality and easy to use music functions like shuffle and repeat and create playlists and other good stuff- and I like to play solitare whilst listening to my music and I'll do this for hours before my battery even thinks about moving. After like 3 hours of that plus another 2 hours of messaging and talk time with background sync and apps running (which you don't have to have your setting work like this but I prefer it to just so I can stay current with all of my updates) the battery will be a little low. However if its just on and I'm no really doing anything then it will last like a little over a day without neeeding to be charged.ConsSometimes it can run a little slow especially when I have messages coming in at once and I'm listening to music at the same time.The phone gets hot- like burn your face if you're talking for more than an hour hot- as for why it does this I'm not sure... However, I find if I pull it away for about 30 seconds it cools down, maybe its just my face? Maybe it because I'm hot ;)... Other than that enjoy the phone especially because mine was brand spanking new for only 40 bux :D", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE this phone!", "Author": "Rebecca L. Zucker \"Bex\"", "ReviewID": "R3TFLGOSJRBEDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Palm and discovered that there are not a whole lot of apps available for it, so I wanted an Android phone instead.  Found this one but was wary with the reviews saying how horrible battery life is and how slow it is, but I've had my phone for a month now and I have had no problems with it.  I've used a Motorola Droid X before (my bf has one) and I don't think the Eris is any difference in speed of opening programs, etc, as that phone (except for angry birds, it won't work, but I got aggrevated at the game on the Palm so it's no skin off my nose).  The battery life is actually amazing, compared to the Palm I had. The secret is to condition the battery when you first get it (the Android forum explains this, just charge it fully and discharge it fully, to 15%, three or four times in a row).  I did this and now one charge can last me anywhere from two to three days, which is great for what is basically a small computer, depending on how much I use it during the day.  2 days is for medium usage, three is when I'm busy at work and can't do much on the internet or play games during the day (stupid work!).  Another secret is to make sure you aren't getting the \"Time without a signal\" problem, that will drain the battery quicker, like only lasts  12 hours. The fix for that is easy though (plug it in, go into airplane mode, unplug it, get out of airplane mode and then turn the phone completely off, then back on; i did this once and it's been fine ever since).  It's also a very nice size, a balance between small enough to fit in a pocket (unlike the Droid X, which is huge in my opinion) and large enough to have a nice screen for internet surfing. I very much recommend this phone if you don't want to pay as much for an android phone as the motorola droid.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first smart phone...", "Author": "Debra Russell", "ReviewID": "R3FRBG8SFUIUCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm impressed.

I agree.I've had this phone for a year and a half now, and it's really frustrating to use, because it has gotten SO SLOW.  Sometimes I have to wait like 30 seconds for it to switch screens.  I sometimes get a message saying I'm low on space, so I bought a card that was twice as big...but 2 weeks later I'm back to having the same problem again.  I'm constantly having to force quit to get out of applications so that it will speed up a little.  Sometimes I have to take the battery out to get the phone to turn off, because it becomes unresponsive.  Not the best.Sometimes I'll click to call someone, but the screen hasn't updated yet (SLOW!) and so it actually ends up calling someone else.  The Internet browser frequently crashes.I had an iphone before this, and overall I like the Android platform better...but my husband has the Droid X and his always does things faster than my phone.  Obviously, since this is an Android, everything works perfectly with Google stuff.  That's nice.The pictures and video are decent, but lately my camera has been doing something weird where many of the pictures come out blurry when I upload them.If you just want something basic, this will probably work fine for you!  On the other hand, my father-in-law also got an Eris when I got mine, and although he is great with technology he HATES his phone.

After I ruined my Eris, I was afraid I would have to buy an extremely overpriced replacement from the Verizon store--something I wouldn't have been able to afford. I scoped out some of the sellers on Amazon, however, and eventually decided to try ordering one online instead. I'm glad I did! It took about a week to receive, and was in gently-used condition when I took it out of the box, with a phone charger and the original instruction manuals included. It also came with a car charger, which was a pleasant surprise.The only real downfall was that it was difficult to have activated--though, I'm not completely sure whether the phone or my phone service is to blame for that.

I can listen to pandora or my own music for hours without it dying and the speakers are great. That about does it for the pro.If you are looking at this phone I'd highly suggest buying a $20 basic phone because that is 10x better than this, you can at least know you'll be able to text, and with a bit of practice you'll be typing far faster than you ever would with this. You'll waste your money on an expensive bill since you have to have internet on this phone but you won't be able to use it that effectively.I haven't been able to install many apps on here, and whether you want to game or you want to do business stay far, far away from this phone, there are plenty of better phones that might cost a bit more but it's worth it to not get the headache. I'm a pretty chill person, but I've wanted to throw this phone into the wall more than once.Now for the music, while I like it for listening to music and audiobooks it still takes a full minute to get it to play any of them, since first you have to deal with the unresponsive screen and then deal with the slow responsive phone, it could take a minute just to get to the application and another minute for it to start playing anything after you've hit play, and I'm not exaggerating.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "ugh....", "Author": "jmarie1991", "ReviewID": "R33VEUWSHOZKAV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really thought this was gonna be a good first smart phone but its not at all its very complicated to use and the directions do not help at all over all its fast enternet speed was the best part but other then that there was nothing else good or easy to do on this phone at not only that you cant use backup assitant on this device so inless ur syncing your contacts with facebook,microscoft,or googel accounts then your entering all of them by hand witch takes forever not a good first smart phone at all :(", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "droid eris", "Author": "chris eubanks", "ReviewID": "R271CX3FA58TW7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "still learning everything on it but i do like the phone . looking forward to using it more and learning all the other features it has", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is not an Unlocked phone!

I was excited when I first got it, this was my first smartphone and was filled with features. After about a week and a half however, I realized that the price per month would not be worth what I got from the phone... and with the full intention of returning the phone within Verizon's 30 day offer, I dropped the phone and cracked it. It was still completely functional with one crack, but unable to be returned.I have now had this phone for a full year, and it has been a year of pain. Excruciating pain in fact over the past few days, which is why I am trying a Blackberry. Let's go back to right after I put the crack in this phone's screen. I called Verizon, who asked if I had the warrantee. I did not. They told me to call HTC. After to speaking with HTC, they asked if I had the warrantee. Again, I didn't. They told me to call Verizon.This made me really mad. Finally, I went into the Verizon store where I bought the phone, where they told me they could replace the phone for a price... higher than what I paid for the first phone! I said forget it, and overlooked the crack for the past year.RECENTLY, my phone started acting up. First, certain keys on the touch screen keyboard didn't work. Some were near the crack, so I assumed it was because I dropped it, and rotated the phone to get to the keys I needed. Then it started to zoom out every time I touched the screen, and more keys stopped working. If I shut the phone off however and turned it back on most features acting out would return to normal.This got annoying fast, so I ordered a replacement screen for $35. I got the screen, and was told that I needed to buy a special screwdriver, soft pry tool, and clear glue. I'm done. This phone has been too much of a problem recently. I'll have fun throwing this at a brick wall.The phone was nice the first week, but the novelty of new wore off fast, and after a year I realized this is a rather cheap phone.
