{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great upper-mid range smartphone", "Author": "JCS", "ReviewID": "R15USVDFX82DD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this short, there are tons of info about this device everywhere online.I bought it from Wireless Everything and received a shiny, new Galaxy S Advance in perfect condition.  Only two unusual things to point out: the phone came in Romanian by default and included a quick start guide in Romanian.  Doesn't matter, you can download the English manual in PDF from Samsung's website.  Also the included AC charger is European, but the package included an adapter for US power outlets.  Everything booted up fine and the phone is in perfect condition.This is an excellent device for the price and I would classify it as an upper mid-range Android phone.  The hardware is capable of running most (if not all) applications and even 3D games.  Loading and closing applications is extremely fast, the touchscreen is highly responsive and the included battery lasts long enough (with low screen brightness, Wi-fi / GPS / Bluetooth off, and moderate calls, websurfing and apps, it has lasted me up to 2 full days!This phone's RAM is sufficient for even demanding users.  There is a big hype for ultra-high-end cellphones like the Galaxy S3 and its ridiculous 2 GB of RAM.  THAT IS *NOT* THE NEW STANDARD, unlike what some people believe.  Most people will only check their email and facebook and will have more than enough with 512 MB RAM.  The 768 MB (total, addressable amount is less in real life) of this phone will go a long way and should be plenty for the base system, multiple apps, and games.  Although not quite on par with its bigger sibling, the Galaxy S2, the S Advance accomplishes much at a very affordable price.  Some games I have played in this device include Cogs, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery, Swords and Soldiers, Waking Mars and Zen Bound 2.  All play perfectly.Just remember: smartphones are trendy at the moment and most people end up buying devices they don't need, that can barely use, or that are extremely overpowered for their needs.  If you are into things like e-book reading, web surfing, email, maps, games and things like that, this device is perfect for you.  If you have the money and really NEED something more powerful (i.e. LOTS of 3D gaming), consider the S2 or even S3.  But please, if your needs are listening to music and checking your email/facebook, consider some of the mid or mid-low range phones.  If quick response and solid build are of particular interest to you, then 300 or so dollars for this phone might be a good investment even if you won't reach its full potential.Sadly this phone comes with Android 2.3.6 (Gingerbread), a very good but relatively old version.  Samsung has promised an Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) update for January 2013, which would place the Galaxy S Advance high among the list of desirable mid-range and upper-mid range smartphones for 2013.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good cell", "Author": "Armand", "ReviewID": "R3ADH4ZAVB9C49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good piece, feels well in hand and has overall good performance.

I'm using it in Venezuela and works great since day 1. It look strong but is light and fine, it's not as big as another samsungs, that is important to me because I have small hands and didn't want a phone that looked like a small tablet when I'm using it. I bought it a flexible case but even with that when I (accidentally) dropped it of a couple of times, the phone didn't feel it, is not as delicate as you can expect from this kind of phones.I have to say that I'm not a app freak or anything close to that, so I use it for normal phone purposes, some small games with no challenging graphics, a lot of personal information like notes, appointments, calendars, photos, some internet use like searches, whatsapp, mails, etc. So if you are a heavy user just look the specification to see if is enough for you. But if you have, like me, a small to medium budget and you want a smart phone with good performance, good quality, easy to use. I surely recommend you this.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Mid-range unlocked smartphone", "Author": "Lawrence R.", "ReviewID": "RI7NENXKQ6QUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mother for her first smartphone. The phone size is perfect for someone with smaller hands or wants to be able to use just one hand/thumb to access the whole screen, and the resolution is is great for simple use. I am an avid high end android smartphone user (nexus line fan) so my expectations are set quite high. The phone comes with Gingerbread (2.3.6) but I installed a leaked Serbian Jelly Bean (4.1.2) rom. The phone works great but could be a little smoother (may happen with an official release, expected in late April 2013). I believe the slight lag from time to time is from the Samsung Touchwiz skin (I have yet to put a Vanilla or bare-bone Android Rom to test). I bench marked the phone with the Quadrant app an it scored (2,702) better than the Galaxy Nexus, and game play pretty well on it. The battery life will depend on how you use it. With moderate use and about 2-3 hours screen time I get from 16-26 hours. This broad range depends if I am on mobile data often or WiFi (saves battery for data). Also, I am using it on T-Mobile and download speeds peaked around 7 Mbps and average 3-4 Mbps. It will be used on AT&T.; The 3G frequencies 850 Mhz & 1900 MHz are good for AT&T;, and the 1900 MHz will work with T-Mobile where they have refarmed their towers for 3/4G [...]I ordered a case and a Mugen Power extended 1800 mAH extended battery (fits with stock back cover). I will update with my findings at a later date.Overall this is a great mid-range GSM unlocked smartphone for the price.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfecto", "Author": "Edgar Delgado", "ReviewID": "RBLU6GPBUBBM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Do compare to similar products and share how long you've used this product.

It is far better looking than the S3 and the S3 mini.A 4 inch screen is the sweet size for a smartphone; you can still use this phone with one hand.This phone easily fits in my pocket and I forget that it's there.If you are technically inclined, you can manually upgrade to Jellybean or flash a custom ROM and kernel.The dual core 1 Ghz processor is quite adequate for everything except very demanding gaming.Cons:Resolution is only 480x800 with pentile pixels.Only 768 mb of RAM. I would like to have gotten 1 Gb, but 768 is enough to multitask without many hiccups.Battery capacity is only 1500 mAh. They could have done better.Comes preloaded with Gingerbread and Samsung has only rolled out buggy 4.1.2 releases in Russian and Serbia.The stock Samsung Gingerbread and Jellybean ROMs drain the battery too fast (2-3% per hour when at idle).Free space is limited to a few gigs without adding a micro sd card.Overall this phone has been a good choice for me, especially after I flashed a custom ROM. I already have a Nexus 7 tablet, so I have no need for a smartphone with a big screen. I really wish more phone manufacturers would make phones with screen sizes around 4 inches with high end hardware and bigger batteries. It's unfortunate that those of us who want smaller screen sizes have to settle for midrange hardware specs and small batteries.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "leonardo", "ReviewID": "R1JTF0588X1IZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i recommend this product..i own this now for a month and it does the job..for it's price it is a great stuff", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy advanced", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3H28BH515T6X0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lovely handset....economical option to the Sii or Siii once you purchase the 32G SD card.
