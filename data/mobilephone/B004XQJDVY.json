According to my local Sprint repair store the phone had been reprogrammed before I received it, Midstar's response was \"I believe Sprint might not know how to activate the phone because we have purchased them directly from our Sprint supplier. We have also received activation instructions from them\".  Really... The rep at the Sprint store was kind enough to replace the defective phone with one of their's, less than 10 minutes later I am out the door with a working phone. I guess they know how to program a phone after all.  Secondly, I was also informed that the battery that was supplied with the MidStar phone was not one of theirs. Ergo, also defective as it barely fits into the phone. $40.00 dollars later, I have a phone and battery that is what I paid for.

It never  freezes, has a responsive touch screen, and it has really fast internet and web surfing.  I would definitely send the word out to everyone that this phone is a really terrific phone.  It's nice on the web and very durable.  It also allows you to watch videos with its awesome kick stand to hold it up.  It's just like a computer, only it fits in your pocket and it sells for a price that's not bad at all. I would definitely give it a five star rating with no problems.

I tried to activate my phone but the battery did not work. After advising this distributer of my battery issue, they sent me TWO new batteries, no questions asked. They didnt even request that I send the bad battery back (this is strange, any legit company would request this). After receiving the new batteries and FINALLY activating my \"new\" phone, I found that the very next day, the phone would not charge. I took the phone to Sprint and they advised that the phone was completely rusted on the inside, had random parts from Japan (not Sprint) in it and that the charger had been saudered on. The phone had major water damage and has been refurbished. Since it is a water damage issue, I have to pay my $100 deductible for Sprint to replace it. Why dont I have this distributer replace it?

Also, the associate also told me 5300 calls were made from this phone and the phone had been activated before. Great news to hear after I spent money on a \"new\" phone. The next problem came about a week later when the phone completely stopped charging. Leaving me to switch batteries with my husband so he could charge the dead one. Brought this back to the same sprint dealer, they informed me that the complete usb charging port in the phone had been damaged and there were no sodder(sp)left on it. Seriously? A month in with this crap???

It's a refurbished phone.  Its certainly not as described.  The only thing new on this was the outer case.  The really important parts are the insides, which appear to have been really poorly repaired by some ill-informed reseller.Here's the bottom line...I bought this for a friend, not me, so I have no way to test this on my account (I am ATT, she has Sprint).  She tried it for a couple of days and it wasn't working as if it was new (tinny sounding, somewhat functioning pixels on the display, low audio quality in general).When I bought this from Amazon, I expected that it would be delivered in a couple of days on my Prime account...it took TEN days, which is just revolting.  They extended my return interval to 31 Jan 2013 and that's fine if it's working.  However, the phone was just returned to me for a return.  Now I am out $200 because some monkey at 5 turd distribution thinks I am trying to scam them.  Quite frankly, I will NEVER purchase from this vendor again, even if their price is 50% less than the next vendor.  Stay away from them.
