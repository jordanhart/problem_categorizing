I had the Nokia Lumia 920 and likes a lot of the personalization features but it lacked my Pandora, pinterest, myfitnesspal, Spotify, and other apps I use daily so I went back to IPhone.NOW, Onto the Lumia 1520. I  had the IPhone 4S. I liked a lot about my iphone but was bored. Seems like since Steve Jobs passing...theres nothing awing about new phones 5, 5c and 5s. Same ol Same ol EXCEPT now...a lot of my apps are always crashing. My wifi isn't that strong in my room, my front camera quit...and it's almost the same as the first iPhone. A lot of good changes but not very many customization features for me. Plus with apple products...EVERYTHING costs.BEFORE PURCHASE:  I decided to get Nokia Lumia 1520 BECAUSE1. Supposedly had many of the apps that I previously could not get on my old Nokia2. More customization with Windows 83. Beautiful Big Screen Like a Tablet4. Amazing Camera by Carl Zeiss5. Mostly...Side by Side comparison that I did with IPhone 5c, 5s and Lumia 1020.(if you can do this side by side comparison which I did on AT&T...I; would do it because it answers a lot of questions and made my decision 100%)6. Ability to Expand storage with the miniSD port7. Ability to get phone in yellow. It was a hard decision between yellow and red because they are both beautifully vibrant but I went with yellow because I love the brighter.UNBOXING:Amazed by color brightness, screen brightness, size and beautiful camera.In the first few days I learned a few more awesome things1. the Lumia now does SnapShot and if you are or have been an iPhone user this is awesome.2. There is a driving mode you can set up with a Bluetooth device to avoid wrecks. No touching phone while driving.3. Some of the apps that were previously said not to be on the windows phones were now there. In face the only thing I do not have that I used a lot was weight watchers...they just have a rinkidink calculator but im sure that will update.4. I can trim videos.5. The live tiles are awesome.Apps that I use a lot that are available that on some reviews were said not to bePinterestSpotifyRdioInstagramAmazonAllrecipesNetflixPandoraMyFitnessPalApp folder (to organize all your apps like IPhone)FREE RINGTONES...NO MORE PAYING FOR THAT CRAPKidsCornerWallet to store credit cardsRun the MapRuntasticVineYouTubeHDI have had this less than a week so I know I will learn more and I will rereview or add to it but my current Conclusion isIf you are looking to upgrade and thinking about trying something new...better camera...more customization with out sacrificing simplicity...live tiles...mostly free apps...free ringtones...driving mode...no sacrificing your current apps, free office, ability to back up on skydrive and at&t; locker....find your phone...ANNNND SOOO MUCH MORE...SWITCH! You wont regret it.Things to know:1. This phone is huge...6 inches. I LOVE IT...some do not. I can see everything beautifully.2. Get a CASE! SERIOUSLY This phone is very slippery on the back. You need some kind of protection and grip to prevent dropping it or if you do to help protect from the fall. *Be carefully applying tight cases...do not press hard on display screen because you can easily distort color on display screen*3. GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR...I recommend armor brand. They have lifetime warranty and less than 10 bucks with amazon free prime shipping.4. If you want smaller phone..you might try Nokia Lumia 1020...better camera and smaller but lacks some of the specs 1520 has. Do side by side comparison.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best of Both Worlds", "Author": "Santosh Geddamuri Sr. \"Happysan\"", "ReviewID": "R34TCVH2Q5OH0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying this phone is amazing.This is my 6th windows phone in a span of 1 year. I keep phone maximum for 3 months and sell it with good value. Earlier i had Lumia 1020 which is amazing phone too. I was in market for a mini ipad.Then i came across this phone . So i thought why not buy Lumia 1520 which can be used as a mini tablet and phone.I have no regrets in buying this phone. Below is my experience with this phone.Form Factor: Yes phone is little big. As this is a phablet category, the size is expected.We cant have a SUV's room in a compact car. So the benefits of large screen is obvious. Also at the same time there will be some inconvinience.Both Hands: Yes most times you need to use both hands. For instance, you cant use back button without using 2nd hand. But i got used to it.After couple weeks ownership , i dont feel this as a inconvinience any more. It matters most in a CAR where you need to handle the phone single handed. So all the time i mount my phone and i can use single hand.Screen: Screen is great and retina. But if you use phone screen without any protector then the screen is very slippery.Camera: Didnt test much but looks as good as lumia 1020 with less zoom.Slim. This phone is very slim when compared to lumia 1020. there is no bulge on the back so it sits flat.I se phone for movies at gym. Lumia 1020's camera bulge was always a chalange at gym. As 1520 sits flat, it is more secure.Speed: I dont think i see much speed improvement over 1020. Though it is quad core ,system still takes time to repsond on certain apps.I believe the speed has to do with particular apps then the phones hardware.When i switched to 1520 ,i thought some lagging in 1020 will be gone in 1520/. but certains apps still lagg.Lanyard: I miss Lanyard of lumia 1020 in this phablet. As this is a big phone, Nokia must have Lanyard option. To remedy this, i added my own . I used incipio air case and added Lanyard to the speaker grill. It works great as the case is strong.Speakers:It is almost same as lumia 1020 speaker with 10-15% improvement in volume. The clarity is same. Both speakers are great. Ear piece could be louder. I dont know but Nokia Lumia series suffers with low ear piece volume.Red Lumia. Red is slippery as every one suggested. Incipio case took care of it.Tiles: Extra column for tiles is a plus. Now one can see more information without moving the screen.Side Keys: Side keys are too flat. It is quite difficult to find volume keys and lock keys .It could be better like lumia 1020.Phone in public: Yes it is eye catching. It doesnt look good if you talk on this phablet in public. But who cares.when Iphone first came, it looked too BIG. but it has become new NORM now. So people will get used to it as phablets become more popular.Also it keep you out of crowd.Pocket: It easily slides into pocket. In my formals and jeans i have no issue in sliding the phone. It fits and doesnt pop out of pocket. As it is slim, the extra length doesnt bother me.Wireless charging. I am really mad on ATT on removing wireless charging from this phone. Hell with the technology and standards. IF they care too much then why did they sell qi wireless chargers. Now that every one got one qi wireless chargers they removed this from phone.ATT ------ in this regard.battery: Awesome. It has very good battery life.It is almost twice that of lumia 1020. I tested battery by turning on everything.Even though the location was turned on, the battery drain was not significant. I believe if location is not used by any app then system turns it off.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS PHONE IS A BEAST", "Author": "W. H.

I can tell you that this phone is amazing. I swapped my 1020 for the 1520 because my dream phone was always a Nokia Lumia phablet with a quad core processor and 1080p screen. My dream has come true.Pros:-The camera is the second best on the market, second to the Lumia 1020.-The battery EASILY lasts 2 days.-No lag. Ever. Windows Phone really DOESN'T need the quad core processor, but you'll notice that even snapping pics is super fast.-The screen is beautiful. Probably one of the best screens on the market. It easily matches/beats Samsung's Super AMOLED or Apple's Retina-The screen is huge!-The dedicated camera button is always nice.-the Lumia design is beautiful, I've always loved the screen \"popping out\"-Micro-SD!-Office is super nice built in-Windows phone has caught up A TON with apps. The apps that Windows Phone does have are definitely easier to use and more clean than their iOS/Android counter parts.Cons-the corners are a little sharp, I wish they were more smooth like the lower end Lumia 1320-the phone is HUGE, while I easily got used to it, and it fits in my hipster skinny jeans, don't expect to have complete one handed control-the matte finish is a bit slippery, but the design allows you to have a good grip-the buttons a bit too flush for my taste-AT&T; guts the Qi chargingIt takes a nano-sim, which isn't a con for me, but it's a note that should be takenOverall a wonderful phone.

I really like the big screen because my eye sights aren't as good as it used so it's much clearer when texting or calling someone since everything on the screen is bigger.  The size however is not too covenient when placed in your shirt pockets or in your jeans but it's just a small issue where you get so much more from this phone.  I like the Windows platform so far due to being comparable to my Windows laptop.  I can open any kinds of emails without any restrictions unlike you get from iPhones.  The only negatives are that you won't get too much apps compared to Androids or Apple but it's getting better each and everyday since Windows phones are catching on so more developers are coming up with more apps, besides I don't use that much of apps other than few I need.  Regardless, I really like and I get comments on my phone when others see me using it.  Again, the battery life is what I really like the most.  I can go on for 3 to 4 days without charging if I don't surf the web too much and only use for making calls.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best Lumia for me yet", "Author": "B.

I figured out that, while they were quality phones, they weren't special, and I didn't form an attachment to them. I have with the 1520. The screen is beautiful, it's fast, playing games is just way more fun, and as a media consumption device, it's top-notch because of the huge dimensions. The expanded storage is awesome, too. I've got a 32gb card in there and it's working great.Only downside I've found that are worth thinking twice about is the weight distribution. Even with big hands, I find if I'm laying down it topples over in my hand. I think it's perhaps top heavy given the camera location.

And for me, it's Straight Talk too!", "Author": "Book Glutton", "ReviewID": "RLXYGC37IAL38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Nokia phones since the early cell phone days. I have looked at and demoed many other phones, but until last year I have been primarily a Symbian OS person. Over the years, Nokia has produced an incredible line of business-type phones. These came with great media software for my audio books (simply drag & drop - I did not want to get into iTunes, just let me use Mp3s), incredible cameras, great synchronization software for Microsoft Outlook, and a primitive version of Microsoft Office. My latest Nokias supported 32GB & SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A cards. I carried a ton of stuff around with me, dozens of audiobooks and other audio content. Along the way, I graduated to the Nokia 808 PureView Unlocked GSM Phone with 41MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics and Symbian (Belle) OS - Black, which I got at a steal. It had the Nokia Belle OS, which I thought was great. It was a super phone, the best I had owned. I had no desire to change or to replace it until I fell asleep in my recliner, it dropped into the \"mechanics,\" and getting up, I completely destroyed it. The price to replace it was steep and it looked as if support for Belle would not last very far into the future. Nokia was going Windows! I was not sure I liked that. I looked into all the top name phones. It seemed that people were getting tired of the iPhone. I wasn't crazy about the Samsungs or others. I simply wanted a business phone, like I've used over the years. I had received a Kindle fire HD as a gift, entered the \"app\" world and found these tools incredible. I found myself carrying this around with me and my Nokia 808. I had also switched my service to Straight Talk (see: Straight Talk AT&T; Micro Sim iPhone 4, 4s, Galaxy S3), working with AT&T; towers (and for a year has cost me $42 a month with unlimited everything).All my research, and it was comprehensive (you can start from the phonearena site and go from there), was pointing to the Windows Phone 8. I wasn't too sure I wanted to go that way. At the same time, most Windows phones were Nokia brands with similar, familiar hardware and capabilities. However, few of these, those that were GSM phones, supported MicroSD cards. Yet, I came across one phone I liked that did, the Nokia Lumia 822 GSM Unlocked + Verizon CDMA 4G LTE Windows Phone - Black which was both a Verizon CDMA 4G LTE, but also Unlocked for any GSM network. They seemed to be selling cheaply everywhere. I picked one up used and cheap, threw in my SIM card and was amazed. It was a great and powerful phone. It did not support AT&T; 4G or LTE bands, but did everything else quite well. This is where I tested the Windows Phone 8 environment and fell in love with it. There were other great phones that were available, like the Nokia Lumia 1020, Yellow 32GB (AT&T;), but they did not support MicroSD cards. Back then, once satisfied with Windows and wanting to go to 4G/LTE, I set my sights on the Nokia Lumia 1520 (RM-940 Version), which supports the AT&T; LTE700 (B17), LTE1700/2100 (B4) Bands and the 3G/4G 850 Mhz which are used by Straight Talk (and work well - be careful there are a lot of the RM-937 International Versions for sale out there which use different frequencies). Over a number of months, a number of sites were doing searches for me for an \"unlocked\" version of this phone. When the price was right, I bought it in this matte yellow finish. I am more than happy with it. The only CON I have is that AT&T; gutted 16GB of the 32GB this phone can support internally, but it looks like I may never need it, the apps are quite efficient. This now is the best phone I've owned. I won't be looking for another anytime soon. Remember, it's not just the phone, it's also Windows Phone 8, and for me Straight Talk too! Note: it takes a Nano SIM card. I had to cut mine, but it was not a problem (see: QQ-Tech\u00ae Newest Noosy Black 2in1 Nano Sim Card Cutter & Micro Sim Cutter for iPhone 5, iPhone 4, 4S and other Phones + QQ-Tech\u00ae Sim Card Adapters Pack).It does everything every Nokia phone I have owned has done and more, including having the 2nd best camera around. Some people say it's large, but it's not if you are used to carrying a Kindle around with you. This has a Kindle App and takes its place now. It has just about every other app you would want, comes with Mobile Office, great free GPS, a quad processor, a monster battery and an incredible screen. It fits in any of my pockets, even with a flip case (Poetic FlipBook Case for Nokia Lumia 1520 Black (3 Years Manufacturer Warranty from Poetic) which I recommend). The Live Tiles are incredible. The ease of use puts other phones to shame. I have six other friends right now who have switched to the Windows Phone 8 world in the last two months from just seeing my satisfaction and knowing the research that I did. They are all Verizon customers and have gone to the Nokia Lumia 822. They could not be happier.You may not be looking for a Nokia Lumia 1520 right now. I do not think you would go wrong with it. You might, however, want to try the Windows Phone 8 world like I did. Should you try, you might be surprised as I was. Then you will be ready to choose which of the phones in that world would be the best investment for you. It might take a two-step process as it did with me. It might take having some fun with all of this!", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gigantic piece of pleasure", "Author": "Hellride \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R2DPGKYKA3Z9AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I assumed I would hate this phone given I didn't like the size of my Galaxy Note 2 and never got used to it. For some reason I got used to the size of this thing during the initial setup, yes I still find moments like going down the road that make me realize this phone requires mostly 2 hand operations and reaching your fingers across the screen is impossible but what should you/I expect buying a 6 inch phone.Most people complain about the market place on Windows Phone, and yes there are some apps you can't find on here like U.S. Banking app for example but using the web application on a 6inch screen is much more pleasant and natively functional.Other than that I find that big app players finally made their way to the WP platform or a 3rd party app is to be found.The specs on this phone speak for themselves and with the soon to be release WP 8.1 update that will be available for this phone when AT&T; decides to push it will bring more major improvements that will make this thing a monster of a phone.This phone keeps me up to date on my 11 email accounts and tons of other things without scrolling much on the screen as the real estate has lots of room to pin your live tiles.The 16GB is holding me over for now but the ability to store content to SD card is rumored (I believe it) to be improved with WP 8.1 in a couple of month.The camera is only the 20MP of Nokia but takes amazing pictures and has a variety of options that you see on most Galaxy commercials.The speed of this phone is pretty much instant and overall use of this phone is a pleasure.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, all superlatives", "Author": "Lawrence J.

I have used so many phones/OS that I am fascinated by the diversity of ecosystem. I have used HTC Titan, some previous Lumia series  and past Windows Mobile series. After dabbling with iOS, webOS, WM, I have settled on a Android as a primary phone. Nokia Lumia series is elegantly designed. The 1520 is just gorgeous.I am interested in the specs of Lumia from following parameters. phone: size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR ratingNokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)In my opinion, following are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.The things that pop out is the screen size and the external storage capability. Obviously weight is a downside. The windows phone 8 operating system has matured to a large extent and most of common apps are available. It does still lag its distant cousins iOS and Android. But Nokia has given a splendid hardware.
