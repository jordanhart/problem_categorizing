I've dropped it way too many times, soaked it in water, and one time nail polish remover and it still works... If you want a phone that will last you, this will do just that.There are a few things about this phone that I have never liked, but I can deal with them because they are small problems.Problem 1: There is no way to control brightness.Problem 2: The camera only takes pictures landscape orientation.Problem 3: This is the stupidest problem. When the phone is plugged in to charge, the screen will remain on. It will dim itself after a little while but it stays on. So if I want to charge my phone while I sleep, I have to put it face down and cover it. This is also very stupid because this is an \"Eco-friendly\" phone and when it is finished charging it alerts you telling you to unplug it, to save energy. But it is a waste of energy to have its screen stay on while it is charging... Also, when the phone is dying it will keep waking itself up to tell you it is dying, and therefore will die faster.Other than these problems, though, I like my phone. The market for sliding phones is ridiculous because nobody cares for them anymore due to smart phones. But this is a reasonably priced phone that I like and recommend. I have had no problems with the touch screen.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cell phone", "Author": "Donna Lee Barber Faulkner", "ReviewID": "R81PPIMICIK6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Straight Talk LG 505C Prepaid Cell Phone is one of the very best.
