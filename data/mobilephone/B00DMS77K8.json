It is just as fast as the big brother. There are just three features the mini don't have that the S4 has: the drama shot, the duel shot, and the hover sensor. Other than that, you can hardly tell the difference! It has the other bells and whistles as the S4 and comes in a smaller (but not by much) lighter body. This is by far the best mini out there!! For the price, it is a perfect alternative to the S4.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S4 Mini - Just the right size with many superb features - Detailed Review", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RKJTMOG6ICNXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, one of the best, if not the best I ever used--the screen is 4.3 inches and for me the perfect size! In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3\" screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Mini S4 phone. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Kit Kat is coming soon to this phone on the OTA (OVER THE AIR) software update from Samsung. This was announced on several websites on February 23, 2014. So even though this device came with 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, not to worry, if you want Kit Kat, it should be on this phone soon. I tried Kit Kat on the Tab Pro and it is very different, but it is a beautiful OS.Till then, I shall keep on trying to update and keep you informed...PROS:+  SIZE, SIZE COMPARISON and WEIGHT - The screen size is a just right 4.3, I find not too large nor small. Looking at this phone side by side with the older S3 Mini, it is just a bit larger in overall size than the S3 Mini, yet the screen size on this phone is larger and clearer and so easy to read compared to the S3 Mini! Also it is still slim and pocketable like the S3 Mini as it is so lightweight to carry as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.+ MICRO SIZED SIM CARD: The S4 Mini has a new type of Micro Sim card slot (Since I had a Sim cutter I bought on Amazon, I simply cut my old standard Sim card, popped it into this phone and it works fine). So you can cut your Sim, or go to a phone store and they will cut it for  you are just transfer your info onto a Micro Sim. The APN settings automatically set up when I set this phone up, so I was able to keep all my plan working great.Info about Sim cards: Standard Sim cards are not being used much in newer phones these days, most of the time Micro Sims are required and some are requiring the newer Nano Sim such as the new Samsung Galaxy S5, and newer Apple phones.+  Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.+ WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser). The WiFi signal on this phone is VERY STRONG!+ DATA - I get very fast data on my S4 Mini, just about as fast as my WiFi at home. It shows up at 3G+ (I do not have 4G or LTE in my area). Overall, the websites loaded quickly in data. Also, I have a small data plan that I use with my minutes and I have a No Contract Monthly plan which I find very reasonable.+ Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!This will accept up to 64GB SD card, but I had a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ CAMERA - The 8MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my regular camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera and I have been happy with all the pictures I took!+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Runs somewhat warmer than past Android phones - Due to a larger processor and faster processor, this requires more use of the battery causing the battery to heat up more and the battery to drain faster than say the older S3 Mini, S3, S2 etc. It is natural for the battery/phone to get a little warm when downloading a app, charging the phone, playing a game (some games really heat up this phone), running lots of apps at the same time. Also, the regular S4 runs very warm due to the larger processor.However, the battery/phone stays pretty cool when I am NOT downloads apps from the Playstore, and I do not play games on this phone.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you want to carry a phone that is not so large and fits into your pocket and you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S4, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment section and I will answer in a very timely manner.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "I bought it from WorldWide Distributors and it is not the same as the description", "Author": "Reinita55", "ReviewID": "R2PDO82VTN9FLB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The title say \"Samsung Galaxy S4 mini GT-I9190 Unlocked International Version - White\" and I have to say it is not the 9190, it is the 9192, basicly the same phone but dual sim, at first I was upset because it wasn't what I bought, but I'm from an other country and it took long time to sent the phone to me, so it wasn't easy to send it back right away because I'm going to USA in march, so I thought that I should not make a big deal out of it... so I was happy with it, and it is actually a very good phone, perfect size, good screen, I love android (I had a Windows Phone before, it was good but now I think a prefer Android), but what really bothered me was that when I turned on the phone and was putting my settins, specificly the google account (pretty much the most important one) it just collapsed, I spend a whole day trying to do the that so I could use the phone properly (download apps from the market for example) and I just couldn't, I even had to do a hard reset to the phone, that one pressing the home button+volume up+power button, and then it let me do all  the settings... it works great but every 2 days o once a day it shut down, and a had to start it again, or it simply reset itself... I really dont know why, if its a refurbished peace (it doesn't seen like it was), I havent istalled a lot of things, basics stuff (and candy crush of couse LOL), but I really cant say what the problem is...Conclusion, be carefull because you may not get what they are saying (GT-I9190)", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "JESUS OLIVO", "ReviewID": "RXQWJR6ATCDLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product.

One is the introduction about this item does not mention about the internal memory. It is 8G so if you want a bigger one, maybe you need to find others.The other is sometimes it does not work smoothly when I play games on it (Candy Crush). I don't know why, maybe it's the network problem.Overall, I recommend you to buy this if you need a cute, light, normal size and functional phone.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got a problem cellphone", "Author": "jie min li", "ReviewID": "R2P9RTSNPKWDOJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini on 10/6.
