Philip \"Author of over 100 boo...", "ReviewID": "RQPCS008WH5RA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a slightly more expensive model in this series, but has several merits. I have always been a fan of the Xperia series. It is one of the most successful series by Sonly (also, formerly, or Sony Errickson) and over the years I have used a number of models from this series.Actually I came across this series a few years ago when I was looking for a phone with the following characteristics:1. Very compact2. Easy to use3. Superb camera quality4. Reasonable priceI found that the Experia series met all the above requirements.This model from the series maintains all the above features, but at the same time it has improved upon all the features and specifications. Those who have used the earlier models will be pleased at the vast improvements. Those for whom this is the first-time buy of a machine from this series it will surely give a pleasant surprise.The increased cost is ok when one considers the enhancements one finds in this model.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Nelxon Gomez", "ReviewID": "R176HSRZ71OBIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a real watterproof smartphone you can use it every where! swimming pool, beach, rains days! excelent so you can quit the battery too:D", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "one problem", "Author": "AMAL", "ReviewID": "R1Y575H4W82PQT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very nice colour, good features, and great camera.However, after two months it started to shout down and not working again untilI remove the battery and return it back.
