It was a refurbished model and arrived in great condition. She has been using it and loves it. The only draw back is she is unable to get push mail to her phone due to only enterprise (corporate) is supported. However, the work around is Internet email. She can go to her gmail account and log in, click the \"keep me logged in\" box and save to bookmarks. After that she does not have to log in each time but goes directly to her mail quickly.I have purchased several unlocked phones from Amazon, some new, and some refurbished. All I do is put my Tmobile sim in them and I am ready to go.

Never Buy.", "Author": "DKG", "ReviewID": "RVXYBOAIZ0CSX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered this item in NEW in first week of December 2012. When it arrived within a week, to my dismay, I discovered that the item was used. It had signs of usage on its body. When I removed its back cover, the inside was dusty, scratched and had clear signs of previous usage. Even the battery did not seem new. Furthermore, even the metal piece that is used to hold the SIM card in place was broken. Last but not the least, the charger was not an original Blackberry charger, but some cheap MADE IN CHINA product. I would never buy anything from AMAZON again.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "with alot quantity some mobile come very bad", "Author": "diego", "ReviewID": "R1TYRMAHKBECZM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "my opinios is for seller recellulartoo, he always sold to my, but for the begining very good all is ok, but now when you bought quantity like 30 or 50 mobile always mobile the 10 or 15% come defective, for example usb, awful, if you want buy one is good, but if you want bouy 20 or 30 items.. you need to know that always 10 or 15% come damage or defective.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "allie1423", "ReviewID": "RY610FVYJYRU1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first BlackBerry and overall I am loving it.
