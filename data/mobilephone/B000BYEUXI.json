It just never breaks down, never locks up, never goes wierd.  I've fallen back to it several times, once after my blackberry became quirky, and once with an international phone.  Originally, I purchased a much more expensive spiffy phone with camera, bells and whistles.  I brought it back to exchange for this phone failing to get a clear line.  I live in a poor reception area.  The sales person said the signal would be better and there would be less hassels.  He was right.  I can always depend on this little fellow.  It doesn't look like much, but I am secure that my calls will happen when I want them to.  This is a great back up, no headache phone.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Reliable, cheap phone-and only a phone", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R39APUOB2SY4S5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simple, well built, excellent battery life; the 6010 is a great phone-and that's all it is.There's no easy way to move information/addresses to the phone-no bluetooth, no included cable.  There are 3rd party cable's available.The keyboard is large and is great for dialing in the middle of the night (like I do). I think it has one of the largest number keypad's of any phone.I've dropped this phone numerous times, and it hasn't had any problems.If you only want a mobile phone with nothing else, this is a good choice.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sweet Candybar, almost Waterproof/Shockproof!!", "Author": "CuffLadyNYC", "ReviewID": "R1PJ0N5YG49H3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "That's even much better than the other reviewer mentioned: IT has its web browser which works pretty well, not a just-a-phone thing, it is a cute one with a decent keyboard, good for guys always complaining of their fingers not fitting ok...!Works with instant communicators! Yahoo, AIM & AOL, it's its coolest feature, indeed! For weeks connected to yahoo, and at the same time using the phone, as well!Every now and then dropped on the park, 10feet high to catch it alive and well, down the hill... Lots of ringtones, one for each buddy call, or sms, very much a user-friendly phone.Charge last much more than my other Motorolas, maybe more than 2 times longer. Bought a second spare one, maybe for the times I cannot find a new one available, one year or so from now...!!On the side I have a Motorola C650, just for the camera when its warm outside, but can't leave my 6010 at home, just love it!", "Date": "November 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great phone that got here fast", "Author": "Keith P.

I'm glad it's unlocked because I am an AT&T; user and the cell phone was made for T-Mobile, lol. I laugh all the time because I remember when these types of cell phones (that didn't have a colored screen) were the \"it\" phones back in my days, lol.If you used to have or use a cell phone with a keyboard or whatever, it'll take some time for you to get used to but it's really no big deal.

The phone has worked every time, gets great reception compared to other models I have used (a few dropped calls, but that is the network not the phone) and replacement batteries have been cheap to buy when needed.  If you need just a basic phone and this model will work on your network, buy this phone.

While I am gradually thinking about getting a \"smartphone\", I probably WILL NOT get rid of my Nokia 6010 or its dedicated phone number.  Reason:  This is a traditional cell phone which is astonishingly durable.  It has fallen hard on the floor a few times.  The battery life is very long - although I have this cell phone turned off fairly often, there are other times I leave it on all day, and generally I recharge the battery every two weeks.  Recharging the battery only takes about an hour.  Trust me, smartphones need very frequent battery recharging.The Nokia 6010 has very good reception, subject to the occasional geographic limitations of T-Mobile's GSM cell tower network.  Voice audio quality is easy to understand and clear.  The buttons are fairly large, it's easy to learn the functions on this phone.  The display is fairly easy to read, for viewing text messages, dialed or received numbers, and similar information.The only real drawback to the Nokia 6010, and the other vintage Nokia \"chocolate bar\" cell phones (as distinguished from the more-commonplace \"flip phone\" designs), is that when the unit is turned on, it is too easy to bump some of the keys and start typing out a phone number or some other type of command.This is the \"Swiss Army Knife\" of basic \"dumbphones\".  The very long battery life is a huge plus, particularly if you are facing emergency conditions such as an extended power outage.  Even if you love your smartphone, you may want to consider activating an inexpensive but durable \"dumbphone\" such as this as a backup device for voice calls, in the event that your beloved smartphone becomes broken, damaged, stolen or electronically malfunctioning - while eventually you can get a replacement, it would be nice to retain a working \"dumbphone\" with its own dedicated cell phone number as an interim communications device.In summary, I have personally used the Nokia 6010 as my primary wireless phone for 7 years and 7 months.  It still works for its intended purpose.  If you value simplicity, durability and reliability in the design of electronic products, this remains a good choice for a perfectly-functional \"dumbphone\".", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome for phone calls", "Author": "shery", "ReviewID": "R30TZQ6J7V4WAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My dad loves these phone.
