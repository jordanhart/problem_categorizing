Great Price !", "Author": "Joshua Hare", "ReviewID": "R3DQGCY0BFGYTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little skeptical buying this phone since I wasn't familiar with the manufacture but so far I am very pleased. The call quality is great. It doesn't feel cheap and it's of average weight. This is a perfect phone for the consumer who is looking to save money but who also wants a quality reliable device. If your looking for an Iphone or Galaxy SIII smart phone I think you might be disappointed but if you want a phone that is powerful enough for social media and you-tube and other internet related services I think you'll really enjoy this phone. The phone is incredibly responsive with a snapdragon processor and alot of RAM. The fact that it comes with Ice Cream Sandwich is also a bonus. Awesome phone, great value.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "powerful phone", "Author": "carlos", "ReviewID": "R2XTGLAYRMR337", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is nice i like that it has a 4 inch screen.The phone is capable of playing  3d games good no lag graphics look better on lg motion but this one boots up way faster than lg or even galaxy.Gets warm not hot.Camera is nice it has a 1MP front camera i think if not VGA.Recommend it", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Huawei Premia: Skeptical buyer review", "Author": "S.H", "ReviewID": "R1OC1AZ86ZPJUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never bought a phone from Huawei brand before, however, I wasn't disappointed. The phone is very fast with videos and web pages. It doesn't lag with games. At first, my battery life was draining very fast, but I began clearing my cache for apps after use and my phone's battery lasts most of the day (7+ hours) now even with occasional use of messaging, Facebook, YouTube, chatting, and web browsing. I love the small notification light on the right-hand side, alerting of FB notifications, voicemail, and messages. The user interface isn't bad either.I was looking for all these qualities inside a 4G phone from Metro PCS and decided against the LG Motion despite its popularity because of it's extremely small screen. I'm pleased to say that Huawei Premia has all of specs of an LG Motion, but with a considerably larger screen. If you are looking for a budget 4G phone with great qualities and a larger screen, I recommend the Huawei Premia.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from the Motion; easily rooted", "Author": "John Goggan", "ReviewID": "RVVUTXOGJKLPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using and was very happy with the LG Motion for over year.  Recently, my wife's old (non-Smartphone) phone died, so we decided to transfer my Motion to her and I bought this Huawei Premium to be my new phone.  Specs compared VERY closely to the LG Motion -- processor speed is very similar (the Motion is advertised as a dual-processing 1.2ghz phone, but actually runs at 1.5ghz out of the box for most people) -- except that this Premia has a larger screen (4\" versus 3.5\" in the Motion).  Benchmarks show the Premia generally beating out the Motion, but still being fairly close in performance.  Short version: the Premia is the better version of the Motion hardware.Also, just so people know, this Premia is currently EASILY rooted.  So, for those into doing their own thing, it is easy to root this phone and do what you like.  There is a nice Recovery bootloader that works fine -- so FULL \"bare metal\" backups and ROM replacements can be done without much worry.  There are some great ROM options out there -- if you'd really like to make the most of this phone.Hard to beat this phone in the sub-$100 range.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "O,Cuevas \"Oz\"", "ReviewID": "R371AQISGYOC69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone for the price I got it I wish I would have gotten two when I got this one.

After visiting my local metro store, the salesman told me how great the Spirit was, but encouraged me to buy the Premia phone by Huawei. I was reluctant at first since I didn't do my research on this phone and I never even heard of the manufacturer. It was hard to say no since the authorized dealer was running a promotion, where I could get the phone, first months payment, and activation all for $100 and was told it was very much comparable to the Spirit but better since the Premia offers a 1.5 Dual Core versus the Spirit, which only has 1.2. Who could say no to that right? The Spirit didn't come with such offer. After 2 weeks of use, I'm so disappointed. I get dropped calls all the time, my alert icons don't show up sometimes on my activity bar to show if I had a missed call, or text, and it's just not practical or user friendly like other androids. I took it in for a factory reset, since they wouldn't give me a new phone on the first go-around but still experiencing the same issues. I'm going in tomorrow to exchange for the Spirit phone, which I should've bought in the first place. I have three words for you: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Every1BH", "ReviewID": "R1WEQLS48TF074", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Really smooth, fast load time, fast boot, 3D games e.g: Dead Trigger, Modern combat 2,3,4, Nova.Cons: none yetIts my first HUAWEI brand phone, and im really impressed!

I didn't. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. While it has some good features it has the worst battery life of any cell phone I have ever bought. There is virtually zero support from the manufacturer and no manual. One must download a large PDF file which is vague at best. Also Metro PCS's support is non existent. Worst phone I ever bought but it only cost me $88 and I have no contract. Since its a prepay I have 3 weeks to find a better phone and write this one off to bad judgment and a lot of baloney from the Metro salesperson.
