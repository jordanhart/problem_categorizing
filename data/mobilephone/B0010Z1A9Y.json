{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone that has served me well over the past 2 years", "Author": "Lil Tae", "ReviewID": "R99K76GG7WJMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for two years now!  It has been a pretty solid device.  Call quality is very decent and I can count on one hand the amount of times I've experienced a dropped call.  I love the fact that I can be logged into AIM and Yahoo IM at the same time all while receiving SMS and email from yahoo, gmail, and hotmail.  The inbox is great and I love how they put it all in one place.  The music player is fine and it plays MP3's, WMA's and AAC files.  It doesn't have a standard 3.5mm earphone jack.  It has an adapter so that you can plug in your earphones.  The SD Card slot is conveniently located so I can swap out in a pinch. (None of that battery cover opening crap)  Unfortunately, this thing eats the battery like a kid eats candy.  You'll have to charge it every day.  The phone is also a bit big so it won't fit in your pocket very well.  But it's solid though.  I've dropped it a few times and it's taken some hard spills.  The slider still works great.  The phone is very durable.  The screen looks very good and can be very bright if you want it to be.  Texting is nice, but now I've had a problem with it missing some of my keypresses lately.  It wasn't like this initially and it doesn't happen unless I am texting fast.  I'm guessing it's because my phone is a bit old now.  This problem started a few months ago.  The internet is pretty quick on it and I've hardly ever been without 3G reception.  Youtube videos load really quick.  All in all, this has been a great phone that has served me well.  If you are looking for something cheap, reliable, and full of features, I can't suggest a better phone.I'll be honest, I really want a new phone now.  I was thinking about getting an iPhone but I am leary of the call quality issues in comparison.  So I'll stick with this for now until iPhone comes out for Verizon.  :)", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Overall Phone with Superior Signal Strength", "Author": "GM NAVIGATION DVD P/N 15807780", "ReviewID": "R390EGY8M0LHHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used HELIO OCEAN and HELIO's SERVICE PLAN for over 2 years.Immediately Dropped Calls went away!

It didn't hold a charge very well, but the rest was fine. I found out that I couldn't get it to work with my provider(verizon), since it is a virgin mobile device. I tried to contact the seller through amazon,but found no e-mail or phone number. I finally found a way and got no reply. I wanted to return this item for a refund, but that is not a possibility apparently.
