This is a good basic telephone.  The compact size along with a QWERTY keyboard makes this an easy to use phone for basic needs.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent feature phone, held back by bad software design, and annoying Verizon software", "Author": "Josh H-G", "ReviewID": "R2YU6830XUKLC7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I don't especially care about having a smartphone or a data plan. I just want to make occasional calls, texts, and possibly take a picture once in a while.This phone does all of that respectably.Call quality is good. Not as nice as many Nokia phones I've owned over the years, but definitely not bad.Texting is easy enough on either keyboard, but not great on either as well.I've had my phone for about a year and a half now. I drop it relatively frequently, and while I have some scuffs, mine has been operating dependably the entire time. I think it's durable enough for most people, but it is not the most rugged phone you could purchase either.After a year and a half, my battery life is still good, too. I am a light user, but I generally only have to charge every 2-4 days depending on what i've been doing. More use means every other day generally, less means I can get to 4 days or so sometimes. Battery life is still good after this long.It is small enough to pocket comfortable, and large enough to hold comfortably as well.The camera is pretty unimpressive. It will take a picture, but you're really best to not try unless you've got a lot of good daylight. Even with the best conditions, you'll still get an okay picture at best.The real reason I would only give this phone low marks is the combination of questionable software design on LG's part, and the really annoying additions that Verizon made to make things even worse. What could be a decent feature phone is mostly marred by bad software design and intrusion by Verizon. Nothing so bad that the phone is unusable, but it can be quite frustrating.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "just what i wanted", "Author": "Pamela J.
