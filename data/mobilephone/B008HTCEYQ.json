{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not as expected", "Author": "Ted Z.", "ReviewID": "R20HZIVIZ9N625", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the phone only for its MP3 player function, as featured in its name--Walkman.It's small, light, and really cute-looking, with relatively higher batt capacity compared to other small phones. And that's all I have to say about its strengths so far.What dissappointed me alot is that the phone, advertised as a music phone, is not at all professional in playing music. The user interface is pretty simple, the equalizer is just SHABBY, and more important, the sound quality is very unimpressive. Mabybe I have been used to Android and iOS, I found Symbian out-dated and not \"smart\" enough (I know it's not fair to compare these two systems now).Last, to those who also want to use the phone as an MP3 player, be informed that you only have the basic MP3 player function available if you don't insert a sim card into the phone. Not even the shabby equalizer! and other useful functions such as video player, voice recorder, FM radio, alarm, etc, are totally unavailable without a sim card!", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "meets my perceived needs", "Author": "Joel King", "ReviewID": "RBXS3LWDGBAMN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Being a touch screen without draining the battery is something I value.  Picked this phone cause you can remove the battery.  I have not had that annoying feeling of needing to recharge  excessively like a smartphone.  The music player is lacking in options, usable if just occasionally listening.  Seems ridiculous but there is a d@mn disco song pre-installed that the phone will not allow to be removed.  Has enough tools to impress, unless your phone defines you in some way (giggle).  Nice to have wifi without an ATT (mandatory) data plan.  Texting is well organized, arranged by contact in a blog commenting format. Warning: no full keyboard.  Turns on/off quickly.  Don't get the phone for the camera if you have quality expectations, cause it is not 'quite enough'.  Could babble on in typical geek fashion, however, I purchased (and has met my needs) for low power use, reliable signal reception, has a bright enough screen and is small but not micro-sized. Oh, and an alarm can be set and will ring even if the phone is off. Sweeeeet.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "sony", "Author": "I.

It's really annoying to use. Few examples:1) you turn it on, then don't expect to be able to use it for around 3-4 minutes. It will \"apparently\" be functional, but it's actually tilted. Touchscreen won't do anything but it would suddenly move somewhere, of course not where you wanted to.2) Starting to play the music takes forever after disconnected from PC3) Out of no reason it would stop responding to the keys, it's like it's having \"one of those days\"4) Playing songs is not improved whatsoever. You just cant play all the music from an artist, it would ask you to go to an album. Really, a PITA if you have one or 2 songs from each album.5) Already mentioned this, but there's no way that the software from Sonyericsson would recognize my phone, therefore, you don't have backup or contacts/calendar syncI really dont understand why they released the phone with this Symbian OS. You just dont expect this to happen in a 21st century phone. I wouldn't mind if my old Nokia 1100 would tilt frequently, but this is unacceptable.-------------------------------I bought it for sale at U$60 and dont think you'll find anything better for a better price. features are good, but if you need to write in spanish you are in trouble since it doesnt come with Spanish predictive Text.Touch is good, sometimes it doesnt get the fingers right but ok. Player is ok, but takes lots of time to start on shuffle, much more than a regular mp3 player that you just push shuffle and starts playing. Furthermore, it looks like it has the ability to play playlists, but you cant build them on the phone, nor draggin a playlist to the folders. Maybe you need to install some propietary software on the PC to transfer them.Finally, cant seem to make the PC Suite, downloaded from Sonyericsson, run. It installs, but the Cell is never found.I would be very upset if i had payed the thing the price it said it was before the rebate, but since I did, cant complain too much", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "chimbisimo", "Author": "alvaro giovanni villamizar martinez", "ReviewID": "R286B1EJOIYLMG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "volumen bajo, se siente muy endeble,parece un juguete para ni\u00f1os, ni siquiera tiene un bloqueo de pantalla con clave, buenas noches", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GSM GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900.
