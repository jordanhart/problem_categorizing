Easy to put a sim in, and works, but within a month I found I could no longer hear the caller unless I put it on speaker phone- and if I put in ear plugs I could hear them but they couldn't hear me!  So some glitch went on there.  Great, however, for texting and plans in other countries are cheap for that.  Overall, it lasted while I was overseas, but that was a few months - and with the last couple as speakerphone only.  So that's something to consider.  It's cheap, it won't get stolen, and it does get in TV to watch while waiting for planes/etc.  Nothing fancy, but gave me a life line so I wouldn't get stranded.Another downside, as mentioned, is that it's really hard to navigate and the instruction manual is very very limited.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just the perfect reasonable priced phone", "Author": "Hermij", "ReviewID": "R2QWBSSCDUPTAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone came with everything as described by the manufacturer, it is super lightweight, supports my dual sim perfectly, good reception and most of all for me I can pick up local Tv stations, and I live in the Caribbean.Charger/data cable is ideal and any regular headphones can work with it.

I only use mine to text my kids or make very occasional phone calls. Thus, I have a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go plan, and as a Gold Rewards customer, I only pay about 10-20 dollars for my phone annually! I bought this phone just because I wanted something smaller than my previous (and older) Nokia. I slipped the T-Mobile SIM card in, and everything worked perfectly. Everything seems to be working fine, the FM radio does a pretty good job, but the TV feature doesn't seem to be able to bring anything in except a fuzzy Spanish channel, if I'm lucky (I live in Orange County, CA).

I am pleased with the product however I do have a few complaints. The first thing is that the phone is all plastic which gives it a really cheap feel. Another con is that the buttons are really loud when you type. The keyboard is on the small size, but it works for me. I would definitely not recommend getting this phone if you have big fingers. Even though it looks cheap it doesn't feel cheap and it comes in different colors which is fun. Basically, if you're looking for a simple and cheap phone this is a great one as long as you don't like the cheap feel.

They have lots of activities where I have to drop them off and split to take another kid to another sport. Being stationed in Italy, I needed a phone that was unlocked, could hold a SIM, was easy to use, but was not expensive. This met all the qualifications. It doesn't take the best pictures, but my kids love it. It does everything I need and more: texts, calls, Internet, videos, pictures, music, games to keep the kids occupied, and the battery lasts quite a while. I also like the multiple colors so that my kids don't have to wonder if they grabbed the right phone. The only thing that was a bummer was that the company does not ship to Italy, even via APO, so I had to ship it to my sister and she had to forward it to me.

It's horrible in terms of functions and features but the battery life is great, the audio quality is good enough, and it's cheap enough that if it gets broken it won't be a huge deal.  The phone can't receive picture messages (good if you have kids) and you will reguarly have to delete text messages as the phone maxes out at like 20 or 30 messages (even with an 8GB micro SD card in it which, for some reason, can't bypass this 20 or 30 text limit).I can imagine that criminals would also love this phone as it's disposable and has the ability to use 2 SIM cards...

(He is 11) I wanted something very simple with no smartphone capabilities. This phone is very simple, maybe a bit too simple. The FM radio does work well (the reason I got this particular phone). The messaging is kind of weird and my son never knows when he has a voicemail. Texting is easy to send, but receiving isn't as simple. The camera is total junk (even worse than I was expecting). The worst thing is that there is no keylock that you can set. There is a timeout feature that will lock the keys, but that is annoying to set a very short timeout feature just so that you can have you phone locked in your pocket. He is constantly pocket calling.So bottom line-- it does work on ATT. The sound is actually quite clear and texting functions. The FM radio also works fine.
