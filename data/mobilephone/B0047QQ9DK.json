{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Spartan Smartphone Without Contract", "Author": "Mr. Staack", "ReviewID": "R1U8Z97PYHIQ1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Rumor2 on Virgin Mobile will NOT appeal to technophiles who want the latest and greatest, but this is a really good smartphone for those who have very modest needs but want a solid well-built phone with good battery life and a full keyboard.  The chicklet-style QWERTY keyboard is pretty good, making it easy to type by touch (instead of hunting and pecking).  The outer keypad ain't to shabby either.  The screen isn't very big, but reasonably sharp, with good color and contrast and pretty bright.  The call sound is pretty good, depending on the strength of your signal - but under ideal situations, I've had very clear conversations.  The Rumor2's speakerphone is reasonably loud, certainly enough for hands-free use in a car.  It synced up with all of my Bluetooth headsets without much difficulty.  I invested in a snap-on case that has helped it stand up to a few bumps, without any problems.  The screen slides effortlessly, and feels very sturdy.  Internet browsing is dependent on your signal, but only about as fast as 56k dial-up.  The default browser, Myriad V7, is pretty lousy.  However, you can install Opera Mini 4, which is light-years better. Through Opera's automatic compression feature, you can browse around a lot faster.  The camera is a 1.3MP through software trickery (probably image interpolation), but still fairly good for a phone camera with good light sensitivity, auto-focus, and good color depth.  The internal memory is a little small, but the Rumor2 accepts MicroSD cards (the largest I've tested was 2GB).  The contact manager is pretty good, allowing for a lot of info per contact and personalized photos.  All the other features like calendar, alarm, calculator, etc. are decent - they work, with few frills.  It's easy to change the wallpaper, if you have a MicroSD card - just save any JPEG to the card, and you can save it as a wallpaper, or assign it to any contact.  The music player is also pretty nice, though it'll never replace a dedicated media player.  The battery life is decent, given its medium size, compared to other more-powerful smartphones.  Nicer 3rd party compatible 950+ mAH batteries are available, to extend usage.  It recharges via the USB Micro port at the bottom, and can recharge from an AC or auto power supply (4.6V), or PC USB cable (2.5V).  I was surprised how many different colored cases and accessories there were, as well, so you can bling it out pretty good (if that's your thing).The few negatives are that you cannot customize your ringtone - you have to buy ringtones from Virgin Mobile.  The stock ringtones are just awful, so you'll probably have to sink $1 for a customized ringtone (using a basic composer) or $3 for a pre-made ringtone (VM at least has a good selection).  You cannot access the phone via USB or Bluetooth - it's entirely locked down, and I have been unable to unlock it with BitPim.  You can transfer files via the MicroSD card (photos & MP3s), or download from Opera, but the phone simply doesn't allow you to mess with ringtones or the contacts list.  Tethering is out, as well.  The Rumor2 can't play videos, even though it's probably capable of it (if you run the camera, it refreshes 15fps full screen).  They also limited what Java apps you can run, pretty much down to their stock email/im app, Opera Mini 4, Google Maps, and a few others.  Google Maps works well, but navigation is disabled - you have to pay-per-use or subscribe in order to get real-time GPS and turn-by-turn navigation.  I've used it once, when my dedicated GPS pooped out, and it worked well, but it's not as good as a dedicated GPS unit and it's a little pricy.For my modest needs, the good outweighs the bad by a large margin.  I needed a spartan smartphone that I can use to check Gmail, send text message, make the occasional phone call, occasionally check Facebook, occasionally check the map, and check the weather.  The handset was cheap, with a gift certificate, and it does everything I need it to do at acceptable speeds. With the $25/month Virgin Mobile service, I get 300 minutes (which I rarely ever get even halfway to) and unlimited text and data.  I don't need an iPhone or high-end Android phone...  This phone suits my need, and was very affordable - perfect for a cheapskate like me!", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful simple phone", "Author": "Autumn", "ReviewID": "R3KNRWKZPEMV4F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone! It's really easy to use, and the slide-out keyboard is really great. I was looking for something simple and inexpensive, and this turned out to be just the thing. The default web browser isn't the greatest, but Opera Mini is fantastic (and it was already installed on the phone when I got it). The screen is nice and bright, and the backlit keyboard and keypad are both awesome. Unfortunately, Google Maps won't work, although I'm not entirely sure why. It's not something I'd use all the time anyway.

Odd that the battery was not cellophane wrapped like others in new boxes. Besides the phone, battery, charger, and headphone (not really ear-friendly), there were only 2 short sheets of info: Terms of Service and 'starter guide'. No product User Guide though I figured how to insert the battery anyway. Future customers may have to download the 100-page pdf file for cellphone How-To's, etc. from the HELP tabvirginmobileusa.com/resources/phones/prepaid/manual/lg-rumor2.pdfThat said, it's a great phone. Online research tags it high as the best for its price in prepaid phones and features plus this battery life is 6.5 hours (buy car charger separately for $20). Nice key touch, qwertpad, great pic resolution. I'm hoping this battery lasts...

It looks good and it's built with good materials. It's a reliable phone: speakers and microphone are good. The full keyboard is excellent. But if you like taking photos and using Internet you can have a bad surprise. Very slow in browsing and the VGA camera is another weak point.In summary if you need a very good phone with several functions (agenda, notepad, alarm, speaker, texts) at a very good price this is the deal for you.

Not only was the phone inexpensive, but the Virgin Mobile plan was considerably cheaper than the phone service I had with Verizon.  The phone works great for talking and texting, which is what I wanted for my daughter.  (It does NOT work well for Internet access and picture taking.)  I was so impressed with her phone/service that I quit Verizon and bought a Rumor 2 phone (with Virgin Mobile service) for myself.

Unfortunately, whether it's the phone or the network, it does not work with Uconnect. It will disconnect a call within 27 sec. and constantly restart the phone. Unless you buy a micro SDHC card, forget a selection of ringtones, I think there are 3 on the phone, all which sound terrible. Even the tones (also 3) bite and I'm not picky. I think worst of all, the phone call quality is sketchy. It may be better in your area, but where I live (which is about an hour from L.A., so not rural) it's bad - the callers can barely hear me.Overall a waste of money.

After obtaining the new phone, Virgin Mobile would not change my plan back to what it was before the phone was stolen.  I'm now paying twice as much per minute.  I lost the ringtones that I paid for and lost $55 for the one day the thief used the old phone.

I have used it for over a year and it has continued to be enough to get by without being great.I bought this phone as a step up from 10 cents a minute NET10.  Some features are as advertised, others are not.  The alleged data service is horrible.The top positives:1) The slide-out QWERTY keyboard is awesome.  Enough said!2) Bluetooth.  I have tried several devices.  All worked.3) The display has a very nice email/text message alert feature to show calls or messages you recently missed.  However, messages are limited.4) Pop in a micro-SD card for storage for photos.The top negatives:1) Basically, 3x as expensive as the next guy.  At $40/mo for 300 minutes, this phone fails to compare against the likes of T-mobile at $15/mo for 1500 minutes or $30/mo for 1500 minutes and 200 mb of data. Or, compare against NET10/TracPhone, at 10 cents per minute.2) Page loads on web surfing can take minutes, IF they complete at all.  I live in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago, so it's not a tower issue, it's bad service.  Many pages are just plain blocked.  For most purposes, the web is UNUSABLE.  Your account balance page loads reasonably fast, if that's all you want to surf.3) Voice quality is often terrible - an artifact of VM not LG.  I have tested from a landline to several phones/carriers in the family.  Virgin Mobile has been the worst. You might want to consider the other version of the Rumor and go with Verizon, instead.  Oh, and if you go with Virgin Mobile, keep your Bluetooth headset charged.  A weak Bluetooth on top of mediocre voice quality results in total garble. Almost funny when it's not completely sad.4) Want your contacts backed up? There's a fee for that.5) The low resolution camera is, well, low resolution.6) While the QWERTY part of the keyboard is standard, special characters are not.  Looking back at the history of LG keyboard layouts, this is yet another random layout for special characters!7) Don't expect any of the special codes that work on the Verizon phone to work on the Virgin Mobile model.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "OMG love it", "Author": "Zachary Fields", "ReviewID": "R17F001V02D3O9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if i could give this item more stars i would.

The phone itself is amazing though i would highly reccomend a case because it is a slippery feel on the phone.
