{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing phone", "Author": "Brandon Ray Douglas", "ReviewID": "R22F93OHES5W9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a week now and it has been treating me VERY well. It may be because this is my first smartphone so i've upgraded from an LG Dare to this phone which is A LOT better. Reviews that you may find on youtube or anywhere else go over all the awesome features but there are also little things that make this phone great. It has unique light indicators that let you know when you have a notification (text, missed call, etc.) I read reviews that made me a little iffy about wanting to buy this phone, talking about how bad the battery life is and the reaction times, but that is just a matter of adjusting your backlight and using your task manager. Ending superfluous tasks will save your battery a whole lot and dimming your backlight will also help- my phone battery lasts on average about 16 hours (that's using the music player and camera for a short time and texting all day) so unless you're not going to be able to charge your phone for more that 16 hours you shouldn't have a problem with that if you know how to preserve your battery life. The phone looks very thick but does not feel thick in your hand or pocket so that isn't a problem either. Full slide-out qwerty keyboard is probably the best feature considering you sometimes have to use the stylus when you text using the touch screen because of how compact it is. Phone is a little laggy at times and can get somewhat frustrating but that's only if you try and rush the phone- if you give it a second or two to load it will load and then will function perfectly. The page also says this is a used phone and only includes phone, battery, and charger but it really comes in the verizon box completely brand new with PHONE, CHARGER, BATTERY, EXTRA STYLUS, AND INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS/CDs. Overall, this phone is a steal for the price of $75 and you will be very happy- unless of course you're downgrading from an iPhone or something like this, but if this is going to be your first smartphone i would very much recommend this phone. One last thing.. if you order from the \"fullfillment by amazon\" retailer it will take longer to ship because it ships from the retailer to amazon HQ and then ships from there to you, so it will take longer than usual to ship but it ships UPS from amazon which has the order tracking possibility so choosing the retailer is completely up to you.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "piece of crap!", "Author": "verydissatisfied", "ReviewID": "RI34D154KUDOJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "purchaced the htc smartphone b/c i thought it was the way to go as far as smartphones but was brought back to reality fast.the windows format it runs on is super slow and greatly outdated.the touchscreen was a joke and the disply buttons only worked when they wanted to.the only reason this gets atleast one star from me is b/c of the slideout keyboard which made it easy to text.beware of this phone though and buy something powered by droid", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "J. E. Barnes", "ReviewID": "R3E2C5XVD53CGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. The only problem I have with it is that it takes a while to learn  how to text on it. The touch screen is more sensitive than other phones I have had, but  once you get the hang of it, it's a breeze.  It is very fast for an older model smart phone, and the user interface is  pretty idiot proof. The seller is awesome...5 stars. The phone arrived  earlier than promised, in excellent condition. All in all great experience.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Htc touch pro", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3MCINE0V1VYIV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It works ok but lots and lots of scraches and when it came it was only the phone no battery no cover but the old battery and cover i put in", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "naaaa", "Author": "Luis Perez", "ReviewID": "RY78YSSJ7EE4G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone is only kinda cool. cost me a large charge from verizon wireless because of some data issues , ended up using there verizon browser and got screwed big time.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "pice of junk", "Author": "un happy", "ReviewID": "R2UXBW2OX1GQJH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "so im on my second touch pro and the first one had a non responsive key board and the second has a non responsive touch screen ive had it with this thing i need my phone for work and have had more time with a briken \"new \" phone than working phone do not buy this i highly recomend just about any thing else", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 2nd primitive smartphone", "Author": "Edward Batey", "ReviewID": "R3M0WL7DDADQ7G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's not the latest popular smartphone today, but it's a start for me. I have Reachout Wireless and I can use CDMA phone to put my coverage on their. I have the $26.50 a month unlimited talk and text plan, data will be added very soon. And I can use any unlocked phone to use in my coverage, the first time I joing Reachout, when they gave me a crappy kyocera phone >< That phone was older than my 8 year old cousin. I currently have the Palm Treo 700p, but I need to take it back because the power/call end button is acting up on me. But once I get the HTC touch, I'll send it back and get a replacement Palm Treo and use it for a reserve/back-up phone. Looking foward to it to be in the mail soon!
