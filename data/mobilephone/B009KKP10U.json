{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Motorola Droid Razr", "Author": "Sierra Simmons \"Sierra Simmons\"", "ReviewID": "R118WLZG17RK0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will admit I was REALLY nervous about buying this phone knowing it was used. I've had it now for almost a month and I couldn't be happier. With that being said I will say there was a few cons. When I first tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I was starting to panic, so I Googled what the issue may be and all it took was a reboot of the phone. Since then I have not had to reboot, and it has functioned just fine. The only other downside to the phone was the charger. It did not work, and it was actually meant for a Samsung Galaxy phone. I tried it on two other phones, and it will not charge anything. I ended up using the charger for my old Android. All in all I LOVE my new phone! Thank you Amazon for not screwing me over! (Oh, and FYI sellers, remember to clear your phones before selling them. I discovered photos of a man who I assume is the seller and his children. Thankfully there were no nude or disturbing photos!! :P )", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best battery life ever!", "Author": "T", "ReviewID": "R3DTPWCNN2WAA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a cellular phone technician for 4 years, and this is my favorite phone.  I love the extremely long battery life.  The response is always snappy, and the functions this has are superior to my Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy SCHI500).  I have a low profile gas tank mount for this phone to use on my motorcycle.  The battery is RARELY below 60%, and that's if I leave it off the charger for more than 24 hours.  To maximize the battery life, I use the \"smart actions\".. while I'm at work, my phone doesn't use Bluetooth, WiFi, ring or vibrate (I could actually put it in \"airplane mode\", but I want to see the missed calls).  The phone has never needed a case, or screen protector, it does however need to be wiped constantly, or my screen \"unlock pattern\" is easily visible from previous uses.  The volume is very good, the Bluetooth pairs easily, and the phone itself is awesome.  Once in a while I've had it randomly power down, then back up.  I've never had a smart phone that DOESN'T do that, so I guess I'm used to it.  At least it's never done it while I'm in a phone call.  The only odd part, is that I can't remove the battery to \"reset\" the phone.  I did root my phone, but I still have the stock ROM on it.  I just use \"driodwall\" to keep pesky programs from \"phoning home\" and sending information over 3G or 4G when I don't know about it.  That also eliminates almost all the ads on stuff.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like new", "Author": "TMQ", "ReviewID": "R2YVS2AQO5TU63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone looked great, had not trouble activating it.

I got it directly through Verizon, brand new, when it was released. Everything seemed fine when I first got it - gorgeous screen, fast, one of the best batteries, etc...Until about 6 months in. It's like this phone hit a wall. It became extremely slow, there was a ton of lag, inability to run multiple applications at once, overheating, dropped calls, battery started to lose life, and yea. It never got better from there. It just got worse, and worse, and worse. I'm not closing in on my two year contract and I can guarantee I will never purchase another Motorola product again. I did everything I could to fix this phone - task killers, clearing cache, uninstalling unused apps, factory resets, etc...but it would always turn to crap on me. It's so bad now that it takes me 10 minutes to get to my contacts list to make a phone call. Forget trying to play any games. Lest me not forget the s*** camera and inability to run Google Navigation/Maps.This phone has everything I need, but it's all moot once it started to become extremely slow. I think the phone has a memory bottleneck that causes it to be overwhelmed and start to overheat.I guarantee you, if you buy this phone, you will regret it. It may seem fine in the first 6 months or so, but it becomes useless after so. I know I'm not the only one to experience this.

This phone, or maybe it's the software, is the most frustrating piece of electronics I've ever owned. I've had it for 18 months and I'm counting the days until I can upgrade (6 more long months). It hangs/delays EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to do anything on it. It takes 10-20-30 seconds to open a web page, it takes 10-20-30 seconds to click thru stories on the USA Today app, it takes 10 or 20 or 30 seconds to start dialing when I try to call out (I use google voice for all calls and texts from the phone), it takes 10 or 20 or 30 seconds to open an email. Surely the phone can't be this bad given all the decent reviews, so maybe it's the software. But I have relatively few apps installed on this phone, almost zero games, I don't let my kids play on it.
