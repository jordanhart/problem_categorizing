I used to have the -  Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged which was a good phone, though the front screen cracked pretty early on, and I just had to deal with it.  When I was ready for an upgrade, I tried out a VERIZON WIRELESS CELL PHONE MOTOROLA BARRAGE V860 V 860 NO CONTRACT REQUIRED WORKS ON VERIZON WIRELESS.  HORRIBLE!  the front screen broke after a few weeks, and the main screen went blank and quit working.  Useless.  And this was after I tried out two different protective cases, neither of which did the job either.I decided to give this G'Zone phone a try and have LOVED it, better than any phone I've had yet.  Nothing has cracked or broken, I've dropped it several times, and it is still going strong.  I rely on my phone heavily in order to run my business, and it has been trustworthy and reliable.  I'm tough on phones, but this one has done awesome so far.  I just have to be sure I don't lose it in a snowbank somewhere.HIGHLY recommended.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen Problems", "Author": "Dunham", "ReviewID": "R2ZH2E04FJ8BZD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for about 15 months. I liked it at first, until the screen acted strangely one day. I opened the phone and all the colors were wrong and the display was showing everything upside-down and backwards. That was probably after owning the phone for 8 months. I had a 1 year warranty so I brought it back and got a shiny new replacement.I had no problems with the replacement until recently. I am getting the same display problems I had before. The Verizon store workers told me they have seen this with this phone before; it is a wire that comes loose from the body to the display. My 1 year warranty is apparently good for 1 year from when I got the original phone, so now I don't have a good phone and am looking for a replacement.If you get this phone, I wish you luck and I hope you don't have this problem. Keep in mind though, the same problem has happened to me twice now and the store has seen it from others.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Basic and Then Some", "Author": "D. Mills", "ReviewID": "R2RF47T9XJFWK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a couple words about the Amazon vendor Wireless4Cheap:  Exceptional service!  At their price - compared to eBay prices - I was concerned about the cosmetic condition of the phone.  They were quick to respond with detailed images of the like-new phone, screen protectors still in place.  And then they were quick to ship...it arrived FOUR DAYS EARLY.On to the phone itself:Smartphones, though I've used them for several years, simply don't meet my needs.  Dragging my sometimes cruddy fingers across a screen just to answer a call seems stupid to me.  I've long preferred just opening the flip.  Nor do I need to get on FB, email, games, maps, apps, etc., every waking moment.  I have a life.For the Interweb, I'm perfectly happy with a 4G mobile hotspot and a tablet (or lappy).  And, golly, I can talk, surf, upload, etc., simultaneously.  I'm still paying less for all that flexibility than most of my friends who have 4G smartphones alone.Current generic flips, imo, are just that.  Generic.  And, for my use, more fragile than I'd like.  I don't worry about dropping this one, getting it wet or dirty.  Rinse it off.  Done.Among the tough phones there have been a few decent choices like the Motorola Brute i686 Rugged PTT For Sprint (now obsolete since Sprint pulled the plug on iDEN 07/01/13) or Sprint Kyocera DuraXT No Contract MIL-SPEC Rugged PTT 3MP Camera Cell Phone Series.  Alternatively, a not-so-tough VERIZON WIRELESS CELL PHONE MOTOROLA BARRAGE V860 V 860 NO CONTRACT REQUIRED WORKS ON VERIZON WIRELESS or Samsung Rugby 2 A847  Unlocked GSM Ruggedized Phone PTT GPS 3G, etc.  Most of them stick to dull clamshell designs (Moto Barrage, MOTOROLA TUNDRA VA76r UNLOCKED PTT GPS RUGGED AT&T; UNLOCKED with stubby, Samsung Convoy 2 Verizon).When I had the original Casio G'zOne Type-V Verizon Cell Phone years ago, I loved it and sometimes regretted selling it for a smartphone.  This one caught my eye about a year ago.For my tastes, it looks like a MotoRAZR on steroids - considerably more so than the Motorola V750 Adventure PTT Rugged Grey Phone Verizon - and actually rugged.  Yes, most of it rubberized.  No mistaking it for a Moto, however.  It's more like a \"What-Is-It\".  Hey, I still have to use this...in public!Ravine 2 is not for everyone.  Unlike the legacy Casio GzOne Ravine Verizon (which I'd considered, except for the weird offset keys difficult to dial by feel), no MP3 player.  That's fine.  Got a 16GB Walkman with FM.  This G'Zone has a healthy, for a flip, 3.2MP camera while most others got stuck at 2MP.  Dedicated cam button.  Easy.  Dedicated speaker buttons inside and out.  Easy.  And, okay I'll admit it, the LED flashlight is very cool.  And a very useful tool I've missed since the Type V. (Already used it this afternoon while digging into the back of someone's computer).The 1150mAh battery (4\u00bd hours/21days) is perfectly sufficient, but I like having the option of an affordable OEM 1430mAh extended battery and cover.Finally, I'll note I used Page Plus (Verizon MVNO based in the U.S.) for activation.  Boost (Sprint MVNO) severely restricts types of Sprint devices it will accept (i.e., nothing with PTT), Not surprisingly in my experience, Virgin (also Sprint MVNO) customer service hasn't even a clue it's even on Sprint's BYOD list...or even what BYOD is!  The Page Plus plan (talk/text) is at a fraction of any Verizon plan.  Activation - ported my old number - is a little convoluted, but worth it.  I'm still on Verizon's network which has a particularly robust signal here in hurricane country.  Everything I need.  Nothing I don't.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, serious screen and clock bug", "Author": "Defaultgen", "ReviewID": "R3H3UAV9OB0SD4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Screen Problems (like Dunham says):I love this phone, it's absolutely the best phone I've had (including a Galaxy Nexus), but it's unusable due to an unresolved issue. The screen will reverse colors and appear mirrored after opening and closing it a couple times. The only way to fix it is to reboot. It worked fine for a few months, but everything Dunham says is true.This combined with the clock bug means two likely easy software fixes completely ruin the best phone I've used. Not sure what flip phone can compete with this, I might have to switch to a Razr.--Previous review:I'm not a smartphone person at all. I've had a Galaxy Nexus in their heyday and it didn't \"do it\" for me, so I decided I'm happy with flip phones. This is probably my favorite phone I've ever owned, since it emphasizes durability, one of flip phones' biggest advantages. I basically use my phone for three things: Texting, Alarm Clock, Phone Calls in that order.Texting and calls are about as good as any other phone. It doesn't feel sluggish in any regard, has a big screen, and has an amount of heft for better or worse. The biggest problem is the clock bug (which as far as I can tell has never been/will never be fixed). Every week or two, the clock will just freeze on a time (or get reset by 6 hours, or something), so your alarms won't ring or won't be correct. This phone can NEVER be trusted as an alarm clock, which is a pretty big disadvantage.Little apps and all that garbage are better than most flip phone fare, but \"apps\" aren't the reason to get a flip phone. The things like the Stopwatch and Star Gazing app run surprisingly well, at a high framerate. If this phone came out in 2005, it would be the absolute hotness. In 2013, I'll deal with the unfortunate clock bug for the sake of a great phone.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "durable phone", "Author": "Cheryl Strong", "ReviewID": "R3JL0M9M2L4XI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very hard on phones and so far (1 month since I received it) this one is holding up just fine.

This is a known bug. Casio said they have a fix, but it's not a fix if I keep having to deal with it. Their apology means nothing to me. My old Casio Type-S performed wonderfully under brutal conditions for over 6 years without even getting a new battery, but this Ravine 2 might as well be junk out of the box. (There's also an issue with switching between the earpiece and speakerphone, and that's not all.)I'm confident Verizon or Casio will do nothing to reimburse costs if I need to get a different phone. (Already tried the Commando - money losing waste of time along with the Otterbox Armor clad iPhone - can I just try a phone without having to pay to try it?) Verizon does bad things to you with fees when you switch phones, even if the phone doesn't deliver what it promises.I'm reasonable person, but I have a job that requires using a phone in dusty, wet, high impact conditions. If I had a candy-like job such as a Verizon or Casio salesperson, I would have my choice of smartphones, but I don't have a candy-like job. If you also need a phone to perform under harsh conditions, trust me, the Ravine 2 can't even perform under ideal conditions....FWIW, I had to clean up this review 3 times before the \"inappropriate language filter\" on Verizon's website let it pass, and I didn't even use any 4-letter words.  I'm concerned that this review in its present form doesn't convey how upset I am about this phone, Verizon, and Casio.EDIT (1/27/14):  Just got an email from Verizon that said this....\"Your review cannot be posted to our site.We appreciate you taking the time to provide your input on Casio\u00ae G'zOne Ravine\u00ae 2.

Softening my review any further would be a distortion of the truth, and I'm not going to do that.

A lot of its use is as my alarm clock in the morning and an occasional call or two.The reason why this product gets 3 stars from me is because of the battery life, or lack thereof. My old phone would hold its charge for up to a week and, just like this one, it stayed on all the time.

I only have it because my company decided this was the dumb-phone of choice.  The first thing I hate is that the front clock does not give you the option for 24hr time.  How dumb is that???  The next thing I hate is that there are no parentheses characters available for texting, which means I can't use simple emoticons.  Really DUMB.  But... the reason I totally hate this wretched piece of crap is that I bought a 32GB chip for it so I could plenty of space available for movies, photos, and... text messages.  It was then that I found out that the morons who put this thing together allow you to put Pictures, Videos, Ringtones, Sounds and Contacts on the extra memory... but not TXT messages  (from setting & tools -> memory - card memory).  I cannot condemn the morons who did this enough for their unrelenting stupidity and incapability with regard to simple features.  I would never never never buy this phone if it was just me.  I am working to ensure my company never never never buys another one.  And.. the fact that my company has a support contract with the vendor, and several others have had to deal with the outrageous idiots refusing to actually repair the thing when it fails... even with a paid support contract... means I have a pretty good shot at getting my way.
