This phone is made of substantial materials and the slide design is very sturdy, plus helps protect the keyboard. I also like how the slide feature elongates the phone, so the mouthpiece is down by my mouth - don't feel like I need to remove the phone from my ear in order to talk into the microphone.  And even though it's \"basic\" by today's standards, it has a GPS feature that serves as a 411 or map directions. Nice big screen, easy to view, has the basic camera... Sound is great and speaker feature very loud and clear. Great product, especially for the price. I took it for a swim with me, so I'm having to replace it and thankful I found it on Amazon, because the stores claim these basic phones aren't available anymore.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone!!", "Author": "steve murray", "ReviewID": "R1C631VKL7NKNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung SGHa777 is a super \"old school\" phone!

I got it from AT&T; for free when my old phone broke.  This phone does well with voice calls- sound quality is decent for speakerphone and normal talking.I hate texting on this phone, which I do a lot.  The buttons aren't very sensitive so lots of letters get missed when I try to text quickly (maybe I just don't press hard enough?).  Also, the predictive function is terrible.  It's very inconsistent with \"learning\" new words- sometimes it remembers, sometimes it doesn't.  It always seems to remember the words/acronyms that I'm never going to need again and put them in every time in the future (for example, I once needed the acronym \"FHE\" and now it puts that in every time I want to spell the word \"did\").The battery life is not great-- about a day and half when I've had a half-hour or so conversation.  However, in standby, it usually makes it about 3-4 days (I turn it off at night).Don't ever count on the camera--  horrible quality.It is nice that this phone has expandable memory- I keep a 1 GB card in it at all times so I've got plenty of space for music or whatever.  Actually, though, I never really use the music playing feature because I don't have headphones with a weird jack like this phone takes.  There's no 3.5 mm jack.The screen is pretty poor quality as well.  If it gets pressed on even a little bit, it goes all discolored and mine suffers some permanent effects from that.  Other than that, the phone is pretty solid in its construction.  I've dropped it a few times and it's still alive and kicking.  The slider is still working just fine after about a year and a half.One more super annoying thing.  The big button in the middle with the AT&T; logo on it takes you to the browser, and I have no data plan.  I can't tell you how many accidental charges I've had to have taken off my bill because of that.  There's no way to turn that feature off.All in all, I may not ever buy another Samsung because of the experience I've had with this phone.  I would not recommend it.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "The 3 stars are for the way 3G reception indoors beats 2G", "Author": "R. L.

Probably not images for wallpaper either--you're better off shooting your own with the camera. AT&T;'s tech support tells me it may be a \"software issue\". Fancy way to say \"it is what it is\". The main thing good about this phone is that my old Motorola 2G was next to useless in my apartment building. It would ring but I had to make a beeline for the nearest window to talk. This Samsung doesn't seem to have that issue.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic features!", "Author": "Javanut4673", "ReviewID": "R5BA755ZIVOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone in desperation. Orignally I paid $200.00 for a smartphone but I could not hear the conversation clearly no matter what I did. I also could not hear it \"ring\" even if I put the \"ring\" on the highest volume level and set the profile to \"outdoor\" <= this is the loudest profile available. Aside from being able to hear clearly or even being heard clearly, the monthly cost was $60.00+. The phone was so bad, I gladly paid the $300.00 penalty fee and moved to another carrier whose monthly cost was $10.00/month with a free phone. The free (non-smart) phone met my needs but the speakers in the phone obviously could not handle the loudest setting. (I think they cracked. a clear case of you get what you don't pay for.) Because my current $10/month carrier was ATT (uses SIM CARD), I was limited in my choices for a new phone. That is where the SAMSUNG SGH a777 comes in. For approx. $50.00 I got a phone with potential. I can activate the \"smartphone\" features (data, internet access, email capable, SMS, 3G, etc.)if I wish and if I only want an \"ordinary\" phone, it works just fine. I slipped in my sim card and voila! It worked seamlessly with my new carrier. FEATURES: It has several options to create your personal menu(s) - effectively alleviating the need to scroll through multi-levels and sub-levels to access one feature. (e.g. MENU/MY STUFF/TOOLS/Calculator, or Currency converter, or World time, or Recent calls, etc. is now just OPTIONS/Calculator, or Currency converter, or World time, or Recent calls, etc. CAPS = 1 LEVEL each.) Not only can you set your own menu(s) but there are extra blanks to create/add functionality! I primarily wanted a solid reliable phone. Just a phone - period. No bells or whistles. The only \"CON\" for me is that the camera is only 1.3 megs. That is pretty bad but I carry a point and shoot when I need photos. So not a real deal breaker. I am just glad to get a phone that works - well. By the way, I ended up buying another one for future use in case I lost this one or damaged it in some way - basically I got a backup phone because I liked it so much.

Leong", "ReviewID": "R30ODQV6GZ3W7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please see my replies to comments from highflyer, R. L. Miller, and sunshine79.I received my first SGH-A777 phone in 2009-May, and it worked great for my use -- cell. phone with simple PDA functions, still/video camera, and audio recorder.  I don't have a data plan, so I can't attest to its utility for texting, navigating the web, GPS tracking, etc.After the flex cable broke in 2011-Dec, I ordered a replacement via Amazon.  I bought the unlocked phone from PLANETCELL.COM.BR for $46!  [See my Seller Feedback for price comparisons.]  The main PCB (with CPU and radio module) has the same revision code (\"2008 08 27 Rev 0.5\"), but the firmware was updated with a few more features.  I temporarily swapped out the main PCB to recover my data that can't be stored on the mini-SD card. (Sshhh!  Don't tell anyone I voided the warranty.)  I'll buy the $4 flex cable to fix the old one, so I'll have a back-up.Anyway, I do wish the phone could save copies of the Notes, Tasks, Events, and Alarms onto the mini-SD card.  Since they can only be stored in the phone's memory, the allocation is static and cannot be increased -- another shortcoming.  I also wish the Currency Converter allowed the conversion table coefficients to be imported and exported (up-to-date data from [...]).  It's good that it allows me to add currencies.  [Other phone vendors tend to allow only one converter coefficient, which must be manually entered each time the function is started.]  I wish the calculator allowed memory locations to store/recall computed values; it would be great to have more math, scientific, and programming functions.  It's good that it allows me to enter and edit the expression, and it supports precedence rules and parentheses.  The tip calculator should have the ability to compute each person's share of tax and tip based on their purchases, rather than split everything up evenly.  [What if I eat filet mignon with a nice cab, and my friend gets crab bisque with a CdQ?  OK, I'm daydreaming.]  I also want a Cut&Paste; feature, as that will work well for phone numbers and numeric data when dealing with messages, phone book, conversions, etc.  OMG, there should be an app. for that!P.S.:  Calendar Events and Tasks neither wake up the phone nor are tagged as Missed Events if, at the programmed Alarm date/time, the phone is off.  This also applies to Alarms, unless Auto Power-up is On -- that's a great feature if you turn off the phone to avoid distractions, but it can be embarassing if you're at 35,000 ft. and the phone is packed in your bag in the overhead bin.  In this configuration, the alarm wakes up the phone, regardless of Airplane Mode setting.  I pop out the battery pack to avoid surprises because the 25-button disabling sequence is a bit long, and later must be reversed to restore the normal operating state.

It's not a particularly friendly phone for text messaging, though. Here are the primary reasons I would not recommend this phone to anyone: * I find myself asking people to repeat themselves more than with my previous GSM phone. * The sliding mechanism is somewhat fragile.  I've had mine for a month, and it's already wiggling/loose.  I had my previous clamshell phone for over three years, and it was still like new, aside for some cosmetic scratches. * The phone's text message inbox is limited to a paltry 255 messages.  Regardless of how much memory those messages require (up to the phone's memory limit), the phone will stop receiving messages once that number limit is reached, until some or all messages are deleted. * The phone's T9 dictionary cannot be edited.  This has been confirmed by Samsung in their online support forum.  Once you add a word, it's there for good, unless you perform a full reset on the phone.  Better hope you don't accidentally add a misspelled word! * Words added to the T9 dictionary take priority over existing textonyms.  Now when I try to enter the word \"He\", I get a rarely-used acronym I added (\"I3\") and I have to cycle through to the much more common word \"He\".  Oops, even correctly spelled words or acronyms can easily become a hinderance, once they are added to the dictionary. * T9 cycling is one-way.  That is, there is a \"next\" button only, no \"previous\" button.  So if you miss a word on the first cycle through, you have to continue cycling through all of the textonyms until you get to the right one again.  It's easy to miss more than once. * The \"Spell\" option for spelling out a word that isn't recognized with T9 only appears on the last T9 option.  If you accidentally \"next\" through the last T9 word, the \"Spell\" option disappears until you cycle back to it.  My previous phone left it available after cycling through all T9 textonyms, it's a feature I miss. * The A777's shortcuts are only partially customizable, to these options: None, My Stuff, MEdia Mall, Address Book, Recent Calls, Create New Message, Mobile Email, Inbox, IM, Music Player, Wallpaper, Ringtone, Calendar, Tasks, Bluetooth, Record Audio, Converter, Settings, Alarms, World Time, Calculator, Games and Apps, Security.  For example, one can't assign the phone's stopwatch, timer, or audio recorder to a shortcut key.  The phone's custom main menu is even less customizable. * The A777's center (main) button is not customizable.  Accidentally press it when opening the phone, and the phone immediately launches Java to connect to att.net.  It's very easy to do and takes an annoying few seconds to cancel out of the process. * Samsung's PC Studio 3 software (used to manage data and messages on the phone) is very limited, especially with regard to text messages.  For example, one can only copy or move Inbox, Draft, or Outbox text messages to the PC, and only within PC Studio.  They are saved to an MS Access database file (.MDB) on the PC, which may allow them to be exported, but there is no built-in way to export them to a standard data file format, not even to plaintext.  Sent messages cannot be copied or moved to a PC at all, via Samsung's PC Studio.  They can be printed, so printing them to a file might work, but that does not preserve the original data or text message format.  If you want to save your text messaging history before clearing the phone's limited messaging space for further use, it's very difficult to do so.Some of these limitations might not be present on unlocked phones (mine is AT&T; branded, and probably not fully unlocked), but there's no getting around many of them.
