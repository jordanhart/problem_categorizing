I had the watch-phone for three weeks and I was fine with the quality of sound and everything but suddenly, the battery case split in two by itself, it looks like the factory glue dry out. Also the blue-tooth headset stopped working. It's not worth the money if it is made to last for three weeks.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great, but not for people who want a full featured smart phone.", "Author": "Unknown.usr \"corpbot\"", "ReviewID": "R1B3PEEXB28R3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great device for people who want something handy with the ability to access minimal internet sites.  It is not a full featured phone, but it is excellent for what it is.The phone works great, even without the headset.  The menus are much easier than previous Chinese watch/phones I have used.  However, teh web browser is burried in the settings menu, which is strange.  And even after I configured the default language settings, I still get Google in Chinese.  I am still figuring out how to setup email.Here is how to setup the WAP browser for AT&T;, in case anyone is hunting for these settings:Go to menu, settings, data account, options, add. Name is AT&T; (or whatever you want). APN is set to \"WAP.CINGULAR\".  User name & password are blank. Auth type, left at normal. Primary & secondary DNS, left at all zeros.Go to menu, settings, Internet service, settings,  profiles, add new. Profile name is AT&T; (or whatever you want), home page I used is [...], data account is AT&T; (or whatever you named it), connection type is http, Proxy Address is \"wireless.cingular.com\", Proxy port is \"80\". Leave user name & password blank.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Appropriate for knowledgeable Buyers", "Author": "K. X.

It should also be noted that the device has minimal internal memory and without an SD micro card, you are very limited for MMS/Music/video.Over all a great product that charges quickly, has GREAT audio volume and when properly paired gives the user a sense of sci-fi superiority over typical mobile device users.Kudos! I have already talked the device up to a few friends and family, all of which are impressed and eager to try it themselves.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mala Calidad", "Author": "Enrique", "ReviewID": "R3N4GE9AX07BUW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Por cualquier cosa se desarma, materiales muy malos, funcionam3ento bueno.No lo recomiendo si va a utilizar mensajes de textomuy incomodas las letras", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Primary Function: Mobile Phone Smart Watch with Touch Screen of 1.49 Inches\nGSM Compatibility: Quad-band 850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, 1900MHz\nBattery Life - Talk Time: Up to 2.5 hours - Stand By: Up to 150 hours\nAlso Function as Video Camera and Media Players\nDimensions: - Watch: L:50 x W:40 x H:13.8 (mm) - Strap: Adjustable", "Name": "SVP G13 Black Touch Screen Camera MP3 GSM Smart Watch Cell Phone~ unlocked~ Quad-band", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41un-EBuBvL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005Z1UQE4"}}
