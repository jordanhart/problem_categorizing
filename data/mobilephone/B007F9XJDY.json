One downside is that it's hard to hear sometimes when I'm on the phone and people have said they had a hard time hearing me because my mouth is so far from the mic.

However, despite being advertised as a Quad Band phone it is not. It is a dual band phone since it only covers GSM 900/1800 frequencies. A true \"quad band\" phone covers GSM 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies. Although a dual band phone will work in most places, it will not work in some countries that do not use the GSM 900/1800 frequencies. Amazon and the seller of this item need to change the way this product is being advertised. To claim it is a quad phone is totally false and constitutes inaccurate advertising. Buyer beware. Samsung does make other phones that are true quad band (world phones). This one unfortunately is certainly NOT one of them.

I was contacted by the seller (Mobile Best Sellers) apologizing that they had a distribution error with this product, and they sent me the wrong model of the phone. A few dozen people were affected by this error. FYI, I got the Samsung GT-E1182 (no \"L\" at the end), which is dual band, not quad-band.I've returned the phone, and got a full refund on it.At least, this makes sense now. I still find the title of this product confusing: \"Samsung GT-E1182L\" (which, I suppose, is quad band), AND \"E1182\" (which is dual band). So, if someone orders this phone, which one will they get?---------------------2013.07.29: Here is an update to my review, after I visited a T-Mobile service center in person and talked to a representative for a long time.This phone is definitely not quad band, it is only dual band (GSM 900/1800) as it is stated on the phone box. So, it does not work in the US with the GSM carriers, such as T-Mobile or AT&T; because they use a different frequency.The Amazon title on this phone is extremely misleading, and I don't understand why Amazon doesn't do anything about it.So, if you are looking for an unlocked phone to use in the US, this is not for you. It will likely work fine in Europe, but not in the US.I will have to return this phone.---- Below is my original review, and instructions on how to switch it from Greek to English ----For the background: I live in the US, and wanted a basic unlocked phone as a backup. After receiving it, reading the manuals, and research on the web, here are my impressions:GOOD:- it's a basic phone, very lightweightBAD:1. The first surprise was that the phone was set up in Greek (I guess it was set up on Automatic Language and because it could not find the network, it used Greek..). After some fiddling around, I was able to set it up in English (see the instructions at the end of the review).2. The second bad surprise was that it only comes with European plug adapter.. so, you cannot really plug it into a US plug.3. The third bad surprise is that it is only Dual band, not Quad band, as advertised in the title. The Dual band is documented right there on the box: \"GSM Dual Band\".4. The forth and most annoying surprise is that I inserted my T-Mobile SIM in it, and it doesn't work. Maybe I need to go to T-Mobile to somehow register my phone, so it might not be the phone's fault. I'll do that and update the review.I saw that some people asked about the available languages. You can set up this phone in: English, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek.In any case, I expected this phone to work out of the box, and I wanted to use it both in US and Europe, and the first experience was very disappointing.---Here are the instructions on how to set it up in English, in case yours was also set up in Greek:1. To unlock phone: Press the star button for about 3 seconds2. Press the menu button (left button), and then select the settings icon (lower right corner), press the big center button to select3. Select item 5 from the menu (Phone in En, \u03c4\u03b7\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd;\u03bf in Greek), and then select item 2 (Language in En, \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek), and then select English, and press \"Select\".That's it, your phone should be now in English.Good luck!", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Katie \"finzup-kt\"", "ReviewID": "R359ZLPYVI4VBM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this phone for a trip to India.

I also took my iPhone and paid $120.00 for two hundred minutes and $120.00 for a data plan from AT&T.; I went through the minutes during the first week of my four week trip and decided to see if I could get a SIM card for my little Samsung. I hadn't trusted that it would work, so I paid in my opinion too much to use my iPhone in Italy. I tried the Tabac shops and no one sold SIM cards so I finally went into a Vodofone shop where I was able to buy a SIM card. The calls only cost fifteen cents per minute. I used the Samsung without a hitch during the trip making calls in Italy and England. I am long winded so bear with me. My point is that this phone cost about $35.00 and was more than worth it. I dropped it several times and it still worked like a charm. When I needed more minutes I simply went into a Vodofone shop to add minutes. I highly recommend it if you just want to make calls. I used my iPad with wifi at hotels and sorely regret spending the money to use my iPhone which I had to keep checking to see if I had used all my minutes or data that I had purchased. Going over meant $1.00 per minute. With the Samsung and the SIM card from Vodofone I was notified by a chime and message on the Samsung if I had used all of my minutes. Using all of the minutes just meant refilling the SIM card. Buy this phone. You won't regret it. I didn't but I regretted paying to use my iPhone for calls and access to the web etc.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Total waste of money - wish I tested earlier", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R30CUIS9RTETOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for a trip to Europe.

He set everything up and my phone was ready to use.  Phone has a simple, intuitive menu for the basics... ringtones,  clock, alarm clock, calculator features,  small (torch) flashlight which came in handy.  Phone is very small but keyface is easy to use as are navigation buttons.  Reception was quite good when I used it.  The only negative thing I would say about the phone is that you have to activate the \"Loudspeaker\" when making a call so you can hear the party on the other line.... if you don't ...you'll barely hear them speak.  This was no biggie because I got used to doing that in sequence after I would dial a number and press the call button,  I'd automatically press the Loudpeaker button and get prompted on-screen to TURN ON LOUDSPEAKER?  of course I'd press YES.  Maybe there's a way to increase the earphone audio but I've not found it yet in the small manual that came with the phone.  BATTERY LIFE IS PHENOMENAL!!  I had this phone on all the time for about 11 days and didn't have to charge it once.  Of course I didn't talk on it everyday and when I did ...only for a few minutes at a time...afterall it's a TRAVEL PHONE.If you need to be that connected all the time...get ready to spend money on minutes.  Fortunately the BTL rep told me about a 1010-dial around number that would save me about 33% on Int'l calls...which was great.This phone worked well and I maybe had only 3 calls dropped my entire trip.... which I don't think was the phone's fault.If you're looking for a decent phone that doesn't cost a lot and take up much space and works... give this Samsung GT-E1182L DUOS Quad-Band phone a serious look.P.S. About the phone volume control; according to the manual ... you can turn up the volume by pressing up on the main directional switch which I didn't realize. I haven't tried this as my Belize SIMS doesn't function in the U.S. But next time I go somewhere and get a new SIMS, I'm sure to give this a try.

The phone shipped with an A/C to D/C charger that is not compatible with US power outlets. The pins are round, and are probably designed for use in Europe. There is no adapter included for use in the USA. In other words, I cannot perform the initial charge of the battery, and cannot use the phone in the USA (unless I buy an adapter separately).I called Amazon customer support, and I was told that this item is not sold by Amazon, and that I'd need to call Samsung. I called Samsung, and I was told that this is an \"international\" phone, and that the number I called was only for Samsung USA support. They advised me to call Amazon back. In other words, I appear to be in an endless loop.Nothing in the product description indicates this phone is \"international\" or not intended for use in the USA. As a matter of fact, the product description states: \"This Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile ....\" and \"US Warranty\". Now, I understand that these statements do not preclude the possibility that this is an \"international\" phone that can also be used in the USA. However, the product description appears to be, at least to me, misleading.Sadly, I will be returning this phone, and I will probably go into a store to buy a phone. Too bad, as I've generally had very good buying experiences with Amazon.[UPDATE (8/14/2013): I decided to give this phone a try, and bought an adapter. After initial-charging the battery, I turned it on to discover the menu is in Greek. I mean, literally in Greek. Thankfully I have neighbors who are of Greek origin, and they were able to navigate the menu to set it up in English. The phone menu is fairly intuitive and easy to use. However, when I tried to set up the SIM card on my network (AT&T;), the phone would not connect with the network. The AT&T; customer service agent called Samsung, who told him that the phone is an international phone, and support can only be provided from Samsung's help center in Jordan, which is on a completely different time zone than mine. Even if they resolve my problem in the US, I have no assurance that the same problem will not develop when I am overseas. Bottom line: I am returning the phone today, and I am reminded of the well-worn idiom - caveat emptor (buyer beware).][UPDATE (8/30/2013): Manticore pointed out that the problem may have originated from the seller, and not the phone itself. I believe my phone order was fulfilled by Mobile Best Sellers, not Zezoo Store (as the Amazon site currently shows). My complaints, then, are directed at Amazon and not at the phone itself - Amazon's site ought to have indicated that the phone as purchased from Mobile Best Sellers would have specific features, some of which may not be universally acceptable.Thanks to Manticore for pointing out my error.]", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dual Sims work as expected", "Author": "Dich Quan", "ReviewID": "R2XEEZIJJ5UZEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so happy that I don't have to carry 2 cell phones any more.

Ambrose", "ReviewID": "R3J5THEDBLW788", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was travelling to India through the Middle East, and needed a phone that I could use while in India and the Middle East.  I looked at various models of phones, and this seemed reasonable enough.  Most countries, apart from the US use the GSM phone system, which involves inserting a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card into the phone.  The SIM card is usually bought separately from the phone, and determines your phone number, call rates, etc.  So to use a SIM card in another country, you need an unlocked GSM phone (which this is), and a SIM card.  I purchased a OneSIMCard \"world\" SIM card which allows you to use this phone in over 150 countries.The phone was delivered promptly, in it's original box.  Came with the phone, battery and wall charger.  No case was provided.This phone was surprisingly smaller than I expected.  More the size of an iPod Nano than an iPhone.  This made using the key pad a little more difficult because the keys were smaller.  The menu system is a little cumbersome too, but not anymore than phones of this type.  There is no dedicated keyboard, so texting is going to be tedious; but I was not going to be texting anyway.  The sound is surprisingly clear, and those at the receiving end of the call also said it was clear.  Because of it's small size, it is a bit difficult to hold, but okay. The screen is therefore also small, and relatively low resolution (compared to most newer phones) but okay to see the information that you need.  It is NOT a touch screen. The phone takes \"standard\" SIM cards.  They are about the size of a SD memory card.  (NOTE: The iPhone 4S takes a \"micro\" SIM card, and the new iPhone 5S takes a \"nano\" SIM card).  Standard SIM cards are more easily available.  In addition, this phone, despite it's small size, has TWO SIM card slots!  That means you could have two separate phone numbers associated with the phone.  So you could have a \"local\" number in the country of travel, and another number where everyone else could call you.  You could give out one number to business contacts, and another for friends and family. You can set up distinctive rings, so that you know which number is ringing.The charging transformer will work with 110 and 220 volts, although the one I got came with the flat US style plug.  The transformer and cord are one piece.  The connection to the phone is a proprietary Samsung connection, so if you lose this charger you will need to get an exact replacement.  It will not charge from a micro USB, or Apple type connection.Overall, surprisingly feature rich phone, good reception, works well for the type of phone, and reasonable price.  If you only need an \"emergency\" phone to make and receive calls while you are travelling abroad on a vacation, or even a short business trip, this phone should serve you well.I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to a friend or associate.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Augustine Ukulu", "ReviewID": "R3MW86LE4DHSWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice simple phone for basic use for calls and simple texting.

The best feature was the dual-SIM capability: I put my Verizon work SIM card in one slot, and a disposable multi-country SIM (which I'd bought upon landing in Amsterdam) in the other for personal use. It's incredibly easy to switch between the SIMs while the phone is on and it still receives messages etc. for each SIM as long as they're both in standby (i.e. you're not on the phone). The best part is that it's about half the price of buying a disposable phone at an airport kiosk once you get there.The phone worked perfectly and had good reception on both SIMs even in relatively remote areas, so I believe it has a good antenna.

Happened several times in a row the other day, had to resort to texting.Moreover, the user interface on this phone is probably the clunkiest of any cell phone I've used, starting with the Ericsson 337 back in 1995.I was excited to see the specs of this phone when I first found it here on amazon. \"Finally a nice dumbphone\" I thought. Unfortunately, while the specs are good, execution is quite poor. It seems one cannot buy a good dumbphone in the U.S. these days.I gave it two stars: one for effort, and one for the \"fake call\" function which can be set up to activate on speed-dial.
