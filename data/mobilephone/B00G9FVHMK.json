{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Grabs people's attention when using the phone (decent phone nothing special, except the size)", "Author": "King James", "ReviewID": "R153EOMZJB3ZX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Do you have the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 or 3 and constantly complain about how small the 5.7 inch screen is? Probably not. But this is the phone for people who are looking for a phone and a tablet put into one. Literally. I've had the honor of using this phone for about a week now and the large part of the reason I wanted to pick one up was that I wanted to see what the benefits of having such a large phone like this is. And this phone is Large. I mean, my primary phone is the Galaxy Note 3 so one would think that the Galaxy Mega wouldn't be such a jump from a 5.7 inch display the Note 3 has, but immediately I could tell the significant jump in screen real estate that I got from using this phone as opposed to the Note 3's Screen. The phone itself looks like a giant Galaxy S 4. I thought that the resolution would suffer from the larger screen size but surprisingly it is vibrant and nice looking. It's not a top of the line specs kind of phone like the Note 3 is so I could tell that the Galaxy Mega resolution was of lesser quality that the Note 3's but I would say it is better than than alot of other phones. It's worse than that of the iPhone 5, Note 3, but probably comparable to the S3. The benefits of having the phone is that watching videos is a pleasure. It's like i'm holding a mini TV in my hand. Furthermore, browsing web pages on the phone feels like i'm using my laptop. And, the battery life (3200 mAh) is the same as the Note 3's battery (they are not the same size). So, I get about the same usage time on the Galaxy Mega as I do on the Note 3 which is to say, I get alot out of the battery. A full charge will last me a day and even until the next day midway through. I use my phone frequently during the day to check the news, text, etc. But, Let me remind you that unless you are an NBA basketball player or have abnormally huge hands you will NOT be able to text with one hand. I'm 5'8 so imagine how big my hands are, but I could still type texts on the Note 3's keyboard with one hand if i position them correctly, but not with the Galaxy Mega. But, with that being said typing texts on this phone is awesome when one does have two hands available because the keys are so large that I rarely make mistakes typing sentences out. I sometimes have the need to type texts with one hand so that bugged me a bit because, even for just basic swipes across the screen sometimes I needed to use 2 hands. This took a bit of getting used to for me. So, this is definitely not a phone for people who need one hand free frequently when using their phone. The camera is decent, not great, as one would expect from a 8 mega pixel camera. Further, using the camera feels like holding up a tablet. But once I got used to the size pictures were easy to take and so were videos. And, the speaker and sound are pretty decent and loud so no complaints on that front. Surprisingly though, the Galaxy Mega as big as it is, fit in my pocket. I'm not going to say comfortably but it fit nonetheless. If you wear any type of tight fitting pants you will not be able to put this phone in your pocket. But I imagine it would do just fine in a purse or hand bag as it is light for its size. Some of the things that I didn't like about the phone were that every time I take this phone out people either, one, gather around me and ask me about it or two, crack a smart alec joke on me about it. (insert your favorite private part joke here). So, however you put it whether one likes it or not the phone will draw attention. Furthermore, Holding the phone up for a call is not as bad as I thought, it seems natural, nothing awkward but I imagine I look sort of off, holding a big slab of a phone up to my head. Another thing that I don't like about the Galaxy Mega is the build quality. It feels cheap because of all the plastic around it. But if you're used to a Galaxy S phone this shouldn't be too much a problem for you. So, with this experience under my belt I would only recommend this phone to people who can't read small texts, have really big hands, or want to get rid of their tablet and have a phone and a tablet all in one device. And even then I would recommend going to a store first and trying it out first before purchasing it online and realizing that it is too big of a device to handle. I personally will keep using my Note 3 as my primary device (because of the better specs) but, I am intrigued with the phone's ability to be my phone to text and take calls and be a pretty decent tablet too. I also like the ability to upgrade the phone's memory (16 GB internal and 64 GB can be added) and replace the batteries if needed by removing the back plastic. But I can go without all the attention it brings. It also takes a few days to really get used to the size of the device. In the end, the reason I'll give it four stars is because it is not a phone for every one and it does lack in top of the line performance. But, let me add that it is a great value for the price (500$) compared to, let's say the iPhone 5s or the Note 3 (750-800$), but of course you're not getting top of the line specs, but the difference is negligible, and only a phone geek will really care about that kind of stuff. As for me, I'll keep it around and use it a bit more before I make anymore conclusions on it.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Monster phone!!!", "Author": "Eric J", "ReviewID": "R9ZT1VI1TXOGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a big screen and boy this phone is BIG. make sure you have the room to carry this phone.

It wont fit in the usual spots I put my phone in my truck so that is something to consider.  Also hope Samsung makes a Mega2 with some better specs.

LOTS of apps and options, most of which I quickly deleted, as I don't use them. Problem is: the big screen is a BIG target. Things that might miss or not damage a smaller screen will destroy the Mega. The only complaint I've had is with Asurion(the Sprint sponsored insurance), who took almost 3 weeks to replace my Mega, after accidentally damaging it. Luckily, I had my old S2 to fall back on.
