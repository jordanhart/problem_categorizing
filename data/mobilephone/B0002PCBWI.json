Sure Windows Mobile is uber cool and tons of fun to use, let alone the ease, but the MPx200 fails at the one thing that is supposed to do best, being a phone. I purchased this phone unlocked on eBay in June '05 for about $117 with shipping. I also bought a 1.0 GB SD card for $60 around the same time ready to load it up and enjoy my new Windows Mobile phone. I was shocked at how much better the phone looked in person. It's seriously the most beautiful layout I've ever seen. The black and blue layout are simply beautiful. Many of my friends and coworkers thought it was a Nextel. It sure is as durable as a Nextel. There is no way in hell this phone could break. You can drop it from a 50 story building and it would probably just have a scratch. It's amazing the build quality that Motorola put into this phone, but it goes downhill when discussing the phone as a functional device. As a phone, it falls very short, especially in the area of battery life. When I initially received the phone, I only charged it for 12 hours due to overexcitment, so I blame myself for not getting through the day without having to charge the phone, but after I bought my second battery and charged it the full term, I was surprised when the battery life didn't improve much. Granted this is just using the phone as a phone, with the Infrared \"Beam\" feature turned off and all the other features either off or at the bare minimum, such as the backlight. I honestly believe that I got much better battery life using the phone as a Video iPod than as a phone. The battery sipped away during use of Windows Media Player, with excellent sound quality I might add. On a normal phone call, I got an hour tops, before the battery was on its last bar, far short of the rated 4.25 hours. Standby time is barely 24 hours. Good luck trying to use call waiting, sometimes the phone just freezes up. This is where the 200 MHz processor is shows its colors. Sometimes when the phone rings, you can hear the delay and the processor loading the rest of the ringtone. Call quality was flawless, has always been, seeing that I'm with T-Mobile. No complaints there. I even got the T-Zones to work on my phone, after doing some research online and locating the settings. This isn't for the tech juvenile. It can be tedious if you're not patient. I really love my phone, but it is just not practical. The other day I left my phone to charge seeing that the battery was on the last bar. When I woke up the phone was dead on the charger. This has happened to me a lot in the past few weeks, and I only charge my phone when the battery is completely dead so I don't know what's going on. I got so fed up with it that I took out the SIM card and put it back in my Motorola V60, which is in my opinion one of the best phones made, period. I just ordered another V60 seeing that I broke the antenna off the other one. It's so sad that all these new phones have all the bells and whistles you could ever want but don't carry out their primary function. I feel bad for the people who bought this phone through AT&T;/Cingular because the phone was dual band for them and Cingular runs on the 850/1900 frequency. My version was the triband 900/1800/1900, and worked fine with T-Mobile. I will still use it as my entertainment seeing that it synced with Windows Media Player on the PC flawlessly and the quality is great. I have compressed loads of videos to WMV format and enjoy them on a regular basis on my phone, but I will keep my V60 in my other pocket when the battery on my MPx200 dies.", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
