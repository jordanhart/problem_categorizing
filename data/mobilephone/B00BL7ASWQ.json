Do not waste your money buying this very unreliable and very poor manufacture quality phone.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Anslem John", "ReviewID": "R2WGQF6DY7SFYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If your looking for a cost effective windows phone ....then the 620 is for you .
