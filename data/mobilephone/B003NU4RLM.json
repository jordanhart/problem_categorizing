Etheridge \"pjeth\"", "ReviewID": "RCKREYUJSJNIE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone a few weeks ago because my smartphone had too many quirks and I have several months before I can upgrade. It works great for phone calls. Answering and disconnecting calls is so easy to do, no sliding like with the android. But as far as texting it is not the best. I like larger buttons and that is why I wanted a slide out keyboard. But the buttons are too small to easily text. I also noticed that the screen is not as sensitive to touch as it should be. Trying to get something on the screen to move or work can be frustrating because it takes some effort to manipulate, move, whatever. The battery is not as bad as some reviewers have stated. It lasts a couple of days with normal use. It is NOT a smartphone so don't expect it to be.

The touch screen is fully functional, but the slide out keyboard makes texting or note taking a breeze.  Pretty good camera with a flash, the image editing software is very handy.  This is a smart phone without having to have a smart phone plan and works well with ATT basic data package.  Holds a pretty good charge, even though I average about 200-400 texts on a busy day.  Great bluetoothe technology and syncs flawlessly with blue tooth in newer vehicles.  The extra memory card you can install slips into the side of the phone, no having to take apart the phone to switch it.  There is an mp3 player that allows you to play songs on your phone at a very decent volume, or through your car's stereo if its bluetoothe ready.  I have recommended this phone to friends.  I recommended it to my mom who is not to keen on newest phone features but with this she is able to text, take pictures and make calls easily.  If you run too many programs at once for example, a chat aim window, a video game *monopoly which is awesome* and a text window, jumping back in forth there is a slight lag.  This is very slight, closing the slider or hitting the end call button snaps the phone back and its all good from there.  Also, one problem I noticed some newer phones have is being able to jump from 3g to 4g cell service areas automatically without having to restart the phone.  I went through three phones with that same issue until I got this phone, no need to restart it jumps service areas without any problem.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone!", "Author": "Rachael", "ReviewID": "RNUHSUUR6VT1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone new 2 years ago for my daughter to call and text only, and it is perfect!  The keyboard is great, at first I was leary of the slider concept thinking it would come apart easily with use, but after 2 years it works as well as it did when we bought it.  She is using it with a go phone SIMM from at&t; and have had no problems.  Great reception in light coverage areas.  Have not experienced any battery life issues, with light usage the battery still lasts 2-3 days.  It is durable, she has dropped it many times (without a cover) and without ill effect.  After 2 years the phone is starting to freeze occassionaly, but all you have to do is push the home button to return to a normal screen, but many phones have more issues that this from the start so I don't count this as a negative.

My old phone that i had was a Pantech Link two. It was acting up like crazy, and wouldn't let me text. I would NOT recommend that phone, and the picture quality was absolutely terrible! My mom decided she wants to switch from at&t; to Verizon in 3 months and so i didn't want to buy an extremely expensive phone and then just have to give it up and get a different phone for Verizon. No, that would have been wasted money. So I found this phone and went to the refurbished section. I found one that was $33.00 plus $4.00 in shipping. and considering originally if i wanted this phone to be new, i would have had to pay $70.00 that is a great deal to buy a $33.00 phone. Especially since I am only 14 and don't have much money. My mom got an email saying the phone had been shipped, and the estimate arrival date was two weeks, :( two days later a box delivered from amazon arrived, MY PHONE HAD COME! to start you can set a signature and the pic quality is amazing. My fav color is blue and that is the color of the phone. I have dropped it 3 times and it hasn't gotten a single scratch!!! AMAZING. The keyboard slides easily and is very easy to text on. This phone has gotten some bad reviews about how terrible the touch screen is, but if you go to the volume changing buttons on the side and click at the top on the button that says touchtone, and then set the volume to silent, then the touchscreen is amazing. and it works amazingly. I lovvvvvvvvve this phone and will defiantly be recommending this phone to my friends. thank  you amazon this was a great buy and is a great relief from my old phone.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfactory performer", "Author": "Allen Minton", "ReviewID": "R2PVQZDSJV6LY5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My wife and I have had these Xenon phones for two years now and neither of us have encountered any technical problems.

I came across this phone on amazon. This phone is not unlocked but it works with AT&T; and I have heard you can unlock it by looking for the code online supposedly. I like this phone because when you lock the screen the date and the time appear in large text/font when you hit a button to light up the screen when locked. The thing I don't like about it compared to my pantech is that you can't set it to where you enter your pin number every time you lock your phone. I have my pin set for when I turn this phone on and this is all I have been able to figure out with regards to using a pin # on this phone. So that's a downside that you can't lock this phone with a pin # all the time, just with a touch of a button. Also, I have found that if you text a lot the inbox gets full rather quickly so you have to delete your conversations daily like every other week or so depending on how much you text. I don't mind doing that but some of you might. The battery seems to be holding ok...but I have found that if you use a lot of the applications on this phone like going online, etc. it takes up a lot of the charge rather quickly, if that's the case and how you'll be using it I recommend you take your charger with you. I think I'm going to by an sd card for it in hopes it diverts that away from my battery's charge...I dunno if that will work or not but I think I'm going to give it a try anyway. Maybe it will help with the inbox texting issue...I dunno. Other then that I love this phone. The sound quality is nice and loud. For example, my grandmother who is hard of hearing could hear me on this phone! : D It has all that I need on it. it takes a while to get used to the touch screen aspect of it but you get used to it rather quickly...at least I did. I recommend you buy a screen protector for it as well as a hard snap on case when you purchase this phone all at the same time as you will come to find you need it. I recommend the hard snap on case because if you are a person like me who drops their phone a lot then it will protect it and this phone is so light the case adds a little bit more weight to it (not much) but just enough to where you feel more comfortable holding the phone and more comfortable to the point that you feel like you won't drop it as much. Also, you touch the screen to dial and such so that is why I recommend you getting a screen protector for it. This phone also comes with the 2 holes in it for a lanyard just so you guys know : ) Otherwise I would recommend this phone.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "amir ashoori", "ReviewID": "R3K4NP2SOVEDIX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originaly got this phnoe for my teenage daughter couple of years ago through the service provider.

I got it because I liked the idea of having a full qwerty keyboard, and a touchscreen all in one.  After a couple weeks, I had doubts in my phone.  I wish I had returned it to AT&T; within my 30 day allowance, and just gotten rid of the thing.  I'd be much happier.The keyboard seemed nice enough at first, but after having a shift and capslock key on my last phone, having just a capslock was very hard to get used to.  You have to turn the caps key on, type desired capitalized letter(s) and then back off afterwords, wasting a movement, and texting slower.  Or just plan on never using capital letters except at the beginning of a sentence when the phone default caps for you.  If I had known so much more would go wrong, I would have cut my losses here.  But I decided to stick it out, and give the phone a chance.If you text frequently, you will be sliding your phone open and closed a lot.  After a only a month and a half, the screen began to flicker, and wouldn't always stay bright.  Now, after almost a year, it flickers constantly and is so bad, I can't make out 2/3 of the pictures I receive from friends, or take myself.The camera is pretty bad.  The exposure time is way too long, and so if you're trying to take a picture of something moving at the slightest bit(try a baby or a toddler for the far-away relatives to see that they've never gotten a chance to meet) or you don't have a perfectly steady hand your picture will always be blurred.The internet button, instant messenger button, and email buttons are all very close together on the left of the keyboard, and are very easily mistyped when you're texting fast.Sliding the phone open always unlocks the keyboard.  This is annoying not only for privacy, but also for when your toddler picks your phone up, and so easily presses your internet buttons, then randomly browses the web without your knowledge, jacking up your phone bill because you didn't have internet on your plan.After 6 months, the buttons began to stick, and hitting one key the phone registers it as another.  This also goes for all the letter keys next to those 3 internet buttons.  wanted to type a Q, A, or Z?  Well now you're loading up the web and have to wait for it to boot up, so you can exit it and get back to your text msg.If you like to text, send pictures to relatives, or just like a non-flickery screen and good camera pictures... BUY SOMETHING ELSE.  This is the worst texting phone I have ever used in 4 years.  I bought this phone because it was a good deal and seemed to have a lot of desired features.  For the same price, there are better phones out there.  All 4 of my previous texting phones prior to this one, have been in the same price range and were by far much better than this one.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE!!!", "Author": "Sally", "ReviewID": "R3FCDKKXFTXT3V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying my old phone (a Sony Ericson) lasted me a good 3 or 4 days before I had to charge it back up. This new phone (the LG Xenon) is HORRIBLE when it comes to the battery. Even after I fully charge it and talk on the phone with somebody, the battery starts to die off extremely quickly. I will talk on it for maybe 10 minutes and the phone quickly starts beeping at me to plug it in before it dies. So, unless you are planning to plug this phone in as you are on the go somehow, avoid it at all costs!Secondly, it limits the amount of text messages you can have. My old phone used to allow me to keep my old text messages, but the LG Xenon does not allow me to get to even 200 texts. Once it gets too high, it insists I delete the old texts, which is always a pain because sometimes I have important conversations that I would prefer to keep.Thirdly, it has times where it randomly shuts off on me. It will just go blank and shut off whenever it likes.The only good thing about this phone is the camera, which takes decent photos. They are not top quality, but for a phone they are pretty okay.Overall, please AVOID this phone! Listen to the negative reviews.

Simple to use!", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R1WH9JBM7OIZQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm happy with my purchase. I spent more than I wanted to on a phone, but this phone had the BEST reviews from any website! I seriously looked all over and this came back the top rated phone every time, plus everyone said that the phone was user friendly and it is. I thought the blue would be brighter or deeper, but it's just an ordinary blue, similar to sky blue, but just a touch darker. The red one is much more attractive, but I didn't want to spend the additional $50.00, so I stuck with the blue. The battery life, I can't comment on, since I haven't used the phone that much, but it's the same size battery as the one in my old LG and that phone lasts for at least three hours, sometimes four, so I'm not expecting any issues with that. This phone CAN be used with or without a SIM card. Hope this was helpful.Update: 10/20/11I returned the phones, because we went with a different carrier and the phones were not compatible with that network. However, HP Electronics is a WONDERFUL company and this return has nothing to do with their products or service. In fact, they let me return the phones AFTER the 30days and gave me a FULL refund. It is rare to find a company with such concern for the happiness of their customers. Already looking into purchasing other items from them again. Love love love this company!

She's had it for about two months now and wants to write a review.The phone itself was great: keyboard fully functional, touchscreen nice and responsive. I especially liked that I could set it to vibrate when I touched a button on the screen, so I always knew if I'd made contact with an actual button. I didn't have a data plan so I can't speak for the web access. One thing I didn't like was that the headphone jack wasn't standard, so if you plan to listen to music you'll need their special headphones. They're great headphones, but I hadn't wanted to spend the extra money. I also had to buy a microSD card for the music, because you can't upload music without one. Once that'd all worked out, the music quality was fantastic. It was super easy to set up playlists. The only other downside about the music was that the headphones couldn't process being in when the phone was jostled, so listening to music while running or in the car makes the phone skip. That'd be okay if only it didn't skip for everyone around me too.Another con: I dropped it for the first time about two weeks ago, which made it turn off. I had to plug it in for a few hours to get it to turn back on, but when that was done it worked well again. Then, a week ago, I dropped it a second time (on a carpeted floor, I might add), and it has completely ceased to be functional at all. I've tried to charge it multiple times, I've taken the battery in and out to try to reset it. Nothing works. It's a kind of expensive piece of metal and plastic now.

It was still under warranty, so I was given another brand-new incarnation of the same phone. This one I had for again a little over six months before it too began to malfunction. The touch screen got out of whack, meaning that to press any button, I had to press the button to the left of it. Annoying, and even more annoying because it is completely impossible to press any buttons on the left side of the screen.

Easy to use menus that take a little adjustment after using the Samsung Flight II, but she'll get used to it. My only complaint and the reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the wall charger did not have a usb cable incorporated. We happened to purchase an accessory bundle with case at the same time which just happened to arrive on the same day, so we have connection to our computer anyways. Aside from all that, this phone seems to be a great buy for the price compared to Go phones in stores around the same price. My wife seems happy, and that's all I need.Edit 5-20-12!!! We ended up having to return this for a refund and reorder the product for $5 more, even though the product was fulfilled by Amazon. They explained that even though the product was fulfilled by Amazon, it was shipped out by the seller. It turned out there was a minor moisture bubble in the lcd display upon receipt, so we had to return it to an AMAZON RETURN CENTER, and when my wife gave me the phone and wall charger to return, she forgot to remove her micro SD card. After contacting Amazon about the issue and a 3 day research time, I was informed that they were unable to find or retrieve the micro SD card, but that I could order another and they would reimburse me for the price (which was only $6.99 fulfilled by Amazon for a 4GB.) BE WARNED THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MEMORY CARD, THAT YOU CANNOT TRANSFER ANYTHING TO OR FROM A COMPUTER WITH A USB CABLE connected to this  phone; SO NO CUSTOMIZED MP3 RINGTONES AND NO REMOVING PICTURES. I can't tell why this is since there is internal storage, but since Amazon is more than handling the problem they retain the 4-star rating for the phone. As I noted before, my wife had the Samsung Flight II prior to this phone, and they take the same memory card, but for those of you purchasing this as a new phone and  who would like customized mp3 ringtones or to transfer pictures off the phone, it would be a good idea to purchase a usb cable compatible with the phone and either a micro SD card or micro SD card with SD card adapter if you have an SD port on your computer. Oddly enough, we still have the adapter and case for our old micro SD card, but Amazon is replacing the whole adapter kit at their cost, so yet again Amazon exceeds to please with their customer service.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I ordered.", "Author": "Penny", "ReviewID": "RIMT2CXG795CG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone came exactly as discribed in ad.

I have never been happy with the camera. Pictures will be blurry unless the subject matter is completely still....difficult with kids...or anyone for that matter. I have a real camera, but it's nice to have the convenience of a camera with you wherever you are and this has been 2 years without that convenience. Even my old flip phone with no features had a MUCH better camera. I have also been frustrated that you can take video on this phone, but apparently can't SEND it anywhere. I would love to be able to put my videos on my computer, but it has not been possible, even with a USB cable. The other issues I have had started about 6 months after I got it with the screen freezing up and going black. Sometimes the screen would go rainbow. When this happens I have to turn it off, but sometimes that doesn't even work and I have to take the battery out. Overall, I like the look, feel and style of the phone.

I loved it when I first got it cause it had a slide keyboard and a touch screen, then a few months after I got it, it started having problems. The first one ended up breaking 9 days after I got it and had to send it back cause the keyboard went loose. Then it developed a sink in the screen and evetually the screen flickered and it never stopped. After that, the keyboard part started messing up. I would go to slide the keyboard and the screen would just go off. I had to hold it up just a bit to see it cause that would be all that worked before I slid it up the whole way and the screen went dark. The screen eventually stopped working all together maybe about 6 months in total of having it.  I ordered Another of the exact same phone but in a different color caused i didn't wanna research anymore phones. Bad Idea. I've had this one for maybe 3 months and now the screen won't show at all.  My Best Advice Is Don't Get This Phone. When in conversation mode for texting, longer conversations will cause the phone to lag in loading them. The music player takes like 5 minutes to load which makes it seem like forever. It's nice for the first few months, then it goes to crap. Best used as a temp phone if anything. The only thing I like about the phone honeslty is the camera cause it never stopped working good and kt was a really good one at that.

I had to order mines off the internet, and the thing broke apart a week later! Secondly, the key pad. The buttons are hard,and to switch to upper case letters you have to press the capslock key. No shift key! The keys are too close together, there's an internet key along with some other pointless keys and if you text fast, or even relatively fast, you end up stumbling over those keys too often. And the screen. After about two months, the screen would flicker, freeze and just turn off every once in a while. The camera is pretty bad too. Don't attempt to take pictures of anything that MOVES with this camera because it is guaranteed to come up blurry. And on top of that, my camera had never been able to zoom. The internet sucks too.
