{"Reviews": [{"Title": "excellent no frills tracfone", "Author": "bg", "ReviewID": "R17XDRPBTUX914", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had previously ordered and cancelled buying one after seeing info that phone used GSM technology. I later found that no, this is a CDMA phone, denoted by its actual model number of LG200C. I then decided to buy one, as I have to have that service as no other works at my home. I previously ordered twice from shop cell deals and was very happy with the service. This phone was ordered late on a Wednesday and arrived Saturday AM. Very quick delivery. The phone charged up and after finally figuring out out to do my transfer from old Tracfone to this unit, it was up and running. You do not need to call them in most cases. The transfer page requiring you to obtain info from old phone to transfer minutes is not really self explanatory. They give you two sets of entry blocks. The first two blocks get the first number obtained from old phone. Then the other two get the second number. Tracfone's page does not explain this unfortunately and most people end up calling them, which can be very trying, as that number is offshore. The email support in Florida used to give out their number, but I see it is no longer listed from them unless you absolutely need to call them. At that number you get far better service.The LG200C is no frills. No Internet. Only Main screen, no outside screen. Since I rarely use speakerphone, its operation off of key pad and screen is no problem. The screen will show call connected and speaker on at first. If you need speakerphone, just press the right soft key, which gives a \"drop down\" page of choices. The speakerphone on option will be there. Navigate to it(highlights) and press ok. Most people assume you should turn on speakerphone first. This is only troublesome if the number you call requests numbers to be entered. Just turn up the volume and you can still hear. Most of the newer phones have a keypad just for the speaker, but really, how much do you need it. These are NOT for use while driving. And really, do you really use this a lot?  So it being a little cumbersome does not bother me.I previously had Verizon with an old LG VX8300, that ran and ran, especially with the 1500 mah battery. I wish I had one of those batteries, but I donated everything after getting Tracfone . Both have same battery type and cover, so I will have to find another. That LG ran for days on end with no charging with that super duty battery, and it worked even after 3 or 4 years.I rate this phone excellent, for no frills and am saisfied with it. I won't have a problem buying again from this seller. I find their service excellent and they are very helpful and respond in a timely manner.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best coverage we've ever had", "Author": "Nadine Wight", "ReviewID": "R3IX5CLTU8BEKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since getting this CDMA phone we get coverage in places you don't expect.

I believe this LG phone is superior to the Motorola flip phone. My sister liked mine so much that she had me order one for her. If you're looking for a good, basic phone, I think you'll like this one. Plus, both times I ordered this phone (from the same seller), the seller included a free double-minutes card.

I am going to have to return it I think. Could be just my area, but it roams and is no good at all. Wrong choice for me.

Fierman", "ReviewID": "R3HZQ9ZORA3NY6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I needed a prepaid phone a family member and decided that since they go through them so fast (dropping in water and other ways that seem to happen a lot), that I would get them this little guy. Less than $10 with delivery, how could I go wrong?  Well let me tell you.  From what I can gather, this phone was a 2007 or so model.  All of the packaging, users guide and even the red activation card were of an old design.  The phone as well has minimal features.  No SIM card, which means it is a CDMA, An old type of Samsung charge port, and very basic functions like some of the older phones had.  I am surprised the battery still had power in it.  I have not activated it yet and probably will not.  I know that if I give it to this person, they will purposely destroy it.  But, for less than $10, it is a cell phone and it does come with a double minutes for life card.  If nothing else, I now have a nice little alarm clock.  If you are a collector of cell phones, and yes my friends they are out there, this is a nice one to add to your collection along with the accessories and documentation that comes with it.  If you are looking for a prepaid cell with bluetooth or even a web browser, spend a little more.  Tracfone does have many good phones for a little more coin and has a lot more options.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001T0HSNC"}}
