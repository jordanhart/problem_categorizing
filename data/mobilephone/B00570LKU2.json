I did not have to recharge for 7-10 days. And that's making calls, texting, watching videos, listening to music...

I sometimes miss my E71 but I am falling in love with this phone. I love the touch screen. I makes the phone feel modern and in touch with current standard but still feel more like a core phone and not a media device. I am a very practical business person, All i need a phone to do is to make and receive calls that's the primary function of a phone. Texting has improved on this phone it has a nice feel to use. The navigation has improve and the GPS picks up much faster. Thanks Nokia for this improvement very useful when I travel worldwide. Oh the phone can be used anywhere I love that too. Much much faster internet too. Pinch and zoom is nice, proud to use my phone next to those other guys.Cons. Sometimes the screen is too sensitive, the slightest touch and you may end up doing something not intended. I really really hate the fact that the notification light is useless. This is the only thing that makes me want to go back to the E71. This is a messaging phone what is the point if you can not see if you have a message or be notified.If there is a solution to turn down the sensitivity and fix the notification issue, then I would not need another phone for the ten years. This is a solidly built constructed phone and has every thing you really need. I often throw my E72 and E6 this phone on the ground and ask my other friends with their \"Iwhatever\" and their \"Samswhatever\" to do the same. you should see them shake. hahahaah. Well done Nokia.If you need a good phone, look no further. Oh stick with the Anna OS do not upgrade.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good but am still in process of finalizing transaction", "Author": "Joe Perelli", "ReviewID": "REJV5UMW0IBU7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have no issues with the company or the product. I am well versed with Nokia phones.The description of this particular product was lacking certain details and information. It actually stated verbage that was incorrect. I would have not purchased this particular phone if it was stated more clearly! BUT the company always responded to my questions quickly and is currently handling the return of this product.
