{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Who Needs an iPhone?", "Author": "B. D. Soufi", "ReviewID": "R221REL682TCPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying I'm an economist. Logos do not impress me. Excellent price/performance ratios impress me. Although I must admit, the Exhibit II is a fairly beautiful phone in real life; don't let the photos scare you.This powerful yet humble device has the same memory (512MB RAM) and CPU speed (1GHz) as the iPhone 4. And, dare I say, it actually makes phone calls. It even has a larger screen than the latest $700+ iPhone 4S. Still with me?Why I bought this phone (with a new prepaid plan):>1. Freedom: With T-Mobile's prepaid plans, you can start or stop your service anytime without any fines. You can switch carriers, sell your phone, and walk away without even saying goodbye.>2. Screen: The 3.7\" screen is bigger than the one on the iPhone 4S. The 800x480 resolution makes for a relatively high pixel density (252 ppi) and looks fantastic.>3. Android has developed into a very solid OS. With over 400,000 apps to choose from, I'm overwhelmed.>4. Price: Why spend $500 to $800 on a flagship phone when you can get 90% of the utility/functionality for $200? At $200, if my phone is destroyed, lost, or stolen, it's not the end of the world.>5. Plan: The phone is shipped with a prepaid SIM card, so there's no need to order the $7.00 SIM card from T-Mobile. For $30/month you get 5GB of \"4G\" data, unlimited texts, and 100 minutes of talk. If you setup a Google Voice # and get either the GrooveIP app ($5.00) or the Google Voice Callback app (free), you'll be able to make unlimited domestic calls for free, over the internet. It works quite well and even allows you to make much cheaper international calls than you would through your carrier. Just make sure to set it up correctly, so you don't accidentally use up all your minutes. Edit: Groove IP/Google Voice is only reliable with a Wi-Fi connection so it may not be a viable alternative to normal voice calls in all situations.>6. ROI: The return on investment is phenomenal. This phone truly represents a breakthrough in information and communications technology. For the first time in history, with a device that costs $200 and service that costs $1 a day, you can have a 3.7\" window to the world that goes with you, guides you, informs you, entertains you, wakes you, and connects you to everyone and everything that matters in your life. The list of gadgets that this phone makes obsolete would go on for pages, but let me just say that if you don't have a smartphone yet, get this phone and don't look back.I was finally released after serving a 2-year sentence, I mean, a....contract. I'm free!EDIT: (after 1 week with the phone)Performance (including call quality) is excellent while battery life falls short of miraculous. With more moderate use and battery saving apps, you could easily go an entire day without needing to recharge. The 3Mp camera on the phone doesn't quite replace my old DSLR, but it works flawlessly for bar-code scanning, jpg-to-pdf scanning, and other \"utilitarian\" applications. By the way, the maximum video capture resolution is 640x480, not 720x480.EDIT 2: (after 4 weeks with the phone)My Exhibit II is still going strong and looks brand new, even after dropping it a few times. I've gotten used to using Samsung's \"swype\"  keyboard which is the only technology I've seen that truly makes touchscreen typing viable beyond a few words. I'm not surprised that the phone is out of stock at both Amazon and Walmart.com. If you're planning to get this phone, good luck finding it in stock! On eBay, the going rate for this phone is $250. Get it on Amazon, if you can.EDIT 3: (After 40 days with the phone)The phone still works perfectly and looks great. Even now, it's easily the best smartphone under $300 and, at $189, has the best price-performance of any phone currently on the market.EDIT 4: (After 10 weeks with the phone)We have had many fruitful discussions in the 100+ comments that have been posted since I first wrote my review 10 weeks ago. If you own this phone, I strongly recommend reading the comments posted by Franquis, Yogi Bear, and others who have become de facto experts on this device. They have surpassed my knowledge of the phone and I have learned from their insights. It appears many of us have been having difficulties with the Groove IP app and various alternatives have been suggested, including Skype.I have dropped the phone so many times and I finally managed to crack the screen but it functions perfectly nonetheless. The Exhibit II is a truly remarkable device (at any price) and I continue to be amazed by its capabilities.EDIT 5: (After 1 year with the phone)I got this phone exactly one year ago today (Nov. 2) and it's still going strong. It has enabled me to harness the power of the internet in my daily life like never before. For anyone still thinking about getting this phone, I would recommend waiting for the LG Nexus 4 which will pack the most advanced specs on the market for the humble price of $299 unlocked, without a contract. The Exhibit II was the best phone for the money in the US market for quite a while, but better options are finally emerging.Thanks for all the continued input in the comments section!", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highest performance to price ratio, hands down!", "Author": "Hao Zhang", "ReviewID": "R3SD50RZ2Y57RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 12/5/12: This phone has officially retired for me. I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy SII from T-Mobile. Here are a few final points on this phone. It has gained its own section in the xda-developers forum, so go check it out if you're new to this phone and are interested in customizing it. Check out the updated review below for more information.====================================================================================================-------------------------From a regular user's point of view-------------------------I love this phone! I picked it up at Wal-Mart because of their exclusive $30 monthly plan with 100 talk minutes, unlimited text, and unlimited web (first 5GB at 4G speed per month, rest of the month slows down to EDGE). I'll tell you, I have never reached my 5GB limit, and I'm a heavy Internet user! T-Mobile's 4G HSPA+ network is really good, considering the price. Of course it's spotty in some places with T-Mobile being the way it is, but not most places that I've been to.The phone is sleek, and is loaded with features. Of course, being an Android phone, it is capable of doing many things that cannot be done on common feature phones. The 3.2 megapixel camera is quite good; it's not digital SLR quality, but it gets the job done when you need quick snapshots. The screen is nice and bright, very detailed and unpixelated because Samsung did a smart move by fitting a whole lot of pixels in a 3.7 inch screen. The 1GHz processor really hits the spot! Everything I do on it is fast! There's barely any freezing with the exception of browsing complicated webpages with more than 5 windows open.Personally, I think this phone beats the iPhone 4. For those who don't know the truth, the iPhone 4 costs $650 unsubsidized when it first came out. So to those saying \"meh you can just get an iPhone for the same price\", keep in mind that this phone does not require a contract, so you aren't forced to pay $100+ for cellphone bill every month. If you do simple math, you'll find that you'd actually save money in the long run with this phone compared to the iPhone locked into a contract. This phone showed me so much I've been missing out with iOS! It has pretty much the same features of iOS, and then some. You'll find that this phone is highly customizable due to Android OS's capabilities. It should be relatively easy to use for those new to smartphones.The phone has many pre-installed apps, which can be either good or bad depending on your preference. The apps are supposed to help you access T-Mobile stuff easier, but they are of no use to me. I rooted my phone and have since flashed many custom firmwares/ROMs to make the phone fit my needs.I really have nothing much to say to regular users. If you're new to Android, you should probably hit up YouTube and see what it's capable of. I can't explain how to do everything in this review. If you're looking for a bit more information, check out the section of review below!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From a geek/power-user's point of view-------------------------Now, let's talk about the performance-price ratio. When you first get the phone, it may be a little 'meh', but many great developers came out and started pimpin' this phone. There are many custom ROMs available; Gingerbread ROMs for those with performance in mind, and Ice Cream Sandwich/Jellybean ROMs for those that want a little taste of unofficial upgrade. There's also a custom kernel floating around that allows the seemingly weak processor to overclock to 1.8GHz! That's about an 80% increase in processing power! Think about that, a 1.8GHz phone for $200. Now keep in mind that this isn't a dual-core processor, but it still performs like a champion.This phone can very easily outperform similar competitions at this price range, thanks to the great developers over at the xda-developers forum for taking the phone's hardware to its limit. At one point, users were able to score a little under 7000 points in AnTuTu Benchmark, which is double of the usual 3500 points that you'll usually see with the stock ROM.There are many ROMs to choose from. Whether it's Gingerbread-based ROMs or Ice Cream Sandwich-based ROMs, or Jellybean-based ROMs, you can't go wrong with this phone. Developers are always porting ROMs such as CyanogenMod, AOKP, MIUI, Paranoid Android, PAC, etc. You'll probably step into the day where you have nothing left to customize! I'm actually looking back from my Galaxy SII with a bit of envy, seeing how this phone has stepped up so much from its start.This phone is perfect for people who wants a mid-end experience at a low-end price. Seriously, this phone is very powerful with a few tweaks here and there. For $200, you definitely can't beat the phone for what it's capable of. It's no Galaxy Nexus, but I think that it can be its little brother. And computer geeks, I know how much you want a device that's affordable and highly customizable! ;)All information regarding rooting, custom ROMs, and software modifications are available on the xda-developers forum.Specifications:* CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon S2 - 1GHz single core (overclockable to 1.8GHz with custom kernel)* GPU: Adreno 205* RAM: 512MB (356MB allocated to stock ROM; 364MB allocated to most ICS/JB ROMs)* Display: 3.7\" TFT LCD touch-screen (800 x 480 resolution)* Cameras: 3.2MP rear-facing camera with LED flash; VGA front-facing camera* Cellular Network Technologies: GSM 850/900/1800/1900 + HSDPA 850/1700/1900/2100 capable of up to 14.4Mbps on an HSPA+ network* OS: Android 2.3.6 (up to 4.1.2 with custom ROMs)* Storage: ~2.5GB total internally, up to 32GB externally via microSD card====================================================================================================Here are some of the accessories I've gotten for this phone.

The phone is really nice for a $200 buyout phone. It has great sound quality (both earpiece and speakerphone).  I am coming from the original Droid on Verizon. The camera on the phone is very decent. Certainly as good as the 5mp on the Droid and faster too. I like T mobiles wi-fi calling from home..it allows me to run on my own wifi system if T-Mobiles signal is weak indoors. Video chat using Gtalk works very well. The phone comes with Kies Air for wireless transfers from your laptop and Yelp (for finding all those nice places to do business with). The GPS system works very well and the web is super fast on T-Mobiles great 4G (and I get it almost everywhere even in places my friends do NOT get Wimax on Sprint. The phone is very light and smaller in size than the Droid (but with same screen size).  It has a textured back for better grip. The battery lasts all day with moderate use (remember not to load the phone with tons of apps and widgets). My chargers for the Droid work with this phone (including the car charger). The screen is very easy to see and the colours are good. It comes with Gingerbread 2.3.5 and the scrolling is very smooth. It's a way more pleasant phone to use than the Droid is. It's not flashy, but it works very well.Cons: Lots of bloatware (not removable without rooting), ATT might consume T-Mobile potentially ruining a good thing, I wish it had a 4\" screen...maybe version 3 will have that.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "More effort required.", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "R1ZZ2MG6ZGWCEO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this off amazon, tax free, with two day shipping. Arrived in a timely manner, but just got to activate it this morning. Activation is very simple. The kit includes a sim card, which you just insert above (and to the left) of the battery in the back. Then you will want to go to t-mobile.com/activation and follow the instructions. It comes with a random $3.34 balance.. for emergency.. instant calling or something I suppose. But following the activation, it takes you to where you can pay for your service online. You can also get those cards at the store, but honestly, it's so easy just to pay online. And then you're good to go. I chose the $30 unlim text/data + 100 min plan. You don't need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this. To my understanding, it is only available for new activations.The price and quality of the phone is all great. One problem I have with it is that... honestly... I'm not really an Android fan. I didn't think I would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with. Sure, there are ways to delete it. But people on reviews made it sound 100x easier than what I had to do. I don't really consider myself technologically challenged, but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap I didn't want. You can't just go to the \"APPLICATIONS\" menu and drag what you don't want to the trash. Why? Everything I've tried to delete just stays there when I go back to the menu. What the hell is that function for then? Why can I not just delete the stuff I don't want? (And there are many.)I'm new to Android so rooting was a brand new concept for me. I must have downloaded 4 different apps off the Android market to no avail. I didn't understand why the hell something called \"______ Uninstaller\" cannot uninstall apps. After a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things, I finally figured it out.I figure I'd type it out in layman's terms for those who have trouble rooting:- Turn on USB debugger (settings>applications>development>usb debugging)- Have the right USB drivers installed ON YOUR COMPUTER (Apparently these are difficult to find. Install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead. When I did this, it told me it wasn't installed correctly but I couldn't find a fix so I just ignored it.)- Connect your phone to the computer via usb port- Then you can download SuperOneClick on your COMPUTER. It is a computer application. Extract (it is a zip file) and run. Click on \"root.\" (top left big button) It may take a couple minutes. It should say root complete or whatever at the end. And to confirm that it is indeed rooted, you will see a \"Superuser\" icon in the applications folder.- Now you can begin the uninstallation, but that is not all! You have to download some more stuff to uninstall. From the Android market, you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items. Android Mate was too advanced for me. You have to know exactly what files you are deleting (which is a constant annoyance.) If you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick. Kind of terrifying, considering the price I paid. I used Titanium backup to uninstall items, but you still run the risk of deleting things you need. It is better to \"freeze\" the apps but that is a premium feature, which you must pay for. I also tried Root Uninstaller to no avail. It didn't show any apps besides Market and itself for some reason. I'm sure there's something out there that might be better but, so far, my experience is that these apps are not that user-friendly.Others have claimed that the process above is \"easy\" but it wasn't for me, apparently. Maybe some people know how to do this intuitively, I don't know. But think about it. All I wanted to do was delete pre-installed junk like internet radios and \"MORE FREE APPS!@!!\" apps. But it took entirely way too long. You can just press on any app in iOS until it's shaking and then press X to delete. A couple seconds, max. I don't understand why it is so hard to delete things on the Android (not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corner.)Aside from my long rant, in the end, it is a good deal for a 4g smartphone and great rates on plans. Still, I'm not too satisfied with Android. I feel like it's one of those apple vs. windows commercials, comparing efficiency. There's a pre-installed anti-virus (free trial for 14 days, then you have to pay). Really? I never even thought that would be an issue with iOS. Obviously these are my opinions, and others will have no problems with the bloatware. I'm a bit OCD and inefficiency is such an annoyance. I just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible, not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services. Yes, the iphone costs way more, but I would still rather have it than Android. That's just me though.EDIT:After a few days of use, I'm getting used to the Android system more. I don't mind it as much, and hopefully it will hold up well. It's still a fantastic deal, and with no contracts none-the-less! In the end, the savings are fantastic. Think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract. This phone is really a smart purchase.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very nice Android phone, especially for the price", "Author": "Lenny", "ReviewID": "R2NZP0D4K4220", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After coming across T-Mobile / Walmart's $30 monthly plan, I started looking out for a phone that can connect on T-Mobile's 4G network. The two other candidates (Galaxy S II and the not-yet-available Galaxy Nexus) are all above $500, and I'm not sure I want to spend so much on a phone. Then I came across this one.It lacks some of the other features I'm interested in. I'd like to have a good camera, this one is about average. I'd like to play with NFC. And dual processors would be nice in some situations. And I'd like to have Gorilla Glass on the front. But I'm not prepared to pay full retail for a Galaxy S II. Contracts don't make sense in my situation when I take the total cost of ownership into account - I don't use the phone enough to justify the price.For the price, though, this is an amazingly good phone. The display is crisp, the UI is responsive. Voice is clear, and it gets better reception than my other phone (a clamshell feature phone). It's easy to root, which you'd need to do if you want to uninstall some of the bloatware T-Mobile put in there. It won't win any design awards, but it looks good. It has a 3.5mm headset jack, LED flash, takes microSD memory. The micro USB port is protected behind a sliding door.Activation was painless and can be done online. The SIM card and all other information is included, and if you don't have the box handy and don't want to remove the battery, you can get the IMEI by dialing \"*#06#\" - it'a also easier to read this way. There's $3.34 on the card, so you will need to add money if you want to activate the $30 Walmart plan. Getting T-Mobile to SIM unlock the phone, on the other hand, is painful. When I talked to a rep, she told me my account needs to be active for 60 days. I have another T-Mobile prepaid account that qualifies, but then she said that SIM needs to be in the phone for more than a day, and to call back later. This is despite me explaining I paid full retail for the phone.I've not tested the data network too much yet. I'm sure you can find reviews of T-Mobile's 4G network elsewhere. What little I've tried was quite fast and responsive, but then again, I had 4 bars of 4G signal at that time.Battery life was OK. I did not measure it before I uninstalled the bloatware, so I'm not able to state how much of a difference it made. My email client constantly checking for mail probably is not doing battery life wonders either. And I have it connected to wifi both at work and at home all the time.Added after 5 day road trip : you definitely want to pack a charger with you (or a micro USB cable). Even with limited use and battery saving options turned on, it would be practically depleted after 24 hours.Additional update on battery life : I rooted the phone and deleted, among other things, T-Mobile's My Account and changed my Hotmail app to sync only on demand (instead of Push). Battery life appears to have doubled because of that.The only thing that really irks me about this phone is the inability to connect it to my computer. I had to install Microsoft's MTP Porting Kit on Vista before it would connect, and I couldn't get it to connect to my Windows 7 laptop. Both run 64 bit Windows. Some web forum posts mentioned installing Samsung Kies for the drivers, I'm waiting to see if there's an alternative before doing it. You can use Kies Air to connect to the phone. Kies Air runs a HTTP server on the phone and allows you to connect from another computer's web browser (no software install required) over wi-fi to manage the phone, including file transfers.I had a hard time finding USB Mass Storage Class mode until J. Weng helped me out in the comments. Apparently, it is under \"Wireless and Network\" and is not a permanent setting, but needs to be activated every time you wish to connect.There are a number of errors in the manual. I think one part stated it had 16GB of internal storage. That is incorrect, there's only 4GB of internal storage. The organization of some other parts is confusing, and the section about storage is just one huge mess.It would also be nice to have the micro SD accessible without having to open the battery cover, but it is a small inconvenience.Finally, it would be nice if there are more accessories for this phone. It's still fairly new, but some choices of skin / case would be nice. I did find a very nice case though : T-MOBILE SAMSUNG T679 EXHIBIT II 4G SMOKE BLACK TPU GEL SKIN CASE, IN QUBITS RETAIL PACKAGINGOverall, I'm very happy with the purchase.

I liked the Optimus T, but felt it was a little laggy when running apps and the screen was smaller than I really wanted. This phone initially seemed perfect: bigger screen, bigger memory, better camera. All of that is true and I really enjoy all of those aspects of the phone.My biggest complaint is the text messaging. The phone, out of box, has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the t-mobile board (wish I had seen those earlier!). Messages fail constantly; some messages that fail have more than 160 characters, other are short messages. It took me five minutes to get an \"Ok!\" sent to one of my employees. If this problem didn't exist, this phone would be a 4-star for me, but both Samsung and T-Mobile support don't seem to want to do anything about this problem.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone for the price!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RNRCKUQ2ABNPU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start this off by saying I'm not someone whom normally writes reviews on Amazon as when I buy stuff, it's generally things that people aren't on the fence about. However, I decided to go ahead and write a review to strongly recommend that you consider the Samsung Exhibit II from T-Mobile. When I read the PR from T-mobile about this phone, I got really excited that finally a GOOD smartphone was coming to the prepaid lineup at a reasonable price. I placed my order the day the phone came out and received my order on November 4.Screen Quality --- I think the specs are not quite as good as some of the top of the line models, but they're incredibly sharp and pretty dang close. It's incredibly clear and leaps and bounds better from the earlier android and iphone screens. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Text is smooth and crisp.Phone calls --- Sound quality is excellent and sounds like a landline using T-Mobiles free wi-fi calling app. It integrates seamlessly with the phone and elects to use Wi-fi if a good signal is available. If not, it'll switch to the cellular network. There are no apps to install on the device or on your computer/router. Like I said, very seamless. Also, phone calls over the cellular network sound excellent as well.Text Messages --- Typical Gingerbread text message interface. The phone comes with swype which I had never used before, but have since become accustomed to and am thrilled it came preloaded on the phone.Memory --- The memory is a bit shallow. The specs say it has 4 GBs of memory though I have about 1 GB of USB storage and 1 GB of onboard memory. I don't know where the rest is though it could be used by the Android OS. Honestly, I would consider it a non-issue since you can get a Name brand Class 4 32GB microSDHC relatively inexpensively. I certainly have the option to upgrade the memory at anytime. Also, I have installed every app I can think of that friends have/use as well as several Amazon free apps of the day and I've used under 1/3 of the 1 gb system memory available. With the Amazon Cloud music player, it makes the total storage on your droid phone a non-issue since Amazon lets you upload unlimited music to their cloud for free. Then, you can stream it to your phone for free. So, I could have 200 GBs of music on my Amazon Cloud and this phone could play it all perfectly without the need for tons of onboard memory. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there are several free radio Apps that I found on Amazon that are free and stream thousands of stations.Battery --- I've been getting about 15 hours of usage out of the phone and keep in mind, this is my first smartphone so it's still fun to play with. I don't have the screen brightness maxed out, but it's definitely bright and good enough. Also, the nice thing about buying a non-Apple device is that it has a user-replaceable battery. I found a generic replacement from Amazon relatively inexpensively. So, after a year of charging and uncharging when the battery begins to age, I can buy a new one and it'll be good as new.Overall, this is a great phone for the price. It's honestly not as snappy as a top of the line, dual core smartphone, but you're also not paying the price of that new phone either. It's still fast enough to handle every application I've run on it. But, I do have several widgets and services running so I know that I'm taking up ram and CPU power doing that.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best no contract Smartphone out there", "Author": "Joey Saylor", "ReviewID": "R300YKPQOGZ0OF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone after owning a Blackberry Curve 8530 for less than a year. While the Blackberry was reliable and provided all the basic needs, I wanted to step up to something much better. This phone has not disappointed me so far. In fact I used it strictly as a media player for 2 weeks before activating to see if this is what I wanted. Coming from Blackberry and stepping into the Android world, the differences are astronomical. While Blackberry App World has relatively few apps to download (40,000), Android Market has over 500,000. This phone is just about compatible with everything on Android Market too. Apps like Beautiful Widgets, Set CPU, Titanium Backup Pro and Player Pro (awesome app for music lovers btw) work flawlessly on this phone. With the 1 GHz processor and 512mb of ram, there's hardly any lag whatsoever. The Blackberry Curve froze up constantly while in the middle of doing something! On the touch screen, I find it very responsive and user friendly. Getting adjusted to typing on screen rather than a keypad has not been as big a deal as I thought it would be either.As far as phone service, I had been a Virgin Mobile customer for 8 years so leaving was a big decision. Unfortunately the Sprint network crawls at a snail's pace here in Louisville. I'm talking 500kbps to 1mbps speed on their 3G network. Still no 4G and no plans for it in this area in the foreseeable future. Root Metrics rated them the worst here as well (far as data is concerned). T-Mobile's 4G is not 4G LTE but pretty damn good if you ask me. Average speed here is 4mbps download, and 1mbps on the upload. All a normal user needs. I use wifi almost everywhere I go, so I elected the $50 plan with unlimited minutes/texting, and 100mb of 4G data transfer. VM was charging me $45 ($10 fee included for having a Blackberry) for 1200 minutes, unlimited texting and web. Would have been $55 if I wasn't grandfathered in when they raised rates.If you are porting your number, be prepared to spend some quality time with customer service. It took me over 40 minutes on the phone with T-Mobile to get the phone activated and give the necessary info for porting. No fault of theirs, they were actually very helpful. Just part of the process. Getting my number transferred took almost exactly the whole 48 hours, but it was done nonetheless. Props to T-Mobile for having CSR reps that speak excellent English as well, something else VM was having problems with in recent years.Last points, I rooted the phone to have complete control over it and got rid of bloatware I didn't need (Titanium Backup Pro is essential while doing this kind of thing). Very easy with Zerg Rush. You will also want a battery saving app like Juice Defender, especially if use the phone a lot or the screen is on quite a bit (that's the biggest battery killer of all). In a 2 hour period if I am playing music and surfing the internet, the battery can go from 100% to 70%. With the phone on standby, I have yet to determine the life span. Keeping Bluetooth, GPS off and letting Juice Defender manage what needs to be on and when, helps tremendously.Bottom line this is an excellent choice for those of us who don't want contracts, yet want a nice Smartphone that is comparable the high end \"contract only\" devices out there.Final update 10/2012:I have in the last 9 months used the stock ROM, RebelROM, Peach Sunrise, Exhibition, CM7, CM9 and CM10. Out of those, Rebel and CM7 are by far the best of the Gingerbread ROMs. CM9 is the best if you want ICS of course, and CM10 is Jellybean but a long way from being fully operational.You also need Clockwork Mod 6.0.1.2 to flash ROMs and make backups. Other helpful apps I have found are Neutron music player, CMarks to sync Chrome bookmarks to your phone, Avast Anti Virus which is free & comes with an anti-theft app and My Data Manager which you will need since you will not be able to use the T-Mobile apps to track data use anymore. If you know what you're doing and are WILLING to spend some time, this phone is fine for the money. If you want it all from the moment it comes out of the box, better look elsewhere.

I must say that going from a \"dumber\" phone to this has been a life changing experience and I will never go back to a non-smart phone.

I was dismayed to find out that I was not able to use Google Voice as the default voicemail for the phone, nor was I able to use T-mobile's own preinstalled visual voicemail  --- I can see the business logic behind these moves (T-mobile does not want pre-paid customers to have easy ways to get around using the limited 100 minutes while checking voicemail (google voice and visual voicemail use data instead of minutes)....still, I feel that T-mobile has mislead customers (they have nothing on their website that states that going pre-paid \"limits\" some of the features vs. what subscribing clients have access to).Still, it's not a bad deal overall - just annoying that they treat pre-paid customers like 2nd rate clients.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much more than just another smart phone.

It's because the phone allows average people to afford a quality smart phone with an affordable plan. I switched from the OG Droid on Verizon to the Exhibit II on T-Mobile two months ago, and I couldn't be more pleased.Mobile phone companies in the U.S. have been fleecing the public with smart phone plans for years. The Samsung Exhibit II 4G, along with T-Mobile's $49.99 \"all you can eat\" plans (available in both contract and prepaid flavors depending on your preference), represents a milestone that should change the industry, if only more people knew about it.First of all, make no mistake: this is a solid mid-level Android phone at a bargain-basement price. Great screen, great touch screen response, good performance. It's rootable, so you can remove the bloatware (XDA Developers is a great resource -- Google \"XDA Developers Samsung Exhibit II 4G root\". Once you're rooted, download \"Root Uninstaller\" from the Market and follow XDA's advice about which apps to remove).Let me briefly tell you our story. My wife and I bought Motorola Droids a few years ago for $250 each (2 year contract price!), then paid Verizon $170/month for a family plan with 1400 minutes, data, and text messaging. When it came time to upgrade, we felt that was too much money, downgraded to feature phones (bought from eBay), and started paying $110/month for 1400 minutes, text messaging, and no data.Fast forward to a couple of months ago. Thanks to this product we were able to buy two very good Android phones on Amazon for under $200 each. Brand new, full price, no contract. We are now paying $100/month combined for unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data. Yes, Verizon's network is better in rural areas. But if you think about it, who needs to pay $1700 extra over the course of a 2 year contract so you have coverage that one day or one week per year you're in BFE? In reality, very few people.But that's not all. Even if you're in BFE, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous. Many campgrounds have it, all McDonalds in the U.S. have it, etc. This is good news because the Exhibit II comes with T-Mobile's fantastic \"Wi-Fi Calling\" feature. This means you can use your phone anywhere in the world with Wi-Fi without paying roaming charges. Or, within old metallic office buildings with Wi-Fi where no cell phones from any provider work. Even Verizon can't beat that. I'm telling you, it works wonderfully. IMO, Verizon's admittedly superior wireless network is not worth anything close to $70/month more than T-Mobile's for the vast majority of users, especially when you factor in Wi-Fi calling. Your priorities may vary.In short, this is the best value in cell phones today. You get a mid-level Android phone without a contract for under $200. You get a plan that lets you use its full potential for only $50/month, from a legitimate national provider. You get this for less than many smart phones cost with a 2-year contract.I applaud T-Mobile and Samsung for producing a high-quality offering that makes smart phones accessible and affordable to average people.

If this phone had been sold a year or so ago, it would have been a premium phone with a premium price.The phone itself is high quality, with the following basic pros and cons:- Solidly made - smooth black plastic body with a dark blue textured back cover- Bright 3.7 inch high resolution screen - the resolution is 800 x 480, not as high as the most expensive current phones but plenty for everyday use- plenty of internal memory for a mid-range phone. I've got 20 or 30 of my favorite apps installed and still have about 700MB free on the internal storage- SD card capability - I have a 16 GB micro-SD card installed.- Fast chipset - This phone has a fast chipset installed - it appears to be the same Hummingbird CPU/GPU as my Original Galaxy Tab of a year ago, so this is a 2010 high end CPU  housed in a 2011 phone. This sounds bad but it's plenty fast for most of today's apps. It benchmarked faster than my 7\" Galaxy Tab.- Android 2.3 Gingerbread - This is the latest Android OS available for phones.

If you want a nicer camera, you'll most likely have to buy a contract phone.- Front camera - You can video-conference with this phone.- Good Data capability - I haven't thoroughly tested this, but I got several Mb/second download and about 1 Mb-second upload speed sitting in my house.- Clear voice callsIf you are opposed to contracts generally , waiting for the right phone to buy on-contract, or just want a nice phone right now without a contract, it's hard to go wrong with the Exhibit II 4G.

I was also disappointed at the sluggishness of the phone, plus how it would freeze not infrequently.  I was thinking of returning the phone at that time.However, after spending LOTS of time trying to figure out how to root the phone, and finally accomplishing this, the phone really does seem to work like a charm.  After googling \"how to root Samsung Exhibit 2\" and reading the top several matches, I got frustrated that I could not seem to find the right Samsung driver or download Zerg Rush Root.  But after scrolling to the next page of matches, I found an entry on \"Samsung Exhibit 2\" in Wikipedia.  The directions under \"rooting\" worked like a charm for me.  They had the Samsung device driver for download, as well as Zerg Rush.  It took me a little while to figure out how to download Winzip (I used the free \"evaluation\" version), which I needed to \"extract\" the Zerg Rush zip file.  But after I figured that out, turned my phone to USB debugging, and plugged it into my computer, the phone automatically went into root mode (I saw a DOS screen pop up, giving the status of the rooting), and about 5 minutes later, the phone was all rooted!  I then downloaded \"Titanium Backup\" (you first have to tell your phone to allow apps from non-Android marketplace), went to \"backup/ restore\" and deleted the unwanted apps.The battery life has increased tremendously since rooting the phone, deleting the junk apps and also installing Juice Defender.  I leave wifi on all the time, and 14 hours later, the battery still has 77% life left in it.  Before this, the battery would be nearly empty by this point.  I even bought extra charging cords to have in the office and in the car, but it looks like I won't be needing these too much now.  I can now wait to charge the phone when I get home.Unfortunately, one day after I rooted the phone, I am not able to find the link above to paste into this review.

I've owned two cell phones in the past, a chunky Motorola MicroTac analog and a Motorola Razr flip-phone... both basic phones.  So how does this smartphone newbie rate the Samsung Exhibit II 4G?Graphic Interface ***** Stunning. I looked at some of my own autumn scenery photography on this phone and was blown away by the detail and rich colors. It's like looking at a hi-def TV. Pictures and text are very crisp.Navigation ***** Excellent. If this is your first smartphone, it won't take you too long to figure out how to get around with the menus. Navigation is very fast and intuitive... either touch, touch and hold, or touch and slide.Ergonomics *** This is where basic phones have a distinct advantage over smartphones.  Both my older Motorola phones could easily be manipulated with one hand. The Samsung Exhibit really can't, which makes it very awkward to make or receive calls while driving. Navigating your phone's contacts, dialing numbers, and answering your phone with one hand is extremely difficult even if you have long, dextrous thumbs.Voice Clarity ** Unfortunately, not good.  People can sound somewhat unrecognizable as if they have a bad head cold and are talking through a sock.  The earpiece quality of this phone does not even compare to either of my older Motorola phones'. (Do not trust the voice quality ratings on T-Mobile's website!  I simply cannot believe anyone could rate the voice quality that high unless their previous phone was two paper cups connected by a length of string.) However, according the people I've asked, outgoing voice quality is apparently excellent.Voice Volume ** Could be significantly louder, especially to compensate for the poor audio quality.  I'll have the volume up all the way to talk in a completely quiet environment, and it's fine. But if I am in a noisy environment such as a bustling restaurant or moving car, the muddy sound quality mixed with insufficient volume makes for extremely difficult if not impossible hearing. In fact, if I'm driving in my car and someone calls, I don't answer the phone because I'll have too difficult of a time understanding the caller.  My old Motorola Razr flip phone's volume was nearly twice as loud as the Samsung Exhibit's.Texting ***** Anything is better than texting on a basic phone, so possibly for that reason, I had no problems adapting to texting on a touch screen. The virtual keyboard is quite small when holding the phone vertically, but flip the phone horizontal, the keyboard just about doubles in size. This helps considerably and makes texting a breeze. I absolutely love it. The phone has keystroke swipe technology, too, but I found regular texting to be faster.Bloatware * Having come from a basic phone background, I browsed through all of the apps and found almost all of them to be useless to me. I'm not going to use my phone for watching TV, reading books, scheduling appointments, geocaching, video conferencing, etc.  In fact, I have just one home screen with six apps on it, because that's all I need.  There is a handy widget on this phone that tells you how many apps are running.  You can see those apps at a glance and shut them down as needed to conserve memory.  Unfortunately, over a dozen apps will continue to run silently in the background and eat up 80% your RAM, and the only way to delete them is through \"rooting\" the phone, and that's something I don't even want to bother with.Camera: ***** Again, having come from a basic phone background, I found this phone's camera to have more than enough bells and whistles.  It's not a Nikon or Canon, so I wouldn't rely on it to take photos suitable for framing, but it captures moments very well.  Outdoor photos in daylight are quite good.  Indoor photos are acceptable.  The tiny LED it uses to illuminate the subject is surprisingly bright.Picture Viewer *** The installed viewer for photos displays photos just fine, and the album selector works very well.  The one major disappointment, however, is that you cannot edit photo albums on the phone itself.  The only way to categorize and manipulate photos and albums is on your computer via USB.  This requires some experience with creating folders and moving/copying files, and may be over the heads of some novice computer users.  But, if you know how to use your computer's file explorer, creating photo albums on your phone is easy.  With your phone connected via USB, create a folder anywhere on your phone and move/copy pictures to it.  The phone will automatically find the photos and create an album with the same name as the folder.Music Player **** The installed MP3 player is not the most intuitive to use, but rather easy once you figure it out.  To add music to your phone, connect it to your computer via USB.  Create a folder anywhere on your phone and copy your music to it.  Your phone will automatically find the MP3 files and add them to its master playlist.  To create new a playlist, touch and hold any song, select \"Add To Playlist\" then select \"Create New Playlist\".  A slight problem with the music player is that with louder MP3 files, it might compress (squash) the dynamics, causing the music to \"pump\" like an FM radio station.  This is not something that the average person might hear, but a discerning listener would.Wi-Fi ***** I do not have a data plan with my phone [I know what you're thinking--why on earth did this guy buy a smartphone?] but I occasionally access the internet via Wi-Fi. With this phone, I have no problems connecting with and using the web.  Web pages and text are small, but you can easily zoom in as needed.  The resolution of the display is so fine, if you have good eyesight, you can literally read most full-size web pages without having to zoom.  It's not practical to browse the web on your phone that way, but it shows just how detailed the screen display is.Battery **** My phone spends most of its time on standby, and that seems to go easy on the battery. If you're a casual phone user like me, you probably won't have any issues with battery life, and will charge your battery every few days. If you use the phone a lot for internet, the battery will drain significantly faster, and you will need to charge it nightly.  Either way, I recommend buying a phone charger for your vehicle so that you can charge and use the phone wherever you go.Glitches/Problems ** There are a few problems I've discovered with this phone, and they mostly revolve around touch sensitivity.  Far too often, an icon does not react when touched.1. When you're responding to a text, the keyboard doesn't always want to pop up right away. Sometimes you have to touch the message reply box ten times or more before the keyboard pops up.2. When you enter a phone number, you may need to press the green call icon multiple times before the phone finally places the call.3. If you accidentally enter a wrong numeral when entering a phone number, you may have to touch the backspace key several times before it responds and deletes the wrong numeral.4. If you happen to touch the upper edge of the screen when handling your phone, the display will sometimes suddenly set itself to the darkest setting.  There is hidden display brightness slide control at the top of the screen that you have to be careful of.5. In addition to a full Qwerty keyboard, the text messaging app also has a shift button that allows you to access three pages of characters: standard punctuation, more obscure characters, and smileys.  A minor inconvenience is that the shift button does not always default to the standard punctuation page.  For fast texting, it should.6. When selecting wallpaper, there is no option to select \"none\". So if you want a plain screen, you'll literally need to go into a graphics program, create a blank/solid 480x800 image on your computer, and transfer it to your phone.7. Installed Apps: If you create an event on the calendar, there's no apparent way to edit/delete the event. Also, some apps require you to sign up with Google, and you can't back out of the signup screen; you must press the Home key instead. Google Maps completely froze my phone the other night, and removing the battery was the only way I could turn the phone off.8. The power/standby button is located directly across from the volume buttons, so now and then, you will accidentally adjust the phone's ringer volume when putting your phone on standby or hanging up.In summary, where this smartphone excels with \"smart\", it falls short with \"phone\".  Once the \"cool factor\" wears off, you'll realize this phone is rife with shortcomings in the quality department.  I dropped my land line earlier this year due to a dispute with AT&T;, but, because the voice quality on this phone (and all smartphones in general) is so shoddy, I revived my old Motorola Razr V3 and bought a second mobile phone plan.  I use the Samsung strictly for texting and Wi-Fi, and the Razr for voice calls.I am an audio engineer by trade, so I may be more critical of audio quality than others.  However, I can assure you that if you need a phone that is loud and clear, this is definitely not the phone for you.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sluggish performance, dropped connections, failed texts, unwanted apps", "Author": "Sagebrush Gardener", "ReviewID": "R16L7H8DDS9NGG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros:Cheaper than iPhone.Call quality - not spectacular, but it usually works.Pretty good camera.No contract.

The phone reboots at random.2. The screen often locks up, forcing the user to reboot.3. Very slow internet and facebook with the screen stuck on the \"Loading\" icon for minutes (or forever).

This phone looks and functions like a value version of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone has a solidity and style that belongs in a design museum, the Exhibit II 4G feels more like a beautiful everyday object, one that, when dropped, inspires irritation rather than panic. The two phones are actually very close in terms of general hardware features, notably the mini-tablet shape, size of the screen, image quality, bi-directional camera, and other smaller details. (It is very easy to see why Apple had filed a lawsuit against Samsung for imitation.) The biggest adjustment personally has been switching from the buttery smooth responsiveness of the iPhone touchscreen to the entirely functional, but uninspiring, Exhibit screen. Otherwise,  I am extremely pleased with the range of apps, built-in Swype and voice texting, crystal clear Wi-Fi calling (useful for an occasionally spotty T-Mobile network). Ultimately the decision is whether a great iPhone is worth $60 a month more in subscription fees than a (very) good Exhibit.

Good resolution and great features. However, it does not have one important feature that I thought all new Andorid phones had. That is the ability to move applications to the external SD card. It takes a 32 GB card, which I installed immediately. However, when you move an application to the SD card it moves it to the internal SD partition. I called Samsung as I expected that this was a fault with the phone, but they said that this is designed into all phones that have internal SD partitations, including the Galaxy S and Galaxy IIS. In other words, all of the higher end Samsung Androids have this internal SD (called USB) and all have this problem. And the internal SD on the phone is quite small, only 1.62 GB; and the internal phone memory is only 1 GB. So the only use of the external card is to store MP3 files and you can set the camera to use the external SD card.I tried every way possible to get around this, but to no avail.

I found myself having to tap the screen for any given command more than once very often. Texting was the most annoying issue on this phone. For whatever reason, the bottom most part of the screen was extremely unresponsive all the time and it just so happened to be where the window to add text was. Lastly, 4 days into owning this phone, the earpice stopped working completely. People could hear me speak but I couldn't hear anything when I held the phone to my ear. To be fair, there was one thing I liked about the phone. The screen is impressively crisp. Maybe I just got a bad unit but this phone was a complete disappointment.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "PEOPLE EXPERIENCING TEXTING FAILURES WITH THE PHONE - TMOB ACKNOWLEDGES ISSUE", "Author": "Carrie", "ReviewID": "RWBAKEFZGJV8Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After less than 1 month of using this phone, we experienced texting issues - essentially texts wouldn't send & we'd get a failure message.  A call to T Mobile customer service had us going through all kinds of hoops trying to diagnose the issue & finally the CS just told us to switch our SIM card.  We did & the phone worked well for about 1 week.  We are now back to texting issues & unable to receive/make phone call issues where we have to power down the phone, wait & power it up again.However, upon looking at the message boards on the T Mobile website, I learned that other people have this same issue & T Mobile has acknowledged the issue, but has not resolved it.<<This is a known issue with this device. Putting the phone on GSM only, as mike_s stated, is a workaround. We ask that you please be patient with us as we work with Samsung to come up with a resolution.>>The T Mobile workaround:I have found a few things that can help you text in the meantime.  First, I'd look to uninstall any texting applications that were used during the failures, and if the texts aren't very long, it might help to not allow the phone to switch between 2G/3G networks.  This can be done like this;  1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key.  2. Tap Settings.  3. Tap Wireless and Networks.  4. Tap Mobile Networks.  5. Tap Network mode.  6. Tap GSM Only.  While it isn't ideal to keep your phone on GSM only (as browsing speeds will be slower and you will need to manually change the network back to get faster data speeds) we have found that short texts on GSM only rarely fail.  I hope this temporary workaround finds you well, and know that we will continue to work on this.T-ForcePersonally, I think that patience can only last so long.  Apparently, T Mobile has known about this issue since November but has done nothing to fix it nor have they offered a replacement phone to unsatisfied buyers.We really liked this phone, but it is simply unusable if it doesn't allow a user to text.  From 5 stars to 1 star.3/8/12:  Phone still has texting issues & T-Mobile has done nothing to rectify the issue.  You can never tell if the phone's recipient actually received your text & we are still experiencing bouts of text sending failure.  We are switching to the Lumia 710 & giving up on this phone.  Disappointing.  What a waste of money.ORIGINAL POST (LOVED THE PHONE):We are on a T-Mobile family plan & it was time to bring my spouse into the world of smartphones.  Since he is hard on his phones, I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but wanted him to have access to email, maps & the other benefits that smartphones provide.The Samsung Exhibit II is an impressive little phone.  It is easy to pick up & start using right off the bat.  It has swype capability, voice texting & an easy to use/read calendar (voice capability to add an \"event\").  There are a ton of nice features packed into this phone & it costs less than half of the \"fancier\" smartphones on the market.We purchased a soft silicone case to start Black Soft Silicone Skin Case Cover for Samsung Exhibit 4G T759 & it fits fine; however, when a more durable case comes available, we will probably upgrade.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Android Smart Phone Is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! ! ! ! !", "Author": "Online Junkie", "ReviewID": "R21IQJEMMD36GM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love this phone! There's so many reasons why this is such a great phone, here's a few off the top of my head...1. Low price for an unlocked full featured phone (have to wait 60 days to unlock free)2. Large User base and developer/hacker base. Plenty of Samsung Exhibit II user forums to get most of your newbie questions answered3. Lots of inexpensive accessories/batteries/cases. I paid  $13 for a bundle that included 2 batteries/charger/gel case/screen protector4. Lots of useful info by other owners/users if you read the reviews here5. Great multimedia Android phone. I just finished watching the latest Transformers movie on the phone with Netflix!6. Excellent T-Mobile 4G network7. Excellent, inexpensive prepaid plans. I pay only $30 per month using the Walmart 100 min/unlimited data/text plan8. Turn your phone into a wireless hotspot for only $15/month and run your laptop and up to 5 wifi devices using your phone as a wifi hotspot.9. Use your Gmail and Google Calendar and Google Maps10. Great GPS functions and mapping11. Facebook, Meetup.com, Metro.net etc. most of the websites that I frequent have apps available12. microSDHC slot to add up to 32gb of memory13. Camera, voice/audio recorder14. Free wifi calling using Google Voice and GrooveIP. Takes a little messing around but once you get it, you'll love it and not use up your 100 minutes. Buy the$5.00 full version of GrooveIP and don't bother with the free/crippled version.14. Plenty of hacks to root this phone and get rid of bloatwareI bought this phone from Amazon and use the Walmart/Tmobile $30 prepaid plan giving me unlimited data/texting and 100 minutes of voice calls. But with the FREE WiFi calling (see #14) I use less than 50 minutes a month as I'm always around a wifi network. If I manage to exceed the 100 minutes, I pay 10 cents a minute... big deal... Later this month, I'm gonna try using the phone as a wifi hotspot ($15/mo) and if it works well at home, I'll dump my cable service that I pay $136/month for cable internet and tv!Just re-upped with Netflix for $8/month for unlimited instant videos as they've added a lot of movies to their catalog and don't bother with the mail in DVD's anymore... Although I did just buy a Blu-Ray player... The Netflix movies play great... well, I was using my cable/wifi connection to watch a movie. I haven't tried watching a video on just the 4G connection yet.Oh, I live at the bottom of a canyon in the Hollywood Hills and most of the other service providers I would not get any reception but with T-Mobile I get a solid 3-4 bars!Cons:1. Battery life is not too long if you are a heavy web user. But buy a couple of spare batteries ($7ea) and no problemo...2. Phone is small and slippery standard, so get the gel case and that will fix the problem and protect the phone3. Seems I can't view my Amazon Prime free videos on the phone. But maybe it's possible and I just haven't figured it out yet...Yeah, I'm a huge fan... this is a great deal for the phone and low monthly cost for a prepaid/no contract unlocked phone.UPDATE 9-2013: I suppose I've downloaded too many apps. My web browsing and operation of the phone has slowed considerably. I am now planning to root my phone and remove all apps that are  bloatware and not needed. Thus at this time, I'm down grading this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. This is a single core processor, so my next phone will most likely be a quad core or no less than a dual core processor.

THIS. PHONE. The more I use it the more I like it, and the more I wonder how I ever did w/o a smartphone, even with no actual data plan, i.e. just using wifi. It is an incredible value.I've never had any particular urge to start using a smartphone, mainly because of the exorbitant cost of data plans. My wife has an iphone 4 that has proven to be quite useful, but we never would have purchased it if not heavily subsidized by her employer. The process of purchasing the Exhibit II actually started when I began thinking about a samsung galaxy player to use as a music player and portable game machine. At some point I realized that I could use the phone w/ my T-mobile pay-as-you-go minutes, and that the phone has pretty much all of the other features the galaxy player has, at about the same price. Basically I use the exhibit II as a wifi device plus pay-as-you-go phone, w/o any data plan at all. I had no trouble using the pre-paid sim card that I already had in my bottom-of-the-line dumb phone. The lack of network access aside from wifi isn't really that limiting, given the number of public places w/ free wifi these days, not to mention home and work, where I spend a lot of my time. The T-mobile wifi calling capability is a bonus, since both my home and workplace (I work inside a big metal building) have pretty poor reception from t-mobile's cell network. In case you're wondering, T-mobile wifi calling isn't free, it seems to just get charged as normal voice minutes. Another bonus is being able to use an IM client to send text messages, which saves the cost of SMS messages ($0.10 for both send and receive). The bottom line is that I'm very happy w/ my purchase of the Exhibit II. Here are some random points:Visually I think the Exhibit II is very attractive. Of course this is purely subjective. I read one review that claimed the phone looked \"cheap\" because it had no logo on the front, which I certainly don't agree with. In my opinion the phone has understated styling that I like. It has clean lines and an uncluttered appearance, and subtly curved sides and corners that are nice to look at and feel in the hand and make the phone easy to slip into and out of my pocket. I also like the color scheme, which is deep blue on the bottom and sides, with a polished graphite look on the top. The overall width and height is about the same as the iphone 4, and the exhibit II has a slightly larger screen. Honestly I think the iphone looks kind of clunky next to the exhibit II.I happen to like the standard music player that comes with the phone, but of course if you don't, there are many alternatives on the android market. I had no problem connecting the phone to my computer thru usb and syncing my music library onto the microsdhc card I installed (I purchased an 8GB class 10 card from Microcenter for $9). Of course all the usual games and other apps are available thru the market as well.I've seen a review that complained about the screen brightness in full daylight. I set the brightness at about 30%, at which setting the screen is usable in bright sunlight, but a bit difficult to see w/ the sun reflecting off the surface. I also saw a review criticizing the maximum viewing angle, which I don't understand at all. I have no complaint about this characteristic whatsoever. I can view the screen at sharper angles than I can actually see information on the screen.I haven't really had much chance to use the GPS, but at least in my house, the Exhibit II's GPS locks on more reliably than my Asus Transformer tablet.For me, battery life is more than adequate. I typically play music on the way to and from work (maybe 50 minutes total), keep both the wifi and bluetooth on all day, and run the google talk IM app in the background. My kids have been playing games on it for maybe 1/2 hour per day. I haven't seen the charge go to less than about 40% at the end of the day under these conditions. The charge rate also seems reasonable to me. I charged it from 40% to fully charged in somewhat less than two hours.Of course the phone runs android, which you may or may not like. I happen to like it a lot. I find the iphone interface to be kind of confusing and gimmicky, but I have pretty limited exposure to it, and this opinion is also obviously subjective as well.T-mobile wifi calling is adequate at best, and the cost is the same as voice minutes over the cell network ($0.10/min for pay-as-you-go). I would recommend using an app like Sipdroid (CSipSimple is another) with a pay-as-you-go voip service like callwithus as much as possible. The cost with callwithus is about $0.01/min, in other words 10x less. The setup is simple, connections are reliable (so far), and the call quality in my experience is significantly better than the T-mobile wifi calling. If you're really cheap and a bit ambitious, you can get totally free wifi calls with google voice, but I have not tried that as of yet, and I'm not sure how practical it would be w/ wifi-only use.As I said, I'm very happy with the Exhibit II. If I have one niggling complaint, it's that the charger doesn't have the built-in usb cable that many chargers have, so there is an extra usb cable that needs to be lugged around if you're going to use that connectivity on the run. Other than that, it's really all good and I don't think I could have made a better choice.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the price, excellent phone  *** If you want 5GB Data, read-***", "Author": "DR-J-J", "ReviewID": "R3NE0MPOQF5JH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE AFTER 5 DAYS.  I have to update my rating of this phone to 5 stars.  While it is not a cutting edge $600 (unsubsidized) phone, it is a great phone. Yes, there is some bloatware on it and I really like a larger screen, but it is a solid phone with much to commend it. This is a great little phone. Worthy of 5 stars, even if there are a few annoyances.  Considering the price, and the great promo plan price through T-Mobile (5GB Data, Unlimited Text, and 100 minutes talk is the one I use). More on that below.I say \"little\" because, for me, it is little.  I used to have the HTC EVO with the 4.3 screen.  I was considering going to a Razr with that 4.6 screen... but went with this because I already have a 7 inch tablet... I really don't need a phone almost as big. Still, this has a larger screen than an iPhone. And it is quite capable as an Android phone.Others have excellent reviews of this phone, so I will look at the plan itself:*************************************************************5GB of DATA and Unlimited Text and 100 Minutes of Talk for Thirty Dollars????Since the online world is a buzz about THIS PHONE and specifically about the T-Mobile's 4GMonthly Plan, let me share my experience with getting on this plan when buying through Amazon:First of all, the date is 1-8-2012 and there is a rather extraordinary cell phone plan being offered by T-Mobile and Wally World...buy one of 2 or 3 data smart phones (such as this one) and get a $30 monthly (no contract) plan that includes 5GB internet data (a whole lot, you won't likely run out)at 4G speed, unlimited data at slower speeds after that (if you do run out), unlimited text messaging and video messaging, and 100 minutes of talk time... all for $30 a month. Now, understand, that low talk time is a killer for many users... some are using an application to talk via the data plan for some of their calling to help that. But if you go over the limit, it is only ten cent a minute after that. There you have it; that is the special Wally and TMobile offer as of now. Many of the Wally Mart stores are sold out of these phones and plans for the clamor for it.  But the online community *(and TMobile) was unsure if purchasing this phone from other places would allow someone to get this same deal (instead of exclusively from Wally World). It is to this issue which I now write... if uninterested, skip to the end of review. ***Even though I called before hand to T-mobile to make sure I could get this \"Wally Plan\" (5GB/$30), upon trying to go online and activate I found out that the phones purchased from Amazon did not qualify.  Through very many call backs, I eventually succeeded in getting this plan. However, I discovered afterwards that I didn't need to go through this time and effort.  Rather, if you buy the phone from a place different from Wally World or T-mobile, you can simply call T-Mobile and order a $7 SIM card from them...then you will qualify for this special plan.  Obviously, verify this for yourself first.Of course, you may not even want this plan.  Therefore, judge for yourself what plan you need. The phone (if you understand what you are getting), is a great phone!Gingerbread Android, 3.7\" sharp, clear, multitouch screen, Android App Store, T-Mobile extras, MicoSD card slot, Bluetooth 3.0, 1 GHz processor, Wi-Fi networking plus Wi-Fi Calling capabilities, 3 MP camera/camcorder; video chats via front camera; Bluetooth stereo music; microSD expansion; HTML web browser with Flash 10.1; Charger and Data Cable, Cases available starting at 1Cents on Amazon, High Def 720, Better audio than my EVO, and on and on. Now, if you try to compare this (now) midlin' list of attributes to the Motorola Razr or the Galaxy Nexus, well, you are going to dislike this phone. But, this phone will satisfy those who understand what they are getting... in fact, they may jump for joy that they have a non-contract phone of this quality.***I am thrilled that I have a very nice (even though I would prefer larger screen and an LTE network to run it on) phone and a great \"4G-ish\" data plan at such a price. This phone is very light and the smaller form factor makes it very portable.I have not tried the GrooveIP app yet (to go along with GoogleVoice (aimed at increasing talk minutes by using VOIP calling), I will update if I find a good alternative.  So you know, the Wifi calling feature that comes on the phone works, but also uses your minutes. Just installing Google Voice will use your talk minutes too. Not sure why that is, yet...but will update if I find a workable combination.Good phone made great by virtue of the price/performance metric!And hey!

If you're comming from a better device...", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "RT28GA7VKDK7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This device has replaced a Samsung Intercept that was on Virgin Mobile.  With the exception of a higher monthly cost ($60 vs $25) pretty much everything else has improved.  Speed: The intercept had a Rev 0. EVDO radio and averaged between 150-250k down.  The Exhibit II has a HSPA+ 14.4Mbps radio and usually sees somewhere around 4Mbps.  This is a huge percent improvement and I'm blown away by what I was missing.  HSPA+ bridges the gab between 3G and LTE nicely.  It delivers very fast and useable speed but keeps the device from suffering from the horrible battery life that's inherent to LTE devices.  Battery: I have not done an \"official\" drain test but I've gone 30 hours on several occasions with about 10-15% remaining on moderate usage (well it feels moderate to me but I do a far amount of surfing, 1 hour of Pandora at the gym daily, google maps and the occasional video).  Processor:  I haven't benchmarked it and have no plans too.  Regardless its fairly quick and seems smooth even with several open apps at a time. Occasionally I'll get a little lag but it will be gone in a second or two.  I have read and agree that its due to the bloatware clogging up the RAM.  I'm planning rooting the phone in the next week or two so I can delete the fluff.  People have claimed their devices have shown marked improvement by doing so.  Still, compared to my Intercept this thing is a Ferrari.  If you're stepping up from a sub 1Ghz phone you will be pleased.  Screen: The best way to sum it up is like this, if you're stepping up from something smaller or lower in resolution you'll love it.  If you're stepping down you won't like it.  I'm stepping up from an intercept so the resolution looks 2x better, the touch accuracy improvement is somewhere in that range and the 1/2in size gain is much appreciated as well.  My friends that have 4inch + devices say they'd have a had time giving up the size but appreciate that the resolution is on par.  As for the size, it fits in hand nicely and even my buds have admitted it pockets better.  The only problem is that the backing on the device makes it kind of slippery and it feels it could be prone to dropping.  Camera: Meh. Not much to talk about here.  It has a flash which is a step up for me.  Memory:  I don't mind the storing things on a card so that usually takes care of any storage issues.  I could wish for a little more RAM but T-Mobile/Samsung would probably just fill it up with more bloatware.  I'll fix this with a root (see above).  Network:  I live and work in Chicago and I usually have great coverage/4G anywhere I go with the exception of the L underground (my work AT&T; BB Curve seems to keep its 3G connection but I lose 4G on the Exhibit).  The far suburbs is also sketchy and I sometimes lose 4G.  At $60 a month everything is unlimited except for data which is limited to 2GB at 4G then throttled.  Don't believe the Sprint commericals.  Consider my usage (1 hour of Pandora a day??? and a fair amount of surfing) and I'm only at 350mbs (officially checked on my \"my-tmobile.com\") with two weeks before my month is up.  If I can make this work you can.Overall I'm pleased.  Its a lot of phone of the money ($200 with no contract).  What you're giving up, Dual core, screen size and camera.  My arguments are dual core phones aren't threading (except for games) so you're not getting the \"real\" advantage of the second core anyways.  How many 1GHz + single core phones are out there?  That's right, none. So its basically as good as you can get in the single core market.  The screen size is a toss up.  The resolution is on par with say a 1st gen EVO so no complaints there.  Its the size that you have to think about.  3.7 makes it really easy to manipulate with one hand and it pockets nicely.  But, you're giving up about another half inch.  You gotta figure this one out for yourself.  As for the camera....its ok.  It could be 5 megapixel but what are you going to do?  What you are getting is SPEED!  If you're moving from any other pre-paid carrier you'll ask yourself how you lived without 4G.  No one comes close, period.

So very tempted to root this phone.For those of you who are frustrated with this phone, give it a few weeks for the system to learn your habits. The first few days I had this phone, I was a little frustrated that the battery life sucked and it had various lagging issues. But as time went on, it got better with how it ran and the battery life improved quite a bit. It would be even BETTER once rooted.So the only downfall to this phone is its bloatware. It's not right to have admin rights restricted to the point where the user cannot get rid of what's lagging the phone. The manufacturers make these phones with certain specs- specs which are minimized due to the bloatware installed on these phones that make them perform at a subpar level.I only hesitate rooting because of warranty reasons. Murphy's Law, you know?But that's probably my only gripe about this phone. It causes it to lag and I'm oh so close to rooting it.Other than that, the pricing was great and to have a phone with Android interface? Awesome. I love that I can sync it to my tablet and my calendars can be updated with all my various scheduling things, regardless of where I edit it (phone or tablet). It's nice to finally have the apps that I had on my tablet, on my phone, which is on the go with me more often. Navigation, email, social networking, etc. All those fun bells and whistles that come with a smart phone. I also love having the capability to turn on wifi, which helps reserve 4G data so I don't go over the 2gb cap that I have.To top it off, I bought this phone in order to get a Value Plan at T-Mobile (inexpensive plans, but you have to buy your own phone). If you're wondering if that's doable, it IS. Less than 60 a month and I get all the services needed for a smart phone, plus insurance, plus MORE minutes than my previous plan, which works great for me. It actually comes out to a little less than what I was paying before for non smart phone internet.If anyone wants an entry level Android phone on a budget, this is the way to go. It has all the same bells and whistles as the 500-600 dollar phones (ex: Like the Galaxy S II) because they're all running the same UI. Just be patient and understand why this phone can be prone to lagging. The phone itself is awesome, it's just the junk that T-Mobile installs on the phone that makes it lag.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Ms. T", "ReviewID": "R2AJ98HLUJADL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is replacing an LG Optimus T that I accidentally bricked while trying to root it in order to gain more space - and man oh man am i glad I did brick the optimus T - I thought the old phone was pretty good, but this one just blows me away.  To my mind, it looks and runs as good or better than the first gen Galaxy S (and it should, because they have similar specs).  The only thing I would change, I wish the camera was 5 or 8 megapixels instead of just 3.  Everything else about this phone is fantastic - it looks like a high end phone (from the front at least, the back does look kinda cheesy but I don't let it bother me, I'll just put a case on it), even tho it's just a mid-range phone.  Value here is excellent bang for your buck - for cellphones, anyway, they are really all overpriced.  Music playing from this phone is awesome and videos are incredibly crisp and fast to load.  And I don't really notice that this is single core processor instead of the new high end dual core processor on the Galaxy S II.  Overall, for anyone stuck on a contract wanting a reasonably priced new phone or any prepaid users that want a good android phone, this is a great option and you really can't go wrong.  Best improvement on this in my mind is the incredible amount of storage for apps - I can't see it ever filling up no matter how many apps I put on it.

I never experience lag or freezes, the GPS works flawless and fast. Honestly, I switch between 10 different apps in a matter of minutes and the phone never slows down. It runs extremely fast!

After calling T-Mobile for some simple info they informed me of a promo they had which included a $50 \"refill\" card with purchase of this phone. The phone was $197 shipped and I used $30 of the $50 card for my first month of service on the $30 Monthly 4g Plan. It includes 100 talk mins and unlimited text and data up to 5gb. I will apply the leftover $20 on the card to next month. So thats like two months of service for $10! If you want more then 100 talk mins a month on the $30 plan the phone informs me it is .10 (ten cents) a minute thereafter. So if you need more minutes don't run out and buy a too expensive refill card from a store or T-Mobile. Check into the .10 a minute first as the phone itself states and offers.The phone is fast and smooth. Been using it a week or so and have had no trouble. It's my first smartphone so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can't imagine a phone in this price range doing much more. It does it all, and then some. I am not a heavy user but the web works well, youtube, simple games like Angry Birds and Bejeweled all fly fast and seamlessly. Voice quality is good, speaker phone loud, and the screen is relatively hi-res, colorful, sharp, and clear. The camera both front and rear facing is about what I would expect from a camera phone of old. It's ok and gets the job done in a basic way.The phone feels good in hand. I was a bit disappointed that the \"blue\" backing is actually very dark. Its not BLUE like some photos make it appear, but rather very dark blue. Almost black imo. Like a blue / black. So it looks a bit dull, but thats ok. It's a phone, after all. And it is well built, sleek, lightweight, and fits well in hand and pocket alike. So I have no real aesthetic complaints.I have had no problem with \"bloatware\" and am not a multi tasker. So the phone just works nice and smooth. No lock ups, lag, or otherwise. Calls stay connected, and the 4G as well. Please update the software / firmware to Android 2.3.6 as this addresses some stability and battery life issues with THIS phone, as well as including a few other fixes for this model released by T-Mobile.

Apparently a percentage of them are faulty.  If you can, try to read the Tmobile website forums.  Tmobile employees admit there are 'known issues' with this device but refuse to fix them.  The most common problems that users are experiencing include DAILY FREEZING, PHONE POWERING OFF AND ON BY ITSELF, SMS FAILURES ON 4G REQUIRING USERS TO SWITCH THEIR PHONES TO 2G TO SEND A SIMPLE TEXT MESSAGE, POWER CYCLING.Cant say why this is only happening to some users and not others but again TMOBILE ADMITS THESE PROBLEMS BUT DESPITE PROMISE AFTER PROMISE, THEY HAVE NOT FIXED ANY OF THEM...THERE HASNT EVEN BEEN A SINGLE SOFTWARE UPDATE SINCE THE DEVICES RELEASE IN NOVEMBER 2011.

There is a reason that Tmobile has come in dead last in terms of customer service among the major cell phone providers.  Also note that if you're using this on Prepaid, It is considered a separate company from Tmobile so you will have to port your number if you're already a Tmobile customer and you will also now get outsourced (mainly Phillipines but sometimes Mexico) customer service, which is much worse than the regular CS...Many of the reps have trouble with English and will constantly give you inaccurate information - so another warning...dont take anything they tell you as Gospel...get everything in writing.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best prepaid deal for 4g, but phone is not that great", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "RA749LKQRHPI6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "you don't need to sign a contract to get it.  4G phones are still the newest and most expensive.

This phone and $30/100 min TMobile plan seemed to fit the bill for me at the right price.  I had some apprehension about whether I'd be able to utilize this plan with this phone (didn't get it at Walmart, etc.) but I had exactly zero issues signing up for this plan online.  It took me about 4 mins between opening the TMobile website and having an active phone in my hand, and I have been happily surfing and downloading ever since.  After reading the various reviews, my other main concern was about battery life.  So far I have experienced about a 30% discharge per day with modest usage (download a few apps, some Pandora, a phone call or two, browse a few web pages), so by that measure a single charge should last me about 3 days or so.  Presumably longer if it was just on standby most of the time.  A friend of mine wth an iPhone says he has to recharge his about every three days so my experience seems typical, and quite satisfactory to me.  I am careful to turn off the GPS and the BlueTooth unless I'm specifically using them, but otherwise I don't feel like I have to be constantly watching the battery and husbanding my usage for fear of running out.  I just sequestered all the bloatware on the home pages in a folder and haven't felt the need to try rooting the thing to get rid of this stuff, as it doesn't seem to be shortening the battery life or anything.I have experienced a noticeable reduction in voice quality with this phone/plan vs. what I had with USCellular, but I don't know if it's just differences in coverage or what.  The voice quality is acceptable, not great, which is why I'm not giving 5 stars.

I am a T-Mobile Prepaid Customer and all what I had to do is slip in my Old Sim Card, start the phone and that is it. After that, I did a root to the phone that took me five minutes and deleted all unwanted apps and that freed much more space.I have to say that one is hardley enough time to say if this is a good or bad phone but for the price and considering what this phone has to offer, I have to say so far its working just fine.Here are few things I have noticed about this phone:1- The phone works pretty good so far, the second day when I turned on the WiFi for unknow reason it was slow to scroll from one screen and app to another, had to reboot and since then did not have that problem again. This phone is very light and cheaply made for sure, so I drop it I am sure it will shatter into pieces. Just have to be careful and find a nice case for it, if that will help.2- The first thing I tested was the 4G speed. I got a reading of 4.5 mg on the download and 2.3 on the Upload. Using the WiFi speed on the Verizon fios network was 19.68mbps download and 16 mbps upload and that clocked the phone to its max of 20. Opening web pages was fast in both tests. Remember if you do not have the 4G plan with T-Mobile then you are receiving EDGE or 2G service which is really slow and frustrating.3- The Swipe works good and so does voice to text. Some people complained about the keypad being small for texting, I really love the kepyad and how responsive and fast typing is on this phone.  Tested the GPS and it works as a charm. Scrolling between screens is fast, opening apps is fast too. You can organize your screens the way you like.4- The Camera works just fine, its not great but its not bad either.5- Battery is terrible, does not last for more than a day with normal and minimum usage. I have charger in my car and my office to keep it fully charged all the time.The bottom line is, for the price, no contract, this is so far a good phone and it does anything else that another smart phone can do. I owned a Samsung Galaxy S that I returned back because I just did not want to sign a contract, and this exibit just as good.The only way to find out about this phone is to buy it and try it out yourself, you can only decide if it is for you or not. AMAZON has a nice policy when you can return it within 30 days, walmart has a 15 days return policy...I think mine is for keeps...keep my fingers crossed.BATTERY PROBLEM: Anyone experiencing a problem with batter draining fast?

This is not to put the phone down, because obviously I am giving it 5 stars when considering the \"bang for your buck\" factor. It is to give a more realistic assessment of the performance regardless of the price.The main issue is that the phone can get quite laggy. Switching screens can take up to a few seconds sometimes. I have tried different launchers besides the Samsung one and they all have this issue. I often manually clear the memory, and this seems to help. However, often I actually have to restart the phone. Note that these issues can arise even when I am using just standard applications like messaging and the contact list. This does not seem to be an issue with the higher end phones, for instance my brother's Galaxy SII.The battery life is not very good. I have to charge at least once per day, most of the times even more frequently. Some of the more advanced features are particularly battery draining. This includes GPS, Wifi, and video calling (using skype). Especially GPS takes a lot of energy and the phone gets very hot after some time. I definitely recommend buying a car charger if you will be using this feature frequently and make sure to turn off GPS when you are done.The wifi connection gets dropped periodically. I used my laptop on the same network and have no problems, so I believe that it is a problem with the phone and not the network. It usually reconnect right away so it is not such a big issue. However, if you are wifi calling (as I have to do since my office gets bad reception), your call will be dropped.The bloatware is annoying. However, I was able to root the phone and remove unwanted programs without any major issues using just basic computer skills. A good thing about this phone is that even though rooting technically voids the warranty, it is cheap enough to take that risk.The power button is right across the volume buttons. When I touch the power button (which is often since it unsleeps the phone), there is a good chance that I will also inadvertently press the volume button. Not a huge issue, but a little annoying.But all in all, I am very happy and glad that I saved a lot of money for a decent phone without contract.Edit:Another minor issue is that certain portions at the fringes of the screen are not so sensitive to the touch. For texting, sometimes I have to press the screen several times to get the keyboard to come up. Again, not a major problem but it can get annoying.

One tweak is turning off the screen animation to get better response. Soft video decoding is also poor and frame-skipping happens quite often even when the bitrate is less than 500kbps.2. Battery. With 4G data and background synchronizing only (Wifi, BT, GPS all off), the battery can last about 30 hours in idle. In daily use you may have to charge it every night.Overall:Based on its performance/price, it definitely should be considered as a top prepaid phone with a perfectly matched plan.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone, especially if you've been holding back on buying a smart phone", "Author": "C.

I simply could not justify the expense of phone and data before. I think this phone is great value for $200. It has almost every feature I want. The only thing I would have really liked would be a 5mp camera like on the Galaxy S. I handled a Galaxy S and was considering buying a refurbished one of those for $150 more before deciding on the Exhibit II. I don't regret saving the money. Unless you've had a higher quality phone before, or you're comparing this side-by-side with something higher end, you won't feel limited or cheated by this phone. It's got a very crisp vibrant display, runs quick and smooth, and even with the 3.2mp camera I've taken some decent photos. Sure beats my previous phone anyway. Battery easily lasts me from 6am to late in the night. I haven't had it actually die on me yet. I don't know how my usage might compare to others, but I use Facebook and email frequently throughout the day, have tried out the GPS navigation a couple of times, used Google Music, surfed a bit of news, and played Words With Friends. The display is the biggest battery drain I think, so I keep that down pretty low all the time. I don't do much talking, hence getting the plan with only 100 minutes, so I can't say how much battery is affected by talk time.Only a couple of gripes... As others have mentioned, the beep when the battery is charged is annoying. I charge my phone by my bed at night and I still want to be able to receive emergency calls and texts so I'm not going to put it on silent in order to avoid that beep. But it does wake me up.  Still, I can live with it.Sometimes texts fail to send and I've seen other people in forums with this problem too. Also the texting app is glitchy and doesn't always respond to your taps in the text area to bring up the keyboard.Yes, the back cover is as slippery as everyone else says. I bought the gel skin case for the Galaxy W (same phone as the Exhibit II, just rebranded outside the US) and I'm so glad I did. I would certainly have dropped the phone repeatedly by now if I didn't have the skin.Overall, I highly recommend this phone.

I'll just tell you a few of the wonderful things this phone has: we were lost in Fernandina Beach on Saturday and I tapped the microphone and spoke the address of our destination into google (right on the home screen). The phone gave us a map and directions and we arrived with no issues. I didn't even have to go to the GPS or anything, it was smooth and flawless. I also love the swype texting and the fact that I can have a mobile hot spot anywhere I am without having to root the phone, it comes pre-installed!The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of two issues I'm having (and I am willing to admit that they may be inexperienced-user caused):- when I tap the window to respond to a text message, the phone frequently does not respond, I move my finger left to right, right to left, double tap... etc, at some point the keyboard comes up, but it is annoying.- my google voice and groove ip calls don't relly go through. I am able to call or to receive calls but, there is dead silence on both ends.If anybody has any suggestions on this please let me know. Also want to ask what kind of screen protectors or cases have you tried and liked?  I bought the \"extreme\" but didn't like how hard they were  to apply.Thanks for any input you can give me.Edit May 12, 2012Well I've now had the phone for 6 months. I've read most of the frustrating as well as the happy reviews, and I will give you my current day appraisal. I still think that for under $200 this is the best deal out there. I tried the $30 100 mins/5 GB plan from Tmobile for a couple of months, but got very frustrated with trying to get free minutes with Skype, google voice (groove ip) and vonage, for me there was never a good enough connection so the plan flopped due to lack of minutes. I have moved my service over to Straight Talk, where for $45 you get unlimited voice, text, and approx 2 GB of web access, which is more than enough as long as you're not trying to run your laptop through your phone.  i downloaded go SMS pro to use instead of the native texting app, as I was also having the failed text problems.  i always make sure my screen is clean, it easily becomes unresponsive when there's dust, sweat or greasy fingertip marks on it, as far as the screen loosing the brightness, I realized that when I inadvertently swipe my finger from left to right (or viceversa) on the very top panel (where the notifications and battery/time icons are) I actually can dim or brighten up the display. There is also a setting you can change where the display automatically dims down when you reach a certain level of battery life... You can change this to your own liking under settings/power saving mode. For a while I was having an issue with the phone vibrating nonstop until I would have to take the battery out. This all stopped when I was not constantly connected to wifi.  All and all I feel satisfied with this phone. Would I like a galaxy S2? Sure I would.... Would I be willing to pay $600 out of pocket or sign a 2 yr agreement in order to end up paying about $1300 for that phone ( if you do the math, over a 24 month period, if you're giving Tmobile $80 or 90 per month instead of the $45 I'm payin to straight talk)???

Coleman \"FulciLives\"", "ReviewID": "R181NY4VQA3EQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far I really like this phone. It is my second Android phone and a huge upgrade from my previous phone. I went with the T-Mobile $60 a month plan. Basically you get unlimited minutes and texting and 2GB up to 4G speeds (after which it drops down to Edge but I haven't gone over my limit yet).I am finding a couple of things out about T-Mobile's \"No Contract\" plan(s) that I don't like. Well really it is only one issue. That issue is Voice Mail. T-Mobile does NOT allow any sort of call forwarding on their \"No Contract\" plans. As a result it is impossible to set up Google Voice for Voice Mail. With my other Android phone I was able to set up Google Voice so that it would be my Voice Mail for people calling my regular phone number. This is NOT possible with T-Mobile due to their no call forwarding feature on \"No Contract\" phones. It really stinks!Also the phone comes with a pre-installed app called T-Mobile Visual Voicemail. I don't know much about it other than I believe it gives some of the features of Google Voice (like text transcription of the Voice Mail message). However it doesn't work. I called T-Mobile about it and you guessed it ... the Visual Voicemail app doesn't work when you are on their \"No Contract\" plan.Like WTF !!!Not very happy about that but yes the usual T-Mobile Voice Mail works but I don't want that ... I want Google Voice. However it doesn't work (as it should) due to the restriction of the call forwarding thing. That alone is bad enough but the fact that T-Mobile's own pre-installed Visual Voicemail app doesn't work (because of the \"No Contract\" plan) is just plain dumb. I don't understand why T-Mobile is being such jerks about all this.I really wish T-Mobile would fix all this as it is a thorn in my side.Other than this issue though the phone is great but consider this: You can get this phone REALLY cheap if you sign up for a (I believe 2-year) contract. Doing so will allow call forwarding so things like Google Voice will work. Also T-Mobile's own Visual Voicemail app will work.I got this phone because I don't mind paying more up front to have no contract. Money is tight for me now and I never know from one month to the next what may come and at least this way I know I'm not tied into something. Obviously I plan on keeping it going from month to month but who knows what the future will bring. Anyway the point is this: I do not appreciate being some bastard step child to T-Mobile who refuses to give me basic services just because I'm on a \"No Contract\" plan. I paid almost $200 for this phone and I paid for the $60 monthly plan. I should not be restricted. And yes I asked and no you cannot pay extra to get call forwarding and they don't care when you tell them that there is no sense in having an Android phone that can't use one of Google's main services.It is a really bizarre situation.P.S.My last phone allowed call forwarding and thus could use Google Voice for Voice Mail and yet it was with cricKet which is a \"No Contract\" budget carrier. So they can do it but T-Mobile cannot? I really feel cheated on this issue.

I just followed the instructions mentioned in the starter kit and chose this plan on the site. And yes, I bought the phone from Amazon.I have used iPhone 3G in the past, and this one definitely outsmarts the iPhone 3G for sure. I haven't checked out on iPhone4 as yet. But who needs an iPhone4 when most of the features come at one forth of the cost. And, without any contract!The phone is pretty zippy even with a 1Ghz  single core processor... definitely not as zippy as Galaxy S2 Skyrocket which runs on a dual-core 1.5 Ghz. Having said that, I am only comparing. The phone is quite fast really!Gingerbread 2.3.5 is simply amazing! There are virtually unlimited Apps available. Samsung TouchWiz UI is very good and intuitive. I love the swipe left/right for message/call feature. Very basic, but so useful!As mentioned by other reviewers, there is quite some bloatware pre-installed on the phone, that one cannot remove (as of now). But, it is definitely not a factor to reject the phone. Some people might just find these useful as well.I haven't connected the phone to my PC as yet and shall update a line or two on the same in some days.I have ordered 32 Gigs of micro sd and will let know how it goes. Per some other reviews, it worked out well.I had charged the battery to full last afternoon and have been doing quite a lot of wi-fi, downloads et all, and yet it has about 28% left. This is where the Exhibit II beats the Skyrocket hands down. The Skyrocket is a battery-drainer, of course due to its larger screen and bigger processor.I am glad that I bought this phone over Galaxy S2, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who does not need a super computer on-the-go and wants to have a decent smartphone with no contract.More updates soon!Update 1 (01/28): Exactly a month's usage, and I am more than happy to have bought this phone. It doubles up as a very decent music player with 32 gigs memory. I would suggest downloading PowerAMP and good in-ear head-phones (J5 JBuds from JLabs is what I use.. they 're neat).On the down side, at times the phone is a bit sluggish when unlocking the phone with pass code. Not that bad since its not that frequent. Also, I don't really use Kies Air to manage and transfer music. I find it ok to use, but am more comfortable just dragging and dropping music folders onto the phone.I have installed quite a number of Apps and all of them have worked excellently on the phone.The voice quality is good, the 4G coverage is very good, at the least in my neighborhood and my work place. Since I have the $30 unlimited data package with first 5GB at 4G, I never really use wi-fi. I guess it improves the battery performance further. I have disabled the 'Background Data' in accounts and sync under settings. I check my emails manually when needed.All in all, I am quite happy with my purchase so far, and I expect it to service me for about 18 months to 2 years at the least.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "It does the job", "Author": "Brindin", "ReviewID": "R3N2INPG44QACG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a low end smart phone.

Be warned though the flash is VERY bright.....its far too bright for normal use (its great using the Flashlight app though). This phone can handle all the tasks of the big boys at a fraction of the overall running costs. I would recommend an antiglare screen protector and a case for the phone though.

The representative was very nice and helpful and assured me that the plan had been added and the minutes credited as desired.

It's very affordable and the best part is the fact that it does not require an annual contract. What more could you ask for? Again, it's still almost too good to be true.

As for the phone it just works.  It handles the newest apps and games without any issue. Some may wish for a \"vanilla\" android experience but after using a phone like that i find Samsungs Touchwiz interface a nice improvement.  I could re hash all the good stuff about this phone but for that you can read the other reviews.  As for issues, which i may be alone on.  I find the internal memory partitioning to be confusing at best.  Theres a main system partition of 1 gig then a second 2 gig partion called usb memory. Thats all well and good but most apps that dont have custom save settings dont have a selection for it.  I use an external memory card but this space seems a little odd.  It seems like they wanted to give you some protected memory for music i guess its kind of odd. please comment if you know whats up with it.  On to other things.The phone is as slippery as everyone says and with curved edges i never take it out without a death grip on it.  Its more than just slick plastic. that textured back is like wrapping a hockey puck in nylon, and the phone is very light.The antennas seem to be in the base of the phone.  i can sit in my living room and hold the top of the phone and get 4 bars on a 4g tower.  Then hold around the bottome it will drop to the point that it switches to edge.  Outside this is not an issue so no worries, its just a little odd.And last up the network.Tmobile is pretty solid where i live which is funny because they dont even have phone numbers around here.

Like an Accord.Love the price. Not free like a contract phone, but not a mortgage payment for a well appointed unlocked Android phone, either. My plan is T-Mobile for 30 bucks a month, unlimited text and internet/data, with 100 voice minutes.Pros:1) Android - Gingerbread (2.3) runs every app I've downloaded2) Processor - 1GHz is very quick and does not lag (haven't played any intense games)3) Screen - 800x480 pixels of crisp, bright display (used it outdoors at the Ryder Cup)4) Touchscreen - works extremely well, even with a screen protector5) Micro-sd slot - a 32GB Class 10 card is cheap on Amazon6) Excellent battery life - went for 3 days with occasional use (mostly wifi, not cellular network)7) Camera quality is very good for 3.2MP (it has a flash, too)8) Front and rear cameras (this was a deal-breaker for other phone with only 1 camera)9) Sound quality is excellent with handset and with earphones10) 4G - fairly fast data over cellular networkCons:1) Not Android 4.0/4.1 (I can live with it coming from a non-Android phone)2) Not a dual processor (haven't needed one yet, I'll take the battery life of a single processor)3) Prefer a slider keypad over the touchscreen, but there were no similar phones with sliders available4) Not scratch-resistant glass (screen protector highly recommended)5) No NFCThe Galaxy S3 is a head-turner and a status symbol. And you pay big-time for it. It gulps power, but extra batteries are peanuts. If I lived on my phone, I would own an S3 with an unlimited voice/data plan.The Galaxy Exhibit II 4G simply works well, looks nice, and saves you money you can use for other pursuits (like concerts, restaurants, a  Galaxy tablet, etc.). For the person who wants to be a bit off the bleeding edge and pay as little as possible for unlimited internet access and texting, the Samsung Galaxy Exhibit II 4G is a remarkable device.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall Great Smartphone", "Author": "Matty Gritt", "ReviewID": "R3PA1WWRHL4W5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "T-Mobile has brought a great and powerful smartphone to the hands of no-contract customers. The Samsung Exhibit II is a fast and responsive phone with a Snapdragon processor which helps decode and watch HD videos. The phone also contains Android's Gingerbread OS which is fairly recent and can run almost all of the Apps in the Google Play Market. I purchased the phone to replace an old T-Mobile phone I bought about 4 years ago and this was my first smartphone. However, for playing games, listening to music, talking, and texting, and of course surfing the web, it is a great phone! Of course there are cons that I wish would have been addressed. The 3 mega-pixel camera is nice, but for the phone's pricetag (cheap compared to others, but still a big $200), one would wish that it could be upgraded to a 5. Also the lack of 720p video recording is a bummer, the max quality of video for the Exhibit II is 640x360. Which still isn't bad I shoot lots of video and the playback and capture is nice. Photos taken are also crisp and the colors come out well. The front facing camera is a VGA camera, meaning the camera will capture a 640x480 image (About the equivalent of a .3 Megapixel Camera) so don't expect the kind of quality of a iPhone 4S front-facing camera.Another problem that you will face rarely, but trust me, you will face it. Is the problem with the phone lagging through homescreen transitions and sometimes the phone will freeze up forcing you to reboot. After that the phone will work fine and is quickly running smoothly again. And finally the only other complaint I have had with my Exhibit II is the amount of apps that come preinstalled on the phone, also known as \"bloatware\". These apps cannot be uninstalled from the phone and take up RAM that the phone could use for other things (RAM is basically how the phone handles apps and things, the more RAM taken up, the more sluggish your phone acts). The bloatware is the only reason why the phone gets a 4/5 and not a 5 star rating.Aside from those couple of problems the phone is great. Keep this in mind that practically all phones you research and purchase will have faults and things you don't like. And this phone has very few.

It is ridiculously underpowered and takes FOREVER to do the simplest tasks. Even answering a call can be frustrating! The touchscreen is SLOW to react nearly every time I need to use it. The only thing keeping me from tossing it out the window when it upsets me is that I have a 32gb sd card in the thing that I would like to keep. I think it ran half decent before the android system updated to the latest version. Ever since then things got REALLY slow. Kind of like running windows 7 on a 486 processor or something. It's reallly, really, REALLY slow. I had to turn of the security swipe feature because the thing lags so much that you cant complete the swipe properly. I hardly have any apps installed on this thing and it still crawls along at a snails pace. Even swiping from page to page of your homescreen is an exercise in frustration. The icons have to \"load up\" every single time you page. It's just awful. Really. I have a Galaxy 2 sitting here on my desk still in the box waiting for me to open it. I can't wait to be rid of this garbage.Old Review from 01/2012 followsComing from Apple, getting used to the Android system took a few days. Everything is kinda all over the place and the 40 or so unnecessary installed apps that come with the phone make it even more confusing for a first timer. (most of those apps are dumb and should be removed to free up memory) If you are used to the simplistic and organized way Iphone works with Itunes, this is a bit challenging at first. There is nothing clearly pointing out WHY you had to create a google account upon booting up the phone for the first time. (you are essentially creating your Android log in and password) There is no onscreen guide explaining Android Market and how this is your key to apps, games, music, video, etc.Eventually you figure it out, and once you do you start learning that there is far more integration and customization possibilities with the Android system over Itunes. Not knocking Itunes, I still use my Ipod Touch everyday and there is much comfort when I go back to that interface. It's just cleaner and more inviting.The phone is very capable and gets a great 4G signal all around my area. The phone has a wi-fi calling capability that automatically turns on when you are in a known wifi hotspot. My home network is on a powerful Cisco Dual-band router set up as two separate channels(2.4 ghz G and 5 ghz N). Even with a very strong signal strength, the call quality is bad over my wifi. People tell me my voice breaks up. I have since switched off wi-fi calling and it's much better. It must be also noted here that the phone does not find wifi N signals in the 5 ghz range even though the phone is wifi N capable. I have learned that this is common. Apparently there are many devices out there that claim to be wireless N devices but only operate at the 2.4ghz range. Kinda dumb since if you have a wifi N router, you are encouraged to set it up at 5ghz. My Xbox finds 5ghz and connects great, but my Playstation 3 cant find the signal so I have to use G. Same with this phone.The phone runs pretty good most of the time, but it has moments of lag, where it seems to be thinking. Usually this is right after closing an app or entering the home screen from the lock screen. Apps seem to run smoothly and the phone apparently runs 3d game apps better than many more expensive phones according to a benchmark article I read.The screen is a nice size, about .25\" larger than my 3G Ipod Touch. It's also very crisp and clear. The touch sensitivity seems very accurate, on par with the Iphone, but it just doesn't feel as nice on your fingers as the nice Iphone glass screen.Now to the biggest problem with this phone... the battery. This phone literally takes over 3 hours to charge from about 15% capacity with the power off. With the power on it takes over 4 hours. After charging to 100% you get about 3 hours of heavy use out of it tops. If you do some texting, take a couple calls, play a few games and check your email I guarantee the battery dips below 50%. So for a 4hr standby charge you get about 3 hours of heavy use. (with the GPS on you will be lucky to get 2 hours) That is just terrible. I don't get it. Lithium Ion batteries are known to charge quickly and give long usage. This phone's battery is quite the opposite. It is equally slow at recharging on an ac charger or a car charger. Maybe the charger itself is terrible? If it charged faster I wouldn't be so miffed about the short usage time. But this phone spends more time on the charger than it does in my pocket.My Ipod Touch (Lithium Ion Battery)can recharge fully in about 30 minutes from a completely depleted state. From a full charge I can use it heavily for 5-6 hours before I even get a low battery warning. Much better usage to recharge ratio.Fortunately there are other (upgrade) lithium Ion batteries available for this phone but they are expensive. ($40-$50) I have not tried one yet but I probably will. I will update my review at that time and let you know how well that works.So, the phone gets 4 stars, because its a great phone for the money. But the battery is terrible.

I'm writing how to activate the plan as some people had trouble with that apparentlyThe activation of the 30$ plan is straightforward (if you are a new customer, I don't care to get a new phone number but apparently people have trouble to switch their old number to this plan. It is aimed to attract new customers...) just go there[...]and enter your informations and the activation informations (activation card on the document inside the box + info at the bottom of the box or check the sim card and the phone battery). Just follow the instructions (pay 30$, etc)For the phone activation, I had more trouble. After your plan is activated (and paid) you will get an email. Use the information on the mail to activate your phone. There are probably several ways to do it (call T-mobile ?). For me, I went there[...]and followed a step by step process (add an info written on the email they just send you, click continue, enter info on the next box)When you are done, your phone is activated BUT will do nothing useful until you reboot (took me forever to find out...)About the phone, I was using a prepaid blackberry plan and the T-mobile 4G makes a huge difference (I don't live in a big city, got one or two bars usually). When I drop on edge, it is like my old blackberry.It is extremely slippery, I just bought a protective skin to get a better grasp. I would not recommend to use it without protection as it will probably fall from your hands at some point. The touch screen is an interesting experience for a blackberry user. I am using it on the side to get a bigger keyboard. Overall, I would say for a new user like me, the screen reacts as expected 80-90% of the time (other time, you mispell, click the wrong link, etc)The number of apps is amazing and a decent number can probably be downloaded on the device without a memory card. I just ordered a memory card but it is because I am planning to use it as an mp3 player and store music on it (sound quality sounds good to me).I had no memory left after getting facebook and google map on my blackberry so I could not use it to do a lot of things. I am just scratching the surface but I believe I will have a much better experience and flexibility with this device.Battery life does not look really high using the default settings. It is one day max for me just discovering what the device can do. It can probably be improved by tuning the settings or by downloading the good app. It is approximatively what I had with my blackberry (and I was using it less often).Overall a really good experience. It is cheaper and better than what I was paying for. I rate it 4 stars because I've no idea how durable the device is. I would go 4.5 stars if it was possible. If it lasts more than one year, what I save every month with this new plan will have paid for the phone and it will deserve much more than 5 stars.EDIT: apparently I cannot write links on the review... The first one would be the one you would get typing on google something like T-mobile + activation. The second one is the link written on the activation card (among the 3 ways to activate the phone).", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone - shame about the bloatware", "Author": "N.

It goes without saying that it was a massive step up, and it was well worth the 200$.Overall look and feel: Many people have said that the phone feels cheap, but in my opinion everything feels tight and weighs what you'd expect a good average phone to weigh. I haven't felt it as being \"cheap\" at all. It looks gorgeous, especially for a pay as you go phone.Screen: The screen is beautiful. Fantastic colors and great response / PPI density. Also very responsive EXCEPT for the messaging app. The text input box shows up at the bottom of your screen but you have to stab at it repeatedly for it to register. This doesn't appear to be a screen problem so much as the app.Performance: This phone can run more demanding games such as Shadowgunners without much lag, but it does suffer some framerate issues when a lot happens on screen. Expect it to be able to handle most things you throw at it, but not everything.Apps: This is the phone's downfall. It came with Bejeweled and Tetris, which I thought was awesome until I discovered that they were demo versions. No big deal, right? I took advantage of a sale to get the full versions of both games, only to find that they had installed alongside the demo versions. Now I have two copies of each game sitting on my phone and I can NOT uninstall the ones that came pre-installed. This also goes for other apps such as their \"welcome to your phone\" app, the T-mobile app store (which just links you to the regular app store, so... why?), their awful social messaging tool (supposedly does facebook, twitter, etc, but does not have a widget or good refresh rates), TWO different e-reader apps (again... WHY?!), the More for Me app (which just advertises to you), the T-mobile TV app (which you have to pay to use), TeleNav (don't need that if you have google GPS, which also comes free on all android phones).Conclusion: This really is a fantastic phone for the price. I can't praise it's performance highly enough, but I also can't stop condemning the crappy pre-installed, uninstallable apps that they load onto it.

Samsung Exhibit II 4g specs has FM radio hardware built-in, but FM radio is removed from t-mobile version by t-mobile request in order to suck your 4G data limit.3) It is T-mobile! It has preinstalled Carrier IQ, which is keystroke logging and location tracking software, which can intercept text messages. Even information that should be transferred only within encrypted sessions is captured in plain text by Carrier IQ. Worse Carrier IQ is integrated with task manager and cannot be easily uninstalled (I have not found uninstallation way yet).4) It is T-mobile! Besides Carrier IQ phone has a lot of preinstalled crapware. LG Optimus V from Virgin Mobile is practically clean compared with Samsung Exhibit II 4G.5) It is T-mobile! Phone has calling over IP using your wi-fi network, but T-mobile will rip off your monthly minutes or charge you 10 cents a minute over 100 minutes for using call over your wi-fi. To avoid it you need to use Skype or Google talk (GrooVe IP) over wi-fi or 4G. 5GB limit is sufficient, but you need to spend your time again to configure GrooVe IP.Bottom line.Phone is good, but avoid T-mobile and Samsung (Samsung preinstalled Carrier IQ on many phones), I suggest to chose Virgin Mobile and LG unless you really need 4G speed and do not care about your privacy. They have LG Optimus V really cheap. Alternatively you can invest your time and install custom firmware for this phone, but this is a new model, and there is not so much choice available yet (unlike Galaxy S or LG Optimus V). There is no cyanogenMod for this phone yet. Probably better to wait a half year before dealing with this phone unless you are going to contribute into custom mode developing yourself (see discussing below).Update:Installed Titanium backup (backup system), RebelROM (custom firmware), GrooVe IP (free calling using google voice works fine over wi-fi and 4g), juice defender (save your precious bodily fluids, battery power). Never automatic update phones with custom ROM, no factory restore... Everything clean and working, but too much work required.

While I enjoy the hardware and software quality of my Apple product, I did not at all enjoy the long-term expensive contract that came with it. I'm usually around areas with WiFi, so paying each month for a required data package didn't make much sense to me. I wanted a phone and carrier plan that met my needs, not the other way around.When my two-year contract expired I began researching various phones and carrier plans. I wanted a smartphone (Apple spoiled me there), but it didn't have to have all the bells and whistles. I mostly wanted something that could play music while on road trips and allow me to reliably call and text my buddies. The Exhibit II was the phone that seemed to meet all my needs.After owning the phone for a month I can say that it does a fairly decent job at meeting my needs. However, there are a number of flaws in the phone that make using it quirky and often irritating. Below are my general pro/con thoughts on the phone.Pros:The screen is noticeably brighter and of higher quality than my old iPhone. Everything looks crisp and detailed.The Exhibit II is a good bit lighter and less bulky than my iPhone. It feels much more at home in my pocket.I save $40 a month in comparison to my old AT&T; bill. The phone will pay for itself in just five months.Flaws:The touchscreen is flat out not as responsive as my iPhone 3GS. I often have to touch or drag multiple times in order to get input to be registered. I get the impression that it is less a flaw of the touchscreen than the processor in the phone trying to keep up with my actions, for it feels somewhat laggy. With a 1GHz Snapdragon, however, I didn't expect such sluggishness.There is something wrong with the volume control when I attempt to make calls. If I toggle the volume up, nothing will happen. I discovered, with some experimentation, that I first have to press the volume control down before I can press it up to make it louder. This is very counter-intuitive and, frankly, annoying.There is a loud pop though the earpiece a few seconds after I press 'Send' to make a call. I have to hold the phone away from my ear to save my eardrums some pain.This phone has a good bit of bloatware installed. I thought Apple exercised tight control over their users, but I can't even delete the useless junk on my Exhibit II!3D games don't run all that well. Even simpler games such as Temple Run exhibit enough lag to stymie your gameplay experience.There is a significant delay between when I press the button to take a photograph and when that photograph is actually taken. The delay can be anywhere between one and four seconds. This is a major issue if you are tying to take a photograph in a pinch. More often than not you will miss that special moment.This isn't really a flaw in the phone itself, but I don't get very good service where I live. The TMobile map showed that I was in a lighter green, but I get more dropped calls and interference than what I did with AT&T.;The Samsung Exhibit II runs an older version of the Andriod OS (Gingerbread), and it doesn't look like TMobile has plans to update the phone to Ice Cream Sandwich.The TMoible MyAccount Software will not work unless 'Use Packet Data' is enabled under 'Settings -> Wireless and network -> Mobile networks.' I generally keep Packet Data off so that I do not accidentally use data while out and about. It is annoying that I first must enable this to see how I am doing in terms of my minutes and text messages.Text messages occasionally fail to send. I sometimes have to attempt the send multiple times before it will go through.Other thoughts:This is just personal opinion, but Andriod feels much less polished than iOS. With my iPhone I never worried about restarting my device to keep it running well. My Exhibit II, on the other hand, reminds me every week or two that it is time to reboot the phone so that it can continue operating properly.Malware seems to be fairly rampant on the Andriod platform. I cringe at the thought of Malware getting on a heavy communication device such as my phone.Setting up my phone wasn't as smooth as I would like it to have been. I attempted to perform the setup through the TMobile web portal, but I continually got a message partway through stating that my account was 'processing' and that I should wait. After a couple days of waiting I called TMobile and painlessly set up my account through one of their agents.Conclusion:This is a decent phone if all you are looking to do is make a few calls, play music, and perhaps do minimal web browsing. If you are a heavy cell phone user and are looking for a phone that will play the latest games, text, run the latest software, and do heavy multimedia, then I recommend looking elsewhere.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Faster, smaller, cheaper.", "Author": "Taco Fury", "ReviewID": "R23CWGUR6A9PRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "4 months in, loving my phone.

I have the Kindle app and find it's comfortable to read on as well if I don't have my Kindle on me.Things I don't like about the phone:1. There is NO alert/notification LED.  This is the biggest deficiency.  Have to activate the screen to see if I have any notifications.2. There is no auto-adjust option for screen brightness.3. The phone beeps (or vibrates when on vibrate) when it's fully charged.  Who ever thought it would be a good idea to have your phone wake you up in the middle of the night when it's charged??4. Phone has a lot of bloat ware. I really need to get around to rooting and deleting the stuff that's not needed.5. A minor annoyance, but it's difficult to tell which end of the phone is which by feel and the volume button is on the opposite side as the power button so I find myself often pressing the volume by mistake when I want to hit the power button.6.

This phone/plan combination is just about perfect for me and represents an outstanding value. Another reviewer mentioned that minutes used beyond the 100 were charged at 10 cent each. I thought he was mistaken since many of the more expensive plans seem to charge around 40-45 cents for overages. But, sure enough, $0.10 is what they charge on this plan, according to the details specified in the T-Mobile 'My Account' app after activation. All I can say is, Wow!The phone itself is very good. Perfect? Certainly not. We live in an imperfect world. However, it is very capable and does just about everything the top of the line phones can do, albeit a little slower (tho still quite responsive.) Given the value play in effect here, it's a no-brainer for anyone shopping for a 3.7\" display, Andoid 2.3.5 Gingerbread phone, IMO.Others have already described the capabilities of the phone in great detail, so there isn't much I can add. But perhaps this might help a few folks: Out of the box the calendar snooze/dismiss feature was grayed-out whenever an event fired. There were no settings to fix this. Hence an event could not be dismissed, nor could the alert reminder be snoozed. I was able to completely solve this problem by installing 'Calander Snooze' from the marketplace. (A free app.)One last thing. If I recall correctly, at least one reviewer mentioned the inability of this phone/plan combo to function as a wifi hotspot (teathering.)

I wanted a low-cost, pocket-sized device for email, web browsing, and remote control applications.Music playback was expected, but not essential. After looking around, it came down to the Exhibit II and the iPod Touch. I chose the Samsung partly because I didn't want to carry around two devices (phone+web). It was a tough choice. I really like the 8GB Touch. Had Apple included 16GB on that device I might have bought it instead.The first phone I received from Amazon was defective. It would lock up after a short time. My replacement works fine. Amazon made the process easy. I had never returned items to Amazon; I'm impressed at the speed and the ease they provided. After my first Exhibit II failed I was depressed. The replacement arrived quickly, so I had only a few days to mope.If you're thinking of upgrading your prepaid \"feature\" phone to this T-Mobile/Samsung smartphone, you might wonder if you can use your existing by-the-minute voice plan. Yes, you can. But web access is limited to when you're near a wi-fi spot. That's how I'm doing it. I recommend shopping T-Mobile's web site as opposed to visiting a store or signing up via phone call. If you buy this phone, you'll want to open a free GMail account for the best integration.As far as the hardware goes: it's excellent. The Exhibit II is solid and comfortable to hold. Plugging in over-the-ear headphones gives loud, clear sound. The 800 by 480 display is crisp. The touch response is good. Although adequate, the earpiece (speaker) could be louder. It is hard to hear your caller in a noisy environment. When used moderately over the course of a day, this phone needs to be charged daily.Factor in time required to purge bloatware from this phone. I rooted my phone (free) and installed Titanium Backup Pro (seven dollars). One shouldn't have to do that. It takes hours to research, plus time and (small) risk in rooting the phone. It appears that rooting is easiest done via Windows computer. [Edit, 19-Apr-2012: I installed a ROM called CyanogenMod9, or CM9 to my phone. This unofficial (and beta) OS is based on Android ICS \"ice cream sandwich\" OS. Despite being incomplete, CM9 for the Exhibit II is very capable and feature-laden.] Although the phone has a slot for a microSD card, the package does not include one. You should definitely purchase a microSD card if you plan to install a custom ROM.I hesitate to recommend this Exhibit II to someone who doesn't want to go to the trouble of purging junk software -- look elsewhere.

This is a really very good phone for $189.Pros:- Screen size is 3.7\". Not too shabby for a sub-$200 phone.

This is what sold me on the phone - the ability to skype or video-gtalk is really nice.- Very good battery life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.Cons:- You have to deal with a lot of T-mobile bloatware. Of course you can always root the phone and delete most of the bloatware.- T-mobile may give you a very hard time unlocking the phone as it is not purchased through them. Since I travel overseas a lot I needed my phone unlocked. I have read that some individuals have eventually gotten t-mobile to unlock their Exhibit II after several calls. I wasn't that lucky so I had to go elsewhere to unlock mine for about $25.Other:- If you are buying this phone to unlock it and use overseas, check to be sure your network is compatible- For the Exhibit II we have:2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 19003G Network HSDPA 850 / 1700 / 2100 / 1900- Several countries in Africa and Europe use 900/1800 which means this phone will only get 2g on those networks.

I was initially afraid it might be a bit too small.  I went from a 3.2 inch screen to a 3.7 in screen.  Who knew half an inch would make all the difference! Although a 4 inch screen would be nice, I think this screen size is perfect.  Not too small.  It fits great in the hand.Text Messaging is buggy.  If you text more than 1 page of text, it gives you an error.  Looks like a lot of people have this problem.  I've searched countless forums about it.  The only way around it is downloading a different messaging app.  The only annoyance is that I can set the new app as my default, but I can't change the icon on the dock to go to my app.  The dock icon just goes back to the default messenger.  There are apps that change your phone screen and it allows you to customize your dock, but I haven't found one that I like yet.Yes, the phone does come with A LOT of bloatware.  I read about this before I purchased the phone.  I read many forums and a group finally made the process easy.  I am definitely new to the whole rooting process.  I wanted to root my old Android phone but it seemed so complicated so I never went through with it.  For this phone, there are some smarties out there that made the whole process so simple!  Very few and simple steps.  Download 2 files (USB drivers and the actual Rooting file), set phone to USB debugging, plug it in, execute rooting and you're done!  Install titanium back up app, back up all apps (Just in case you delete the wrong one!), delete the apps that are not needed (List provided by the genius root people).  SO EASY!  I was a little hesitant in rooting because I was a newbie, but it's super easy and simple.  The phone works just fine without rooting.  It didn't lag or drain the battery.  I went a whole day with moderate use during my work hours and heavy use on wifi when I got home.  I still had some juice left the next morning.  I only rooted the phone because all the extra apps annoyed me.  I didn't want pages and pages of apps that I don't use.I'm still under contract with t-mobile but I wanted a newer smart phone. I had an old T-Mobile MyTouch.  The very first version of the MyTouch line. I wanted to upgrade to a bigger and gingerbread android phone but I didn't want to be tied to a 2 year data plan.  This is a great alternative to very pricy unlocked phones.  Plus, when my contract is up, I can switch to the prepaid plan.  I don't need data because I'm usually at home or at work where wifi is available so it's great that I could buy this phone, stick in my sim and I'm good to go. The only issue is that if you don't have a data plan you can't send picture messages.  I have read this is an issue with Android and/or T-mobile.  It doesn't bother me too much because I don't usually picture messageRegarding that other reviewer that said the phone can't get network calls or texts while on wifi, I don't know what's wrong with their phone but mine works great.  I was hesitant to buy the phone because of that review.  I'm glad I believed it to be a fluke and bought the phones anyway. Network calls DO work with wifi on.  There's absolutely no reason it shouldn't.  T-mobile told that person the wrong information!This phone is definitely slippery as other have said.  The full body skin helped with that (Offered as a bundle from Amazon).  Installation was SUPER easy.  I like the soapy water method because it's more forgiving when you place it down crooked.  Now I'm just waiting for my case from ebay.Overall it's a zippy phone (even before rooting), way faster than my ancient MyTouch running on Froyo.  Very few lags and no \"force closes.\"  It has the perfect screen size and customizing is so easy.  Battery life is great (I was afraid it would be like other smart phones where you charge every 12-15 hours).

While I would really like to have my voicemail transcribed, it's not worth the extra $30 - $40/mo. to get a qualifying post-paid plan.If not having visual voicemail is a dealbreaker for you, then prepare to shell out the money for a traditional plan; but if you can get past that speed bump and you salivate over the thought of 5GB of cellular data at 4G speed per month + 100 mins. of voice for $30/mo, then this is one phone you should seriously consider.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "If your thinking of buying this phone~~~~DONT!!!", "Author": "arleen", "ReviewID": "R22BS2GAJ20ICD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone with a tmobile contract and ended up regretting & returning it before my 15 day buyers remorse period ended.Had the phone for 6 day......put simple apps in like angry birds, accuweather, yahoo mail, gas buddy & myxer.Angry birds after two days would not load i would either get a black screen or it would go back to the home screen.....tried unistalling and installing back into the phone serveral times with the same result.If i attempted to send a text msg more than 3 sentences long i would get message failed error code......and it would take about 10-20 attempts before it would finally go through......called tmobile 3x and they said it was not an issue with coverage it was an issue with the phone.Also i have made calls and people have hung up on me because they could not hear me.I took the first phone back to tmobile thinking maybe i just got a lemon since the phone has good reviews......by the 2cnd day the new phone i exchanged it for started the same issues......returned it that day for full refund and opted out of contract.This may be a good phone for someone on tmobile prepaid but i would NEVER be locked into a 2yr contract with this piece of garbage.

Paid full price from another store to get it same day. It does take a little getting used too, if you previously had an iphone. My last phone was the iphone 3gs. The keyboard is slightly more difficult than the iphone, but what isn't? Nothing really beats the iphone keyboard. But... I started using Swype after a short time, and found that it was intelligent and very quick. Also the voice to text is amazing! What a great way to answer text while driving! lol. I'm a criminal, I know! Second greatest feature of this phone is that it works over wifi, even if you have no service in the area. I took my phone on vacation across the country recently. It worked EVERYWHERE! I even stopped in at a local McDonalds and used their free wifi. Calls are VERY clear over wifi, there is no lag, and I have no problems. It also sends text.I've downloaded a couple dozen apps, and have never had a problem with one giving me any error message when I used it. I really enjoy skype on the phone, the speaker is loud and clear, the video is crisp and clean. The camera takes great pictures and video, and I've actually used it for my business on several occasions.As far as I'm concerned.... using the voice to text to search google is just as good as the iphone4s Siri app. It doesn't give you a voice response, just pulls up what you're searching for. I paid $199.00 for this phone, with a $50.00 unlimited plan. Best investment I've ever made!Don't listen to the one star morons who tell you the phone lags sometimes... as with every computer phone, periodically, you have to close all the apps you have open, and clean up your RAM.

I've had the phone for 6+ months. I rec'd it as a gift, purchased from Amazon.The primary problem has been it's lack of speed. Most of the time, it's just slow! I regularly have to touch the screen and wait, touch the screen and wait and wait. You get the idea. Three to four seconds to open the pre-loaded texting program.  Five to ten seconds to load web pages and e-mail. For one thing, the memory is inadequate. The phone is always running at nearly full memory. Even when you shut down some of the apps to free up memory, five minutes later the memory is running at full again. Go figure.Occasionally it freezes. I have to shut it down and reboot! It's locked up when I've had to make important calls. Times I really needed the phone to step up and perform. This latter issue of freezing seems to have been solved after I contacted Samsung and they walked me through a process of resetting the phone without losing apps or data. We'll see if this lasts.And I didn't mention that it's been impossible to upload the updates to the software. I've spent way too much time trying to make this work. Samsung has not been able to help except in the end to tell me to go to Best Buy and have them do it.If it weren't so slow and didn't have some of the quirks (there are lots of apps on the phone that you can't remove without a fair bit of computer savvy and without voiding the warranty), it would be fine.  I really like the idea of a lower cost smart phone. I wish there were one that lacking some of the bells and whistles was still a competent device. I don't need the top of the line for my purposes.This is my first smart phone. I don't want to spend a great deal of money. I lose and drop things. I don't want to be chained to a cell company on a two year contract, paying much more than needed on taxes, a plan I don't need, and $15-20 on insurance to cover my over-priced hand-held \"computer system\".I'm on a month-to-month plan. It's great. I pay a limited amount in taxes and get everything I need. A little more data might be nice though I don't want to be connected all the time. I'm in front of the computer at home and at work. Sometimes that's enough.

But it's the identical model.  It has an always-active touchscreen, and the power button is on the side, just below the upper right corner.  What's wrong with these things?The power button falls naturally under your left index finger, when holding it to your ear in your left hand.  It doesn't power off for several seconds, but the slightest touch drops the call you're on.With the normal display during a call, touching the screen with your ear, as is quite natural, also drops the call immediately.  If you happen to have switched to the keypad display, e.g. to navigate through voicemail hell to get a live person, then your ear touching the screen produces loud beeps when it hits a number.  To avoid this, you have to wedge the upper edge of the screen into your ear, quite uncomfortably and reducing the volume, and also hold the bottom far from your mouth, so the other person has trouble hearing you.I'm kinda stuck with the phone (although not a 2-year contract, thank god), so I'm buying a Bluetooth headset.  That's all very well for calls I've planned in advance to make, and reduces the risk of fried brains, but who wants to wear a headset for hours just to be able to answer a call quickly without risking dropping it?Don't buy this phone!

The USB cable that it arrived with would charge the phone from my laptop but not one of my USB wall chargers. I thought, \"ok, I guess I can live with that\". Afterall I still had the regular wall charger it came with. But then I discovered it wouldn't charge in my car's USB lighter charger UNLESS I used a different cable (not the one it came with). Then it wouldn't charge using another regular wall charger I had at my studio. Mind you all these cables and chargers WORK PERFECT with other phones, including my girlfriend's Galaxy SIII which is much larger and you would think more of a power hog. I've used these cables on at least 3 other phones without the problem. Then I discovered not only is it the USB CABLE or the USB CHARGER you use but it has to be the RIGHT COMBINATION. I thought \"Really???\"This is what I did last to test it. I plugged in my Exhibit II to my laptop using the OEM USB cable that it arrived  and the phone charged just fine. I then took that SAME cable and plugged the phone into a USB wall charger but the phone wouldn't charge. I then took a DIFFERENT cable and plugged the phone into the SAME wall charger and it worked. Honestly, what is that all about???I then found out that this is a KNOWN ISSUE and many other people are having the same problem if you search enough. Those that don't probably only use the charger that came with the phone. In conclusion, I have tested this phone with 4 different cables and 4 different wall chargers and 2 car chargers and it has only worked about 50% of the time with any combination of the above.If you are only going to use it with the wall charger it came with then you might be ok. I also read that the cheap Walgreens multi-colored car adapters work but haven't tried it myself. But mind you, my two car chargers are designed to put out more amps because they are made for iPads and still the phone had issues unless I used the right cables. I am about 50/50 on returning it because IT IS inexpensive and I already bought a case for it.

For occasional use, it will do the job, but performance-wise it's not even in the same neighborhood as bigger dual-core phones.The phone is surprisingly heavy for its size, and it features a very slippery plastic back that can make it fall out of your hand very easily.  The 3.7\" screen is fairly bright, although colors are dull (this ain't AMOLED).  The touch screen does not have a smooth response, and inputs don't always register.  The call quality and volume is pretty decent.  After a year of use, the battery life has diminished quite a bit, although it's still got some juice.  The battery is replaceable and IIRC is somewhat affordable.The Exhibit II 4G performs o.k. at first, but it deteriorates over the months.  I'm now retiring mine after just one year of use, and it has become very laggy and slow.  This includes loading up the actual \"phone\" section, which you would think would get high priority.  It often takes forever to exit apps to the desktop, and it's prone to temporary freezes and browser crashes.  On rare occasions the phone will reboot for no reason (takes forever to re-initialize), and the snooze on the alarm clock also doesn't work sometimes.  My Alpine receiver can't connect to it over USB (this may be an Android issue).  These performance issues could perhaps be ameliorated with a Factory Data Reset, or possibly rooting the phone to get rid of bloatware, but I haven't tried it.  I'm annoyed by having to tinker with something as utilitarian as a smart phone.If you are set on going the prepaid route, you may do well to simply spend a bit more money and buy a used smart phone like a Motorola Atrix, HTC, or Samsung Galaxy S2.  As far as I know, T-Mobile contract phones are GSM and should work with a prepaid T-Mobile SIM, and used AT&T; phones will work on Straight Talk with their AT&T; SIM kit.If you can squeeze a couple of years out of a higher-end used smart phone, you've probably made a better investment than this phone.

It is quick, the screen has pretty crisp images/good resolution and colors (depending on what you are used to), the camera is good (not great), and the Samsung interface is better than vanilla Android in my opinion (adding shortcuts/widgets to the homescreen for example).  However, this phone has been freezing a LOT (also..the pull down notification bar often wont stick/stay down, it just goes back up, the call volume could be a little louder, and the signal ability seems slightly weaker than other phones).  Basically, it freezes once or twice with every 20 minutes (straight) of use.  And it was like that even when I barely had any apps downloaded onto it.  To make matters worse, it doesnt just pick up where it left off after a few minutes of me waiting...it concludes by restarting itself!  This is usually not a big deal but I have worked on school papers via phone before and I would hate for it to shut down during a time like that.  Such an issue just doesnt make the phone feel dependable.  Im considering returning this phone.If it matters to you...the freeze ups are not during gaming or watching movies...they are during simpler things like clicking on something (or just the Back button) within the first 1 or 2 screens of an app.  Neither Home nor Back work.  Not even volume (oh, that freezes up too by the way...when there is no other freezing going on.)  The only button that works is the lock screen/power button but it only provides the on/off screen, not any actual locking or powering down during the freeze.Tiny gripe:  I wish there was some other way to turnt he screen on other than just by the somewhat stiff, high-up button on the right-hand side.  Its not a convenient spare fo the moment location.  The phone is a *little* awkward to hold/not narrow enough and I dont have short fingers.  The plus of the power/lock button being high is carefree placement in a car mount, but its just high up enough to not be a comfy location.  The volume button is a little lower and no problem.Tethering - at least as is - does not work, but I dont fault the phone for that (but I wanted to let you know what to expect).

After about 3.5 weeks, I received my phone, and it has not been fixed.  I just got off the phone with Samsung again, and I am on my way to send the phone back to Samsung again.

For the past almost five years I have been using the same old Nokia - which served me well. I wanted another Nokia but I also wanted Android OS, and was told by Nokia that it was not available on their phones. My Nokia was so old that I think it is like the one Elvis used. Anyway, it had a rotary dial.As I say, so far so good. The biggest drawback, as mentioned by many others, is the number of apps icons that need purging - I won't use all of them, maybe three or four. I have had a T-Mobile prepaid plan since 2007, so converting this phone to that plan was not too difficult. My Nokia SIM card was not recognized by the Samsung, for whatever reason, so I first copied my \"contacts\" from the Nokia SIM card to the Nokia memory. I then placed the Exhibit II SIM card(the one that came with the package) into the Nokia and copied the contact info to the new SIM card. This card was then placed into the Exhibit II and viola! It didn't recognize the existence of a SIM card.  What now?After fumbling around a bit and recalling how often I have had to reboot the set-top box for my Fios service, I said, \"Aha!\" I removed the battery and reinstalled it - We now have ignition. So, I signed up for another 1000 minutes on my plan and I'm good to go.One disappointment - and maybe it's just me - but I connected the Exhibit via the mini USB, to my iMac and the iMac did not recognize the device.  If anyone is knowledgeable about this connection, please advise.For now, it looks like I take the phone to work to download the necessary drivers and apps required to \"root\" the unwanted apps icons as directed by others on this review site.Not having had any other \"smart\" phone to judge this one by, I think I am going to really enjoy this phone. However, I don't text at all (not yet anyway), and I don't intend to watch movies or TV, but it might be nice to sync with my computer at home, via Evernote, once I figure out how to get it on board.Hope some of this will help others with whatever they are considering in the way of a new phone.EDIT: So far, not so good. I continue to be unable to remove the App icons.....even though I have a gmail account, I can't even download the Superoneclick App recommended here, to root it.

I have been yearning for some modern phone hardware, but I will not pay more than $40/ month.Up until now this has left me out of luck.Here's what I did...-Purchased Samsung Exhibit II 4G and activated on T-mobile (100min 5GB $30). I did not port my number.-Installed the Line2 app and had my number ported to Line2. It costs $9.95/month and it gives you unlimited calling. You can configure Android to use this as your default calling and texting app. It runs in the background all the time, but doesn't kill the battery.-Rooted the phone and installed a ROM free of bloatware. The phone does come with a lot of useless apps. The process took 5 minutes. The hardest part was finding USB drivers from Samsung. I ended up using the drivers for a different Samsung handset.[...]Heres what I ended up with...-Unlimited calling, texting and 5 GB of really fast 4G for $39.95/month. In Portland I'm getting 6 mbps in my living room. It is theoretically capable of 21 mbps but who knows.Where I came up short...-Line2 calling isn't quite cellular quality, but not terrible. It does seem reliable and it works on other platforms like Mac or iPad which is neat. It also can email you your voicemail. I'm not a huge talker so this is fine.

I am on the Tmobile prepaid unlimited everything. I had been looking for an internet capable phone for quite sometime, as I was paying for a data plan I was not using. I purchased this phone after much research on android phones. What sold me on this phone was the price. Because I have the prepaid plan, I was going to have to pay in full for an unlocked android phone, which can be over $300. I found this phone on Amazon, and was imediatally in love with it, because it can everything that I wanted it to do and it was at an affordable price of $200.I like this phone for many reasons. It is a 4G capable phone so I get signal almost everywhere. I like the way that the texting is set up (gingerbread interface, I think that is what it is called). This phone comes preloaded with swype, which i had never used before until now. Swype is pretty easy to use I just drag your fingure across the letters in the word that I are trying to spell and it writes out the word for me, so no more hunt and peck. Another thing that I like about the phone is that it is wi-fi capable. I like many other things about this phone, these are just some examples.I have only had a cupple of problems with this phone. Sometimes the phone is not very responsive to my touches on the touch screen, though is rare. The only other problems that I have with the phone are that occasionally my phone will not send texts and rarely it will freeze up. Both of these problems are fixible by simply restarting the phone or pulling the battery. I have had no other problems with phone other than those things.Over all I think that this is a pretty nice andriod phone, and totally worth the money.

I used Comet for little less than a year and I got it for 160 bucks - which I thought was a good deal back then, when rest of the options available were at least twice as expensive.Comet was very slow; when I saw Exhibit II for less than 200, I knew it was time for an upgrade.Exhibit II has all the good features that you read on here - which are excellent for the price.Here are the downfalls:1. 1.0 GHz processor is really great, but it is a single core; thus, some (quite little) choppiness or loss of smoothness is observed when you are multi-tasking - insignificant downfall.2. Android 2.3 appeared to me to be less stable than 2.2, as Exhibit II did freeze a couple of times after doing updates or installs and uninstalls. Not that I'm an expert, but I'd say this is expected, because 2.3 is more extensive, more compatible, more versatile. These freeze ups could also be a cause of some on-the-poor-side hardware.. but this is totally a guess.3. Screen is great, camera is borderline good (nothing amazing).. but I'd say, the sound quality is poor, with the most obvious one being the speaker on the back of the phone. It is loud and clear, but lacks depth to the tunes it is playing - sound like cheap laptop speakers as opposed to good laptop speakers. Sad to say (for Exhibit), Comet has a much better speaker (and this is one of the reasons why I'm not throwing Comet away). In addition, I can easily say that the earpiece inside the phone is not a lower-end quality one. The sound is overall is good but just not brilliant - wouldn't expect this from Samsung.Overall, it's a great phone - fast, functional, average up-to-date technology.. but we all know how long that lasts..I would recommend this phone.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "What is an iphone", "Author": "David King", "ReviewID": "R1Y8A68N7DSR59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great.

Writing to the Customer Relation Department with relevant documentation was not a wast of time but effective. But, make sure you have sufficient documentation such as package tracking information in such exceptional situation. Although I would still recommend improvement in their software update quality and customer service department to streamline communication and processing of customer issues such that I would not have lost the use of my newly bought phone for more than four months with lots of frustration. I now changed the rating from 1 to 3.-----------------------I think I have the social responsibility to report my experience to potential customers:1. I purchased a new Samsung Exhibit II Smart Phone from Amazon.com for about $200 and it worked fine until a software update pushed to my handset by your company. The software update rendered the handset frozen, unusable. Therefore, if you do own a smart phone tied to T-Mobile, beware of the poor software quality pushed into your phone..2. I called technical support and the representative asked me to send in the handset for a replacement to: 4500 Cambridge Rd, Fort Worth TX, 76155. I sent in the handset via UPS according to the instructions with the order number posted outside and inside the shipping box.3. UPS delivered the handset promptly. Tracking information shows that the package was delivered to the dock of warehouse 07/12/2012 10:00 A.M.4. But, the replacement handset was not shipped to me within 7 business days as promised by the representative who asked me to send in the broken handset. After several calls to the Customer Representative Department and about one month later, the warehouse sent me email saying that no record was found in receiving my handset such that the replacement handset order cannot be fulfilled.5. After even more phone calls to the Customer Service, a supervisor who was relatively fair and honest and confirmed that UPS did deliver the handset to the warehouse. He cancelled the old handset replacement order and created a new order.6. Unfortunately, the order still could not be fulfilled for some unknown reasons. Again, after many phone calls after phone calls, the representatives could not help but asked me to verify that I did send in the handset. Finally, I asked UPS to give me additional proof of delivery. UPS performed an extra procedure called Package Investigation. UPS confirmed that the package was delivered with the name of the person receiving the package in the warehouse.7. As of today, the order was not honored but cancelled automatically by T-Mobile system.Most of the customer representatives I talked to seemed courteous but could not actually be helpful practically. In fact, they could not even keep their promises to call me back when they said they would after their investigation. Therefore, I had to explain the whole story when I called again but connected to another customer representative in the T-Mobile Call Center. Writing to the T-Mobile Customer Relation was also a waste of time. They simply ignored my letter. I think this company calculates that it is more profitable to provide poor customer server or even illegal business practice in certain cases such as replacing a smart phone broken by software update pushed into their customers' phones.

You CAN NOT un-install these apps the way you will be able to do with any other app that YOU download from market.To get rid of this, custom ROM is the best option, which will remove all this junk, also optimize the memory and apps. you need to root your phone to install custom ROM which might void your warranty(actually there is a way to unroot your phone as well ), but i dont care for the warranty.rooting the phone is not rocket science; any non technical person can do this, but you need to read and read and read and once you are sure, go for it.you can find all the details about rooting and custom ROM here - just google \"samsung exhibit ii 4g all things root\"after installing almost all the custom ROMs one by one, finally I am settled down on RebelROM 3.09 which I feel is the combination of performance and nice user interface.CALLING:--------To reduce the monthly calling bill(I hv tmobile 100 min unlimited data plan) I installed CSipsimple(available in market for free) and signed up with Callcentric (you can start with as low as $5)configuring callcentric with CSipSimple was super easy. CallCentric also offers you number for free(if you decline 911 service otherwise you need to pay $1.5 a month 911 fees).Also signed up google voice, and setup my callcentric number in google voice as forwarding number. I have given my google number to all my contacts, so when someone calls my google number, my callcentric number rings, which is also configured in CSipSimple APP that is running on my phone - which rings my phone.CallCentric has another feature which is very useful. when you are not in the 3G/4G coverage and the app on your phone looses contact with callcentric website, you can forward calls on your regular tmobile number so you wont miss any calls!I have also signed up on Rebtel ( they have a free app on the market) which gives me very good domestic and international calling rates. I mostly use rebtel to make outgoing calls when I am connected to the wifi because rebtel offers very good voice quality over wifi as compared to GrooveIP+GoogleVoice( tried this as well but not very happy with the voice quality)Also Rebtel tells you the call charger up-front before you make any outgoing call - eg. when i select any US number to make outgoing call, I am aware that i will be charged 1.2 cents/min and so for the international calls.Few more things:1)Over 3G/4G CSIPsimple- CallCentric works well compared to any other setup; make sure you change the settings in CSIPSimple and force it to use low bandwidth CODECs like G729 only(de-select rest of the codecs)2)Google voice APP is good to send unlimited free text msg(domestic)3)when you are moving, no setup/app might help you for 3G/4G calling. so be patient and do not blame the phone! - as I said before, you can simply disconnect your data/wifi whenever you want and all the calls will be forwarded to your regular tmobile number(will cost you minute)4) you can even setup your google voice number with CSIPSimple. search \"pbxes google voice\"but this setup will do no good compared to grooveIP/GV setup.5)I have tried talkatone,SIPDroid and few more apps but didnt find them as useful as CSIPSimple.6)GrooveIP works OK on WiFi but is worst on 3G/4G. though i have purchased the $5 app from market, I hardly use it - main reason is you can not configure Codecs in grooveIP(by default it uses  G.711 as google voice only supports this codecs)I wl be happy to answer any queries!!", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Must be rooted to see it at its best!", "Author": "Sunny", "ReviewID": "RE6JBN477B6E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently brought this phone and initially did find it a bit sluggish. it even hanged quite a few times. the navigation used to loose the gps signal every now and then. was already reaching my frustration point.but when i had this phone rooted, all this magically disappeared. this works smooth now. absolutely.

It's absolutely frustrating me to the point of being useless. I like the theory of Android smart phone but I need more reliability. Maybe I have a bad phone, I'm not sure.Original ReviewPros:+ It's a nearly perfect compromise between a high end $400+ phone and a real chepo+ Screen is responsive and rarely ever is slow+ Mostly use it for Groove IP VoIP calls since I have only 100 voice plan minutes.Cons:- Bloatware Apps- Occasionally vibrates nonstop and requires shutdown or even removal of battery.- There are occasional seemingly unrelated glitches. For example a recent glitch involved Google Chat where the phone was displaying certain portions out of order. I would send something, my friend would respond but it would reverse the order. Vary strange - since afterwards I logged on the computer and checked that that the chat was in correct order on the computer. Glitches don't appear to have anything in common other than the underlying OS / hardware. EG, it's not always the same App that will have a glitch.- Battery life. The max I can go is 30 hrs until requiring a recharge - which is a mix of talk, App usage, and standby. Basically make sure it's charged in the morning before you leave for the day. My work building blocks the signal so it could be sucking the battery in the search for a signal it will never find.- Screen cracked - I did drop it, so it's my fault. Unfortunately it landed screen side down on rough concrete sidewalk. Touch screen still works though.Groove IP specific information:+ Sometimes it performs beautifully (exponentially better than my previous device: Samsung Galaxy Player)+ Strangely there is better quality when I call cell numbers.- Other times, there may be echos or times when the other person can't hear me. Mostly when I call wired phones.- Groove IP has many settings to tinker with. A given call may work fine, a different call may require a setting to be messed with.- When idle (eg not in a phone call), Groove IP doesn't always maintain it's connection even if it appears to be connected. I might attempt a call with nothing happening. To fix it, I quit Groove IP and enable airplane mode then put things back to normal.- Obviously if you are using someone else's WiFi such as a friend or you're works, you can't control certain settings like QoS, firewall permissions, WiFi channel, etc.Given the number of variables in internet connection quality, WiFi signal, QoS, etc - it's difficult to determine if some of these issues are indeed Groove IP problems or due to the other variables. If you want to use Groove IP, you will probably have to do some tinkering. In the Groove IP issues, I always can hear fine, but the person on the other end hears echo, or says I'm breaking up.Here's some specific examples and results with Groove IP:Call from my dad's WiFi to Verizon Landline - has trouble hearing meCall from my work WiFi to another Verizon Landline - hears echosCall from my home WiFi to Verizon Cell - works perfectCall from my work WiFi to Unknown Rebate Claim Landline Call center - says I'm breaking upCall from my work WiFi to Sprint (Vigin Mobile) Cell - works perfectCall form my home WiFi to Netflix support Landline - works perfectEcho cancellation does help when there is echo, but sometime they may not hear me.

It is time to make a fair judgement now.[Appearance]----------------This is good looking device with thin design. Screen size is 3.7 inch.[Usage]----------------Exhibit II is quite light. It feels good in hand. You mostly need to use your both hands to handle because of Android's menu and virtual keyboard design.[Speed]----------------It takes about a minute to boot device which is reasonable I guess. This is not fast device even it has 1 GHz processor. Because processor speed is an illusion in Android devices. Don't get fulled by numbers, just think about what you get. If you compare Samsung Exhibit II with iPhone which has equivalent hardware you will understand what I mean. My conclusion is Android is much slower operating system than iPhone. What you pay is what you get.[Camera]----------------Front cam is an ordinary one that is reasonable for video calls. Rear camera is 3MP with flash support. Photo quality is not fancy but not too bad at all.[Operating System]----------------This device is running Android Gingerbread(2.3.x). Android is Java dependent system which makes it running slow. However it is still better than Windows based mobile operating system. You can experience weird resets sometimes don't worry. There is no news about Android 4.0 update. I guess they may not prepare 4.0 update for Exhibit II.[Connectivity]----------------3G/4G networks are available for internet connection. Bluetooth is available for data exchange.[Software]:----------------t is coming with bunch of useless T-Mobile software. You cannot directly remove them they are defined as system component. You need to root and remove them. You will use Android Market for new software. Android Market is still poor if you compare it with iPhone apps.[Battery life]----------------This part is really crucial. I bought this device to use 4G service. That is why I always enable either WiFi or 4G. Data backup and synchronization services are always running too. Average battery life is 20 hours for me. But there is a significant inconstancy in battery consumption. I usually use similarly each day but sometimes battery is draining in 8 hours, but rarely it is draining in 30 hours. I have no idea about that.[GPS/Navigation]----------------At the beginning GPS signal was frequently dropping but it is quite consistent nowadays. Use Google Navigation software. It is much better software than other navigation software which comes default.[Conclusion]----------------First off all you need to know that you are not buying an iPhone equivalent smart phone. I don't know the whole market but this might be one of the best smart phones in terms of performance/cost. If disadvantages don't bother you too much this might be right smart phone for you.I hope this review is helpful for you.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cannot complain too much given its price", "Author": "C.

It is an excellent entry level smartphone.Good* competitive price as $200* decent size , not too big, not too small* usually fast and can handle netflix smoothly* Internet tethering is supported by default. no  hacking is needed at all.* very good screen for text and pictures* the Android installed has some nice features, like a task manager to show and stop running apps. Very handy.Some noticeable issues for the first day.* the back of the case is VERY, VERY slippery. The worst of all phones I ever had. You have to be very careful when holding it. Maybe it is the vendor's intention that you can drop one dead on the ground and buy another one.  For now, I applied some black tapes on the back. It is a little better.* I can notice occasionally lag when flipping screens. It is strange considering the 1 GHz processor it has.* The only way to active the screen is trough the power button. It is little annoying since you have to hunt for the power button. I wish it had a physical home key which could active the screen. There might be another way. But at least I don't know yet.* T-mobile's 4G network is slow in my area. I can only get a few hundred kilo bps (less than 1Mbps!) most of the time.* Battery life is a concern. I may have to charge it daily to be safe.Updates after a few days of use.-----------------* camera: the shut lag is very bad. I thought autofocus was a good feature. But it takes 2 seconds to focus. Only good for shooting stationed objects, not for shooting anything moving.* video recording is impressive if you just watch the results on the phone. But uploading it to youtube will lose some quality. Very frustrating about this. Hope there is a way to upload video with its original quality.* The speaker's quality is worse than the T-mobile Comet's speaker. Playing Pandora gives me some high pitch noise. Tolerable but unhappy about this.* For me, there is no choice of $30/month for unlimited data and 100 minute talk from the \"My account\" app of the phone. Not sure if T-mobile dropped this option or what. I do see the choice of $30/month 1500 minutes or messages.* T-mobile's $3 Daily unlimited voice,text and data has some gouging trick. With a payment of $3, I switched my plan to it from as-you-go-plan at around 2pm on one day (Day-1). T-mobile started to charge me again for the next day (Day-2) at 11:45pm , without waiting for 24 hours at all.  I also tried to switch back to pay as you go around noon on Day-2. The switch becomes effective immediately, forfeiting all the rest of Daily Unlimited Plan from 12pm to 12:00am. So in reality, I paid $6 for less than 24 hours (from 2pm on the first day to 12pm the next day).  Be aware of this kind of trick played by T-mobile!----- update 3 ---------I changed my rating back to 4 star after realizing the screen problem is not an issue.

Aside from that it was almost impossible to nail down a rooting procedure that was less complicated than Newton's theory of relativity ! As if that wasn't enough it developed a behavior of turning itself off and on at will , and becoming very hot , while consuming all its battery power every 10-12 hours . Since I travel to various cities frequently this was not only unerving and frustrating , but a SERIOUS business communication handicap . I actually began to travel with an accessory battery charger and TWO spare batteries as well as the wall charger . Near associates were infinitely amused to observe me changing batteries in my phone once , or even twice ( on heavy use days ) while their phones remained stowed . All in all it was a great product until real service and current communication demands were placed on it . Then its performance diminishes and becomes irregular very , very , quickly . This will be a great phone for a user with only the most very basic demands ( i.e. basic talk - text and photos ) . I have since returned it to Samsung , where it was factory refurbished . In the meantime I purchased a Galaxy III with which I am quite pleased with and has absolutely no difficulty negotiating the same apps , and more that I had on the Exhibit 4G and very good battery life for a smart phone .

Worst phone I have EVER had!", "Author": "Maggie Mulroy", "ReviewID": "R3DL08TNLTKI4K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was one of the first people with a cell phone when cell phone service was introduced.  Although that first phone had no bells or whistles, it worked 100% better than the Samsung Exhibit!! THAT is how bad this phone is.  To say I hate it is not strong enough.First of all, when I first purchased this phone, I was told it has camera zoom feature.  No, it does not!  I was willing to overlook that as the phone seemed to have other features I liked (forward facing camera) but I so regret not turning back and returning the phone when I found out it doesn't have zoom.  Where do I start.....let me start with it's NOT just my individual phone. My husband has the same exact  phone/model. We bought both of them together at the same time.  His phone is exactly the same.  I do not have a bunch of apps loaded.  I have maybe 3 small apps that I thought I could enjoy if I could actually use them.  Nothing that takes up a lot of space or processing power.  Even when I deleted all my apps in hopes that it would be the solution...nothing.  My husband has never downloaded a single app to his phone and doesn't even use the preloaded ones.  Same problems.* Phone constantly freezes!!  To just read a text messages takes upwards of a minute.  I am NOT exaggerating!!  I look at this black screen until my text finally pops up.  I'm not talking about videos or pictures, just a one-word text! Same for apps, phone calls, camera, etc.  Everything I do with this phone is waiting until it can actually complete the task.  If there is ever a time I need to dial 911 with this phone, I know I'm in trouble!  If it's a matter of life or death, I know I will die!  Yes, this phone is THAT bad.  The freezing is constant and often!* Has a crazy mind of its own!  It won't send a text or complete a call because it has to freeze for 30 seconds first, but then when it finally comes back from its coma, it decides to ADD to its task.  It will start opening up screens I did not try to open. At first I thought it was maybe just me pressing extra things in trying to get the phone to come to life so I tried JUST trying to make a call or read a text and put the phone down so I could not select any additional options while I wait for the end of its coma.  No different.  The extra problem is that, while closing out extra screens it opened, it goes back into a coma again!!* The battery seems to occasionally *forget* it has a full battery and just shuts down on its own.  When I try to turn it back on,  get the stupid \"dead battery\" icon.  I have to plug in the charger and once the phone gets some juice (or I remove and reinsert the battery), it suddenly remembers it has a battery charge.* It decides when you can or cannot talk to someone!! No kidding.  I'll be 5 minutes into a conversation and the phone shuts down my call (it's not the service as I still have full bars and am on the 4G network).  When trying to reconnect, it simply will not connect the call!  Each time I put the number in and hit the send icon, it returns to the main screen.  The first time it did this, I tried 5 times and then gave up.  Hours later, it decided that permission had been granted to allow me to make the call and dialed the number five times!  Again, no kidding!!* The on-screen keyboard is awful!  I am a woman with normal sized-fingers for a woman so it's not that my problem is due to finger size.  When you press on a letter, a little bigger version of the letter shows up on top of the letter to confirm that you hit the right letter.  ha ha ha ha.  Nice feature if it worked!!  Why, oh WHY, when I try to select the letter \"o\" and it shows the letter \"o\" as being chosen, does the letter \"i\" show in my word???  That's not all....most of the time, when I select a letter, it selects a different letter instead.  It takes me twice as long to write a text because I constantly have to look at the screen to ensure the correct letter had made it through and backtrack when it chose a different letter.* You would THINK that the solution to the above problem would be their talk-to-text feature.  Oh, how nice it would be if only it worked!!!!  When trying to use this feature, it tells me to \"start speaking now\".  So, I start speaking into the phone at the distance it says to in the manual.  Hmmmm..nothing...still \"start speaking now\". So, I talk louder and put the phone against my lips so now I am KISSING THE PHONE and it still doesn't recognize that I've said anything.  I may be a woman, but I am NOT quiet.  I do not have one of those silent, squeaky voices that might explain this dilemma.  I have an average woman's voice in which everyone and everything can hear...except this phone!  Sometimes I get lucky, it actually acknowledges that I have said something.  However, it has to process it.  It shows \"working\"..... ...... ...... ..... after a minute I just cancel it!  Sometimes it just cancels it on its own with an error message.  I try and try, but I have learned with this phone, if it does not want to do something, there is nothing you can do to get it to work.  NOTHING!!!  Now figure in all the time invested in trying to get the phone to recognize you have spoken AND be able to process it....add the time for freezing.... and it's FINALLY spelled out what you have said....* The stupid phone jumbles everything said!  I have to go back and rewrite half the text!!  Waste of time!!!!These are the biggest issue off the top of my head.  There are more!  I have T-Mobile and they locked me in jail with their stupid 2-year contract which has another 2 months on it. I am leaving T-Mobile as the place I moved to has no service (although they claim I do have service - classic) so I do not want to spend the money getting a new phone when I'm just leaving them in 2 months.  Plus, I'm still paying monthly for this phone.  It cost $400 a phone and we renewed the contract with monthly payments for the phones.  So, I'm stuck in hell for now.  However, in 2 months, LOOK OUT as this phone will be FLYING DIRECTLY INTO THE NEXT HARD SURFACE.

And when you're trying to use the navigation in traffic, those minutes seem like hours. Having to tap the text box 5-6 times to bring up the keyboard and type messages was incredibly annoying. This is unforgivable though.Now that I have the phone, I really question all these 5-star reviews by what seems like professional reviewers...go to the Samsung site and you will see nothing but 1-star reviews of dissatisfaction.

Everyone who has not had a smartphone will be searching for a decent one or those on a low budget wants one. Samsung Exhibit II is the best smartphone out of other prepaid smartphones. In other words, it is good of prepaid smartphones but not that good in the smartphone market overall.First, the phone is good if you would like to have easy and accessible communication. You can call, text, e-mail, and use apps to communicate such as Facebook and other social apps. Setting up e-mail can be difficult if you are using a system like Microsoft Exchange. But once you figure it out, it works great. Also, there is a decent camera. The picture is great and videos appear pretty darn good for a budget smartphone. There is a camera in the from to for self portraits (but low quality). For basic communication, it is okay.On the downside, you probably won't be able to get the best experience from a smartphone. If you like downloading various apps and using them, the phone will become kind of sluggish. One disappoint is the Maps. Maps is not accurate enough. If you are searching for a location, do it before you drive. I would not recommend driving and following navigation because it GPS does not respond at the speed you drive. Also, I recommend getting an external memory (i.e.: MicroSD). The memory will fill up before you know it if you use music apps like Google Music/Play. If you do not know, a great deal of 4G smartphones get warm after using it for a while. Do not blame the manufacture because of this one negative aspect. Otherwise, this phone is not for excessive use, but it can get by.Overall, this phone is great for those who never had a smartphone that has not been made in the past several years(including the BlackBerry).

The backdoor around the phone upgrades is to buy a no-contract phone and stick your SIM card into it.  Yes, the selection when it comes to smartphones is more limited, but the Exhibit II phone offers 90% of the features of the Galaxy for way less money (Galaxy II with no contract is $600).  You can get the Exhibit locally at Wal-Mart for $199 (plus sales tax), but they absolutely fly off the shelves, and of course the Big \"A\" would be a sure thing and save the tax (for now until the US govt ends that loophole).  They got me 200 megs of data for $10 a month, which I know is not much, but with the Wi-Fi ability and using common sense it will not be a problem.  Believe me, I feel like a new man having access to web on the road when I need it.  The other phone commonly seen in prepaid Android is the Samsung Dart, with no front camera, puny screen, and no Gingerbread software for about $128.  I would say this phone is far superior to that older model.I have had one or two \"lockups\" with the phone and yesterday while passing Newark Airport (known dead zone for T mob) it just shut off completely.  Battery life with moderate use will get you down to 50% by the end of the day.  The Wi-Fi calling is seamless and it works well when I am in my house.  I am having a blast with apps, have not paid for one yet, eventually will get some more.Make sure you order some accessories from Amazon with your phone such as screen protectors, a HARD phone case, and a car charger.  These items are difficult to find locally and when you do, they are expensive (hard case was $15 at the local foreign-run cell phone store and they wanted $10 for ONE screen protector).

The camera is really nice (I am wondering on critical reviews on camera). The front camera is just a VGA, still good for video chatting using skype. (not sure whether a skype or Android's bug not detecting the headset during answering skype calls - not a big deal though, just unplug and plug back the audio jack). A good phone if you are a beginner to use smart phones.This is technically the 2nd phone I received with the same order, as the first one's audio jack wasn't giving sound on both sides. Thanks to Amazon, as they replaced a new phone the very next day.Update 1 : Just noticed that, whenever there is no actual 4G coverage (though the network shows as 4G), the speed drops to EDGE instead of 3G. Not sure if this is phone's problem or T-Mobile's.Update 2: After 4 weeks I found couple of weird things. The mobile restarted itself 2 times while I was on a call.

I followed others advice and turned off most of the loaded applications and selected the battery saving selections found under Settings.  Still, you'll be recharging the phone every day, since I don't even use it every day or have it on all day at a time.Second, as opposed to my Samsung not-smart phone which turned on right away, the Exhibit you have to press the power button 3-4 seconds before it lights up, awkward and annoying.  Then it is a almost 30 seconds before it is booted up.Thirdly,and Most Important, right from the beginning every few days or so when I turned on the phone I would get a black field on the screen with the white-lettered phrase \"RAM dump mode  Cause: Forced download\", at which point I could do nothing with the phone, not even turn it off.  I would have to open it up and pull the battery, like a forced powerdown on a computer.  After reinserting I could boot up again.  No one seemed to know what this was about, so I called Samsung.  The customer rep talked me into the settings selections to find some codes.  One of them, the \"kernel version\" she identified as not the code for the version with which Samsung programs the phone.  The phone had arrived in a brand-new T-Mobile Samsung box and packaging, but somehow it seems the phone had been unofficially \"modified\".  The customer rep didn't know how this would have occurred.  Samsung e-mailed me a UPS prepaid return label and had me send it back to their service center in Texas for \"re-flashing\".  Samsung sent me an e-mail on January 27 notifying that they had received the phone and then sent another one on February 2 notifying that they had shipped it back to me. As I am writing this and wondering when the phone will be delivered and thinking perhaps I should hold off on this review until I've tried the phone again,I thought to check the tracking code Samsung sent me.  I just cheked the UPS tracking and it said the delivery was today, 2 hours ago, \"left at front door\".  I went to check and there it was!  I have booted it up.

Its great because its not pushing any technology envelope, its really reliable and consistent. Its technologically similar to the EVO 4g, so plenty fast for most everything. And actually the EVO has the Snapdragon S1 processor and this has the Snapdragon S2, slightly newer processor. But its also a technology  that they've been working with for over a year so all the kinks seem to have been worked out.I'd rather have a 1ghz phone that works every time I need it than a dual-core 1.2ghz that fritzes out, turns on and off, gets hot, and does random stuff.The size is great. I don't really want my phone to dominate my pockets... The screen size works very well. I watch netflix on it regularly, email, web pages load really well and are easy to navigate, games are good. Texting is easy. I like the swype. Its improved smooth and quick.And at $200 I'm not so worried about it. Can you imagine carrying a $400 object in your pocket! I'd think about it all the time. This is way lower stress and a gain in workability.+Music player works great. Good sound without any enhancements.+I like how they do the calendar and the day's appointments are displayed below the monthly calendar.+Contacts software is well integrated and usable.+Being able to create folders inside the app menu is nice.-I liked the text msgr until I realized it cut photos sent thru MMS down to 9kb, can't even see them. So I use GO Messaging from App market. It only cuts them down to 30kb. Which is very readable. (I didn't like Handcent because when monitoring memory usage with the apps open, Handcent took up more memory and left more memory tied up even after I closed it.)+It has Tasklist and Memo apps that are well thought out.+The pull-down bar lets you change screen orientation, wifi on/off, bluetooth settings. Very handy.+Photo gallery loads quick.-Camera kind of sucks. Its usable for quick pictures and sharing good times, but I'm not going to print them out and frame them.+Skype works!! Well it doesn't work from the phone to a computer for some reason. But it works great from phone to phone. Had a great chat with my Brother on his EVO 4g.+They send you Txt reminders for making the prepaid payment on time starting 3 days before they're due.**Wifi Calling is installed and works great but it uses your minutes. Originally I thought I would get a minutes plan to save money and use wifi calling as much as possible but no-can-do. Wifi is just a way to get you service in low service areas. It still uses your minutes, so I moved to the unl minutes plan.I will say the less apps you put on a phone the better they run. The App Market is just not as well managed as Apple's App Store. The Apps in the Market can take up excessive memory, create memory leaks that increase the memory they take up even when closed, they conflict sometimes with other apps due to the access privileges they require, they slow the phone down.I watch carefully thru a memory monitoring app and see what apps do to the phone system and delete those that cause issues.I can get 3 days out of this phone's battery this way.Fortunately, which is something I love about this phone, most of the software I use is on the phone and it works really well. I'm very happy with it.The Service:I switched from Sprint. I'm glad I did. I paid $200 for the phone and now just pay the prepaid 4g monthly of $50/mo. I get unlm talk and text and 100mb of data at 4g and then unlimited data at 2g/3g. Its good for the occasional Navigated trip and getting emails (w/o attachments). Otherwise I just use wifi at home or office or friends. Easy enough and only $50/mo. Huge savings over Sprint/Vzn/ATT. And T-mobile has been pleasant to work with.

I seriously can't imagine someone trying this phone, looking at the price, and going on to buy some other phone that either costs 2x as much, or signing a contract!You would think they'd cheap out on this phone to make the higher price phones look better, but the only defects of this phone are expected, the basic camera (flash included) and the rear speaker (should be two front facing).Otherwise the standout feature is the crisp, beautiful screen.  It is made of a very resistant material that reveals a pristine brightness.  Not a single miniscule scratch after a month of use.This comes with the newest version of Android for phones, Gingerbread  2.3.5(though ICS was recently released for the flagship Samsung Galaxy Nexus).This phone becomes even better when you root it and remove some of the unnecessary T-Mobile applications, and further tweak it.  There are about 5 icons that are pretty useless, but can't be removed normally.  Perhaps they are included to reduce the cost.This actually works better than most GPS devices out there.  Just buy a windshield or similar mount and take full advantage.  This has been my experience:1. Waze - Community driven navigation that gets better when more and more people use it, reporting traffic, and new roads.  This can really help you find better routes on your commute.  The drawback is that it's harder find newer places in its directory.2. Google Nav - everything you can find in Google Maps, is navigable here.  Complete with Google's satellite imagery.  Very polished and includes traffic reports.3. TeleNav GPS - comes with the phone, and is the closest to a traditional GPS device.  The free version works quite well, without ads or distractions.  You must pay a monthly fee for additional features.Here is my experience with watching streaming video:1. Netflix - Works perfectly.2. Hulu Plus - Does not work yet.  Says the content is not yet available for this device.3. T-Mobile TV - Included app works really well, but the best content requires subscription.  Even has LiveTV!4. Amazon Video - Officially it is only for the Kindle Fire, but I got it working quite well by tricking the program. Only works on Wi-Fi.5. Crackle - The low quality you expect, but it works6. Qik - Records and uploads video instantlyGames:All Angry Bird Games work perfectly smooth, Cut The Rope a total delight, Fruit Ninja fun as always, Where's My Water is a bit tricky on this size screen, and I haven't tried much other popular games as these are enough to entertain.Reading:Kindle, Nook, Zinio, and Google Books appear nice and clear.Music:The built-in speaker is very loud, but not very clear for dynamic music.  For optimal enjoyment and respect for those around you, use headphones.VOIP:Google Voice works well, and you can use it to make and receive calls (4G up to 5GB and 100min plan is perfect for $30). Google Voicemail is incompatible with prepaid plans. Skype works well and video chat is acceptable.  MobileVOIP works well.So why consider a different phone?  Well the processor is more than capable if you're conscious that it's a single core, and has its limits.  So far, every program that I could want on a phone works well.

Annoying, but you can long-press the status bar and slide your finger to change the brightness on the fly (phone has to be unlocked).

That's exactly what I got. I don't talk much on the phone, and since I'm ancient, don't text:-) I really only have three complaints about this phone, which is otherwise worth every penny.The 1st complaint is that it has the older Android 2.3 OS. I have tablets with 4.0 and 4.1 and had a 3.2 before it was upgraded. There is NO comparison between these more advanced OS's and the one on this phone. I don't really mind it, but it's not nearly as useable.The 2nd complaint is the enormous amount of non-removable (without rooting) bloatware. A few of those apps are OK, but, serioiusly T-Mobile and Samsung, that's the most bloat junk I've ever seen, and I have a LOT of devices (addicted).The 3rd and most important negative is that the volume control is directly opposite the on/off button--side to side--so it's easy to turn your volume waaaay down or completely off while turning the phone on OR off. This bit me hard one day when I never heard a medical emergency phone call from my wife. This last problem is critical, but can be worked around by just paying attention to the problem.I'm not sorry I bought this phone. It is my first smartphone and without paying a lot for the phone or being tied into a contract, I now understand why folks are so crazy about them. The contract I chose is month to month and gives me all the calling and texting I'll ever need, as well as 5GB of data, which is fantastic for the price.Will I keep it? Heck, no.

I have a 2 year contract with T-mobile and it is not prepaid.  I had bought a used HTC G2, but it bricked after 1 year of use.  Since I purchased the HTC G2 used and it wasn't covered with warranty I was left to find a smart phone to use.  When I went to a T-mobile store, buying a smart phone from the kiosk would cost 350 and up.  The current flagship smartphone for T-Mobile is the HTC One S and has a list price of 599.  Even with the offer to split the payment over several months, the idea of spending that much for a smart phone that would be obsolete in a few years bothered me.  At almost half the price of what was being offered at T-mobile's kiosk, I found this phone.I quickly discovered there are many bargain android smart phones that are unlocked (can be used on multiple carriers).  If you are in the market to purchase a phone and already have a plan, be sure to check that the bandwidth frequencies are compatible.  Some of the 3g and 4g phones will work fine with AT&T; and not with T-Mobile (only EDGE).  I found while searching the budget android phones, screen size varies greatly.  Some of the cheaper phones around 100 seemed to have a smaller screen.  Given it is the primary input, I knew that typing text messages and emails on a tiny screen would be irritating unless it had a physical keyboard or large enough screen.The Samsung Exhibit II is now a little dated, but comes with Gingerbread and a bunch of unnecessary apps that cannot be uninstalled unless you root the phone.  Rooting the phone voids the warranty and is the only reason why I have not done so already.  The response to input on the phone is fairly snappy and runs smoothly even though the RAM is a little small.  The screen quality is surprisingly good and sharp.  Call quality is decent.  I was even able to make a video call with the phone and had no issue with it.  The battery life with this phone has been typical of android phones that I have used, lasting about a day with moderate use before needing to be recharged.  T-mobile's 4g network is very fast where I live, but is throttled after a certain amount of data has been used.  At this price range, I think it is an excellent value.The reason I have given this product an only average rating is that text messaging would not work for a week.  I went through all the typical troubleshooting methods and reset to factory default twice, contacted Samsung and T-mobile customer support to get text messages to send.  Samsung was very unhelpful and stated that issues with text messaging are an issue with the phone service provider.  T-mobile initially stated that it was Samsung's fault for not updating the drivers.  When going through the T-mobile's forums, it became clear that I am not the only one with this issue.  For a while the only way to send text messages was to disable the 4g and switch to EDGE.  This bothered me a lot as it became very annoying to switch every time I wanted to send a text message. I was originally going to return this phone, but decided to call T-mobile one more time.  The tech at T-mobile was able to fix the issue and stated that there was an error on their end and I am now able to send text messages.  I've now had this phone for over a month and have not had any other issues.On a related note, the customer service at Amazon was stellar.  I had called them stating my frustration with the product and how it was not operating as advertised.  The CSR was very friendly and answered all my questions regarding Amazon's return policy.

Most of the time, images even sent through text cannot go through, let alone be received which becomes really frustrating.There are also numerous posts on T-Mobile's forums about the same problem concerning texting and image texts that's spanned back to November 2011.

I browsed the internet wherever I went. I sent email. I watched YouTube videos on the go.

At random times text messages would simply come back saying \"Message not sent\".This frustrated me to no end. The bug seemed random, and happened regardless of message length and signal strength. The same messages would almost never send successfully, no matter how many times I retried. This happens more for some contacts than others. And, to make matters worse, sometimes the texts actually do get through, but the error is still there. A friend once received 12 copies of the same text from me.Now, a significant percentage of text messages simply doesn't get through. This is a basic feature that breaks the phone for me.

My wife likes playing games on it and just started to learn how to text.Thank you Amazon.Rudy", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the price, but it may not fit your needs", "Author": "Alexander Wilke", "ReviewID": "R39WN7DCAQ3DSI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I made the switch to T-Mobile about 4 months ago and I'm pleased with the service and especially the cost of the service.  I didn't want to buy the top-of-the-line phone either since I was trying to save money and this looked like a good entry-level phone.  I would say I think I got the best phone for the price, but in retrospect I think I would've been happier getting something slightly more powerful.One thing I am very pleased about is the ease of modding this phone.  I knew I had to get away from the TouchWiz interface and I wanted something newer than Gingerbread as well.  It took me a while to find the right set of instructions for rooting the phone, but once it was finally done I was just shocked at how simple it was.  With my last two HTC phones there was always some complicated unlocking process involving drivers and installing the Android SDK and such.  With this one I really only had to download a few files, put them on my SD card, reboot into recovery and flash them.  Easy!  The phone may actually run smoother on Gingerbread, but there were some JellyBean features and apps I just had to have.  So when I mention the performance just bear in mind I'm not running stock Android.The performance is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone.  It only has a 1Ghz single-core processor and 512MB of RAM.  It's fine for most apps, but some visually strenuous games or \"fully featured\" apps will make the phone choke.  I'm not a big phone gamer so it's not a big deal for me, but when I hear about a cool game it's frustrating when I can't even try it.  I think the RAM is the most limiting factor of the phone though.  I usually run Tasker on my phones but not on this one.  I figure it would choke even more often if it was running since some apps have a tough time running after a fresh reboot.  The most frustrating thing about the poor performance is when I'm playing music into my stereo over bluetooth.  I get a lot of skipping and pausing in songs when my phone is choking up.  Still, you may have none of these issues depending on your phone usage.One thing that is also an annoyance, and I think this is common for Samsung phones, is that there are three storage areas on the phone: Internal, SD, and External SD.  I imagine the first two are actually the same chip, they've just been split up, and the third is the removable SD card.  This is an annoyance because essentially nothing gets stored on the External SD [by default].  Using the app manager to move apps to the SD card is useless.  It just moves them from Internal memory to the Internal SD memory.  Unless your app can be configured to store data on the External SD card you'll have to manually move items to the External SD (pictures and videos, not apps), pull some storage tricks with root access, or just deal with the limited space.  This is one thing I definitely miss about my HTC phones.A couple things I also really miss, and this is mainly a consequence of trying to save money by getting a low-end smartphone, are the notification LED and the light sensor.  Other than auditory queues I really don't know when I get a notification unless I check my phone.  I've heard some apps can make the soft keys flash for notifications but that sounded like a really sad replacement.  Considering there's a front-facing camera I was really surprised that there's no light sensor (I would've preferred the latter over the former).  There is also an app that can use the brightness from the camera to adjust the screen brightness, but it wasn't very consistent.I think the USB port is in an inconvenient spot as well (on the top of the phone).  It makes the cord get in my way much more when I try to use it while it's plugged in.  One nice thing about running a custom ROM is the ability to flip the screen 180 degrees.I never really had a phone with a good camera, but this one is definitely grainy.  Really, unless you're outdoors or in a very bright room the LED doesn't help that much.  Speaking of the LED, I've only found one app that was able to turn on the LED as a flashlight.  My beloved Tesla LED app just didn't do it.Overall I like the phone, obviously there were things that had to be left out and corners that needed to be cut to keep the price low, but it's a good phone for what you pay.  Some of the complaints I had were simply design or implementation choices, but if you're willing to pay a bit more I think you can avoid the performance issues and lack of common Android features.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone not perfect", "Author": "Careful consumer", "ReviewID": "R3FJMMU9LD48JR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you like the simple life stick with the flip phone. This is not a bad phone, specially considering the price, the battery life is not great but with smart phones that is a given. The multitude of functions that these phones performs is amazing, usually at a sacrifice for privacy and the more apps you download the slower the phone gets. The manual is not much help, specially if this is your first smart phone. The sound for calls is good and clear, for me that is important.I took me a month to figure out most of what the phone can do. some functions that require internet connection are done with WIFI access unless you have unlimited data from your carrier, this is true for GPS navigation, the program has to download maps as you go. Some of the better apps cost money, the free ones are basic and you have to give up privacy and see commercials.As a phone it gives you the option of storing a lot of information with your contacts, which you have the option to back up thru your carrier or g-mail. The more expensive phones can cost 5 or 6 times what this one cost, or sign a contract, which I wasn't about to do. I like the freedom of changing carrier if I'm not satisfied with the service, off course you would have to unlock your phone to use it with someone else, which I'm not sure you can do with this one. If you are thinking of that possibility get one that is unlocked. I think that if you buy a phone you should be able to do what you want with it.I give this phone 4 stars because I don't have major issues with it, but it's not perfect. The screen sensitivity is not as responsive some times and you have to press several times. The power button has to be pressed several times to be turned on or off. As far as some frivolous functions such as videos, games and music, they eat up battery, you would have to charge the phone daily, for stand by for calls it could last 2 or 3 days with out charging.

I switched from Blackberry, so I miss the physical keyboard, and small size of my BB.Size: As Android phones go, this phone is one of the smaller ones.  It is almost the exact same size as the iphone, and even has a larger screen than the iphone.  Screen size to phone size ratio is among the best around.Weight: AverageSpeed: Web browsing is fast.  The phone sometimes takes 3-4 seconds to load the page with my corporate email - seems like a long time when you are staring at the screen.  Other than that it seems ok.Battery: Terrible.  But as I understand, all newer phones are like that - wish they would take a page from Blackberry and get a clueInternal memory: I've downloaded a few apps and seem to have more than enough memory left.Software: Phone installed an update the second day I had it, so it runs Gingerbread.  It came with all sorts of preloaded software I don't want, but since I seem to have plenty of memory left on the phone I'm not worried about it.Other: You have to download stuff and tweak settings to get it to do what you want, and it does not always comply.  I'm usually quite technically adept, but I set this thing to receive push email, and now for some reason it is not downloading new emails from my gmail.  So there is some setting messed up.  It is not like a blackberry, where everything just worked, but I think that is Android, not this particular phone.Accessories: Phone did not come with a memory card, but has alot of internal memory.  Came with a USB cable and with a very nice (very small) wall charger, and a SIM card.Delivery: Took Amazon 5 business days to get the thing out of their warehouse - it just kept stating status was \"shipping soon.\"  But once it shipped, it arrived in less than 18 hours.7/21 EDIT TO ADD: I am using this prepaid phone on a regular post paid TMobile plan, and it works just fine.  Just put in my own SIM card, called TMob and asked them to change my plan from Blackberry to regular data (no cost difference on my plan), and it works.  This was the least expensive option for me; TMob wanted $329 to buy the phone outright from them; Amazon was $189.Edit 7/21: Have had the phone a little over 2 weeks now.  Battery life is MUCH better if you physically turn off the device each time you are done using it - press button on upper right side.  I was not used to having to do this, as my Blackberry either turned itself off, or somehow did not use as much power.  Physically turning it off, I can get through a day on the battery.  Part of saving battery life is setting display brightness to about 5%, screen time out to 1 min, and touch key light to 6 seconds.  The 5% brightness is more than sufficient inside, but I cannot see the screen when outside.  Will have to find an app that adjusts brightness when outside.  Also, this particular android model has no LED light, so the phone lacks the visual notification that there is a new email or voice mail (ie like the BB blinking light).  I solved that by downloading an app called \"NoLED\" which is terrific, and even shows the time on the screen.  I'm getting used to the size of the phone; it is not as much of a problem as I anticipated, but still larger than my BB Pearl.  Other issues are all Android issues, but I'm getting used to them or solving them.  Gmail problem is solved, and a free app called \"SMS Unread\" can be downloaded and configured to show the number of unread emails in each gmail account.Update 12/22: At the five month mark, I'm reasonably satisfied with this phone. Biggest complaint about this phone is it's ridiculously terrible battery life.  I think this a shortcoming of non-Blackberry phones (ie all Android & Iphones) and not this specific phone.  A colleague who went from Blackberry to Iphone has the same problem.  As a result of the poor battery life, my screen is set to the absolute lowest brightness, so I can't see anything on the phone when in the car or outside (anything subject to natural light), which is the second worst thing about the phone.  I probably use less than 45 minutes a day of cell, and check it occasionally; battery really should last longer and allow for brighter screen setting so it can be seen in a car.  Third on list of gripes is that it is not as fast as my friends Iphone5, but it is not a $700 phone either.  I'll keep the $520 I saved and wait a few seconds for the phone to respond to certain commands.  I'm told this is because the memory is filling up; I'd like a way to get rid of all the preloaded programs for which I have no use.  Rooting will do this, but the root procedure for this model supposedly breaks it's ability to call 911, so I'm not interested in that.On the ok side, the picture quality is better than my BB, not stellar, but not bad enough to change phones. Seems lately to have developed a problem connecting via USB to the computer to download pics, but that might be Android, not this model of phone.  I've also had an issue where I try to dial a number and it immediately disconnects.  I pull the battery and let it restart and everything works fine.  I don't know if this is caused by the phone, the OS or Tmobile.On the plus side, I've dropped it numerous times and the screen does NOT crack like iphones do.  I find this one of the major advantages. The other advantage that I LOVE is the TMo Wifi calling - as long as I have a wifi connection, the cell part of the phone makes and receives calls regardless of the strength of cell coverage.  Third advantage (silver lining in the cloud?) is that even though it does not have a hard keyboard (which I miss), it comes preloaded with \"swype\" for entering your text/numbers.  This works pretty well, and makes entering text bearable, and apparently a feature like this does not come preloaded on iphones, because a few iphone users have marveled at this feature.  I have no issues with sound quality on the cell, both regular and on speaker phone, and internet connection seems to work at a nice clip.  Web pages are displayed crisply, so screen resolution is good.Overall, I'm pleased with the phone and pleased with the price.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "great smart phone for the money", "Author": "beepbeep72", "ReviewID": "R10B4FY0NM6N6A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only had it for less than a week, but I'm really digging this phone. It's my first smart phone, so I'm not speaking with tons of experience.There is a bunch of bloatware on this phone. I installed the ZergRush root:(...)And then Titanium Back-up app which allows backing-up to the SD card and removal of all the crap.Worked great. Still exploring all the capabilities this phone has.The voice recognition seems to work really well. I've used it a few times with the Google search function when I didn't feel like typing.It has locked-up once while surfing the web which required a battery pull. Re-booted with no ill-effects.A primary attraction to this phone was the availability of T-mobile's $30/mo 100 min/unlimited text and data plan. I wanted a smart phone on a monthly plan, but not the typical $70/mo charge you've got with a contract. For me, this is an ideal package as I'm not a big talker.That being said, read the fine print. This plan is only available via Walmart and T-mobile.com. The catch is that going through either of these sources makes it difficult or impossible to port your old number.To activate my phone, I called T-mobile's porting resolution number at 877-789-3106. They activated my phone and ported my old number, but then despite my request, set me up with the $50/mo unlimited plan. I had to call customer service and do some arm twisting to get on the \"Walmart plan\".In hindsight, it may have been easier to have paid an extra 10 bucks and bought the phone from Walmart.8/8/2012 UPDATE:This sucker runs HOT. Gets pretty warm while websurfing and streaming. Gets scalding hot while running Navigation. It's locked up a few times while running navigation. Pretty much the worst time to have to shut down and restart your phone (while driving).This last time when trying to restart, I got a message stating the battery was too hot, or something to that effect. I've started removing the case when using the Navigation.I'm pretty sure these symptoms are leading up to premature battery failure. Time will tell. Might try a different case to alleviate the issue.Other than that, I'm really happy with the phone.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent phone, not just for prepaid!", "Author": "P.

Let me go back and say that the reason my monthly contract is so cheap is because I opted to pay full price for phones to roll the savings into my bill. Anyway, instead of looking to buy a cheap used replacement phone, I looked at prepaid options. Amazon had the cheapest deals. I ordered the Samsung Exhibit II. When it arrived, I stuck my sim card in (instead of the prepaid sim), turned it on and started using it immediately. I was blown away by all the features. Wi-Fi calling is the best. I had mediocre signal strength with my previous phone, but when using my home internet I never drop calls. Using the Wi-Fi at home also saves on data, even though I have unlimited data. My only complaint is the amount of bloatware that came installed on the phone. It takes up a substantial amount of space. What I did was purchase a 32gb micro sd card and saved all of my downloads to the card. I also purchased a tpu gel skin case for the phone through Amazon. It offers excellent protection without bulk.

These are the samsung's attributes in relation to the above 2.+ The Samsung has a quick to locate GPS, which is great for walking navigation.  The triumph had a horrible GPS that quite frankly took 5 minutes sometimes to \"lock\".+ The Samsung has a bright and beautiful display.  It is much bigger than the Optimus V display (but the Motorola Triumph does have a bigger display, although not necessarily brighter).+ The Samsung battery life is phenomenal.  I went 24 hours of medium/light usage and still had about 10% at the end of the day.+ The Samsung is relatively stable.  I haven't had a crash or reboot outside of those created by \"flaky apps\".  The Triumph had numerous problems with stability in regards to it's screen appearing washed out.  The Optimus needed to be reset every day or 2 otherwise it would no longer be able to use data.  The Samsung for me is very solid.- The Samsung is a little laggy when coming out of hibernation.  Both the Optimus V and the Triumph were not nearly as bad as the Samsung.- T-Mobile did a real \"number\" on this phone and installed a lot of bloatware.So the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of five is really the bloatware.  The lag is not that bad since it disappears shortly after waking up.  So onto the bloatware.  The bloatware will reduce your battery life.

Jaros", "ReviewID": "RY5AD8K1P2GUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*** UPDATE ***T-Mobile updated the firmware on this phone to Android 2.3.6. The difference is huge! My review below reflects on my experience using Android 2.3.5. Most of the issues have been resolved. While the phone still lacks memory, it manages it much better now. Instead of running out of memory and crashing all the time, the phone will now close unused applications before that happens. It also feels much snappier overall. For some reason though, the phone had somewhat better reception using the old firmware, taking off a star.*** END UPDATE ***The Samsung Exhibit II 4G could be a real game changer for prepaid phones.  Unlike almost every prepaid phone out there, it has a high resolution 480x800 screen, runs Android 2.3.5 and has a fast 1GHz processor.  Alas, Samsung did not want this phone to become a viable alternative to its far more expensive Galaxy S line and equipped this phone with not enough memory to truly give you all the benefits of a smart phone.First off, there are many things to like.  The screen is bright with vibrant colors and crisp text thanks to its higher resolution.  The included 3MP camera makes great pictures, comparable to regular 3MP cameras back when they were popular.  I especially like that the phone does not compress the pictures too much like many other phones, leaving the pictures largely free of visible artifacts.  I had a 5MP Nokia with Zeiss optics, but the pictures on this 3MP phone look WAY better.  The reception is also excellent, even in difficult locations, such as on the Staten Island Ferry.  This phone does not lose signal for the duration of the trip, unlike some other phones.  Don't expect good data connection though when the signal is poor.  Finally, you can use this phone with any T-Mobile sim card.  T-Mobile offers discounted plans if you don't require a subsidized phone.  This prepaid version costs much less than MSRP but will still work with your existing T-Mobile sim card.Sadly, the phone also has some major drawbacks, the biggest one being a lack of RAM.  The phone advertises 512MB of RAM, but only 356MB are accessible.  Preloaded and system apps take up the bulk of available memory, leaving you with about 100MB of available RAM, give or take,  at any given time.  If you like apps, that's not enough.  Many apps, including the most popular ones like words with friends, install services that run in the background.  They can use easily 6-40MB each.  Download 4 Zynga games and you are out of RAM.  Once the phone runs out of RAM, it slows down and crashes.  Forget multi-tasking.  The app widget which lets you close applications and free RAM will become your best friend.You could root this phone and remove some useless T-Mobile apps to free up some RAM but that would void your warranty and probably not help a whole lot.  If the phone had 1GB of RAM, it would have been perfect.Overall, this can be a great phone if you want a smart phone but do not plan on installing many apps. If you want a phone that can truly take advantage of a high resolution screen and a snappy processor, this one is not it.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3OC954CVKYQ7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am enjoying my phone (the samsung exibit II 4G) so much that when I told my daughter about it she wanted one too so, this one is for her.

I had the Samsung Galaxy Prevail for Boost and it wasn't so great. The internal memory for it was horrible, and I was constantly having to remove the battery to reset it.The Exhibit II is a great phone, though. I have been having problems with it slowing down, and that is mostly because of the amount of bloatware T-Mobile put on this phone. I rooted it, and froze the bloatware and the phone is blazing fast! I have also moved all the programs I can to the micro-SD card when possible. Angry Birds Space runs just fine on the phone, and doesn't slow it down if I need to quickly look up a map or webpage. The system monitor widget is great - and it comes pre-loaded on the phone. I'm a little stunned at how much RAM is being sucked up by background apps running, but I'm working on a fix for it.The only thing I don't really like about the phone is that it is hard to hold onto. I haven't been able to find many choices in cases with belt clips, either. The rear camera is only 3.2mp, but that doesn't mean the pictures look horrible. It's a little tricky trying to take a picture with the light, but this is also my first phone with an LED light, so it may just be user error.The internal storage for the phone is adequate. I've downloaded at least a dozen apps for the phone and haven't had a problem with memory being compromised. The battery life is good for me, but I'm not a heavy cell phone user. I'll text and surf the web, but not a lot of talking.Just in case someone is having problems with the phone powering up after it has been idle for a while, Samsung programs their phones to go into a battery saver mode which is like a deep. It may take a few seconds for the phone to wake up from this - it's not a defect or anything. I learned this recently after perusing some Android developers forums.The network and WiFi connectivity is really good with this phone, and is also pretty fast. YMMV. I have had a problem with sending text messages. I would spent literally 5 minutes trying to send a message even when I had good connectivity to the network.

My Nokia and Motorola had them built in already.Now, the phone... Display is readable, but small. Very sluggish writing emails, means waiting for the text to appear or the keypad to respond. I really hate the Samsung keyboard and I especially hate the predictive text, which is more wrong than anything. Text editing is screwy too and they place a big honkin pointer in the way. The back plastic is flimsy, so get a case for it! The phone is easy to configure and to add apps. The camera sucks and lacks decent options. Not enough internal memory and the processor is slow, sometimes it kicks out of programs. The phone is 3G/4G... Not LTE, like some think. It did come with Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread. The touch screen itself is responsive, sometimes too much. The voice quality gets ruined by the micro processing other things, such as text or or updates or email or social updates or anti-virus software, etc... The WiFi works good. When dialing numbers, there's is a huge delay and sometimes I need to reboot the phone.2013 Oct 02 - The device definitely doesn't have enough RAM or processing power and there seem to be many bugs in the software to be fixed. When running some applications, such as Facebook or Google Chrome, the phone runs out of memory and exits the software. This happens a lot! And FB is bloated, so it will also slow the phone down considerably, sometimes to a halt. Some programs, such as FB (again) remain memory resident, so when making phone calls it will hang up and exit the phone dialer app. It's quite frustrating when this happens, since you're on the phone trying to talk to someone. Before making phone calls, flush your RAM (there's a utility for this). I was able to set up the phone as a WiFi device, but T-Mobile will not allow tethering for the internet. Oddly, my old garbage Nokia Neuron 5230 will allow internet tethering! My internet through T-Mobile is a 10 dollar a month GSM. It's slow in comparison, but gets 480kbs still. I was also able to use Bluetooth to create a tether and share files between my two laptops, tablet and this phone.2013 Oct 15 - The RAM issue IS a problem! Especially if you use Facebook, even a little. The Samsung software chews up 197MB of RAM, leaving you with 330MB in which a few apps will easily chew up (when apps chew up to 300MB, the phone runs even worse). The phone has a habit of kicking you out of apps. The BIGGEST problem by far is that it will not let you make a phone call!!! It's easier to reboot the phone than to play with it and get it to make a phone call. I don't think Samsung intended this CELL PHONE to be used as a device to make calls, otherwise, this would not be an issue. It also tries to force you to add everyone's dialed number into your contacts, which is irritating. Using the internet is very very very slow, like 2 or 3 minutes slow. Ugh!!! If anyone knows of a solution or a better replacement app, I am all ears!2014 Jun 02 - I cannot wait to get a better phone! Do not install social media, in fact try to keep your apps to a very minimum. This phone doesn't like making or receiving phone calls. I hate that the voice quality takes a back seat to everything else, so communication will suddenly stop and can take a minute. During this minute, people will hang up on you, since they think you lost contact. The contact book just totally sucks! I would like to set up a person and list all their phone numbers under them. You cannot and the name field is ONLY one field with a very limited number of characters, so you abbreviate. The LookOut AV is a pain in the Buddha and takes a long time. I'm rebooting this stupid cell phone twice a day now for two main reason; 1) It will not make a phone call unless I reboot it first. 2) The time will not advance unless I reboot. The alarm clock sometimes works. The Calendar alarm is one stupid bleep. Samsung has not updated the software since I purchased it 10 months ago. One last thing, The phone sometimes will freeze and vibrate. I have awakened several times to find it connected to my charger with a dead battery. I experience this during the day too, usually I catch it in time. The fix is to remove the battery, re-install it and reboot twice, since the first reboot usually is messed up. There are too many reasons to stay away from this phone. Save up a little more and get a dual processor with at least 1GB of user RAM (after the Mfrs software is installed).

This only happens when you have alot of apps open at the same time. But for $200 not bad at all.

I once had a SE neo pro with separate keyboard (there are only a few). But the battery was exhausted very quick so I gave it back.Then I found this one surfing the T-mobile site for a new plan. Samsung is also a favorite brand and at the first view it seems to have everything that I like / need:- not too big (3,7\") but very good res of 800x480- nice appearance- expandale memory (up to 32 GB)So I decided to buy it with the monthly plan for $30 with 100min talk and rest unlimited.I like this phone very much but there are some things to mention.- You can't get this phone / plan in a T-mobile shop. They treated me not like a customer. When I stepped into the shop it took them a while to realise that a customer is there (there was nobody else). Then they just said I can order it only online. Also the SIM card. So I ordered the SIM card at T-mobile online and the phone at Amazon bc it cost $249 at T-mobile (one day later ist was $349!).But what I didn't know was that the SIM card is included in the package. This is not mentioned here!!! (Fortunately the SIM card is only $2.49 + tax or so)- The battery is exhausted also within a day even if I do not play surf or text (much) and the brightness is as low as possible. GPS and WiFi is turned off. I can't believe it. But it seems that I have to get used to it. My \"stupid\" phones only need to be charged once a week!- sometimes it is slow (ie playing angry birds or writing a text) although I only run one or two apps. Is the single core from Qualcomm so slow? Or as there an update running?- I assumed that 4G is faster. But it may depend on where I am. (ie. in a building with thick walls...)- Tethering: Not working with the monthly plan (100min voice, unlimited text, unlimited data (up to 5GB with 4G). This said the guy in a store.

Im 34 years old and i never bought one before now because the pricing on these phones and their plans are pretty high. I've always wanted one tho and my sister said she would pay $100 towards one for me as a christmas present.This is the one i picked.After much shopping i had actually given up on picking a smart phone because i had no idea what the heck to choose. Its like buying a PC now.I decided to just get a cheap old $20 prepaid one when i discovered this phone and its reviews 4th down on the search list.I've used it for a couple of weeks now and i love it.You see differing opinions on the battery life and ill tell you why from my experience. For standby mode and texting and calling the battery is pretty amazing, it will last a very long time but if you want to run any game apps it drains it super fast! Its not too bad or anything but i believe thats why you see the different opinions on the battery life.I've had a couple issues but overall so far its pretty fantastic. It has reset itself a couple of times and the power button itself is kind of horrible with the protective cover on it. I have to hold the power button in for at least 10 seconds before it will actually power on but turning it off is far more simple. I dont know if thats normal for all of these types of phones or not. I find it to be a little bit frustrating.I was able to get the \"Walmart exclusive\" $30 monthly plan for 100 minutes and unlimited web and text. That was a very small hassle. Before even purchasing the phone i had called tmobile and asked them about it and they said i could get it no problem, then when i called back after receiving my phone they said i didnt buy it from Walmart and yada yada i had to talk to a few people before they would activate that plan for me.Good luck with that!I personally enjoy playing video games so i love them on this phone, it does drain the battery fast but its not so bad if youre just going to casually play something. I havent really timed it or anything but it seems you can get about 5 hours of use if you play game apps for that long before having to recharge it. When i left it on standby for an entire day and texted a few times the battery was at 91% i thought that was pretty cool.Loving the phone so far especially at that price.

Kline", "ReviewID": "R2S05OW7QLVKZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like so many other reviewers, I bought this specifically for the Wal-Mart $30 plan that gives you 100 Minutes, but 5GB of 4G data and unlimited txts. Specifically, I bought this cheaper phone as a test bed to see if I *could* get the $30 plan, if 4G works well in my area and how easily I can run VOIP solutions to overcome the 100 minute limitation. If all works out, I will then buy the nicer Galaxy S2, which I already have on Sprint and sell this one. I will then port my old number via Google Voice to have my original cell number, which I've had for several years on this phone. I will probably not port the number directly to T-Mobile just to avoid headaches.Anyhow, I chose to purchase this off Amazon for the lack of sales tax, Prime shipping and easy return policy (if needed).I've had the phone for a few hours and, being Android-savvy, can declare that it's a very nice, basic Android phone. My current S2 still runs Gingerbread 2.3.5 and I refuse to go up to 3.0 or 4.0. Seeing as how the Exhibit still has 2.3.5, this works well for me.My biggest question was whether I was going to be able to get the $30 Wal-Mart plan at all. Other reviewers said it was pretty easy (don't call in to cust support, do everything online), so I bought the phone. During activation, which you should do in front of your computer, you will be presented with all the T-Mobile prepaid plans, including the $30 Wal-Mart special. As long as this is a NEW activation, that plan will present itself. It did for me, I signed up for it, paid the $30 and off I went. I have a new number, which I quite like actually, but that will be a moot point later on down the road.I am now working on the $30 plan with zero issues. 4G is indeed in my area and is working inside my house. It is very fast and a world of difference over Sprint 3G. Yes, Sprint has 4G, but not for 75 miles from my house.Anyhow, the Exhibit is simply a smaller version of the Galaxy S2, as far as I'm concerned. The screen is smaller, the phone is slightly slower in all aspects, but it's still a great phone. If you are not a power user, the Exhibit is all you need. It is very much simply the Galaxy's little brother.I will perform several additions/edits to this review over the next couple of days. There hasn't been a good, detailed, more-than-two-sentence review on this phone since mid-2012, so I wanted to interject a detailed, recent review here in 2013.In summary, if you want a functional, solid Android phone and you want the 5GB of 4G data and you want it for a measly $30, then this is the one to get. No questions asked. If you want a more powerful phone, get the Galaxy S2.

Knox", "ReviewID": "R3PH9EMYZ3269Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone after nearly a year of dealing with crappy handmedown phones and Tmobile being completely unsympathetic to it's contract customer. I signed a 2 year agreement and thought a great bargain on a new phone would be a part of the deal. apparently, \"they dont do that anymore.\" The very best I could get was an Optimus T(?) for $150. Anything else was much more, \"discounted.\" I didn't really have that money at the time, and I know a few people with the Optimus T who weren't all that happy with it. So, I figured I'd wait until the time was right.The Exhibit II is really the perfect balance between smartphone geek and budget freak. For under $200, I was expecting a lot less than this. The next lowest in price as far as a \"prepaid\" phone is the Samsung Dart. Ive seen this phone before, and even its size alone fails to thrill. But the Exhibit II has a large, brightly lit screen, and endless possibilities.Pros: Lightweight, yet doesnt have a cheap feel.Android 2.3.5 is arguably the most stable Android out there. I have a tablet that runs on 3.2, and despite it being out for a bit, still has some quirks. Most apps are hand crafted to 2.3, and it really just does everything you could possibly want. Most legit apps will run just fine, maybe some shady ones will too.Video and music Playback/streaming is great. I was surprised to get netflix up and running on my phone! No, it doesn't have beats audio or anything, but sound is good for hooking up to headphones and listening on the go.Camera/video chat-As I said, this phone isn't $400, so don't expect a Canon SLR camera here. Its, alright. It will take a good picture in good light, and a mediocre one in any other setting. But, to my surprise, the video chat is much better than expected. I could see and hear clearly, and my mom said she could see and hear me fine as well.Not sure if this is android particular, but here's a few other little cool things:The phone is basically dummy proof--for most things that even seem confusing, all the way down to the keyboard...theres a tutorial nearby.The alarm has so many things to it, such as a pre-alarm to wake you up lightly, and then the regular alarm. Snooze is adjustable, etc...simple stuff.Expandable memory--this really gives you space galore for everything!Cons:For some god awful reason there is not a camera button! you have to open the camera app, and take a picture through a button in the UI. Not a deal breaker, but just seems strange. There really is space for the button...The screen lock is a little annoying. It doesn't give you an option to take the lock off or change it, and its this annoying swipe action that for some reason gets annoying if you don't keep your phone screen on too long.I've experienced force closes. But...I can't say for sure this has to do with the phone. I have them on my tablet as well, and I even had them on my Windows computer. Maybe I just visit the wrong sites!Overall, I can say it is a great phone for someone who wants a nice, well functioning smartphone with *some* of the bells and whistles, but certainly not all of them. I guess if I could describe the Exhibit II, it would be practical. The screen is nice, the sound and video is nice, and the specs on it are on point with the medium, but not big boys. No, it doesn't have Galaxy or whatever specs...but I figure, you must REALLY be a stickler for it to pay that much more. If you aren't...this is the everyman's smart phone.*edit* 1/9/12--I will still stand at four stars...but I have encountered some other quirks. The 356mb RAM seems to be always half used despite doing absolutely nothing. I've cleared it and as many as 12 phantom applications are taking it up--plus just functioning takes up a third! Don't bost the ability to switch apps if you can only have two running without getting laggy.My theory still stands that they skimped in the \"right\" places to get the lower price. The screen is not small...but the keyboard has given me a run for my money. Its not tiny, but its that \"tenth of an inch\" missing that definitely makes it seem like my piano fingers are sausage links. Even portrait gets awkward.also, as I said about the lag...wouldn't likely be experienced with a galaxy.I haven't had major battery issues. Then again I don't browse the internet for 5 hours straight.But otherwise, if you want a fully functioning (but not perfect!) Smartphone, this is a great phone for a moderate user.9/17/12-Update. Yes, its been nearly 9 months with this phone. It updated to 2.3.6 and quickly went downhill. It would restart itself, force close, freeze, and just lag. So, I took the dive.I tediously studied for hours rooting the phone. Mine is now running on Cyanogen 9. It was not easy (apparently the simple rooting doesn't work on 2.3.6).

(In case your phone dies on you when you don't have a charger around, you can have an extra battery ready to pop in.)- Don't install many apps on this phone.

What it has trouble doing is what makes this a bad purchase. Prior to this I was using a 10 year old razr, same network same everything, though this is the most I've ever spent on a phone, as a phone it is the worst I've owned. When I say it drops calls I don't mean a few I mean every one that lasts longer than 10 mins. It is not my reception, it is not the network it's the phone. When it isn't dropping the calls it is constantly cutting in and out. A phone call with me typically sound like: \"Hello? Wait what that last part cut out. wait say that again. hello?\" dial again because it hung up.On top of this the phone is extremely slow, doesn't seem to matter much at first but when you have to make a call or want to snap a picture in a timely manner the steps between unlocking the device, getting to the phone part, getting to the contact list, selecting your contact and hitting call are all separated by 3-5 second delays which becomes extremely annoying. I don't have many apps running or even an animated wallpaper, nothing to bog the phone down. I could imagine if there were ever an actual emergency the 15-20 seconds you'd have to wait before you could dial 911 could result in some real consequences.Typically the phone will not connect your call the first time, I have gotten into the habit of not even holding it to my ear when I dial because I'm waiting for the half ring/click of the phone giving up.I do not know if this is all smart phones being as this is my first one but one of the most aggravating things about this phone, when you make a call that requires you to press 1 for english or use the keypad you MUST have the phone on speaker, by the time you take it away from your ear and get the screen back on, then get the number pad to come up you have already missed the time allotted to press your number.The touch screen is boggy at times, occasionally areas simply do not work or you have to press/slide several times before it will pick it up. It isn't every time but it adds to the inconvenience and the time it takes to make a call.The things I like about this phone seem to be standard for most smart phones. I like the text message set up in instant messaging form. I like the android os. The google play store is great. I enjoy the customization options, though often I have several games in a folder and for no reason one will just disappear and I'll have to re-ad it.  The camera is okay quality, there is no zoom which can be a bit annoying but being as though it would be nothing more than a digital zoom cropping the photo in image software and zooming into the area isn't that much extra work.I gave this two stars because while I enjoy the android os and the phone works well as a light gaming platform it fails as a phone. Considering the 10 year old razr I had before this and the even older motorolla I used before that never had issues with dropped calls or call quality I certainly don't consider this an improvement for everything a cell phone is supposed to do.  The extras are nice but if I can't do what you bought it to do it just isn't something I could recommend. I would like this phone much more if it just worked better. While I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a phone I would be open to trying a samsung phone again because while it has good features the usability simply isn't there in this model.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "you get what you pay for...", "Author": "Mel0804", "ReviewID": "R3U7A1958671NV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is a nice size and has all the functions i need.

I have been a T-Mobile user for about 3-4 years now and was using the Samsung Gravity 2. I have an iPod Touch, which I used for all my \"smartphone\" needs (email, facebook, etch...). Though my phone worked fine, I decided it was time for an upgrade. I wanted a smartphone but due to the fact that I would need a expensive data plan and two year contract, I never took the plunge. After some internet research however, I found out that you can use smart phones without a data plan. I purchased this phone, turned data off on my account, and am now happily using my Exhibit without the extra data charge, and without renewing my contract. Some might think that not having data would kill the point of the smart phone, but since I have wifi at work, school, and at home, it works out fine. Now on to the hardware.This phone is amazing quality for $180. Not only does it have high resolution touch screen, it has a front facing camera, 3MP auto focus back camera, great battery life, and a perfect form factor. Since you can see the specs up in the descriptions, let me talk about the operating system.As a first time Android user coming from iOS, I was super excited for the customization features of the Android system, as iOS lacks in that area. I can happily tell you that Android is the most customizable operating system I have ever tried. You can litterally make it look like any phone or OS you want. It is functional, the app selection is superb, and the options on it are extensive (from custom keyboards, interfaces, icons, etch). This phone comes with the Samsung interface called touchwiz, which makes some of the basic functions a little easier.Now while this phone is great, there are its drawbacks. T-Mobile puts a lot of junk apps on it that cannot be removed unless you root (sort of like jailbreaking an iPhone). This was a great annoyance and so I rooted and installed a custom rom called Peach Sunrise. For those who don't know, a rom is basically the operating system of the phone. There are many of them and can add lots of cool features to your phone (though it does void your warranty). Peach Sunrise is identical to the default phone rom but is streamlined to be fast, and doesn't have any of the annoying T-Mobile pre-installed apps (Lookout Anti-virus and Slacker radio are two notable ones). After flashing this rom my phone has been wonderful to use. Its faster and more powerful, like the phone should have been from the first. I highly recommend it to anyone.Overall this is a great phone and well worth the $180.Overall this phone is great!

First of all, there is a big discussion about whether or not you can activate the $30 plan [100 minutes, 5GB of 4G data] susposedly exclusive to walmart when you buy the phone from here. Now, I can't say that you can do it in all circumstances, but let me just say that it is possible since I was able to do this.  All I did was follow the tmobile online activation.  I didn't call anyone (I don't think you can do it if you call, unless you pester them into doing it for you).  I also activated a temporary number, but plan to transfer my virgin mobile number later.  You don't need to buy an activation kit from tmobile.com, you can use the one that came with the phone.*PROS*-Display Screen is very nice. Coming from a 3.2 inch Optimus V.-Phone is fast (1 Ghz). You won't see much lag if any.-Wifi speed is fast. (I compared it to other phones and this one consistenly is faster)-Size is perfect for pocket. (Same size as Optimus V but thinner with larger screen)-Front facing camera for chat. (Works with Skype/google voice)*CONS*-No zoom on the back camera-pictures are a bit grainy with the back camera. (3.2 Megapixels - a bit disappointing)-4G connection is slow. The best I've seen is 800 mbps download. I was getting much better on 3G from Virgin Mobile.-Takes forever to charge.

She loves it, except for a few very annoying and very basic missing functions:When she sets up an alarm clock and shuts the phone down, the phone will not wake up or turn on at all. She has to leave the phone on at all times for the alarm clock to work. It's annoying. We like to turn our phone off at night so we don't get any phone calls. I tried all the possible options I can think of, but no luck. I'm no rookie when it comes to smart phones :) The only other work around is to switch the phone to Silent mode, then it works. But like I said, we like to turn our phones off at night. It works on any of my other phones or any phone I ever had, even a \"dumb\" phone... It's a shame that the most popular phone OS doesn't have such a very basic function. I don't get it. Also, snooze function could be better too. I have Nokia N900 with Maemo OS, and I love its snooze options, you can either touch the snooze button on the screen, or flip the phone face down if you don't feel like searching for the button when you're sleepy.What she also dislikes about this phone is that it doesn't keep notifying you that you have a text message. It only does it once, immediately when you get it. So, when you're in a noisy environment and you miss that 1st notification, you won't know you have a message until you check it yourself manually. It's very annoying to keep checking / unlocking your phone all the time, just to make sure you didn't miss an important message... A short beep or vibration would be nice. (at least, I can't find the option - anybody?)Otherwise, it's a very nice phone. I just popped my wife's old sim card in, turned the phone on and she was good to go, no issues whatsoever. Call quality is good. Battery could last longer, but that's an issue with practically all smart phones today. Oh, one more annoying thing - when it finishes charging, it beeps loudly, so it wakes you up sometimes.The camera is decent. Good enough for a phone that costs less than $200.Not much else to say, others already did. For less than $200 for a no contract phone that has all the features of a contract phone, you can't beat it. Despite the issues mentioned, she still loves it, and I would still buy it for her.

I used one prepaid T-Mobile card on each one as they were purchased, then I unlocked it and signed up with PureTalkUSA.  Unlocking was completely painless (which is the main reason I bought a 3rd one).  Now I have unlimited talk and text plus a second account for a total outgo of about $40 a month.  I really like the Android operating system and the phone is tough and attractive.  It's a bit small if you don't have good eyesight and at times my big hands miss the icon I'm aiming at.All I have installed is the Amazon Store app and Amazon mp3 player, Opera Mobile browser, NQ Mobile security and an improved file manager.  I installed SanDisk 32GB SD cards in both phones; just pop them in and boot.The only real downside is the bloatware. Sometimes I fill the memory and most of it is bloatware.  Clicking the NQ Optimizer button clears enough memory to continue using the phone, but shutting down the bloatware does no good; these useless apps just start back up.  If this problem was just a little less severe I would just live with it, but it looks like I will have to root all three of these phones.  The bloatware just doesn't leave enough memory for the average users needed apps.Update: I have now unlocked and rooted this phone; both operations are simplistic if approached correctly.  Unlocking is a snap and rooting only has one pitfall.  Don't try to root with the one click applications; I tried that way and after several attempts overseen by the software authors (and installing a lot of java ME libraries on my laptop) we all gave up.  The easy way can be found documented on theunlockr dot com site.  The biggest gotcha is that clockwork mod must be installed *first* (cwm.6012.t679.zip).  If you do that and then install root (root-stock.zip) you are rooted.  NOTE: reboot as soon as you are rooted and then run a root checking program (there is a good one available here on Amazon (Root Analyzer). For about $7 you can then purchase Root Explorer and upgrade Superuser to Superuser Elite and download Root App Delete on Google Play.  Root App Delete is a great application for uninstalling bloatware; the apps are listed as Unknowns (user installed or bundled popular apps) which can be safely uninstalled; operating system apps and kernel modules are listed as such (leave them alone, NOTOUCH etc.).  I also run RAM Control Extreme; note that this app needs to be configured not to kill things while you are using them, but when configured properly it will clean things up in the background without even bothering you (I configured it to run every 30 min.).  I suppose these modifications carry some risk, but nothing bad has happened to me and I see lots of similar testimonials out there.With about 2 hours work I was rooted and another hour of uninstalling and my memory stays about 49% used if controlled by a good Android Ram Manager (was as much as 90+ percent used before and most of it bloatware).  The phone boots faster and runs faster and the changes are transparent.  I lost no functionality.  Better yet I can now use apps which require root access.With a little work and a little additional expense I now have a phone that cost about $200 that is (at least) equal to the $600 \"Unlocked International version\"). With a pocketful of sims I can use this phone anywhere in the world. This phone is a great buy compared to the price of competitors.  Recommended.Update: I have flashed my personal T679 with Cyanogenmod and like this phone even better.  I overclocked it to 1024 MHz (stock is a little under 300) and after about a week I hit the right combination of hot temperature and working the phone to cause it to hang once.  I dropped it back to 806 MHz and after 3 weeks still no problems and I work this phone as hard as some people work their tablets.  The obvious tradeoff is that the battery drains faster with it overclocked.  For me that isn't a problem; I have chargers everywhere (desk, pickup, bed stand, etc.) and I work it most of the time plugged in.  I am a little rough on my phones no doubt in the same sense a racer is rough on his wheels but that's what I bought it for.Cyanogenmod also has much better memory control built in.  It is just about perfect for me now; liking it better all the time.  Glad I bought these phones.

I would have to say that, overall, I'm disappointed. The biggest problem is the lack of responsiveness. Here are some issues.1. When inputting pass code, there is sometimes a long delay between the time you press a key and when the number appears on the screen. As a result, I often find myself having to re-enter the pass code three or four times.2. There is occasionally a long delay before the app icons appear on the screen. (I've never timed this, but I'd say there may be a delay as long as 15~20 seconds. Doesn't sound terrible, but it's a pain when you have to wait.)3. Frequently, the screen takes a long time to switch from horizontal to vertical orientation (and vice versa). In fact, I sometimes have to move the phone back and forth many times before it will switch.4. On several occasions, the phone will not dial out. I have to restart it, which takes a few minutes.I live with the imperfections because one cannot expect the best phones with prepaid plans. I guess those of us that want to save a few bucks on a monthly plan, have to live with second-rate products------------------I've now had the phone about a year. The problems remain, and are even more frustrating. I really dislike the phone, but I'm too cheap to get another phone after spending almost $200 on this less than a year ago.

Unfortunately the one I received did not live up to those good reviews. So here is how it went for me:1. The plastic packaging on the phone was partly cut open when I received it. Since the phone looked brand new, I didn't think it was a problem and just went ahead and used it (opened the cardboard box). I never cut into any plastic to open it. Nothing else in the package was opened or touched as far as I could tell.2. The phone is not able to code it's own number into the SIM. So when you go to the phone status and check your own number, it simple says \"Unknown\". After spending hours searching for a solution on my own, contacting t-mobile support through chat and phone as well as going to a t-mobile store, the issue was never resolved. Their \"solutions\" ranged from wait and see to \"it can't be done\" and often contradicted each other as well. This seems to be a common issue with many t-mobile phones and the solutions \"vary\", none of which worked for me. Anyone can search the t-mobile support forum and I suggest doing that before buying a phone.3. The phone froze a few times. Initially I could hold the power button down to get it to reboot, but later only removing the battery would solve the problem. That's just unacceptable. T-mobile knows of this problem as well: [..]They blame 3rd party apps and lack of phone maintenance (rebooting). Well, I never installed any apps and I rebooted the phone far more often than I would have liked (several times a day to try and solve the above problem). It is loaded with bloatware, far far more than my Gio and my guess would be that is the reason for freeze-ups.4. The battery seems to drain very quickly and not unless I put it into constant power saving mode could it last a whole day. The first day I had it, I had to charge it 3x to keep it going after charging it fully to start with. I never even used up the entire $3.34 that is given as a starter credit, so making a ton of calls is not what used up the battery.I have a Samsung Gio that has never frozen up and the battery lasts for a couple of days even before needed a recharge. I put the t-mobile SIM it in and it could not code the number into it either. It has in the past coded numbers into other SIMs so I know it is capable of it. When I told t-mobile support this, he they told me that the Gio is not capable to code SIMs. I told him it can and does other ones just fine. He just went silent. I think T-Mobile's SIM is either defective or their methodology for over the air updates has some issues.I've returned the Exhibit II and will not buy another one. While the T-mobile staff are friendly and willing to help (almost all), it was mostly just a waste of my time.

She's a major texter, sending/receiving between 7,000 and 8,000 texts per month.  This phone would cut off her outbound text messages if they were more than one page long and display an error message to both her and the recipient.  The rest of the text messages wouldn't go through and were completely lost. I called both T-Mobile and Samsung and they were of no help. I'm sure it's the phone and not T-Mobile since my daughter never had any problems texting with her Blackberry.  I read a ton of reviews on Amazon before purchasing this phone and read only one review from a person who  experienced the same problem.  I didn't think twice about it since the other 160 something people never mentioned any problems with texting. I guess I should have listened to that one person.  I sent the phone back for an exchange.  However, the new replacement phone did the exact same thing. I had to send it back for a full refund.

However, if you plan to port your number from a postpaid plan to a prepaid plan within T-Mobile, be prepared for some frustrations and watch out for ways T-Mobile wants to rip off you. I did as suggested by someone else from online forums, activated my new phone online first with the unlimited data/text plus 100 minutes, then called T-Mobile to port my number from a postpaid plan to this prepaid plan, the first person I talked to assured me that she would convert everything over and I would see changes within 24 hours, nothing happened after the 24 hours, I called again the second day, this time a different lady told me that the conversion never took place, then she told me that she couldn't do anything, she had to direct me to an account specialist to cancel my current postpaid plan first then send the number to the prepaid account, when talking with this account specialist, he told me that he could only convert my postpaid plan to a new prepaid plan account and I might have to forfeit my balance on my other prepaid account that had just set up a day ago. Since I don't trust T-Mobile to set up a prepaid plan for me (I had read a review that they had assigned a wrong plan for someone) especially after all inconsistency I have been experiencing with them lately, so ends up I had to choose to give up my existing number. As a comparison, I had no trouble to port numbers for my other two phones from T-Mobile to Virgin Mobile, I only needed to talk one person from Virgin Mobile and everything went smoothly within two hours.In conclusion, I would give a four-star for the phone, but a one-star for T-Mobile customer services.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "Letitia Lindsey", "ReviewID": "RO53EAS43YLUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great!!

Additionally, when not in monitoring use, for vehicle location, something Android/Google lets you do. Completely brilliant, it's sat in the frozen SUV, well shielded, without freezing or dying, reporting its location back to Google. This is, admittedly, a specialized non-phone application, but considering the capabilities and the price it is very well suited for that. Love it. I mean, you don't want to take a $500 phone and use it for tinkering, if you're not independently wealthy, but this, I can manage, the ancillary mobile charge is only $10/month.Postscript 9/26/2013:  This device/version of Android works brilliantly with the Paypal Here device and application - I understand not all Galaxy's do. The only caveat is that you need to set up the Paypal app with a mobile #/PIN login - a regular login crashes the app. The new version of the Android Device Manager, accessible at the Google site, which can locate, lock or wipe the phone remotely, works with this handset too. GPS works fine, so does Bluetooth, WiFi calling (UMA) works, and I am impressed with the battery life - my Blackberry Torch 9810 doesn't last a full day on 4G, the Exhibit 4G does.  All in al, the T679 provides a very stable, manageable, and capable little handset, for relatively little money.Original review 9/21/2013:  What with 672 reviews of this unit, you probably don't really need mine, so let me just add why I purchased it, and what I found. I- wanted to get a sufficiently advanced Android device so I could try Paypal's \"Here\" credit card device;- wanted to learn a bit of Android, having been a Blackberry / Nokia aficionado until now; and- wanted a device I could use with one of my existing postpaid T-Mobile lines.It does all that, admirably. I'll add a postscript as soon as I've had a chance to test the Paypal device, but for now, I was able to pop in one of my SIM cards, and have the thing come up on TMO's 4G (HSPA+) and use its UMA (WiFi Calling). IOW, all good, there aren't any restrictions on the device as far as I can see, it'll use 4G data too, although I have that turned off on this line for now.The Android thing was just to satisfy my curiousity, what can I tell you, it works, I can't quite fathom all of the excitement, other than that you get a gazillion apps, which for those with the time to play must be a Godsend. I like the support I get from Google, including Google Maps with offline capability, and Google Voice, something I've been using for a long time. Am I happy telling Google where I go, what I do, who I do it with, and when? No, so this handset will never be my primary handset, but if that doesn't bother you, this is a very cheap - although as I write this it's gone up a bit from what I paid - powerful, and very convenient, pretty little handset. I do realize it is fashionable to carry a flat screen TV in your shirt pocket these days, but for those not bothered, and for those who already have a tablet and a laptop, this is a nice device. I especially like the lack of buttons on the surround - on my Blackberry and my Nokia, I am forever pushing things I shouldn't. Importantly, this is a brand spanking new, T-Mobile branded, device, with the factory seals intact, and updated to the latest (2.3.6 T679UVLK2) Android version available for it, at a very decent price  - mine came from shopcelldeals, can't vouch for other vendors. TMO will even unlock it for you, if you're an existing customer and you meet the requirements, and they provide the warranty and support for it.Enjoy.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "E.

I will say that if you don't have patience, don't buy this phone. It will test your patience on numerous occasions. For one, the memory is terrible. After about eight months into the phone, I have no memory what so ever to listen to music & take photos/look through photos. It glitches a lot. With incoming phone calls the screen will be black for a few seconds THEN will show the call screen, whereas on better smart phones the call will automatically show up. Loading applications takes a little longer than desired. I've tried applications in which that would help speed up the phone, but there's only so much you can do. Sometimes, if the phone is overwhelmed by so much, it just reboots itself. The battery, over time, will go on you, especially if you use a lot of applications. I would suggest to constantly have a charger handy. I mean, for a person that needs a phone with basic smart phone capabilities for cheap, this is okay. However, I have learned my lesson not to be cheap with my cell phones. I'll be sure to save up & look at higher end models for now on.

You can buy the Galaxy Exhibit in any T-Mobile store and use it as a contract phone or as a prepaid phone. Why T-Mobile decided to stick the Galaxy brand on it is beside me. This is NOT in any way shape or form a Galaxy-line phone, as those are higher-end with better features and hardware.You can get it for dirt-cheap from T-Mobile now, but it begs the question, why? T-Mobile designed and launched this phone as a predecessor to the Exhibit 4G, their first attempt as a middle-of-the-road smartphone, positioned between the bottom-shelf Comet and LG Optimus, and the Galaxy S, G2X, Note, HTC One S, Sensation, and Galaxy S2. I have one, and I really liked it. Impressive feature set for the bottom-shelf price. Enter the SGH-T769 Exhibit II. It's basically got the same innards as the Exhibit (aside from added internal memory bump to 4 GB and 1 GB ROM), 1 GHz Snapdragon MSM8255 CPU, Adreno 205 GPU, 512 MB RAM, and Android Gingerbread v 2.3.5. To cooperate with the internal memory, it will take a 32 GB microSD card as well, which is located under the battery cover and is hot-swappable. The differences between the two include a bigger screen from 3.5\" to 3.7, the physical \"home\" button beneath the display is deleted in favor of the traditional 4 Android capacitive buttons, and there are some stylistic differences. You get the same physical buttons for lock/unlock/power and volume pup/down, but it's now got a textured blue battery cover, blue trim with black plastic trim around the display, round camera lens as opposed to the square on the Exhibit 4G. It feels well-made, and despite being made entirely of plastic, seems to be sturdy. Typical Samsung.The handset itself is pretty compact at 4.5x2.36x.43 inches. It's a little heavier than the Exhibit at 116 grams (4 ounces). They are roughly the same thickness, but the Exhibit II is a little harder to hold in the hand, as the textured battery cover is still pretty slippery. Hardware-wise it's a decent handset. The display is really nice. The resolution is 480x800, and has high pixel density so it looks great, but not as good as the Exhibit 4G, which has an excellent display. The screen is capacitive an very responsive and has multi touch enabled. The CPU and GPU work well together, as it's every bit as snappy as the original Exhibit. Like the original, this has the 3.15 MP main camera with the LED flash (also a video light), and a .3 MP front-facing camera. It took pretty decent pictures for 3 MP! Shots are bright and have good color reproduction. Indoor photos in low light also looked decent, although even with the flash, night shots are grainy and noisy and lack fine detail. There are pre-programmed shooting modes for indoor, portrait, macro, landscape, scenery, low light, nighttime shots, and panorama. You get burst shooting, a timer, and tap to focus.I have always been very impressed with every Samsung camera I gave ever used, and I've used a lot of them. It's not perfect though. The shooting performance isn't great, over 4 seconds rom first focus to picture preview. That's a carry-over from the Exhibit. Video recording is also the same story. You can only shoot D1 720x480 at 24 FPS which is serviceable, but nowhere near even 720P HD. You'd think Samsung would do things differently the second evolution of the Exhibit line?Again, it has Android Gingerbread with the Touchwhiz UI, which I really like. Easy to use and customizable to a degree, but nowhere near vanilla Android. Of course it comes with loads of bloatware from T-Mobile, but thankfully you can uninstall most of them.For connectivity, it runs on T-Mobiles HSPA+ \"4G\" network, but only get the 21 MB/ps band. The other Exhibit gets the same treatment for typical downloads of 1.2 to 1.4 MB/ps and uploads running 3-7 MB/ps. There's b/g/n WiFi, A2DP v. 3 bluetooth, and the web browser is full HTML with Flash 10 enabled, so browsing was a good experience. Call quality was top-notch everywhere I used it. Callers said I came in loud and clear with little to no auditory anomalies, and callers sounded good. The audio performance was good. The speaker was a little muffled and the volume could be louder, but overall not bad. The battery is a 1500 MHh lithium ion cell that Samsung says is good for 5.5 days. In actuality, I got about 2.5 days of light use before it beeped at me.So overall, a good well-rounded device that won't cost you a lot of money. However, it's mostly only good as a prepaid device. A postpaid plan will afford you handsets like the Galaxy S2, HTC Amaze, One S, Galaxy Blaze, Nexus 4, Note II, and Galaxy S3 with the newest addition the Optimus L9 (which I own and love it), and they're expensive, so if you're not looking to spend a lot but want a good prepaid device, the Exhibit II isn't a bad choice by any standard.Pros:3.7 inch capacitive touchscreen1 GHz CPU with dedicated GPU4 GB internal storageAndroid 2.3.5Good call qualityGood photo qualityCons:Outdated OSPoor quality D1 video recordingPoor camera shooting performanceSlippery in the handBattery life could be betterSo not a bad device.

However, I started my android experience with the Original Kindle Fire, and have graduated to the HD version.  It made my life so much better, that when my Samsung slider \"dumb\" phone was not quite as useful as it used to be, I started looking for an inexpensive android cell phone.  Here is my review....1. Memory: There is enough on board memory for primary apps.  You need this, especially if you are an amazon customer like me because the Amazon App Application needs to be placed in the main memory and it takes up quite a bit.  You'll need to supplement the on board memory with a micro 32GB memory card.  This will be for your other apps.  There wasn't enough main memory for me for all the apps that I like to run.  4 or 5 Stars2. Battery: I was surprised to experience the lack of endurance in the battery.  However, there are lots of ways to manage that, including bringing your charger to work!  2 of 5 stars3. Screen:  The resolution is very good.  The screen is good at understanding your touch and has a positive response.  5 of 5 stars4. Weight:  The phone is light.... Unusually light!  so if you like it that way, its 5 of 5 stars.5. Ergonomics: While the screen is good to the touch, and the phone is light, the case is slick as you know what.  You will need some sort of case to keep the darn thing in your hand.  But, since most of these phones need a case anyways, thats probably not a huge problem.  4 of 5 stars6. Cameras: Nice!  Its got a rear facing and a front facing camera.  I like that.  Although Skype isnt specifically approved yet for this phone, nor have I tried to run it, I have hopes that it will run fine.  5 of 57. Wireless:  Wifi, Bluetooth and GPS all are awesome.  I could see me retiring my Garmin GPS.  Which probably means I'll need a windshield mount for this.  5 of 5.In all, the worst things about the phone is the battery and its so darn slick and slides out of your hand.

I have an iPod Touch 3rd gen. that is 3 and a half years old and it still runs smoother than this phone does. Sometimes when I click to make a phone call it takes 5 seconds for it to finally dial the person.

Doing a memory clear gets the phone back to a more operational speed. I've found that I'm better off using the integrated web browser. Firefox doesn't run too well on the phone.

HSPA+ was also amazingly fast - at least 3x the average speed of VM's 3G. But the problem was that T-Mobile's 4G Phones are pricey, even for the up-front cost that pre-paid users expect to shell out to get to a new phone. Looking around, I discovered Amazon was selling them for much less. The reviews seemed pretty positive, so I took the plunge and was glad I did.

Mine lasted exactly 29 days before the battery went and the USB port stopped functioning. T-Mobile replaced the battery at a store in NJ, later to discover that usb port does not work anymore. It is not the drivers, it is the phone. After the battery heated up and died on August 24th 2012 the phone has been randomly rebooting and will not connect via USB port anymore. Now T-mobile wants me to ship the phone back and be without a phone for an undetermined time.  T-mobile has to be insane! I am between PA and NJ every week, I can not be without a working phone.Long story short this phone is a disaster of manufacturing. I have never had issues with the LG Optimus and the LG Optimus Elite or other older Motorola variant Android phones like this Samsung Exhibit II 4G. So between T-mobile (this is an exclusive phone) and MANY reviews of this phone being defective (please Google them), avoid this phone.  Since I am away from home, this will force me to buy yet another (roughly) $200 phone with a different company just to keep my phone number.  Will try a T-Mob store in PA tomorrow as a last straw.  Since I have had this phone (July 29th 2012) about every four days I have to do a complete factory reset to avoid problems, and the phone is not connecting via USB at all as of August 25th 2012.  At least i can still use a Motorola 115V wall charger for the time being since these issues.  I can not believe how bad this phone is and how T-Mobile is refusing to help me get a working phone.Avoid this phone to keep your sanity.

Unfortunately this phone must me used only with T-Mobile service.EDIT 10/15/12.I am on my replacement Samsung Exhibit for T-Mobile for almost one entire month.  This one likes to crash and corrupt the Core android OS apparently at Random times - OK I have not found a specific pattern yet.  I am unable to determine if the memory is overheating or exactly what triggers the system corruption of the phones core OS.  All I can say is that the RAM is not full, and it is not a faulty SD card...  I have since rooted it and running Peach Sunrise ROM just to be able to use the phone due to the bloatware installed my T-mobile.  Same issue happened again when I used Google navigation for more than one hour stock and rooted (so repeatable).  I never had any of these issues on my LG Optimus V or Optimus V Elite phones.  So, 2 of two of these phones that can not handle what my 400Mhz slower FROYO phone was able to do.  So much for Samsung for me since this phone has and continues to be a disaster.  FYI, I have no games or music on this phone since it self corrupts far too often, and I have to reload roms from ODIN.

The device does not have enough hardware, however. Camera resolution is too small -- making indoor pictures highly pixeled.3. Touch-responses are too sluggish. Delays are annoying. If you used any device like iProducts, the sluggish responses are unbearable.4. The phone required frequent reboots.  Sometimes the phone gets persistent vibrations, and I need to open the back cover to take out the battery to reboot it.5. One time, and only one time, I left the phone unbooted for a week. I began to tell myself that the phone finally became more stable. However, the next day I received an alert from T-mobile saying the phone requires frequent rebooting to get better performance.6. RAM is not enough for this phone. RAM is always running low with ~70MB free.7. There is not word as to when OS can be upgraded to android 4.0.xIn summary, this phone is not worth the money given the sluggish/unresponsive, outdated Android OS, and frequent-rebooting user experience.I wish to have spent money on a quad-core, or at least a dual-core smartphone, which would give much better user experience.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally Works After 2 Years with CM11!.", "Author": "Steve C", "ReviewID": "R1RINQ30EDWUHS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone can't get 4G anywhere in the Phoenix area except at T-Mobile stores and can't get 3G at all so it only runs on Edge that is too slow to do anthing! While this seems like a nice phone it's SLOW, SLOW, SLOW  It's actually slower than my old Blackberry that had 3G!  The coverage map shows coverage everywhere but they don't mention that it's just Edge with a speed of only 139Kb and nothing on the phone will work at that speed. I can't even use it unless I have wi-fi. Actually I don't think they even have a 4G network! T-Mobile claims to have the largest 4G network in the country and they also claim it's the fastest but I can't find any evidence that it even exists. It's not very fast either. Even in T-Mobile stores where they have a strong signal of 5 bars the speed is just 4-5Mb, not the fast speed they claim to have. The only way I've been able to use this phone on the go is to also carry my old 3G phone with me too. 3G is also spotty but it's available in different areas than 4G is so I can usually get coverage on one or the other.I don't care if the girl on the motorcycle in the TV ad claims there is a 4G tower in West Phoenix (and only 1, it's a big area!), how about one in the East Phoenix area where I am?The phone also has the Carrier IQ spyware but the Voodoo Carrier IQ detector said it probably wasn't active.Also, the battery runs down everyday so I'm always having to charge it and it's pretty annoying not to have a button for the camera since I can't see the icon for the camera on the screen in the daytime. I can't call Customer Care at 611 either, just get the T-Mobile ring tone and hangs up with a message on the screen saying to check the FAQ. I guess they don't want to talk to anyone who has one of these lousy phones! They don't give you a case either but it fits into the Blackberry case just fine.I got it at Walmart so I could get the $30/mo unlimited data plan but can't actually use the data at Edge speeds.  If you get it at Walmart that count on going back lots of times until they get it working right. You need lots of patience since nobody at Walmart knows anything about setting up a phone, can't actually do anything themselves and have to call T-Mobile everytime. I had to go back 3 times before they got it right. First time they set it up for the standard 1500 talk, text and 30mb of data plan instead of what I wanted and the slow data service with Edge in the store makes it impossible to update the account info so you can see what you are getting. After changing the plan I found the $30 card didn't take and I had no minutes and it said the plan was Unfunded. Went back again to get the credit problem corrected. It finally seems to be running OK except for no 3G or 4G so everything is very slow unless it's on wi-fi.On the plus side the wi-fi is the best I've seen on any device. It connects automatically when there's no cell service without having to search for wi-fi networks or anything and all the apps run faster when wi-fi is available, if you are near the wireless router. On the negative side it won't work inside most building so don't count on using it at all if there's no wi-fi available unless you go outside where you can get wireless service.  The wi-fi range is really short also, just 20' from the wireless router it only shows 1 bar and speed is cut in half.BTW, I picked up a Samsung Galaxy S, model T959V to replace this and the Galaxy S works much better. It's 4G but can also fall back to 3G when 4G is not available so I get service most places now where there is no service with the Samsung Exhibit II.Update: After updating to Cyanogenmod 11 it finally works!  It can get 3G now just like most other phones!

I have had mine for almost a week and a half and the only thing that makes me disappointed is the pre-installed apps that you can not uninstall, also when I plugged it into my computer it took me awhile to figure out why it wasn't able to install the software for the phone, so I had to go (on the phone) into settings, then wireless and network then went down to USB utilities and had to connect the phone to the computer before I pressed \"turn on USB storage\". so that took awhile but now everything is good. 4g is great and fast too. The processor is fairly good, nice and fast. there's only some points where it lags in and out of messaging or any other icons, but that is usually when I haven't turned off the phone for a couple days and all I do is charge it when the battery gets low. but it is nice and responsive to the movement of your fingers, the screen is very nice and responsive also and surprisingly has not scratched yet. I have had this phone in and out of my pocket so much without a screen protector and still has no scratch, it does smudge a little but not much. The screen is also a bit bigger than the iPhone (long wise). the camera and front facing camera are actually pretty decent. if you keep them smudge and scratch free they do take some good pics, the front facing cam is pretty pixelly but isn't bad when your doing a Skype or snapchat. and now for the calling, the speaker/ear piece or whatever its called is very nice and has good sound. I have not tested the speaker phone feature yet but I play music out of it sometimes and its nice clear. Basically its a great phone for people who don't want to spend a whole lot on the phone or the service and mostly uses it for texting, calling, music, web and facebook, or any social app that's about it. if you want something that you can use all for media stuff and as a phone, iPhone or galaxy would be your best choices.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "its ok", "Author": "ernest", "ReviewID": "R3RH5S4WBUPFIE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i had to go in for this phone cos i needed a smart and handy one. it works great but the only problem i have wit it is the battery life. it runs out of power so quickly, and after using it for a while it doesn't charge when u connect it to any of the charger (usb cable,car n normal)", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pre-Paid \"smart phones\" still require a monthly charge.

Save yourself some pocket change and settle for this incredible* phone!The Samsung Exhibit, although much cheaper, is much more advanced than other smartphones in the market. It has a \"don't drive and text\" and a \"don't drive and talk\" feature where the phone will crash every time you try to do either. Best part is you can't turn off this feature, so you will never be tempted. Calling and texting people will simply just not work, even if you're not driving! What about when there an emergency, you say? They thought of that. Facebook and twitter work just fine under any situation, so hash tag away!Another neat feature is the data saving. It takes unlimited data in a whole new direction! I'm not exactly sure how it works, but I believe the browser runs on a randomized timer where the browser crashes no matter what you're doing. This makes sure you never reach the data cap on your plan.

I have had mine since January and this thing is so slow to respond that I would have thrown it away had I not paid $200 for it.Firstly, the autocorrect is awful! It has autocorrected \"luck\" to \"duck\" countless times. Funny and cute the first couple of times; but not all that the tenth time or more.When sending texts, the keyboard failed to pop up no matter how many times I tapped the text field --- you see, it shows the string of messages with only a one line text entry field with the keyboard hidden and the idea is that it will pop up once you tap the text field with your finger. Problem is? You have tap it so many times just to get the keyboard to pop-up that it is downright frustrating!And then comes the address book. It takes a full 2-3 seconds of blank screen before it displays the list of names.There has been days when I have had to reboot (restart) the phone three or more times just so it to responds. On countless occasions, it would just play it's \"startup theme tune\" and that's when you know half your apps are going to stop working. Skype *never* fails to stop working when that happens although it may look like the phone is humming just fine. You have to reboot to get it working.The camera too, more often than not, takes more than 5 seconds to launch when you tap on the icon. A unique selling point about camera phones is the ability to quickly capture an epehemeral moment; but good luck with that with this phone!Unlocking the screen can be a pain at times too --- you have to make sure your finger is way across the other side of the screen so you can swipe it clean across in order to unlock it. No quick flick of the finger like in other phones; no siree/ma'am, that won't work. The phone refuses to budge. You will appreciate my position on this when you're walking from your car with a bagful of groceries in both hands, your left hand barely hanging on to the phone as you try to make a quick call, and see how tedious it can be to swipe it to unlock.It has been a very frustrating experience, and I would highly recommend against buying this phone.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "HELP I HAVE A QUESTION", "Author": "Luis Vivas", "ReviewID": "R17YX5K9SA760I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HI I HAVE A QUESTIONN!!!

It certainly has lots of bells and whistles. And it certainly is a much better phone in terms of hardware and software than the iPhone.  However, I returned this phone within 4 days of having it for a number of reasons:1) I need a phone that is reliable, durable, and functional for traveling. This phone does not do that. It has only 3G service in North America and some parts of South America. It does not have 3G service in Europe, Asia, or Africa.2) The phone is nowhere near as durable as a Blackberry. Not even close. Though it is much more durable than an iPhone.  Unless you are in the habit of replacing your phone every 6 months because a new trinket catches your eye, this phone will not last 3 years of use and abuse. The screen will crack, the camera will scratch, etc. Nothing new here that iPhone users will not be accustomed to.3) With a fully charged battery, I left the phone on idle with it only connected to the 3G network for cellular phone service (no data). The battery was dead in 18 hours. Totally dead. I can leave my Blackberry in the same configuration for 10 days without any worries. This battery issue alone is enough to disqualify this phone for serious use.4) It is basically impossible to sync Outlook with the Android contacts/calendar. The only way is to sync Outlook with GMail servers, and then sync that with Android. This means that you must be ok with allowing Google to have access to all your contacts, calendar, and whatever else you are syncing.

I do not have the best eye sight, hand-eye coordination is ok, as is hearing, hands a bit on the larger side and not as steady as they were 20 years ago.Use mostly for data, have had the phone for 2 months and not used 100 voice minutes total.The GoodNice screen. I was concerned that I'd have trouble typing but in landscape mode, which you just shake to get to, the keys are big enough.  THe GPS feature works well for me and I've so far had great coverage and no lost calls.  The menu is fairly intuitive, and with a bit of exploration is ok.The BadThey load it up with lots of rubbish apps.  T-Mobile Market place and Voice Messaging are two (there was another I don't recall).  All useless and I've been bothered having to update them both for no purpose.  When I say useless, the Market had nothing of interest to me in it and the Voice thing wouldn't launch.Th battery life is about a day.  Ths thing sucks power like an Abrams M1 sucks JP8.  A bit longer with all power saving on, but not much.The screen goes dark 2 - 5 seconds after you dial.  Thats a real problem if you call a answering system.  Hard to \"press 3 for customer service\" if there is no visible 3 on the screen.  This is a real bad bug.  I am constantly having to push a button to \"wake up\" the screen. Of course, doing that puts me back to the main screen and I may or may not have lost the call. So, in terms of useability, this goes dim/goes dark bug (which you can not prevent from happening - I called about it) means I can not recommend this phone.I turned off auto sync (to save battery) and to my chagrin learned that unless its on, your g-mail inbox doesn't check for new mail.  Nowhere did I see that warning, nor did it ask me \"do you want to check for new e-mail now?\".  Reminds me of software from 1998!!!There is this blank screen (screen saver?) that covers the icons after a couple of seconds too.  So once the screen goes dark, pushing the on button doesn't even return you to where you were before it decided 3 seconds is long enough for you to be inactive.The swiping needs work too.  Sometimes response is slow; as in you push a button or swipe (to scroll) and nothing happens for several seconds.  If you don't wait (and forget about aubible feedback!) you can scroll right past where you want to go.The screen edges are less sensitive and I often have to repeatedly swipe or press to get any response. While in other cases I swipe but the phone interprets it as me clicking on a icon and up pops some app or another.  Not cool.  Its almost like they haven't learned anything about user interfacing from the Macs and PC business.Two other things and I'm done.The off button is on the opposite edge from the sound volume rocker.  This extremely poor design means if you hold it in one hand and push/squeeze it off chances are you also changed the ring volume.  really poor design.Finally, I've tried four 3.5 mm headphone sets (wired) and none work with this. There are no impedance specifications listed, nor was customer service able to help.  Its ridiculous.  SO either I need to get a more modern pair of ear phones or the unit is defective.  But come on! no impedance data for the headphone jack?!?!BTW best work-around for the screen going dark when you need access to the keypad is to set the phone on \"speaker\" phone.  The Samsung forum is much more useful than Technical service = non responsive.To sum up: I don't have any other smart phone to compare this with but I hear power is a problem on many of them.  The GUI (user interface) is slick but crippled: I have no doubt that in a couple of years the phones will work like you excpect a phone to work, without roadblocks and frustrations.

And these unwanted apps aren't just taking up storage space, they START RUNNING ON THEIR OWN and waste RAM.Despite the large amount of memory, I have had as low as 40 megabytes of RAM free without running a single program I wanted to install.  This phone can barely handle running GMail and Opera at the same time, and in fact sometimes the web browser will get zapped if I try to switch to GMail briefly.Yes, this phone looks like a low price.  Maybe that's because of all of the kickbacks t-mobile must be getting from the software peddlers who have hijacked the phone.OK, aside from the fact that t-mobile has ruined the phone, is there anything wrong with the phone?  Yes, unfortunately...1. Only the power button can activate the display (in order to be able to swipe/unlock it), and it is tiny and flush with the phone body.  Unlike my previous Androids, it has no easy-to-feel button which can activate the display.2. Despite the visible texture on the back of the phone, it is very slippery.  The texture is a bunch or very smooth lumps, which provides no grip at all (flat plastic actually provides more grip than this).3. It beeps when the battery is fully charged.  It's an annoying high-pitch beep, and it can't be turned off unless you turn off all alerts.

For their part, Samsung did a poor job of attaching those things to a battery/case and then T-Mobile flew in and dumped a bunch of unwanted software on it.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be aware this is not unlocked phone", "Author": "acbola \"acbola\"", "ReviewID": "R12C59ZJMCLE6N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is not unlocked as may think it is. I called T-Mobile and it does not help to unlock. The same with Samsung. They say since they cannot verify the ownership of the phone they do not help to unlock it. They send back to Amazon. What a mess!!! I thought I was buying an unlocked phone. Too bad for me...", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "It sure is an exhibit.", "Author": "OccupyRetail", "ReviewID": "R2ZOKJM9H6QGS5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Strengths: Not ridiculously expensive (Lol..made in east, with cheap Love!) Front facing camera, T-mobile monthly plan, Android Gingerbread(although it may be causing most of the issues), currently one of the best bangs for your U.S. buck.Weaknesses: Marketed as 4G but technically it's not, Cheap build material (Typical of Samsung Phones), Loaded with bloatware (Typical with phones locked to carriers), If there's no 4g signal then you are on EDGE! Lags, Headset issues, volume issues (Try the lowest volume setting, its not low) Hard to see screen (Well...not if you don't plan on being outside) SLOW 3 MP rear camera...when its working.Overall: No real big complaints with Fake4g-mobile. Lol...costumer service doesn't exist...closest thing is what the carriers call retention department! Currently the 100 min and data plan for $30 a month isn't bad. Using Skype to call without using the plan minutes is nice. Ask this question if you plan on buying this phone, well any phone. CAN I REMOVE THE CRAPPY PRE-INSTALLED APPS I DON\"T WANT AND WHY NOT? After you get the answer, ask yourself, AM I OK WITH PAYING FULL PRICE TO USE A PRODUCT THAT THE \"MIDDLE MAN MANUFACTURER\" RETAINS CONTROL OVER? if yes, more power to you...I mean...from you to them. Let's really focus on the things that matter. Doesn't matter if it's the mePhone, the Slamsdung, the Meterolo, the another Acronym Company, etc...all of them are pretty much the same! YES!!! EVEN MADE BY THE SAME COMPANIES. Overpriced, made cheaply in the east doohickies! Don't get fooled because the mePhone has Blah Blah display and Blah Blah gyro (LOL...greek dude with the cart on the street sells that too!!!) It's all marketing. Their pennies for our dollars! Oh...The Slamsdung...Well, it will work out of the box. But once you install the Apps YOU want, the phone struggles because their crap is taking space! HOW COULD YOU BE OK WITH THIS! I know about root and freezing with titanium but we shouldn't have to go through that. And to top it off these greedy companies have the nerve to justify their unethical deeds with strong arm threats to their victims..I mean costumers...such as, voiding the warranty, telling you it's illegal to get full access to what you paid for. They invade your privacy and they take your money and never hand over the product...CAN\"T YOU SEE THE IRONY? SO...if the phone was not filled with bloatware, unlocked, with full control to the purchaser...Then it would be just like the other! After all that's what the greedy companies claim. It's the excuse, their reasoning to why they must retain control over user interfaces and  product systems. Only a fool asks another what to do. So one suggestion out there is to buy the phone at walmart for $198 with a $30 refill card so you can test it out (while the offer is still here). If you are not completely satisfied with the purchase then you may return it within 15 days of the purchase for a full refund of the phone.  You possibly lose the remaining unused talk minutes but hey just use the heck out of it during the 15 day. Doing what makes YOU completely happy is all that matters,not what others say!
