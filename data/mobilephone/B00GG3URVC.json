{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Super fast, smart and thin - is it as good as the iPhone??", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "RB7G7OMMQQRJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Google Nexus 5 is the latest, fastest Android phone from Google (built by LG). Incredibly fast, light and thin - but is it as good as the iPhone 5s costing more than double the price? Read on to find out.....Firstly, a word of warning. This is a lengthy, thorough and in depth review to compare the two phones - not just trash one or the other. I personally have an iPhone 4S, iPad Air, an Apple TV and several Macs. However, I also have an open mind and limited budget.Display----------The Nexus has a stunning 5 inch HD screen with more pixels on a larger screen, and they're more densely packed. For the techies among us, the Nexus is 1080x1920 pixels and 445 pixels per inch (ppi). This clearly beats the iPhone's 4 inch retina screen at 1136x640 pixels at 336ppi.But what does this really mean? It means you get a bigger, better quality screen than an iPhone 5s (which as a fan of Apple, really surprises me). What it means, is photos and videos just look absolutely stunning, and web pages razor sharp.In short, screen quality on the Nexus is absolutely brilliant, with pure whites and super-sharp text on a larger screen. A clear winner for the Nexus.Speed---------Both Nexus and iPhones are blistering fast. Web pages display instantly, scrolling a breeze, and you can rapidly jump between apps. So not a lot in it. This is an incredibly fast device for the money.It's also worth noting both Nexus and iPhone support the super-fast 4G network as well as existing 3G. You may pay more for a 4G contract (although not from Tesco Mobile or Three), but if you want to get the best out of your phone it's a consideration.Look, Feel and Build Quality-------------------------------------Lets be honest here. The iPhone wins hands down on the top quality, hard edged aluminium industrial design from Sir Jonny Ive. It's lighter, smaller and thinner than the Nexus, and if you have smaller hands (but deeper pockets), it's a beautiful device. A top end BMW 5i compared to a Ford, Peugeot or VW Golf.The Nexus is physically larger with rounded off corners, a lightly curved rubberised back, and tough \"Gorilla Glass 3\" screen. Quietly understated, although the Nexus 5 is (on paper) very slightly heavier, (see specs below), it also \"feels\" lighter - incredibly light in the hand given the relatively huge screen size.I have to admit, the Nexus does sit nicely in the hand, feels light, and the screen is just massive - but if you're looking for top quality Android - you need to pay around double the price, and buy the \u00a0HTC One (M8), but on build quality - the iPhone wins.Camera-----------Considering both have an 8 mega-pixel camera with optical image stabilisation (ie. the camera tries to compensate for shaky hands), the iPhone wins by a fair margin. Automatic zoom on the Nexus is a bit hit-and-miss. I often find you need to use the \"tap to focus\" feature, and annoyingly even this doesn't work perfectly sometimes, especially in low-light conditions where the iPhone wins.Having said that, in normal outdoor situations, it's great for quick snaps, and you can always use a \"proper camera\" if you're really serious about photography.Battery Life---------------Always difficult to tell without a head-to-head test, and even then I think it depends upon how you use the phone. Typically video over WIFI burns the battery and a review (search for \"V3 iPhone Nexus compare\" to see) has helpfully done much of the work for us.Nexus ran 7.5 hours compared to iPhone 5S at 7. So (despite other Amazon reviewer gripes), it's pretty much comparable.Having said that, today I've blitzed the phone today. Downloading Apps, searching on Google, navigating and watching videos of-and-on for the past 11 hours, and it still has 18% battery left.I'll update this review after a few months real world experience.Storage----------Nexus comes with 16 or 32Gb of storage compared to iPhone's 16, 32 or 64Gb, and neither have expandable storage. Having said that, I've lived happily with a 16Gb iPhone for nearly five years without issue, but it depends upon how you use it.Price-------For once it's absolutely black and white. \u00a0Compared to the iPhone - the Nexus 5 is an absolute bargain. \u00a0Fantastic value for money.What about Apps?-----------------Firstly, an App, is a small \"application\" (a program) that runs on your phone or tablet, and there's thousands available from both the Apple and Android stores. Be aware they're \"Apples and Pears\" - an Apple App will only run on an iDevice (iPhone, iPad etc), and you'll need an Android App for this phone.Many apps cost $1 - or 69p in real money, and there's thousands free (frequently advertising funded with an ad-free version for 69p). Here's my favourites:-* Mailbox. \u00a0Incredibly slick mail box app (gmail only - sorry). \u00a0(Free)* Go SMS pro. (Go Chat on Apple) Send and receive text messages. (Free)* QuickOffice. Edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents. (Free)* Evernote. Write and organise notes. Edit them on your Nexus, iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac (Free)* DropBox. Access your files, documents and photos anywhere. (Free)* Tune In Radio. Listen to 1,000s of radio stations world-wide (\u00a32.40)* Spotify. Stream music for \u00a35 a month (or free with ads). Brilliant! (Free)* eBay. Buy and sell your stuff while you're out and about. (Free)* Zite. Online web magazine that learns what you like. Terrific! (Free)* Movies by Flixter. Read reviews of films on cinema and DVD. (Free)* Kindle. Read your books from Amazon Kindle bookstore. (Free)* 1Password (reader). \u00a0Read only access to passwords. \u00a0(Free)Note: All of the above without exception are available on Apple and Android, and some (Evernote, Spotify, DropBox and Box) also run on PCs and Macs.So to my mind - it's a draw. OK, so it's common knowledge that many new apps (typically games) are first launched on the iPhone first, but the market for Android Apps has matured, finally catching up with Apple.Admittedly, I do find iPhone versions of Apps tend to be slightly better versions, as they seem to be launched on Apple first, and Android second, but the difference is not crippling.Viruses - Apple Vs Android------------------------------Unlike Apple who stop you buying Apps from anywhere else, on Android you CAN buy Apps from the equivalent of a \"dodgy bloke in the pub\" - or indeed reputable companies like Amazon. It's up to you really.On Android, if you try to install an app off the internet you get the message \"For security, your phone is set to block installation of applications not obtained from the Android Market\". You can unset this on \"Settings --> Applications --> Unknown sources.In short, if you get a free copy of an App by mail or a web site and you ignore the warnings and install it - you risk getting a virus. It's your call.Operating System---------------------The Nexus runs Android whereas Apple run iOS. Personally I think much is down to taste and what you're used to.Worth noting however, is the Nexus is one of the few Android phones which aren't loaded with additional \"bloatware\" rubbish. Samsung for example, load their phones with a confusing (and unnecessary) \"Touch Wiz\" interface to differentiate their offering. Personally I'd always stick to a Google Android device. As well as avoiding the useless bells and whistles, you get upgrades direct from Google. Other phones often take months to provide upgrades (sometimes never). Worth knowing, if you're considering another Android phone.The statistics-------------In common with Apple, I've tried to avoid quoting \"the numbers\" except to illustrate a difference as pure stats can often misleading. But for those who like to compare:-GOOGLE NEXUS 5OS: Android 4.4.2 (KitKat)CPU: Quad core 2.27Ghz Snapdragon 800Space: 16g or 32gScreen: 5 inch (diagonal) , 1920x1080 (HD) display with 445 pixels per inchCamera: 8 MP with Optical Image StabilisationSize: 137.9 x 69.2 x 8.6 mm - very thin bezel, almost all screenWeight: 130gAPPLE iPHONE 5sOS: Apple iOS (7.1)CPU: A7 chip with 64 bit architectureSpace: 16g, 32g or 64gScreen: 4 inch (diagonal), 1136x640 with 326 pixels per inchCamera: 8MP with Optical Image StabilisationSize: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mmWeight: 112gOverall Conclusion--------------------Well, I guess in conclusion I bought a Nexus not an iPhone, and that says it all.On balance, the Nexus 5 is:-* Blisteringly fast* Has a beautifully clear, large display (without being silly)* Runs an excellent version of Android (direct from Google so bang-up-to-date and without bloatware)* Runs all the Apps I already run on my iPhone* Is MUCH cheaper!Lets be honest, if I had cash to burn, I'd love an iPhone 5s (or even better a 6). I think the iPhone is a beautiful example of industrial design with top end build quality. Add to that the superb integration with the iPad, Mac and Apple TV, not to mention the security of the touch ID fingerprint scanner, and I can understand why they charge more.If you really can't stand Apple (or think the iPhone screen size is too small. but have the money, I'd also consider the HTC One (H5). \u00a0Apple quality build on Android.However, at this price, it's a steal. Absolutely astonishing value for money, and highly recommended.

Main concern, no microSD card slot. Sound volume is low even at highest setting. This becomes a concern when driving in highways. I have to use a powerful bluetooth speaker. Otherwise this is a great device. I knew the limitations, still bought one. Look at my video review of Nexus 5 Black phone.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\" is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don't use it as a primary phone. The display in Nexus 5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! I like it as much as Galaxy S4 and S5.ANDROID UI:Nexus 5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface has a flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery and it is geeky and impressive.CAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. I use it sometimes, but my Nikon D90 still the workhorse.PROCESSING POWER:Don't bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:BIG PLUS on Nexus 5 phones. Very convenient. Period.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both.Micro SD card!!BIG BUMMER. I am so used to SD card and having tons to stuff. I am feling the pain.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + Nexus 5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don't necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don't. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Look at my video review.To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they have for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions.

Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption.This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s.It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all.And now I will explain it.--------------------------1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off.Now one step further...iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else.iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring.I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said \"beauty lies in the eyes of beholders\".\"Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less.\" - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5.In short its unapologetically simple\".2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes.3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology.4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.)5. Powerful Soul-> \"Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful.\" Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything.6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long.7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic.8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful.With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets.9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera.Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors.Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference.10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others.It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day.11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular.Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now.

This phone is priced really good for everything it offers.Big screen, fast opening apps etc, the voice recognition is spot on and also very fast. The phone does everything really good. If you like the android system it will have the latest and greatest with immediate updates.The camera takes great pictures. Its sometimes slow to focus though. Video quality is also excellent.This is a great phone but has a few problems that may be deal breakers.The bad: The battery on this is horrible. If you work outside without any way to charge your phone during the day this phone is not for you. On top of that it takes forever to charge once its drained , which is almost all the time. I have done all the things various people have posted on the internet to make the battery last longer and it still doesn't. And why should I have to turn everything off on the phone? I bought it to use. This is a powerful phone with a really bad battery which you cant replace to my knowledge. The battery life has me already looking to replace this phone.The power button is in a position that any time you hand the phone to somebody they will turn it off on accident. The button is too touchy also. A slight touch and its off. Sounds like knit picking but its annoying.The speaker location should be on the top of the phone. If you hold it in your hand with a finger under it to support it you will block the speaker which already is not very loud.The charge cord plugs into the bottom. Typically this is not a problem but you cant turn the phone all the way upside down and use it so the cord is in the way of propping the phone up or its in the way of your hand when holding the phone. Since the phone almost always needs plugged in because of the weak battery the cord is an issue.If your a moderate to heavy user you will be plagued with the battery warning. I cant use the gps on the golf course or even listen to music on it because it will be dead in no time.The charge cords are cheaply made with no markings on it as to which way its supposed to go into the phone. I marked the cords myself for convenience and easier to plug in when I come to bed in the dark after my wife. The small end of my cord has already broke off and I have replace the cord. Again this seems petty but since your constantly having to plug it in its an issue.If you buy this phone go ahead and buy a cord for every outlet in the house so you always have a place to charge it.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sweet Phone", "Author": "ArtistKeithLutz", "ReviewID": "R2CCKKPKS8IAOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looking for a great international phone for your older teenager, this is perfect.

Hangout is a pain and I need to get messaging real time.  The phone barely alerts me to messages coming in and doesn't display it in a popup forcing me to open Hangout.I like the phone, but no longer love it, and dropping $350 every two years (if it lasts that long) to replace a battery seems like a fool\u2019s errand.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "All that and more", "Author": "Yaara Di Segni", "ReviewID": "R1T0D1PVYJR7HH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had the Nexus 4 for about a year, once the Nexus 5 was out, I knew I had to get it.

The good news is that there are apps that let you download and transfer music so it doesn't need to be built into the native Kit-Kat OS.

They are all so smart devices, so quick and, even the Nexus 10, so compact and slim. Put them all side-to-side each other, and they do look good. I have waited years to get devices like these and, even tho I have also got the iPads, I can honestly say these Nexus devices are the best I have ever seen...I'm really impressed with all of them.I had an old Ericsson phone, it must be, almost 10 years now and thought it was time to replace it for a smartphone.But I wasn't too keen on the iPhone, my sons got the iPhone 5, because how small they are. But when I saw Google was bringing the Nexus 4 out, I decided to get that but I never did. I'm glad now that I waited for them to bring the Nexus 5 out, becaz I understand its slimmer and a lot more compact, also the camera is better than the previous model. Comparing this Nexus5 to the iPhone5 it is a Fabolous size and I always knew the iPod 4 was small, but having the Nexus5, iv realised just how small it is so now I will only be using the iPod for media only.This is the best phone I have owned, it's even easier to use than my land-line phone....I'm not technical at all.The dial pad is terrific and so simple to use,and the volume is crystal clear. I love the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the phone near to the loudspeaker and micAlso, becaz iv never used a smart phone before, I'm amazed just how quick it charges and if you compare it to ordinary mobile phones that aren't Smart, I'm extremely impressed with the battery life.The camera is amazing, I have never seen a camera so precise and the pictures come out so clear and sharp, it's just as tho you are seeing the real object and not seeing it through a lens. Front and back camera I found really good, but for obvious reasons the back camera is a lot more sharper, giving a cleaner photo all round.I haven't text on the phone yet......Google sent me this earlier to show me how to do texting - SMS - 'HANGOUTS'[...]I wanted an emoji keyboard for the Nexus and this is itiPhone Emoji Keyboard support slideI just love using these emoji symbols. I actually got this one from GooglePlayStore for my Nexus5 phone and it works fab. You just 'default' the emoji keyboard and then it works in the exact same way as on the iPads. Use it when writing Emails - typing on-line - SMS. It is so much fun to use., and it's brilliant that you can have the Emoji for Android, not just for iOS devices.Went on the net earlier and just like the other two devices, it's so quick. Browsing and Emails, I couldn't ask for a faster smart-phone...it's so genius, clever.Also, I have played a couple of my games that I got from GooglePlay, played 'Tilt 3d Labyrinth' where you have got to get the marbles across the board by 'tilting' your device and make sure they dnt drop down the holes.So touch friendly -it honestly felt like I was playing my nexus 7 or 10, obviously apart from the size difference, I'm still amazed that it was a phone that I'm using.When I got the phone from GooglePlay, I should have asked them about the sim becaz unfortunately I didn't realise it was a Micro-Sim, so I had to wait a few days for my Mobile Operator to send one. But at least I was able to still use it as a small tablet whilst waiting for the Sim to arrive.I downloaded the Amazon AppStore onto my Nexus, which I can't understand as it says iv got the max amount of devices - 10.- and I have only got 3 devices, I dnt even think I downloaded the AppStore onto the 7...so it might just be just the two devices, so where's the others come from??Edit: 1st Dec -When I rang Amazon to enquire this, we eventually realised its everytime Android OS gets updated the PlayStore looks at it as a new device. Unfortunately there's nothing that can be done to resolve this issue apart from the customer deleting older versions of the OS ourselfs within 'apps and devices' - 'Devices'. I find this annoying, but at least we know now what the problem is.I also downloaded the Amazon Music Player and, even tho I haven't downloaded any music onto the device it self yet, playing the music from the cloud was really clear.I will add more into this review, but I have only just started using it...but overall I'm extremely impressed with my new phone - Tablet.Also, one reviewer I have noticed has given this amazing device such an appalling review just becaz there's no 'paper' instructions.We are 'trying' to be Planet Friendly and so the best way is to reduce the amount of paper that's used. All the instructions can be found via the internet, just Google Nexus 5 or phone Google themselves as they have a dedicated help-line. But, like I have said I'm not technical at all, so if I have no problems anyone can work this device out and that's not even getting advice. It's so simple to use.I have just received an Email regarding instructions on how to get started with the Nexus 5, including some really useful tips also[...](I also need to add that I'm reviewing the Nexus device and not the seller, as I always buy directly from the Manufacture whenever possible)", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Android 10", "Author": "Ronpy", "ReviewID": "R3SQXBS3VBZHOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El software dentro del universo Android, es el mejor para mi gusto, es de los m\u00e1s fluido que hay en el mercado, aunque ya te sufrido varios bugs menores con la activacion de la pantalla y las llamadas.
