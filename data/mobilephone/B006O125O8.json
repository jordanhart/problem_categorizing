I bought it for Page Plus and was told most AllTel phones work with Page Plus. Took the Page Plus CS less than 5 minutes to change my ESN from my old phone to this one. The phone is working fine so far. Too early to say how the battery life is. So far Im liking this. Would have give 5 stars, taking one away for the lack of proper description on the item.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does NOT work with PagePlus unless you unlock & program yourself.", "Author": "Ben680", "ReviewID": "R16TNKOOZP9VMK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Does NOT work with PagePlus unless you unlock & program the phone yourself or pay someone to do it for you.  Seller's description and title is still wrong.  This phone only works with Alltel.

The phone is NOT a Verizon phone, it is an Alltel phone and will not work with Verizon Wireless service. It clearly states in both the product description and the title of the product Verizon phone. Don't waste your time or your money. I now have to drive 50 miles into town and drop it off at UPS and I also just had to order another phone due to this. We have our smart phones this was simply a replacement phone for the ranch. Very disappointed in the seller due to the fact that they are misleading people by stating in two places that it is a Verizon phone, it even says this on the phone when you receive it. It also looks like it has been used and they just threw some plastic on the screen and the back to make it look new. Don't waste your time, it is a farce. I don't even want to give them one star.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone just cant use with Verison.", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "RZCSPGUVW7ACR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone was perfect.
