{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific smartphone but poor build quality", "Author": "Bernard Morey", "ReviewID": "R6GUKABUEEQW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update: Do not buy this phone.  I would re-rate it to one star if that were possible.  The problem is build quality.  After 6 months the outer case was chipped and scarred.  A colleague who bought one at the same time has the same problem.  I had the case repaired under warranty but 3 months later the replacement shell is also chipping.  As soon as it's out of contract I'll be replacing the phone with a decent one.Pros:  Clear speech (both caller and called).  This was a No. 1 priority - a new phone had to have clear speech.  The N76 doesn't have speech clarity circuitry but it's excellent all the same.  Has a great MP3 player with ample volume. Voice dialling, neat size, clam-shell form factor, 3.5mm standard headphone socket.It synchronises with Outlook.  This works efficiently and it's easy to find a date and read the appointment. It's not so easy to amend an appointment, but I can do that on the PC after I return home.Cons: Poor quality. Expensive.  The front screen is prone to showing fingerprints.  Some users may need to use fingernails to operate keys as they are rather small (not a serious shortcoming).  Doesn't have anywhere to attach a neck or wrist strap.Some might criticize if for not being openable with one hand.  In fact it takes a practice to use two hands.  I fumbled and dropped it a few times - fortunately it's landed in my lap. It closes securely and doesn't have a spring hinge that might break down.Not really a pro or con but the camera is a standard Toshiba fixed-focus 2mp unit with all the shortcomings this implies. It takes reasonable photos in sunny conditions but nothing to get excited about.  In other-than-good light the photos are, as you would expect, very noisy.  It's for emergency use only.Battery life is very poor although it does charge quickly.  From fully-charged 20 minutes listening to music, 10 or so phone calls using the loudspeaker,(say, 30 minutes in total) is enough to completely flatten the battery.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Function great, Outter quality HORRIBLE", "Author": "R.

It looks like a great phone, and the functionality is amazing.  Very well made.. HOWEVER.. within two weeks of buying this, the silver paint started chipping off to reveal white underneath.  Let's be honest.. You spend $450 on a phone.. it's paint shouldn't be chipping!!! For that reason alone, I DO NOT recommend this phone.  Boo nokia.. you disappointed me.SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A DIFFERENT PHONE!", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nokia N76", "Author": "Mkhokhokho", "ReviewID": "R262QCRQFWYB60", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Thd item i received did not work on any South African network and i had to take it back after waiting for it for a long time.Very disappointing", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone!", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R2UUBT51QDFBAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. It is one of my all time favorites. This is probably the 4th one that i buy. There is nothing fancy about it i know, but i like flip phones.

It is able to read Arabic messages though!", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy communicate", "Author": "theresa cheung", "ReviewID": "R3T0M0OVBDCRQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "wonderful product but could ne better if the phone has a Chinese language option install because no phone store able to install the program.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone", "Author": "Pollab Das \"Upper  Darby\"", "ReviewID": "R3BTF8YFDJO7II", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i loved this phone.........i used it almost 4-5 years without any problem.
