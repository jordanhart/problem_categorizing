{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OCT2013 UPDATE Great phone, easy activation, value priced, uses Verizon network", "Author": "Well Read", "ReviewID": "RPTZ6IIJ3X2P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Tracfone via Prime and it was sold and shipped from Amazon which made it $14.99 to my door.  I cannot believe this phone is priced this low because its build quality is good with nice large keys that are well lit.  The screen is clear and a good size.  It does not have a camera and I wouldn't use it for web browsing, or music.  Butthis is a great basic phone for voice calls that does the job with no fuss.  I gave it to my FIL to use when he makes short trips around town and it is perfect for that.Since this is a CDMA Tracfone phone, Amazon's description of it as GSM is wrong, it will activate on the Verizon network.  Since Verizon has great coverage were I live that is a plus.  You cannot get this phone at a store in most areas since Tracfone's predominant carriers are GSM.  If you want Verizon on a Tracfone this is your best bet.  It is not Verizon service but this company uses Verizon's network.This particular phone has \"double minutes for life\".  This means when you add airtime via Tracfone's aircards your purchased amount is automatically doubled.The chronology from purchase to first call.1.  Purchased via Prime and recieved in two days.2.  Opened package, set up phone and charged it.3.  Tried online activation but is was too much work since they wanted my personal information to set up an account.4.  Called the activation number and followed the simple directions.5.  I was slower than the activation system so I got punted to a real person who took all of one minute to help me finishand I was done. The activation process gave the phone 60 days of service with 10 minutes.6.  I purchased an instant activation Tracfone air card off eBay for $84 for 365 days and 450 minutes.  I loaded this on the phone following the included directions that also had a bonus coupon that added 50 minutes.  Since the phone automatically doubles the minutes my phone then had 425 days and 1,010 minutes.This was all very easy and took about 5 minutes. So for $99 (or just $7/month) I have (for my FIL) about 70 minutes a month for the next 14 months.  I have a Droid, Thrive, a laptop, and a Kindle but I find myself wanting this phone because it such a cheap and easy solution for making voice calls.UPDATE OCTOBER 2013:  No issues after a year.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "First phone", "Author": "bakeryroe", "ReviewID": "R1QNELQ2LO9KM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my 78 yr. old aunt.

Fourth phone I have had in ten years and it beats all the previous ones.  Ergonomics are just perfect for my large fingers and old eyes.  Very easy to program the features.  Battery life is very good.  I wanted a phone.  I have a Laptop and a point and shoot camera for the other  things.  The LG 221C with Tracfone Service thru Verizon is aces.  My old service was T-Mobile and with the Tracfone/Verizon service I have not found any weak or dead spots where I had a lot of them with T-Mobile, and I have more bars then my wifes phone with Sprint service.This is every thing a phone person could want.  I'm glad I bought two, and may soon buy another as my wife likes the LG221C better than her LG840G touchscreen.When I got this phone I activated it with a Tracfone number.  After a few days I decided it was a keeper.  I went online on Tracfone and transferred my T-Mobile phone number.  30 minutes later my T-Mobile phone went dead and my old number showed up on my new LG221C.  Outstanding service.

Luck", "ReviewID": "R1T6VJ5D45IJVG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the LG221C specifically because I needed a clamshell/flipphone with NO camera. I came, I activated it, then tried to put the back cover on. Wouldn't fit no matter what. I did a quick search and find that it is a common problem, not just with tracfones, but will all carriers who use this phone.  They are all packaged with the wrong back cover. I have spent the last hour with LG on chat and on the phone trying to get a correct back cover. They wouldn't do ANYTHING except tell me to bring it to the store I purchased it from and get the right cover. Uh... I bought it on Amazon. \"well tell Amazon to give you the right cover.\"Finally I changed tactics and called parts and instead of saying it came wrong, told them I needed a replacement cover. Finally they were nice... however, still no joy. There are NO correct back covers for this phone available from LG.  Very interesting since the date inside my phone said it was made 10/2012. It is now 3/2013 and they are apparently out of production and have no parts left.I'm more angry with LG than with Tracfone or Amazon, LG tried to tell me that they don't package the phone, the carriers do. Well how come then that it is not just tracfone, it is other budget carriers and they all have similar comments about this phone?  It seems like LG must have shipped them a batch of phone and backs that don't match.I will try sending this back to Amazon and get another one, just in case I get lucky, but i'm not counting on it.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect for us!", "Author": "Diane Sams", "ReviewID": "R3E0ZAAB3WRGLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were looking for a phone that is easy to use, has large numbers, easy to read screen, and works off Verizon.

Contract phone plans suck more out of the budget than they're worth, offering more minutes than you can use, and charging extra for features you do need, like texting and occasional emergency internet service.  Straight Talk seemed a good choice, but its set fee was only a little lower than the Verizon contract's.  Its internet option wasn't much help, either. V E R Y.  V E R Y.  S L O O O  W.I tried Consumer Cellular, which offered a wonderful phone with a bright white case (easy to find in dark purses, on the floor of the car, under the seat, between cushions--you get the drift). Great keypad for large fingers. Unfortunately it did not work in my area. Those on-line coverage maps are pipe dreams--what the company would like to believe.  And no, I did not get my money back. So that was $100 lost.I tried a tracfone, an LG 225C, slightly different from this one, which I chose because of it's decent-sized keypad and its double minutes for life.  I have big hands, and in my work I do a fair amount of texting.  Tiny keypads are frustrating.  I paid $19.99 at Walmart.  It's a sturdy phone--black, unfortunately. So, I proceded to lose track of it--in the car, in my tote, purse, etc.  It even fell out of my pocket in the rain, in a parking lot. It was found by a woman from my church, who tracked me down to arrange its return.  Neither rain nor dropping seemed to affect this sturdy phone.  I used it for a year--phone and airtime came to just under  $30/month.  Compare this with Verizon's $50-$60/month.I slapped a piece of white duct tape on the back of the phone (so it would show up more readily), but still managed to lose it for a couple weeks in early May.  Turning house and car upside down, I decided I must have lost it for good this time.  Online I saw a new model, with touchscreen and triple minutes for life and decided that would be a suitable replacement.  I tried ordering it online, but have never been able to order anything online from their website. When I saw it in a Wal-mart 40 miles from my home office, triple minutes and all, I paid $49 for a new tracfone. Then the real problems began. I followed the easy instrucctions carefully, but it did not work.  I called Tracfone customer service (another exercise in how-persistent-are-you-willing-to-be-to-get-what-you-want?).  The customer service tech transferred my minutes from the lost cell phone to my new phone, and we tried for 45 minutes to activate that phone.  She and her supervisor eventually determined I had the wrong phone for my network and offered to send me a free Verizon-enabled replacement and a mailer to return my failed purchase.They sent an LG 550C (looks like a little blackberry) in short order.  The new phone came in a package similar to the phone it replaced, but packaging clearly said 'double minutes for life.' I had been promised a phone 'just like the one you bought, only enabled for Verizon.  I was not surprised at the different phone, but I did note a week or so later it was offered on the Tracfone website for $19.99 for Mother's Day weekend.  There was even a card to purchase to make any tracfone a triple minutes for life phone.  But that was online, and I couldn't get it online.  I called to activate the new phone, and all was well.  Except I had a new number.  Since I use this phone for work I needed my previous number.  I called and was told it would take 'up to 3 business days' to activate the phone with my desired number, and the current 'temporary' number would be frozen.  So, I was still without a working phone.Of course this was on a Friday.  The next week I found my old phone. I activated it as soon as I could get an air card.  Calling about the new phone, the tech kept me on the phone for 30 minutes on hold.  In the background I could hear him pagig through paper, eating something, never saying a word or responding to my 'hello? Are we still working on my request here?'  It was yet another (allbeit extreme) 'how-much-are-you-willing-to-put-up-with-to-get-what-you-want-or-wouldn't-you-rather-settle-for-what-you-have situation. I didn't hang up and try again because that would mean another half hour in que waiting for another grumpy tech.I finally did hang up, laughing.  This was clearly a stand-off: 'I am doing this to you, lady, because I can and you're ungrateful and stupid, losing your phone and expecting me to port your number to a new one.'  I called back the next day (4 business days) and a young woman was able to port the number in a matter of minutes. I asked her if my new phone was indeed triple minutes.  She said it was noted as such in the com[puter.  Probably next to the label 'difficult customer!' I now have 2 cell phones.  I don't even know the number of the older one (though I can look it up easily enough), and I use it for non-business calls, keeping it in the glove compartment of the car (where you're told NOT to keep electronics).Both phones are LG's.  Both have amazing battery life.  The newer one is easier to use for internet, and the internet is a great feature for emergency on-the- road lookups--addresses, bank balances, etc.  The newer phone has a very slightly better camera. But let me advise you: Do as I did and buy a bright colored sleeve for the phone. It not only makes the phone easier to see but cushions it against dropping and keeps it from slithering out of pants pockets.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "won't work", "Author": "h8402", "ReviewID": "R2D25X6OFRV6AZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "phone looks good but I did'nt get to use it.
