{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally a usable dual SIM smart phone!", "Author": "Gear Head \"photo geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2B1XECW22BWH1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, you need to set your expectations right. Samsung Galaxy Y duos is an entry level smartphone. Do not expect all the latest and greatest features one can find in Galaxy S II or S III. For example, screen is low resolution and is not particularly bright. The amount of internal memory is very modest, and the processor is not fast. There is only one camera, and it is a fixed lens no flash one.On the bright side, Samsung actually improved a few features over Galaxy Y and did extremely good job integrating the dual SIM functionality. I particularly like the way the SIM switching and management is integrated into the Android notification area. I can also select which SIM is going to be used for data. The phone supports Quad band on both SIMs and also has dual band 3G connectivity. WiFi works smoothly and is actually pretty fast. Battery life is reasonable - 2 days on average with reasonable usage (a couple of hours of calls a day + some browsing/downloading). Call quality is good, no dropped calls whatsoever. The speaker could be better but it is reasonable.Note the following limitations- Only one SIM can operate in 3G, the second one is forced into 2G.- Dual SIM is dual standby type. It means that if you are in a call on one SIM, an incoming call on the other SIM will get \"not reachable\" message. The phone does allow receiving a call on one SIM while using the other one for data connection.Overall I am satisfied with the phone. I wish Samsung would release a dual SIM version of mid or high end smartphone, but in the meantime Galaxy Y  duos will do.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't Turn Off Phone", "Author": "Black Shango", "ReviewID": "R1LSSIPF9URAO6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "On 2/5/2013 I ordered a Samsung GT-S6102B from Surge Telecom. The phone arrived on 2/12/2013. The first thing I noticed is that the phone cannot be turned off with the ON/Off button. It turns off and immediately turns back on by itself. The only way to turn the thing off is to take off the back cover and remove the battery.  I was going to return it thinking it was defective but lost the phone while away on a trip.So upon my return, needing a dual SIM phone, I purchased a second GT-S6102B on 2/28/2013 from Surge Telecom again, still assuming the first one was defective. So what do I discover about this second phone? The phone cannot be turned off with the ON/Off button. It turns off and immediately turns back on. Like the first phone, the only way to turn this phone off is to take off the back and remove the battery.If you want a phone that can never be turned off to conserve the charge on the battery, then this must be the phone for you. But for me, this is the first and last Samsung phone I will ever buy.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone does NOT have warranty in USA", "Author": "Wayne Ju", "ReviewID": "R1424HT3TA3284", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I checked with Samsung support and was told this phone is not under warranty in USA.
