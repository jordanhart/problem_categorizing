{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Totally Awesome Phone but Beware Of Sellers", "Author": "SEAN SEEBRAN", "ReviewID": "R1RXHE99LZ7DI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are on the fence about purchasing the Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White, rest assured that you will be getting what I dear say is the most advanced phone/tablet on the market to date. What are the features of this phone? What can it do? It may actually be easier to tell you what it can't do.I've had lots of different makes and models of cell phones over the years, including Blackberry and Iphone but I dear say that this is by far the best phone that I've ever owned, it has way more features than I may ever actually use. The Samsung Galaxy Note II makes the great Iphone seem very BORING in comparison.This being the international version, I initially had a little trouble with getting Apps from the Samsung Apps Store, every time I tried I got an Error Message that was basically stating that the Samsung Apps was registered in one Country and my Samsung account was from another country so I was unable to get any Apps for the Samsung Apps Store. (If you are having the same problem, just let me know and I'll help you fix the issue).The level of customization on this phone is simply amazing, I know that you will happy with this purchase, unless you have an issue with the size, let's face facts this is a big phone but it is by far the best out there, a total beast when it comes to processing power.P.S.  I must make mention of this just to let you know happened when I made my purchase so you can take precaution when making yours.I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Note II form a seller known as \"Techno.Trading.House\" but was fulfilled by Amazon. When I received the package, there were no seals on the box, there should be a seal on each side, it should also have a plastic film on the screen as well as the back of the phone, but the one on the back was missing and there was minor scratches on the back of the phone.When I took the plastic film off of the screen there were finger prints all over and the battery was not in a plastic bag as it was supposed to be, taking all of these things into consideration, it lead me to believe that someone opened this box and placed the battery into the phone probably out of curiosity, whatever the reason, someone clearly TAMPERED with my phone scratching the back cover in the process.When I checked the log it showed that the phone was in use for over 5.5 minutes, apart from this, the phone seems to be in perfect working condition with no scratches on the screen whatsoever.My advice to you is to purchase from Amazon or from a seller whose product is fulfilled by Amazon in order for you to be covered by Amazon.When Amazon heard of my issue, they apologized for what happened and told me that products from other sellers that are fulfilled by them is from the sellers stock, and they promptly offered me a full refund so I can re-order, which I thought was great on their part, Amazon always like to see their customer be happy with their purchase.I told Amazon that I don't think that a full refund was necessary in this case as the phone works great otherwise so they offered my a 20% refund for the condition in which I received the phone, this I accepted as I consider this fair for all.PLEASE be careful who you purchase from, these phones are not cheap in any way, if you were to look at \"Techno.Trading.House\" seller's profile & feedback rating you will see mostly 5 star ratings which may give a false sense of security, make sure that your purchase is covered by Amazon for your peace of mind.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible phone/tablet!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1GU4GDXEVOIIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When one opens the box, there is a sense of awe. People ask \"Is this really a phone\" was one reaction I got. It is an amazing piece of hardware. I have used Android devices starting from Cupcake version, used iPhone, HP Veer with webOS, Windows 7.5 HTC Titan 2. This phone is the sleekest and one of the best so far. It is fabulous!  I find the big size to be very good and not a problem at all. Will the Galaxy Note 3 be 6\" ?!Out of the box, connect to wireless and get the phone logged into Google account. The advantage of Android phones is that once you are logged into Google universe, everything gets synced up especially if you have been using Android.  The position of power button is at an excellent position for your hand on this Note 2. The additional LED for notification on top is very handy. Listen Apple? The camera serves some really futuristic ideas also. It can check if you are looking at the phone and disable screen lock (even if you set timeout to say 30 sec). Also it can serve as password unlock. Amazing! These can be set from Settings Menu.The Android version as of Oct 26 2012 is Jellybean 4.1.1. Kernel version is 3.0.31-259982. Model GT-N7100. I got the 64 GB microSD card. Get this mobileUltra, it is the latest as of Oct 2012. (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging. Settings show an available space of 59.45 GB. So along with 16 GB built (system shows only around 10.46 GB), my Note 2 has 80 GB memory. With music in the  Google Music cloud, I intent to use the memory for video/pictures as a camcorder/camera.I strongly suggest going through Settings and customizing many things as per your desire. I did Voice Input, Keyboard (this comes with English(UK), change to English(US) for example. Fiddle around the settings and you will be amazed how much you can customize. I also did Battery % to appear in notification bar.One thing I found the default keyboard did not show Mic button. I realized it was next to Sym button. Long press it and choose Mic. And then on, it will appear in default keyboard. Also customize the accent. It can do magic for typing. I type paragraphs at a time effortlessly. This is Google backend servers at work. The Mic on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 does a fantastic job!S-Pen, Ah.. I was truly impressed. You have to use these to believe it. The note taking was very fluid. Samsung seem to have nailed it. I wrote up an equation in Equation mode - x^5 = x^2 + 2x + .... Something completely random, another one d/dx(an equation) and it recognized perfectly and asked it to search, it went to Wolfram Alpha and solved it. It is at first unbelievable and then it starts to sink in this is a computer program made well. Like it should be in first place! Export to pdf is very good. The main thing is the pen is very fluid and feels like a fountain pen writing.Overall, the phone feels very smooth and snappy. The screen is crisp and clear. Apps can even be multi screened. Samsung approved apps can be placed two in a screen. Eg. Maps on top and email on bottom portion. I doubt I will use this, but handy.One gripe I have with this phone is speaker is on the back. Typically if you lie the phone down, the speaker is blocked on bottom. I wish the speakers were in the side. This is a design decision and not sure why phones have speaker on back. But the speaker volume is very high, so I am not complaining too much.One big pain point with Android is once you purchased/downloaded for free Apps, they cannot be permanently deleted. So even if you get a junk app, and delete immediately they are permanently there in your Google Play store. From the phone's play store I got 300+ Apps. One cannot choose 50 apps and say get all these. You have to do one by one. After getting one, the screen resets to beginning. So I went to a computer browser and pushed apps to pone. This is easier and faster.UPDATE: In Jelly bean, you can make the apps vanish from the list entirely. Look at comment #1 from Mark. In the My Apps in settings, at the end of the app there is a circle with a / in middle. Tap on it and confirm to remove. This is great, but if you have a list of 200 apps, you have do this one by one. Also the list resets to beginning after each delete.Some of apps I have as of now :Amazon MobileAndroid Status : Android Status app shows ARMv7, Max Freq 1.6 GHz, BogoMips 1592.52 Memory 1.79 GB, Free 365 MB, Internal Storage 10.46 GB Free 7.18 GB.

Unfortunately, it couldn't be charged or restarted after an auto power-off at the beginning of this March. It's been DEAD since then. According to the documents that came with the phone, there is a 2-year warranty. However, the seller FGS Trading refused to offer me any help or give me any information about the origin of the phone after I have contacted with them for SIX times. They simply said it was already more than 30 days after purchase and it had nothing to do with them. They asked me to go to Samsung directly for help or repair the phone by myself. Even more worse, they provided me with an unanswered customer service number.Then I turned to Samsung for help. Until then I had been told that the phone was an international one ,and the Samsung US wasn't responsible for it .If I had known this ,I wouldn't buy a phone without US warranty. So I thought I was cheated by the seller-FST Trading. They shouldn't ignore such important information. Samsung told me they could do nothing without knowing the origin of the phone and asked me to go back to the seller. This is just RIDICULOUS!I chose to buy a cell phone through Amazon because it's been known to everyone Amazon is very reliable. And now this is what I have met with. I think Amazon is responsible to give me a reasonable solution, rather than let me make any more phone calls to listen to any NONSENSE. As a matter of fact, I have contacted with Amazon twice. And Amazon promised to negotiate with FGS trading for me. However, nothing has changed. The seller still keep the same attitude, ignoring their customer's requests .If you need, I can forward you all the emails between the FGS Trading and me. After reading the emails, I think you will be angry with them and their attitude. How should I buy a phone in the first place if I knew I would not get any technical support here in the United States? You shouldn't let the sellers like FGS Trading to sell goods through Amazon anymore .And I also found somebody else met the same problem with me.I have no choice but request to return the phone and get a full refund.

I love being able to use the multitasking sucks though that not alot of apps support that function yet though. The battery life is amazing and can take my heavy pounding all day long. The fast charging is no joke its fast. The s pen function that is supposed to beep and vibrant when you leave the pen out and walk away does not work well at all though. The phone can run a littke hot because its a quad core but that's not also a big deal breaker. There is a led light on the top left of the device so you will know when you have a notification. I am not going to root this phone it does not need it like all other phones.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works Great on AT&T;! Except for Voicemail!", "Author": "John Platt \"alwaysonjohn\"", "ReviewID": "RVSMTPC4S6SZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I start my review let me remind you that this is the GSM version meaning it will work on AT&T;, T-Mobile (no 3g support), and Straight-talk here in the United States.  This is NOT the LTE Version of the phone so LTE will not work.  Also, the international version can come from different countries.  I ordered for World Wide Distributors and I can tell you that mine is an unbranded Argentina version.  I did not want to wait for the AT&T; version since LTE is not available in my area yet.  Plus, AT&T; is known for taking forever to approve Android O/S updates.Now on with my review.Phone Setup: I took my phone to AT&T; they scanned the barcode and put in a new micro-sim.  Everything worked great without manually putting in any settings except for visual voicemail.  You can download the AT&T; Visual Voicemail app and even with AT&T; Support I could not get it running.  I instead installed YouMail which I find to be better anyways.  The data speeds will be HSPA+ on AT&T; which for my small town that means speeds of 2.5MB/s.  I also wanted to add that wifi hotspot works fine with AT&T.;Calling:  At-First it was awkward speaking on the phone.  I didn't know where the phone should be in relation to my ear, but after a couple of hours playing with it I now have the hang of it.  The phone call quality is average and i get average reception.TecTiles: These little devices require you to go in your settings and enable NFC.  Then you can go into the play store and download the TecTile App.  You can then program these tectiles and place them where you need.  I use four right now, (two near the door for entering/leaving, one in the car, and one near the nightstand).  These TecTiles are amazing and with one little bump I can put my phone on silent/vibration off/open clock before i go to bed or turn my Bluetooth on and open spotify while i am in the car.Flip Cover: The phone does not come with it, but i decided to buy one.  The flip cover works great (if you can find them in stock).  They automatically turn the phone on as you open the cover.  Plus the phone will automatically turn off when you close it.  Plus the phone has a feature where it won't turn off the screen if the camera detects you looking at the screen.  Make sure you get an official Samsung Flip cover since the NFC Antenna is built-into the phone's cover...Camera: It works great. The video recording works great too.Music: I use spotify and I must say this phone is plenty loud on speaker mode and it works great over bluetooth to my car dvd player.Screen:  This is probably the reason you bought it and it looks gorgeous!  Facebook looks amazing, as does angry birds and other games.Keyboard:  I just wanted to add that the keyboard does not do auto-correcting up to my standards so i switched to swiftkey.  While doing this I lost some s-pen functionality such as the pad to write on for text messages.S-Pen:  For now the s-pen also does not highlight text on facebook or chrome but that may be added later. I also found the help section in settings which explained the shortcuts for thes-pen.  There are short-cuts for accessing the menu, going back, opening a s-pen app that will allow you to type to do more functions, and capture screenshots.  As of 11-12-12 there is no shortcut for going back to the home screen so you have to hit the button to go back to the home screen (or you could type the back shortcut several times).  The s-pen is helpful especially when precise movements is critical.  Draw Something is easier now! There is also a feature to alert you if you walk off without redocking the s-pen.LED Notifications:  There is a blue/red led that blinks alerting you of text messages or emails.  This can be turned off (thank goodness) for when you go to bed, etc.  It also turns red when charging and turns green when finished.Battery Life: Absolutely amazing.  I am ending the day with 40% left which almost makes me want to try and go two days.SD Card: I added a micro-sd 32GB card.  It read it fine without formatting. I bought a Sandisk Ultra Micro-SD Class U-1 aka Class 10.Widgets:  Samsung/Google added some free basic widgets.  The calendar widget takes up a whole screen that merges all of my calendars (work/school/personal) into one calendar for me.Find your phone:  Registering with Samsung allows you to sign-up for a find your phone feature that can supposedly find your phone even it is factory formatted and even if a new sim-card is placed in the device.  There are also some other security abilities such as remote-wiping too that samsung has added.Facebook: The phone syncs with existing FB contacts and all contacts if you want.  It also sync my calendar and FB photos show up in my gallery!  The facebook integration is very well done.Gmail: There is no zooming in gmail still but supposedly the next update will fix this.  Gmail works as normal and comes pre-installed.Chrome: It comes pre-installed but is not set by default.  I love this app and the incognito browsing is nice.  I also like syncing my bookmarks with my laptop.Dropbox: The phone comes with a 50GB/2 year offer.  That means dropbox will be free for the next two years with a 50gb option. I am currently using it for syncing photos only. My offer didn't automatically take effect upon sign-up for 50GB of storage until I installed the program on my laptop then they e-mailed me a link to complete the 50GB offer!Overall Use:  It works great. I love the S-Pen functionality when texting (you can write out your texts) but I will have to learn all the \"shortcuts\" soon.  I also enjoy the speech to text features as well.  I LOVE this phone.  The quad-core processor puts it over the top in speed as well.  This phone does NOT lag and everything runs smooth.  Overall i love this phone.  The only cons for the \"international version\" is that there is NO LTE, the stock keyboard sucks (but should get better when the next update rolls out), my voicemail didn't work (which was fixed with a 3rd part program called YouMail, and you can't remove the Samsung Chat program which no one uses...", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "INCREDIBLE!!", "Author": "shojus", "ReviewID": "R2NOPJST4PSJI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First,I purchased this phone through Amazon but it was just fulfilled by them so I will not lower the rating cause I received an open box item that was already used cause it's NOT the products fault!

Last December I purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note II from Amazon through Worldwide Distributors. The phone worked fine for 9 months up until September. Then without warning, the phone simply died. It was not the battery and the phone was never dropped, nor exposed to water nor any other hazards. There was not even a scratch on the phone. It was completely dead with no lights or sounds and it was not the battery. Worldwide Distributors won't help you after 90 days so I contacted Samsung. After first being directed to Samsung U.S. in Texas, who told me that it was a Latin American version so they couldn't help me, they directed me to Samsung in Panama, who told me that it was actually a U.K. version. Samsung U.K. was also of absolutely no help. Bottom line, I paid $642.00 for a brand new phone that Samsung refuses to even look at, will not repair, not exchange nor refund even though the product is still under warranty even as I write this. I have had several hours of conversations and numerous emails including with various managers and even contacted Samsung corporate who all refused to help saying that it was \"not economically viable\" to repair, refund or replace their defective product. I will never buy another Samsung product ever again and write this review solely as a warning to others that if you buy an unlocked version of a Samsung phone, they will not honor their warranty if the phone should fail and you will essentially be throwing your money away.

For one, it doesn't come with US hardware, like the USB charger is a European model. There is no warranty either, I contact Amazon, they told me to contact where I got it, I think they said World Wide dist., they were short and terse with me. They couldn't tell me how I can register this phone. What's worse is that Samsung doesn't support it either - they made the phone. You can't ask questions because the number n7100 isn't a choice. So that's a big problem right there.I installed a Sandisk class 10 64gb micro sd card, it had the android on the cover. The phone knows it's there, yet there is no install to SD option anywhere on the phone, and most programs don't know from it. Some know it's there, some don't, some backup programs know it's there and can use it. But for the most part it's useless, and I can't find anyone in Samsung that will answer that simple question. I don't want to root the phone, because I don't want to take the chance messing it up. I'm hoping it's a glitch, 4.1.2 is rumored to come out at the end of January, maybe that will be fixed by then.That's why it's a 3.However that aside, it's a great phone. Fast, GPS locks on in seconds (though a little too often since it writes home to google each time you connect). Plenty of apps to get. I found it odd that even though I'm plugged into the USB, that the battery will drain. And the computer won't sync up with it, instead I have to rely on the wifi working.The pen feature is kind of dumb. Mostly it's the software, Samsung made the software and it doesn't flow like the system does. Like you can't drag and drop a file, you have to select by holding down, then move, then click the folder, then select move again, it's kind of tedious. The pen is also really hard to hold onto and that button is a joke, unless you have tiny hands.The size of the thing is rather large, and it's very slippery. Even with a case on it, it slid out of my pocket twice. If you plan on putting it in your pocket, and I place the glass side against my leg, choose a case that is sticky. When the otter box comes here and if it's less then retail I'll buy that. The instructions are terrible though it does come with a help app. The instructions that came with the phone was in 5 languages but not English, but you can download the full version online anyway, and the booklet was mostly for that pen.Everything about the phone is google oriented, and while I'm not totally certain, I think my search results for a map ended up in the google now that's installed. The talking features of the phone work well, they understand most things what I say, I just wish I could teach it my name. The spoken by it works well. The map functions is more than great because you can download 10 miles at a time, though the resolution drops the further away you get. But the maps are huge. But when offline you can browse these as if you were online and get spoken turn by turn instructions. If your online you can choose other routes to avoid traffic. There is a siri like thing on this device that I have yet to figure out. So far everything I asked has been totally ignored. Frankly I don't know what it's even for. I guess it's another gimmick to compete with apple.Graphics are fantastic, bold bright and pretty even. Strong contrast, you'll lose a little detail in the shadows, but everything else looks wonderful. There is a built in updater that will check and install any updates you programs might need. The info is in the notification box. The flash for the camera is a LED, pretty bright and can be used as a flashlight, so that's pretty neat. Oh you might want to get a better USB, I find that it's too short and seems to always pull out, along with that - you'll need the charger for your outlet, if you don't already have one.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung & Seller offers no help when it stopped working", "Author": "Kathryn Ovcina", "ReviewID": "RS5H3T7MJOU50", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this (new) in the U.S. from FGS Trading (based in Miami) through Amazon.

Everything about this phone feels different from all the androids I've tried. I chose this over the nexus 4 and i don't regret it. it's not perfect however. here are some of the things that could be improved:1. phone needs to switch the menu button with the back button. almost all androids have it the other way i don't know why samsung put the back button on the right side. this is especially problematic when writing notes with the S-pen and my hand keeps hitting the back button.2. If you like the read aloud feature of google books, you have to turn on the talkback feature and disable airview (the feature that lets the s-pen communicate with the phone before it touches the screen. this isn't too hard but it's still 2 extra steps compared to my previous nexus where the read aloud  is just 1-2 clicks away; no need to play with the accessibility settings.3. S-note doesn't let you zoom into the page so you can write more. Handy Note and Antipaper Notes does this well.4. touchwiz is feature rich and i love it but it doesn't conform with android's holo theme which is more sophisticated looking5. if you enjoy video maker in note 1, it's missing in note 2 for some reason. they replaced it with \"video editor\" in the samsung apps market but it's not exactly the same. it removed the ability to edit and annotate the video with s-pen input.6. google music widget is ugly while the samsung media player (widget) doesn't work with google music at all.7. changing the wallpaper takes too many steps.8. they need to improve the calendar app. the widget doesn't show the S-pen marks. and i heard samsung calendar doesn't sync with google calendar. not sure about that.9. image search syncs with images in dropbox but not google picasa. that was a big disappointment to me. there were so many times i wanted to pull out some image from my google photos and it only shows me the ones in my phone and in my dropbox account.the positives:1. the S-Pen is awesome and can be used in many ways. this is a stylus-centric OS.2. screen is big and beautiful3. FASSSST. no lags. i can do anything. 2 GB RAM!!4. battery life is great. 1 1/2 day for typical users and 1 day for power users.5. you get 50gb of dropbox storage for free (for 2 yrs).6. works with google voice.7. syncs with facebook contacts8. click \"add shortcut to home\" for your favorite contacts and put them in one folder, it's like a speed dial! there's also actual speed dial. samsung handled the address book well.9. 2 wonderful unique ways to type: one is using the s-pen and swyping with it and second is text recognition when you write with the s-pen or just your finger. it's not perfect but it's awfully accurate. most of my problems with it is it capitalizes when it's not supposed to but the letters are usually correct.10. scrapbooking! i have installed flicker, ebay, 500px, Fancy and Pinterest so i can search and clip items to be put in my scrapbook. discover wonderful s-pen apps like comicbook, flipaclip, paper artist, photo desk, photo editor, sketchbook, notes on life and papyrus. try the game sudoku with s-pen input. these are all s-pen specialized apps.11. you'll love evernote with this phone. also try catch.12. ChatOn is a wonderful chat program that's cross platform but with the S-pen you can do a lot more with animated messages and edited images from your scrapbook. you can even record what you're doing in your screen with the right productivity apps. e-mail and messaging are more powerful with the s-pen.3. accessories: the moga controller, the samsung dongle, the all powerful dock, a slew of nice cases (if the note 1 was any indication).so although i would be unhappy that this won't prob. get instant updates from google, this is however a version i can get stuck with for 2 yrs. touchwiz isn't too bad and you can't go wrong with 2GB of RAM.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung galaxy note II N7100", "Author": "Julian", "ReviewID": "RIXRIU8ZVTXZO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recommend the customers do not buy this cell phone.

What???.....I would not have bought this phone by spending >$600 if I knew that the warranty is based on UAE.

Big for gaming, big for videos, big for web browsing. Simply put, if you want a phone with the most real estate on the screen size, then there is no alternative. Don't be so mesmerized on the 1080p screens that will come out soon. Unless you want to destroy your eyes and use the phone from an inch away, you will not notice the difference in everyday use.2- It's fast. Yes, the Qualcomm S4 Pro quad-core beats this Tegra 3/Exynos 4 CPU in most benchmarks, but again, unless you are a hard-core geek that is OCD on numbers, you will not notice any difference in everyday use. There is no discernible lag anywhere (it's probably just your slow Internet connection).3- It's beautiful. Not HTC or Sony beautiful, but this is one sleek and stylish phone. The white is classic, but the Titanium Gray is also super slick. Just check out the back cover and you will see what I mean (yes, even with that cheap-feeling plastic material).4- Did I mention the screen? It's BIG, it's bright, and it's beee-ay-eeww-ti-ful! AMOLED screens have awesome color saturation and contrast (most times even overkill, actually). Some people say it's not good in daylight. Um, have you tried cranking up the brightness??5- The Samsung/Android touch. Not everyone may like Samsung's Touchwiz user interface compiled onto Android, but I dare you to find a phone with more features than this one (and similarly the Galaxy S3). Here are the main highlights:a. Samsung utilizes the front facing camera almost to perfection. You can use it to control your music player; it has facial recognition to sense you are directly in front of the screen so it won't dim and turn off the screen (for reading, web browing, video playback, etc.); it recognizes your facial orientation so that when you are lying down sideways looking at the screen, the accelerometer will not kick in to auto-rotate the screen in the wrong orientation. That is something that has always bothered me with other phones and FINALLY someone has added that feature! Granted, not all these features work flawlessly, but it's a great start.b. Integration with Google is finally starting to show off in good ways. It was always once that Apple had the superior ecosystem. But now we see the future is bright indeed. Not just evolution, but finally innovation!c. The S Pen and all the neat things you can do with it. Preview a point in the movie before skipping to that point, and other things like going old-school back to the PDA days!6- It accepts up to a 64GB microSD card. That turned out to be the dealbreaker for me. Explanation in \"cons\" section below.Cons:1- It's BIG. With my tiny hands(hey hey), I can hardly do anything one-handed with this phone. Pocketability rating: -2. Putting it up on your face to make a phone call is also a big fail if you're sensitive to public ridicule like me. Have your Bluetooth earpiece ready.2- It's quite heavy. I really wanted to switch to the Verizon Droid DNA - for a 5-inch screen, it was remarkably svelte and light. And if it wasn't for the fact of pi$$-poor Verizon customer service at their call centers, and that it only had 16GB of memory with no microSD card option, I would have made the switch. The Droid DNA is superior in every way except those things mentioned. I have absolutely no doubt that the Samsung Note 3 (and maybe even the Galaxy S4) will be a 1080p screen with the Exynos 5 quadcore - can't wait!3- The screen may be bright and colorful, but it's way over-saturated and unnatural. Fortunately, you can go to the screen options and set it to \"Natural.\" \"Dynamic\" is overkill, and even so is \"Standard.\"Conclusion:Even with its inherent flaws, I can't help but love it. It's not even a phone, it's a cellular tablet(cablet, anyone??). I'm going to keep it.

We ordered from Techgiant, a third-party merchant here on Amazon, and they informed us that there was nothing they would do to remedy this (nice, no?). Contacted Samsung, who informed us that since the phone was manufactured in Vietnam, they are not responsible for any warranty within the U.S.  We took it to a local cell phone repair shop, and apparently the main board fried....no idea how or why....to the point where they said repairing it would be cost prohibitive. Contacted Amazon, and God bless them, they gave us a partial refund as an effort to lessen our heartache.My wife still loves the phone, so we're going to get an unlocked version through Staples, and we will buy a warranty through them as well. We would buy directly from Amazon instead, but they only sell this through third-party merchants. We will pay about $100 more that we would online just for the phone, but the peace of mind we'll have getting it through a reputable company makes it worth the extra cost.If you read all of the reviews, you'll see our experience is not unique. So, purchasing this phone online, through a third-party vendor, is a gamble.  If you choose to roll the dice, I hope you have better luck than we did.  I felt obliged to update this review to let you know of our very bad experience so maybe you can avoid having to go through something similar.Original review:My wife was tethered to T-Horrible by a contract for several years, which we finally broke away from....with a penalty, of course.  It was worth it.  They treat their customers like dirt.We then switched to Virgin Mobile, which didn't work out so well either due to bad connectivity and bad customer service (but not as bad as T-Horrible, by any means...the main issue was being on hold for an hour to speak to someone in India, and usually subsequently getting disconnected).  Plus, at least with the Virgin plan, we were not bound to a contract....something we vowed to not repeat if possible.We bought this Samsung phone and switched over to Straight Talk, and couldn't be happier.  Connectivity is great, as is their customer service (so far).We ordered a micro SIM card with the AT&T; format.  Even going with their higher priced unlimited $45 per month no-contract plan, I figure it will take about a year in savings as compared to a contract plan to break even on what I paid for the phone.We contacted Straight Talk and made it clear that she wanted to keep her old number.  We were told it could take a day or two to process everything and make the switch.  Well, that was wrong....it took about an hour!  We ordered the 30-day unlimited plan and the SIM card online from their website, and it arrived the next day (the had a special offer for free overnight shipping).My wife's only complaint about the phone itself is how complex it is; it takes some time to learn everything it can do and how to make adjustments (e.g., why is it making that noise every now and then?).  It really is an amazing device....the screen clarity and all the options it offers will blow you away!If things change, I will update the review, but right now we are very happy with our decision to go with this phone and with Straight Talk as a service provider.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST CELLPHONE EVER!", "Author": "Cassie", "ReviewID": "R27I1CEX7S53JA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is the best cellphone I have.

The size makes all this so easy, I think the size is perfect for a pocket-computer that also has a phone in it. To be honest, phone conversations are probably 2% of the use on my little marvel ;-)The iPhone is just to small for me and the iPad is way to big. IPad mini (copied the Galaxy Tab) doesn't fit in your pocket but this Note II sure does fit ok  in mine, without a problem. I do have big pockets, yes, ok.And since I like to read longer articles, the iphone just didn't cut it beyond a paragraph. This screen size is just perfect for on the go reading. It gives you about half the reading surface of a kindle. Reading a book I'd recommend the Samsung 800, Kindle or a mini iPad, both perfect reading sizes. But for shorter reading periods such as an 8-15 page article, this will do great on the go.Pros: Great screen size for a pocket computer. Makes everything so much easier than on the iPhone.Cons: Teflon-like body. I did drop it and break the screen because it slipped out of my hands as I was carrying several things. Its not teflon but that's how I think of it. Be careful. The screen is fragile.Camera is ok, but not great. the iPhone camera is a better quality. But I always carry around a small real camera anyway. You know, in my other pocket.This phone is on the big side for my runs. I think the iPhone is a bit large for that as well, but easier to hold.There are a lot of things you can push and I had to get used to not pressing something erroneously.

The ionic guardian is decent but i need to carry the phone on my belt, hence the defender.Battery life is excellent: two days on moderate to heavy use. The charger charges the phone in under an hour from 0 %, maybe even just 30 min. It's very convenient, but I just charge mine off the usb port as it is better for the battery's longevity.I love this phone's screen, responsiveness, 64 gb card allows me to upload all my music and photo albums to the phone, not to mention saving offline maps, pages, using the camera freely, etc. I highly recommend getting the maximum capacity card installed.So, productivity, performance, screen quality and battery life are 5 out of 5, it's the fragility of the plastic and the exposed screen that bring my overall rating to 4 stars.

I'm very high tech and will not let technology pass me by. I have to have the \"latest and the greatest\".Now... about this \"Phablet\" (thats Phone + Tablet)**This thing is HUGE!! It will fit in a pocket or purse, but it is a big one. Definately not a one handed phone.**Everything that they say about it on TV and the internet is true!**Big screen, very bright and I don't even need my readers to read internet pages.**Can you say FASSSSTTTTT! Quad core processor is amazing. This is one of the first quad core processors in a phone.**Battery: OMG, it has a huge battery (3100 mAh) and clams a 15 hour charge without non-stop use. I am a heavy user and have not killed it in the course of a 10 hour work day, although it was down to about 30-40%.**It can run about any video format.**Flash can be loaded but have to do a \"work around\" to do it since Adobe isn't supporting it anymore. An internet or YouTube search can fix that. I did it, and it works just perfect.**Speakers are much louder than other smart phones.**Easily personalized**With a proper OTG (On The Go) cable you can use USB keyboard, mouse, flash drive or portable hard drive.**I have used it for video chat and you wouldn't believe the quality and speed.**Comes stock with Jelly Bean**Update for split screen multi-tasking capability is being rolled out slowly but it is coming.**Has the new updated S-Pen. This is a major breakthrough for those of us who are \"business on the go\". I am personally, still learning what all can be done with it but there is MUCH.CONS: because it is so new, a limited array of accessories and apps specifically for it but that will change.WARNING:1. Use the stock Samsung battery charger. I had a generic one in my office and it didn't seem to have enough output and it was charging very very slow. I put the stock charger on it and it charged super fast.2. Beware of aftermarket cases, pretty back covers, etc. Make sure they contain the NFC antennas, many do not and therefore your NFC communication will not work.Side note: I had only had my Galaxy 3 for about 3 months (absolutely loved it) and went into the store to see this and HAD to have it. Its everything my GS3 was plus! I had to reach deep to get it but it was worth every penny. I had the very first smart phone that ran Windows Mobile, and I thought I was all that and then some. I have had about 9 I think. Once you use a smart phone you'll never be able to go back to a non-smart one.

Just make sure your MVNO allows this too.As for the functionality of the phone itself, you won\u2019t get 4G data, but I was able to achieve 3G Plus (H+) with my carrier.

As for the display, it\u2019s my first AMOLED display phone. I noticed, blacks to be very black and primary colors to be very vivid, especially reds.

Very very fast, working Multi-tasking unlike At&t.; It works flawlessly with At&t; service in the states. I had no problem with rooting the device, if anything it runs a little faster. Quadrant Standard put out a 6573 Benchmark as the highest I have tested, lowest was 6123.The 8 Mega-pixel camera takes pictures at the quality of a 12MP.  The burst shot has pros and cons, I say use it statically. Don't move the camera but snapping photos of a dog or something moving, whilst keeping the camera still turn out great.I love the size of the phone, If you decide to become a Root user there is options available to adjust the Resolution. This giving you a more customization experience with your device. Do you prefer more Tablet or more Phone. Change the resolution and find out for yourself.The sound is great for its small back side facing speaker. You wont be throwing a party but you could easily use this as a music player around the house or odd jobs without having to use a stereo at all.My only complaint is the S-pen seems a bit sensitive. I am one who likes to hover that pen over my screen thus causing me to select screens and mark things I didn't mean to. This may be more of a PEBKAC (Problem exists between keyboard and chair) issue than anything, however an ability to adjust the distance sensing of the S-pen would be fantastic.Bottom line- This \"PHABLET\" is freaking awesome, anyone with a love or lust for processing power in the palm of your hand, well this is the device. Should also make a comment about Samsung FINALLY has an all day battery!If I had to give it a score I'd say 9.5/10.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone tablet standard...", "Author": "M.

I was amazed at the size and thought to myself if i could fit it in my pocket, use android, and enjoy the whole experience the Note would be.. after doing much research i decided to jump the boat and try the Galaxy Note 2 and i haven't looked back since. The screen is Amazing!!! Yes it is a bit more saturation than i would like but other than that the size is great and the quality of the screen is great too. This is NOT a one handed device for almost everyone. I happened to have hands big enough to use one handed but many of you will not be able to keep this in mind. The S-Pen is handy some times..

The Iphone is just as good (if not better) than android at keeping one organized. When it boils down to it, the note 2 is good for video games and movies.I owned the Note 2 for about 4 months. I'm 6' 4\" tall with XL hands. I dropped the Note 2 at least once a day. I found that lying in bed and looking at my phone was all but impossible with the Note 2. My hands also hurt on a continuous basis, due to the fact that I was always trying to hold this ridiculously large phone with one hand.Everyone told me that this phone was too big. Every time I pulled it out, I would get bombarded with comments about how I should carry that phone on my back. The fact that the Iphone looked so small in comparison was my justification. When looking at the Iphone, after holding the note, I was blown away by how tiny the Iphone really was. I quickly discovered that it takes about 2 minutes to adapt back to the Iphone size. A good movie is just as good on a 32\" tv as it is on an 80\".What I discovered through this experience is that Android fan boys are just as bad as the Apple ones, but the Android guys write way more reviews. Just look at Craigslist and you will see all the people trying to trade their Note 2 for an iPhone.
