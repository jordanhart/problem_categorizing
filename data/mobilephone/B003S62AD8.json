The battery life of this phone is amazing. One bar can last you two days and no bars can last you a full day and this is only txting and making two or three calls. But i will tell you its now starting to act up a little but now a days phones start to have problems usually around this time so that you can waste money on buying a new phone by upgrading with a new 2year contract. But i would most definitely recommend for those who love to text.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not very sexy but quite dependable", "Author": "Man o 'tides", "ReviewID": "RKGR00LEP9N59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the Samsung Gravity T459 almost 3 years ago and it has served me well.Not glamorous by Iphone, Android, Blackberry standards but, then, I don't need nor do I have to pay for a bunch of expensive fees and uneeded bells and whistles associated with those phones.Starting with the design I like the grey/lime exterior.  It's a candy bar  with a convenient QWERTY slide out keyboard.  That was the feature that attracted me to this phone.  Prior to this Samsung I had a Motorola Razer flip phone which had its good points but was awkward as far as texting goes with my big hands.It was about then that I discovered that my grandkids will respond to my text messages faster than phone calls and voice mails.  So I wanted a phone with better texting features.  Once I got used to the keyboard i found texting was much easier on this Gravity.I can remember doing some research on the T 459 prior to purchase and remember how a CNet reviewer claimed the phone had poor audio quality.  I went ahead and bought a 2 year contract with T-Mobile which included the Gravity saying to myself no phone is perfect and waited for the heretofore described poor quality sound to show up.  It never did.  Maybe the CNet person got a bad phone or lived in a canyon or something anyway I always get clear , undistorted, reception.And rarely do I have a dropped call.Speaking of dropping..this phone has been dropped a few times and came up unphased.  It's pretty ruggedly  built  so seems able to take a lot of punishment.It has a very unimpressive 1.3 pixel camera which comes in handy occasionally.  If I take pictures I prefer my Canon powershot anyway.Has bluetooth, which I never use.So, you can see its kind of down and dirty meat and potatoes kinda phone that gets the job done.  All I care about is calling and receiving calls, voice mail, caller ID and not much more.I just went with T-Mobile's pay as you go plan.  Because the Gravity is a GSM unlocked phone I was able to keep  my phone number and original SIM card with  all my contacts and such and didn't have to purchase another phone.  Very cool.So..yeah...I have been well pleased with Samsung Gravity...it works.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "A PHONE THAT SERVES THE PURPOSE", "Author": "Benokafor", "ReviewID": "RIOYM47A8R6Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those looking for a phone that serves the purpose of talking and texting, this is the one.

My brother bought it for me, and it's great. Texting is easy, using the IM is easy, and the speaker quality is fine. It doesn't have a super-quality camera though...if there's not a lot of light, pics might come out dark.

But this \"New\" phone has the worst reception ever.  I can barely get a signal, Calls are dropped, always says \"searching\". When I have a bar and try to text , it won't go thru in many area's. I had my son stand next to me with his Samsung TM 506 phone and it has full reception, yet the T459 has none??  After researching the T459 phone, I found many other people had poor reception with it. Therefore it seems to be a problem with this model. Don't waste your money on this phone. I ended up returning this phone.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really durable phone!", "Author": "Bergen", "ReviewID": "R3ER0NUUO4TYYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is really good for people who don't treat their phones too well, i drop my phone all the time, mainly cause i like to play around with it in the air haha. The battery life for this phone is pretty good, i've had it about 2 years now and im on my second battery, the first died because of water, but this one is holding up pretty well, texting all day long the battery lasts, with a full charge it lasts only about a day and a half, but thats because i text all day long and i'm generally on it so there is a constant battery drain there. Overall i really like this phone because of its durability (getting a phone case is a really good idea too btw) and its overall easy access.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't get this phone if you're expecting picture messaging or IM capabilities.", "Author": "Margot", "ReviewID": "R3Q7MJRXLNUFJF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since this is an \"unlocked\" phone and you're not getting standard firmware, (\"Chatr\" firmware), don't expect to have the same functions or applications as the normal Samsung Gravity. Let me be clear, you CANNOT send picture messages and there is no way to use Instant Message services such as AIM, MSN, ICQ, or whatever with this phone.

I would get this phone as a spare or a second phone if you need one. It has a nice full slide out keyboard and very easy to navigate through. The color is pretty cool and not a plain solid color. The power on and power off are fairly quick!!

There was a specific feature I was looking for and that was an alert tone that will continually repeat the alert every minute for texts and voice mails.  That's important to me because I don't have to look at my phone all the time if I'm out of hearing range.  The keys on the phone for texting are much easier to press than my previous phone that costs over twice as  much from TMobile.  The keys are a bit rounded which makes pressing them easier.  Also this phone has to be manually locked by pressing the star button so if you don't want it locked it isn't automatic.  For me that was a plus.  This is an easy phone to use and text with, not for people who want all the features of an IPhone, but for someone that doesn't need the internet on their phone.  A great value!", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid", "Author": "pcyh", "ReviewID": "R2Q4EY5Y4ANUXO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Solid phone, for $59 which is what I bought it for @ Fry's.Not the lightest or sleekest or coolest phone, but it has some good basic functions.Sadly at Fry's the box only comes with the phone and the charger, and that's it. No USB cable, no warranty, no instruction manuals etc. But that's Fry's problem.Pros: easy to use, the slider keyboard that opens sideways, decent camera, mp3 usageCons: Slow startup time - 11 seconds almost - a bit heavy and not the most fashionable. Also the battery life is a little less than some other phones of its kind - about a little over a day and the battery is getting low.I'm not the fancy smart-phone type of person so this phone is quite alright for me. Bought it go to Europe with, it is a GSM quad-band phone. I may do another review when I get back from Europe and see if it still holds the 4 stars for me.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone.", "Author": "kb", "ReviewID": "RFXB7J0XPX7HT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed a phone for my nephew that wasn't a data plan, but had a keypad for texting.

The description says T456/T459.  I already owned a T459 Samsung Gravity that is a simple phone that does what I need it to do (until it was dropped in a puddle during a major rainstorm).  I am not concerned about internet connectivity, touch screen or apps.  The Gravity has a QWERTY keyboard that slides out that I use for texting.  It also has functionality compatability with T-Mobile that saves all phone numbers to T-Mobile Servers as a back-up.  What I received was a T456 Samsung Fido (appears to be for Rogers network in Canada).  It has the same QWERTY keyboard that slides out.  The shell is generally the same (exact same color scheme as my Gravity).  The phone is compatable with T-mobile, but I have had the most difficult time getting my old phone numbers across on my old SIM card.  Did not thik this would be an issue with the push/pull of the addressbook from T-mobile servers, however the T456 DOES NOT HAVE THIS FUNCTIONALITY.  If I had multilpe phone numbers on the Gravity for a contact, only the cellphone numbers made it to the T456, not land line/home or office.There are some other functionality differences in terms of how to get to a certain function, but otherwise similar to my Gravity.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "not happy with the phone", "Author": "Michael Depalma", "ReviewID": "R21D6S08QOI5JY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this phone about 3 weeks ago the phone was delievered late and i cant send picture messages the phone keeps shuting off when i go to use it....i also cant set any ringtones that i have on my memory card i am so unhappy with the phone :(.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "gt it", "Author": "xL0vexLess", "ReviewID": "R2J4G0WAYKBZ16", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "just got itnothing i don't like about it yetexcept i had to order a 2GB micro memory cardit messed up my 8gb and i had to reformat it", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "monstermom \"G.M.\"", "ReviewID": "R3UXL7H09OSX6A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has good features, but kept getting dropped calls.
