Very Impressed", "Author": "Sherlock", "ReviewID": "RK3H3RXL97MEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a replacement for my old blackberry.  I was very impressed with the motorola cliq! Motoblur is great software, it keeps you on top of the social world.  It syncs with your Facebook and other social networking accounts. It was very easy to import all my old contacts onto this phone. the Android market has a very large selection of apps, games, etc. to download from. One of the greatest features from this phone in my opinion is the 5mp camera! It takes really good quality pictures, and there is photo editing software that is already installed in the phone that can add effects and bring out the best in your pictures! for being a smartphone, i was very impressed with the phones battery life. this phone is perfect for those who are trying to transition into touch screen devices. It is touch screen but the slide out keyboard is a very nice addition to those that have a hard time typing on a flat screen.  I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone interested!", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "do not buy", "Author": "yep", "ReviewID": "R2TXETVKU2CXXL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this phone i bought it about a year ago from tmobile and was supposed to be my \"upgrade\" from my old motorola razor. I've had this phone for a long time it really only worked well for the first few months, and i was trying to be really careful with it because it was a new phone i think to this day i've dropped this phone 5 times (not bad falls either) and it does not work properly, the screen turns off if you light tap it or if the if you try to use the keyboard, the keyboard at this point does not function correctly, the screen doesn't turn on half the time when you type on the screen some keys don't work, and yes i've tried to get it changed but when i got it through the company they told us that we couldn't get insurance on this phone. Honestly if this can help anyone to just not buy this phone then I'm happy.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1MP5MCDGYRYLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone 2 weeks ago and so far I am lovong it.

My last phone was a Blackberry Curve.  Overall the Cliq is a solid phone from a hardware perspective, although the left-handed pointer is rather odd given the majority of the population is right handed.  Unless you are ambidextrous or left handed, the pointer will be unusable.From the software perspective, the Android operating system is horrible and barely usable.  While it is cool to surf the Internet because of the larger screen, the phone is barely usable as a phone.  On incoming calls, pushing the big green \"answer\" button typically does nothing.  Most of the time my incoming calls end up in voicemail while I repeated push, tap, hit, or beat on the answer button to no avail.  Then I have to call the person who called me, which increases my minute usage.  Android also has an odd habit of pocket dialing people in my contacts list, particularly those on speed dial, even while the screen is locked, further increasing my minute usage and resulting in odd call backs from friends and business associates.The Android marketplace is as well designed as Blackberry's which means it stinks.  Applications are not properly tested or vetted (like Apple does for the iPhone) so there is a huge quantity of junk and non-working applications many of which crash the phone.  Some applications, particularly Twidroid, seem to updated daily causing constant downloading and reinstallation over and over again.If I had to do it over again, I would have upgraded to a newer Blackberry.  If Apple would sell the iPhone for providers other than AT&T;, which has the worst coverage in the Phoenix metro area, I would look at an iPhone.  If you have an iPod Touch as I do, the primitive touch screen interface of Android takes a lot of getting used to.Battery life is horrible!  Plan on buying and keeping 1 or 2 spare charged batteries because the Cliq turns into a brick around late morning unless its continuously charged.  And don't think plugging this puppy into a USB port or the wall for a quick 20-minute refresh will do anything.  Plan on 6 hours to recharge.  You will have to charge nightly and several times during the day.  In comparison, my Blackberry only needed to be charged every 4 days with the same amount of usage.Google should stick to search engines and browsers because they don't know the first thing about making a usable phone operating system.  I can't wait until T-Mobile will allow me to upgrade again and I chuck this beast in the trash can!", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
