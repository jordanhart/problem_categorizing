Will update later after it's been used in Italy as unlocked. All menus are easy to navigate just like any other Android. Important applications are compatible. This phone was reviewed in many other listings. The difference between S6102 and S6102b is RAM. This one has 800MB and the S6102 only 180Mb, which makes all the difference in the apps you can install. I have been using it without a SIM over WIFI for now and added a 2GB card for photos and some music. Camera is ok for quick snapshots (3Mpixels). Menus scroll fast and browser is not too laggy..", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Marlin Guedez Gimenez", "ReviewID": "R3O6VC8R6U2CXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like very much the cell phone, it is economic and easy to use, and it is light and beautiful", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Price is Okay but it only have 162 MB available.

The initial memory storage capacity of this phone is only 162MB. Therefore, in order to take your first picture or be able to add contacts to you address book YOU NEED TO HAVE A SIM CARD MEMORY INSTALLED. I will update my review after I have purchased and used the phone.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0088IOX0E"}}
