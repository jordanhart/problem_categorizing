{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HTC One X+ Unlocked (best I ever had)", "Author": "Carlos M \"Carlos M\"", "ReviewID": "R1MK4Q38YP1GR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tryed several brands from iPhone, Sony Experia, LG, Samsung (GS3) and HTC.This One X+ to update an HTC Desire HD. Previous to receive the One X+, I tried the Samsung GS3, which is an awesome mobile phone, but the user interface seems cheap against the sense interface in HTC phones. The only feature I would miss from the GS3 is the predicted text, quite honestly prediction text on the Samsung is amazing and I would say this is the only feature I think it beats the HTC, but if you buy or already have Swift key from the Android store you won't miss anything.I have two cell phone numbers with two different cell companies, because of work needs. On my other hand I have a One X. The sense interface from HTC is the best user friendly interface I have tried. No lag, awesome graphics, you can shoot real nice pictures, I love the keyboard and the best feature is the way you look for telephone numbers and names. Battery last longer than previous HTCs, I would say 1.7 times longer than the One X or Desire HD, at least 2.5 times longer than the GS3 and the iPhone.The One X+, has a clear full color HD screen great to surf the web for a while, watch videos or to play games like in a portable console (look for EA Dead Space, awesome graphics). The only think that you'll find out here is since games are high resources consumers phone's processor will make your phone feel the heat near the camera. So far these kinds of applications are the only ones making the processor heat up like that. I have made a couple of calls for nearly 60 minutes without having a heat up issue.I have seen some issues reported on the internet regarding this model. This phone come from the UK and has been unlocked to use with any carrier. I haven't had any issues regarding the no sim message. I can imagine that this could be due to some carriers OS distribution, it had happened to me with the One X that came from Vodafone Germany, unlocked also. I was experiencing some issues until the OS was updated by Vodafone.Audio quality seems great to me. I usually play non compressed music on other devices. I have Sony's Music Unlimited service which has a very nice quality audio files and you can play off line also. I have synch my phone with my car by Bluetooth to play music and answer phone calls. The car has factory built in Bluetooth to do both things, and I can tell you that music sounds better than a CD: Answering the phone from the car has a very good listening quality and I haven't had any complaints from the other side.I simply love this phone.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than the One?", "Author": "reviewer2 \"reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "RM3Y8EJ57FXU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, now that that's out of the way, it probably isn't better than the One, but why did it take the HTC One to make people realize HTC makes great phones? I broke a 64gb Ipod, and for about the same price, I got a phone (and all those capabilities) AND a 64 gb mp3 player with better battery life.But that's beside the point there are a few things that are very important:1) DesignGreat feel, in many ways I find the thin poly carbonate of the One X+ better than the iphone 5. It's got a grippy feel that is nice while still feeling solid. It's also very thin. The photos kind of make it looks like the sides bow upward, and curve, but I'd say it feels/looks very flat and smooth. I like the \"infinity display\" as well as the fact that the 3 touch sensitive buttons at the bottom don't take up the display and extend the whole way to the base. I hate on the One (and a LOT of other phones) that those buttons and other parts take up so much room at the bottom, decreasing screen maximization.2) PerformanceYeah, it's a tegra 3. So what? This is the same processor that put the nexus 7 on the map for being comparable to the ipad in performance for 1/2 the price (I know I keep relating to apple products, but let's be honest that unfortunately that is the yardstick that everything else is measured by, if only for it's ubiquity). With Jelly bean and a snappy processor and even sense 4, this thing is crazy smooth. Theoretically this phone is also supposed to get the Sense 5 update, which I assume will only make it better.3) BatteryI was concerned about this going in. 2100 Mah is not anything crazy. I honestly believe that this will be the big emphasis on the next generation of phones. We've got performance down that unless you're playing the most DEMANDING games (get a console/pc!) you're phone is way more than adequate. Battery life/storage/screen real estate will be the next battles. BUT, for now? This thing works GREAT. So, why in the world would you turn power saver off? It manages what you do and don't let through as far as in the hibernate/rest mode. Xperia Z just introduced this technology this year, and HTC has had it for a while. In any case, in real world, just like the speed/performance, this thing works very well. I don't have to worry much about charging at all.4) Looks/miscellaneousI know it's superficial, and you can say I'm scraping for another point, but when they came out with the black iphone 5, everyone called it like the B-2 bomber of cell phones. Those are gizmodo's exact words. How could this description not also apply to the X+? This is a thin, matte, beautiful phone, that includes a 4.7 inch screen (for those of you that still defend iphone 5's screen size or even 4s, get outta here! Is it even debatable that 3.5 inches is too small for a great smartphone these days?). Sense 4 does a pretty good job being close (ish) to stock android. Even if it's not perfect, sense 4 has some great widgets. I'd say like APW pro +. I really do think they're very nice.5) Anticipating complaintsI know this may have come off somewhat biased. I know the phone has it's weaknesses (sealed battery and capped storage for 2). As far as the sealed battery goes, I got mine used and it's still going strong. Replacing an HTC battery is still cheaper than an Iphone (though admittedly possibly not as easy). As far as the storage? I get 59 usable gb, which I think is VERY efficient. I was surprised to have so much space. I am a huge fan of locally stored music/videos and consider myself a data hog. The only thing I can say to this is really look at how much you have stored on that 64 gb SD card + 16 stock gb on the SIII. My guess is you'd get by with this storage and be better off with a better screen, nicer feel, and more premium skin for the OS.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Form Factor, Underwhelming Android Experience", "Author": "Ashyford", "ReviewID": "RO6OUE212RRI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used a Palm Treo, a two Blackberries, and two Samsung Android smart phones before trying the HTC One X+. The form factor was great. Super slim, super light, solid and durable. I could not be happier. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy HTC's implementation of Android. I found rooting the device way more complicated than rooting a Samsung device. Finally, the nail in the coffin, I found the sound volume to be too low when I tried to go on a run.  I could not hear the music.  Whether or not the \"Beats by Dre\" software was turned on or off, I could not hear the music. Weeks before, I was jogging with my Samsung Skyrocket to the same tracks and could definitely hear the music and no one else. I returned it for an S4 and feel much better about the switch.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stellar Android phone", "Author": "D. Hollenback", "ReviewID": "REND9PWDM32W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm admittedly a gadget geek and cell phones in particular 'flip my switch'. I've have a countless number of phones over the years (buying/selling on Craigslist etc.) and always strive to get the best available. This phone is that. I came from a Galaxy S2 Skyrocket that I had rooted and was running Android 4.2.2 but wanted something a bit more stable. This phone is that. The One X+ is arguably one of the finest constructed phones on the market except for perhaps the upcoming HTC One. I've used and compared this phone against the Nexus 4, Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2. Of those the Note 2 is probably the best but just too big for me to be lugging around, loved the screen though.The One X+ however excels in so many areas that for me it is the best 'all around' phone. It has gobs of storage (64GB) is thin & light, a fantastic screen and great sound quality. No need for a case on this one also as the unibody design is solid, grippy and apparently you can pound nails with the Gorilla Glass 2 screen and not damage the phone. Nice to be able to have a phone that I can throw in my pocket 'naked' and not have to worry about it.The latest firmware update from AT&T; last week addressed a bunch of issues and now wifi & bluetooth work without a hitch and the battery lasts alllll day. Knowing that HTC has already committed to bring Android 4.2.2 and Sense 5 with Blinkfeed to this phone in June/July eases my obsolescence fears a bit.If you are interested in this phone be sure to go to an AT&T; store to try one out. The feel of it in your hand is unlike any other.Highly recommended. Oh, I bought it on Amazon from the seller Mobile Image and they were great.

Lives up to HTC's tagline- \"Quietly brilliant\".", "Author": "Krishna Satheeshkumar", "ReviewID": "R3S9L28PSVBL5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was quite skeptical of smartphones because all my friends had them and they would always end up complaining about how there isn't enough free space on their devices or that the charge constantly runs out. I felt that I was better off with my normal phone, without any apps and games (my friends and I are quite compulsive gamers, hence the massive load on their devices).But when my old phone died, I thought I might as well get a functional smartphone. The HTC One X+ immediately caught my eye. I've read many previous iPhone users' reviews on this device and they all almost conclusively say that this phone is as good as, if not better than, the iPhones. So I went ahead and purchased it.It's been only two days, but I've already had my mind blown away. I know that it's too soon to say anything, but I can definitely say that the pros significantly outweigh the cons of this device. Firstly, I'll just get the cons out of the way. The phone heats up. I played FIFA 14 for Andriod on it for almost 1.5 hours straight and it did heat up noticeably. But in the defence of the phone, it is a VERY processor heavy game. The temperature began reducing just moments after I closed the game though.Now for the pros. It is an amazingly powerful phone. I've used a brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Samsung Galaxy S2, Samsung Galaxy S3, Google Nexus 4 and quite a few other smart phones (my friends') and I can easily say that none of them have been as fast and powerful in their processing capabilities as the HTC One X+. It takes a little getting used to, but the entire system setup is extremely ergonomic and user-friendly. The graphics are really nice and sharp. The HTC Sense 4.5 software is great. I've heard that some people downloaded the Swype software from the Android Play Store, but I don't understand why. The HTC Sense Input Keyboard is amazing. I loved it. Getting the phone to register on my Windows 7 laptop was a bit tricky, but when I downloaded the HTC Sync Manager, it automatically began to register on my laptop. It may have just been the umpteen tries I put into getting it to register, but either way in a matter of fifteen minutes, I had managed to get my phone connected to my laptop.So, in conclusion, I can say that I have thoroughly enjoyed my first smartphone for the first two days and I hope to do so for as long as possible. I strongly recommend the HTC One X+ to anyone who wants a good, reliable and heavy-duty smartphone with none of the frills of an iPhone or a Samsung phone. It truly is \"quietly brilliant\".", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good phone", "Author": "Richard W.

I needed an unlocked phone that I could bring with me when I travel to Europe for a few months next year. The phone itself is great - chic, good sound, easy touchscreen, etc. I don't find using the Android system on the phone all that intuitively easy - I'm still figuring out a lot of the settings etc. And because I don't have a regular contract with a service provider (using T-Mobiles pay as you go plan), I'm on my own to figure out how things work. So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as someone's first phone - I'm sure techies love it though. I was wary of Apple for a few reasons, but mainly because I couldn't bring an iPhone to Europe. So even though Apple would have much better customer support and help figure out things, I went with the Google phone. But I'm pleased with this purchase and it's a great phone with terrific features.

Since, the specs and the looks seemed good enough, i thought i'd just buy it to check it out. I i've got to tell you this phone is amazing. Android 4.1 really shines on Tegra 3. I really like the red high lights in the capacitive buttons, the beats logo and the red highlights on the camera lens as well. Gives the phone an overall sleek stylish look. The performance on this version of the one X is greatly enhanced probably due to reduced bloatware and improvements in HTC sense. Still, there is a minor lag while browsing and pinching. Otherwise, HTC really rocked on this one. i would certainly recommend this to anyone who is willing to sacrifice the availability of a MicroSD slot for a whopping 64gigabytes of NAND storage. The camera is just pure stunning, images looks crisp and with natural colours. The SuperLCD2 720p screen just knocks the viewing experience off the charts. I would bet that the screen on the X+ is a lot more better than the AMOLED ones on the Galaxy S3 and the note 2. The extreme viewing angles also just adds to the list of accomplishments made by this phone. One thing i noticed about this phone, the rubber matte finish feels really, really good in the hands and the oleophobic coated screen looks sexy given the side curves and unibody design. Aside from all that, i really wish the phone speaker was tad bit louder, it sounds very clear and very nice. But, still would it hurt HTC to provide a louder speaker.

It's beautiful, it looks great, has fantastic speakers and two great cameras. You can't add storage space to it, which is a negative piece, but that's okay considering it has 64GB of space. The only thing is- the HTC One is better than the HTC One X+. That doesn't make sense to me, considering the names, but the HTC one has better cameras, newer software, and better speakers. Apparently the One X+ is at its \"end of life\" which means it's pretty much outdated. So soon.

Known bugs, poor customer service.", "Author": "TJ \"koldfuzun\"", "ReviewID": "R29KF43W69940A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone about 6 months ago, through AT&T.; I read some great reviews on the phone, and the technical specs were pretty impressive.Pros: -Powerful: A  quad core CPU allows this phone to operate at blazingly fast speeds. Android 4.1 really shines with quad core, and with these specs, the phone is as functional and beautiful as the iPhone 5, if not more so. Video and games are no issue.-Beautiful and large screen: The screen is really impressive, and huge! I actually do tend to watch videos from the phone, which I never really did with previous devices. I'd put this on par with the iPhone Retina displays.- Powersave mode: This is a great feature! All phones should have this. The phone actually has a 5th CPU core, which allows the phone to use this low-power core when power-save mode is on and the display is turned off. Essentially, the phone will turn off all push data, and any unneeded services are not used. In this mode, my battery can last 2-3 days, depending on how much I use it. This is great for someone like me who spends the majority of their day in front of a PC anyway. You will still receive calls and texts, but you will not receive any notifications for things like Facebook messages, Twitter, etc.Most of the other improvements for me really have to do with the Android 4.1 OS. It's such an improvement over pre-4 versions that it's really a whole new OS in my opinion.Cons:-Buggy: I have two issues with this phone and both seem to be known issues. First, the phone will display a \"No SIM card\" message fairly frequently. I will have to reboot to get it working again. Sometimes this will happen 4-5 times in a day, causing me to miss calls and texts. This seems to be a well know issue, as I found a number of references to it by Googling. I contacted HTC and received a number of canned responses and was essentially told I'd need to RMA my device.-Poor Bluetooth audio quality: Using a Bluetooth headset, calls are very poor quality. In some cases, I have a hard time hearing people at all. Music quality over Bluetooth speakers is also terrible. I'm not sure how this device even passed HTC quality assurance with this issue, but it is unacceptable. Again, HTC claims they have no knowledge of this issue and that I need to RMA it, even though there are numerous references to this issue online.-Battery life: Simple put, it's terrible if you're not using Powersave mode. Especially if you turn on WiFi. With WiFi on and BLuetooh enabled, my battery last less than a day if I do not have Powersave enabled.- Size: It's a fairly big phone. Yes, it's super thin, but the width and height are larger than usual. People comment on how big my phone is. I actually don't mind it most of the time, because the size is due to the screen size.SummaryDue to the bugs, I'd recommend looking at another phone. Myself, I have to buy another phone and try to sell this one. The bugs are just unacceptable for me. And HTC's customer service is terrible. It's not likely I'll ever buy another HTC device again. Phone manufacturers should realize that it's difficult for most of us to RMA a phone. Just get it right the first time and we won't have to.
