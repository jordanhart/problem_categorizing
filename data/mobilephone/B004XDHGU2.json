{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone but crippled in functions", "Author": "Sidney R. Dobson", "ReviewID": "R14USEYJE7DB2Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I haven't had it long so I cannot report on the reliability of this phone but I have attempted to run through every function. It's about average for learning how to use the functions. I was very disappointed when I tried the Bluetooth. I can get it to pair and connect to my computer, other phone and Bluetooth headset. The only function that straight talk allows once connected is the headset functions and transfer of contacts information. This means no free ringtones from your computer and no picture downloads from the phone to computer. Straight talk will sell you ringtones or background pics for $1.99 each from their website. That's good for business. Also the only way I can manage to get pictures off the phone is to email them. This cost time and data count. Again that's good for business. I don't really see how they get away with advertising it has Bluetooth when they won't let you use it. Maybe I'm not doing it right so if anyone knows how please share. Can't get the word Home off the screen either. The browser does the bare minimum. That's all I have to say bad about this phone. It works great in all other respects. Sound is good, pictures are good for a phone and it works almost everywhere. I'll keep mine as long as it lasts.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone.", "Author": "Robert M.

Graphics are awesome, internet is speedy, and excellent, it even supports MP3's sent in messages! signal strength has NEVER been an issue where ever I go. I was out in the middle of the Nevada dessert; and had all 6 bars, while browsing the internet! (beat that Cricket!) This phone is well worth the price, and an excellent deal for a pre-paid plan! (DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED THOUGH!)", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Stepehen Vasko", "ReviewID": "RPTLASBPYZC5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "vary easy to use I sent back my smart  phone to go back to the LG 290c this phone is so easy to use and every thing that I need", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "Riohnna", "ReviewID": "R33PKRBL43W4Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great phone!

It has been working well for voice calls and text messaging. This weekend we were caught in an emergency situation and neededto take some really important photos. This was the only phone or camera that we had with us .. so I use it to take many pictures. I planned to mail them to my other phone (that had a direct connect to my computer) or email them to my computer. This was the first time we ever used this phone for sending pictures. Long-short it failed. \"Invalid Destination Number\" no matter how I sent it or to what number it deducted the minute charges but would not send .. same error message every time. Could not even send an email from it. Spent over an hour on the landline today with Tracfone customer service and after many attempts to install lengthy number codes and even online downloads to reprogram the SIM card it still failed. Finally the tech person gave up and told me \"this phone won't sednd picture messages\" (I have that in an email too. Now I have a phone full of terribly important photos that I can't get out of the phone! Why have a camera and a picture messaging system in a phone that won't do that? They told me I might be able to get them with a bluetooth hookup with another phone. Tried it and the phones pair OK but the LG 290C only allows for transfer of contact information and calendars. No mention of images. FAIL!!!!", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Loved It", "Author": "annacat", "ReviewID": "R1FTUV7OM0HDPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My service was with TracFone. I LOVED this phone but I ran out of minutes too fast. (I have AT&T; Go Phone now with unlimited texting which is much better for me) The camera was great, the sound was great, and everything else was great! If you are thinking about this phone I would definitely recommend this. :) Love this phone and I still have it to look through some old photos from last summer <3", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Bluetooth\u00ae Wireless Technology, 1.3 Megapixel VGA Camera, Stylish Slider Phone Design, Vivid Color Display\nVoicemail, Call Waiting, Caller ID, Text Messaging, MMS Picture Messaging, Handsfree Speaker, Vibration Alert, Auto Redial, Voice Dialing, Voice Commands, Voice Recorder, Key Pad Lock\nHearing Aid Compatible (M3 Rating), Alarm Clock\n33 Polyphonic Ringtones and Phonebook with up to 1000 entries\nBuy Downloadable Ringtones and Graphics using airtime minutes", "Name": "LG LG290C SLIDER (NET10) Phone.", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NM505c60L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004XDHGU2"}}
