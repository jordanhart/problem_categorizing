I've seen some bad reviews for it, but it's mostly from people who expected performance and versatility of a Blackberry. It's a good basic phone, with a few less features than other phones. If you're looking for a practical phone, this is a good choice IF:1. You can live without a camera on your phone (like <1 megapixel camera does anyone any good)2. You can live without speakerphone (I don't know anyone who utilizes that feature when thet have it anyways)3. You don't have to have the flashiest, fanciest, most cutting edge phone on the market.I wouldn't sign a contract to get this phone, I'd get one off the major auction website (begins with an \"e\", ends with a \"bay\"), where you can get it for about $30.", "Date": "January 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone for all its features and price!", "Author": "dstubsten \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R3SA1BGD68JG7J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My LG c1300 is a really small, clamshell phone with a part that looks like a mirror on top. It includes most basic features including text messaging, multimedia messaging, media mall, and everything you need to download wallpaper, games, ringtones, and applications straight from cingular. It has an awesome battery life, but you can't always trust the battery monitor...sometimes it will display one bar left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call quality has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have bad reception...but that is the network, not the phone. Overall, I love my LG c1300 although now I wish I might have had a cameraphone, but this phone is awesome for all the features and the minimal price involved.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "perfect for what i needed", "Author": "Scarlett", "ReviewID": "R3GZNSRQGLPJFL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i needed a simple phone for my tech-challenged husband to use. this looks to be just right although i haven't had time or money to gewt the service set up yet.received in great condition and in a very timely manner", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's Durable", "Author": "J.

I dropped it in a glass full of water, and then a few months later took it swimming in the ocean with me, and it was fine after a few days. I doped it on a weekly basis and aside from a few scratches a dings it never seemed effected. The reception was okay, and as for the lack of camera and speaker, who needs those things anyway. I liked it and my experience with LG phones in general has been great, they're built to last.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "not a bad phone", "Author": "Karl K. Zahler", "ReviewID": "R2N1QL6303LOKZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first cell phone in a few years, my first was the bulky bag phones. I now own a sony ericsson z500a and have had good luck so far despite the horrible reviews. As for this phone, I liked the design and ease of use much better than my new one. I even dropped it in the toilet and after a week of dry out worked fine. The only thing I realize now is that the signal strenght wasn't that great. My wife and I both had these phones and now she has a nokia 6010 and both of our new phones have better signal strength and clearer call reception than the lg did. But I absolutely loved how the lg 1300 phone was set up more than either of our new ones", "Date": "January 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Real Piece of...Junk", "Author": "Jay South", "ReviewID": "R68W9GKKW7ZCZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will have to disagree with the positive reviews on this phone -- mine is a real piece of crap! The phone, although the battery lasts for several days, has terrible reception, terrible menus (it will always go to the online shopping option first), the screen cuts out, the hinge mechanism is loose, the call volume fluctuates, and God forbid you sign a 2-year service plan like I did. There's a little mirror on it, but for what? It has a status light, but does nothing useful -- no clock, no caller ID, and as a mirror, it reflects an area about the same size as your eye, if you hold it out at arm's length. Stay away from this phone at all costs. Get a Nokia, Motorola, Sony, ANYTHIN but this LG. LG may make refridgerators, washers, dryers, and other household appliances, but they certianly can't make a phone.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000CQETT0"}}
