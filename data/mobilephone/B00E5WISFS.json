The money you save is not saved at all if you need to repair the product or buy another one.", "Author": "Roque Javier Albuja Ponce", "ReviewID": "R1ASSQ9YT975O7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I bought this product I was really happy because I had a cell phone that worked really good, complied with all my requirements and let me use two SIM cards! I bought this product on December 2013 and used it to all it's potential untill february 16 2014. During the time the product worked it sometimes got hot, but nothing that had not happened with any other phone I've had in the past. But on december 14, the battery suddenly uncharged and the product was very hot. When I tried to charge it once again it didn't charge. When reviewing the problem on the internet, it is common that some Samsung cellphones come with a problem in the card that causes that the cell phone gets really hot and the battery uncharges really fast. On the product I bought the problem is even worst because it doesn't charge anymore.  In  consequence, the problem in the card impedes that I use it anymore.For this reason, I contacted the seller and they've let me know that they are very sorry to listen this, but nothing can be done because the product has no guarantee. This is something important for you to take into account before you buy this product. There is a possibility that your phone suffers the same problem as mine and having a guarantee at least for the first year is necessary.In my case they've suggested me to repair the dammage, but repairing it has a similar cost to buying a new one, and there is no guarantee that it will work.Take care that you buy an unlocked version and not an international version.Another negative point of the product is the charger it comes with. International version comes with an adapter for US plug, which makes the plug huge!My suggestion is that if you want to buy this cell phone, you contact another seller. The product is great, but needs a guarantee!", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very reliable cell phone", "Author": "Vladimir", "ReviewID": "RW156FZ1E9QTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item received exactly as described and in a timelty manner!!!

Also from european phones I'm used to have stickers on the outside of the package which tell the IMEI of the phone, that's not available here either.Thanks to Surgetelecom the package was shipped with Fedex for free, so delivery was very fast! Highly recommend that shop!Then the problem if the phone is locked or what ever:I unpacked it and found a note in the package that told that it was the US-version of the phone and worked only with american carriers (north and south america). If you wanted to use it with some other SIM-Card, it told you would have to use an american card to make a call of at least 5 minutes in order to unlock the phone.Despite that note I directly put my german SIM-Card in it to give it a try. And it worked just like that!!! So even if the manual tells something different, my phone purchased from Surgetelecom end of April 2014 was fully unlocked!At the moment I am using a StraightTalk and a GERMAN T-MOBILE card in it and both work just as they should.All the technical stuff can be read out there online or in other reviews, in a nutshell, I have never seen a dual-sim phone that worked so smoothly!!!Rooting was very easy, kernel supports a lot of root apps (droidwall, cisco AnyConnect, FolderMount to better integrate the external SD-Card)Of course the problem with the external SD-Card is always present on a Samsung phone, but with the help of FolderMount you can easily gain more space for apps and their data.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Working well and it is used now by my husband in Cote d'Ivoire", "Author": "Djeneba Coulibaly-Traore", "ReviewID": "R1M32WL1TNL7A0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good product hope it will work well for a long time.It is also taking great pictures and movies.
