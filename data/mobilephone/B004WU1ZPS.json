{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "G.J. Thomas", "ReviewID": "R37KKJPK9IIT5Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "These are complete garbage. These come from a low end distributor in China. Most come from Chinavasion who then supplies resellers. A common complaint is the microphone is so quiet that the person that you call can't hear you. The manufacturer (and most resellers) even promise a warranty and tech support, but when you need it, they never help and frequently require you to ship the product overseas to China (very expensive shipping), and once hey get it they claim no responsibility and keep the product unless you send them more money!I stopped carrying any product that is featured on Chinavasion because of the constant complaints that I receive about them.Chinavasion even fakes reviews on their website (and does not allow anyone to post negative reviews).  Google it. The main manufacturer (Chinavasion) is a fraudulent company. ANY product on chinavasions website is highly suspicious.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New Android 2.2 operating system\nBright and colorful 3.2 inch touch screen\nFirst dual SIM Android 2.2 phone on the market\nTV antenna for receiving free over the air analog TV\nFully Unlocked: Can use with any GSM service provider around the world", "Name": "Eclipse - Dual SIM Android 2.2 Smartphone (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dfQykI6lL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004WU1ZPS"}}
