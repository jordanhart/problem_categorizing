Most ppl switching to net10 are switching to get out of high monthly fees from contract carriers - so i say don't port the number unless you want to continue paying for 2 phones. Porting might work best if you are porting a number from another pre-paid phone (i.e. Net10, Tracfone, etc).- Customer service: Online tech support is a joke (both on net10's site and facebook net10). Don't waste your time, just call them instead. Online tech's take days, weeks, to months to answer your problem(s). Net10 Tech's thru the phone take anywhere from 20 mins to maybe a couple hours depending on your issue. You will enter alot of codes in the phone in order to t-shoot your issue.- don't expect the phone to work right off the bat when you purchase it, it probaly won't. you have to go online and enter the serial #, or sim card number, and sometimes the phone # (even though you don't have one yet) in order to activate. if you have to call cust. serv., do it from a land line/home phone or business phone and expect to be on the phone for at least 20min to a couple hours entering lots of numeric codes into the phone in order to get it to work. last problem i had took us 2 diff techs and nearly 3 hours on the phone to t-shoot. (no lie). Don't call from a cell phone, your battery will either die or be close to going dead after you finish w/ net10 cust. service.-pic messaging/retrieving - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - i get repeat charges of 1.00 for retrieving a photo, and sometimes it never comes. if i see it is taking a long time and repeat charging me, i just delete it. not worth the use of my min being taken away.texting: you get charged to send/receive- deleting text msg's - You'll be charged .30 to delete the msg.-voicemail - you get charged to listen to your voicemail.-airtime cards: probaly best to go w/ Pay As You Go cards - these are the ones that cost as low as $15 up to $100 and give you more service days then talk time. ex: 90 days ( i think it is) for 300 min. If you buy the pay as you go cards, you can rollover your min and service time.However, if you go buy the monthly cards - 750 min for $25, or unlimited for $50 - you only get 30 days of service, and every month you have to re-buy another card. If you reload w/ a Pay As You Go card while you currently have the monthly card, NONE of your unused min/service days will roll over. Monthly cards do not rollover. Pay As You Go Cards only rollover unused min and extend service days.Web Browser: EXTREMELY SLOW!

I do not like that the soft button for the browser is right up front and so easy to accidentally click on that it becomes an annoyance.If you want a browser and email phone, then this is probably not the phone for you.If you want cheap minutes and texting, then this is the way to go.Other phones from Net10 charge you .5 cents per text, but this phone only uses .3 cents per text.I'm very pleased with the phone and the service so far.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Phone!", "Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "R2RUPCFCBUIKDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for over six months now, and I love it. This phone has an incredible battery life. I am a moderate phone user, and oftentimes I can go a whole week before having to charge my phone. There are so many great features, as well. The MP3 player works great and the sound quality is alright. Also the calendar is great. When you add an \"Anniversary\" the phone will count down the days until that date. It's just a fun little feature to have. :) Texting is easy with the slide-out Querty keyboard. My only complaint about that is that the Alt key doesn't automatically turn off so I sometimes find myself typing a whole sentence in symbols instead of letters. The internet speed is relatively slow, but I don't use it that often so it doesn't bother me. There is also a MicroSD Card slot. I discovered that if you create your own ringtones and transfer them to your phone with the SD Card the phone will let you use your own songs as ringtones. This has saved me some money because if I could not do this I would have bought Net10's ringtones. I love the vibrate setting, as well. When receiving a text on vibrate the phone has this unique vibrating pattern, so when in a room of people, you will know when it's your phone that's vibrating.This phone is also incredibly durable. I have dropped it countless times - even on concrete a few times - and there are only a few scratches. It still works great! There are now cases available for the Samsung T401G, so it can be even more protected.The primary reason I bought this phone is because each text is only 3 cents a minute. In six months, the money I have saved on texting has caused this phone to literally pay for itself. I would definately reccommend it to anyone. Net10 is a great money-saving option for this college student!", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone Bad Keyboard", "Author": "Cody C. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R1Z9XL9NVOCEMS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this a few years back when it first came out. my wife bought one very soon after. We wanted a keyboard texting phone but after some use (couple of weeks) the keyboard doesn't work right both of our phones either give you more letters then you pushed or doesn't give you the letter at all when you type. I just gave up and used T9 she still uses it but the problems persist. other than that the phone is good coverage around my area is great sound is great the ring and vibrate are not the strongest I often miss calls in my pocket when it is on. It can use a micro sd card and you can use it as an mp3 but you will need an extra cable for headphones. the mp3 player lets you only make 10 playlists at only 50 songs each so you really can only have 500 songs in it or you have to rotate the playlists by deleting one if your lists are full. the sd card can be used to transfer photos taken from the camera or transfer ringtones or wall papers to it which is nice. can go in mobile web but even in big cities its SLOW and at 10 cents a minute its not worth it. lots of accessories on amazon such as chargers covers and holders so that's nice. honestly its not worth the $70 I paid for it I'd say its worth around $20 new. My friend has a T404g and it has a headphone jack and the keyboard still works and she has had it for about a year. overall I like the phone for what it does and for what doesn't work I just tolerate it. I want to upgrade to another phone but just not in the budget right now. if you can pick it up cheap and you don't need a complicated phone this is a nice one. My biggest gripe is that keyboard just doesn't work right never has and since both of ours did it I believe its a manufacturers defect. overall I would give this phone a 6/10Cody", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Buy Now..29.99. Killer Deal", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "R2IEIYC18K7Q9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone originally in 2009, loved the drop down keyboard, the ease of use and basically all the features are just awesome. I had dropped the phone probably about 30 times in the time i owned the first one, this thing is an absolute indestructible beast. But eventually after all the wear and tear i decided to splurge for something new. Big mistake. Tried an LG (blackberry imitation), nice features, but the locking and unlocking was annoying, net didn't work very well, and it was huge, much larger than this one. Then i made another mistake of buying the LG Touchscreen for 49.99. For what it was it was (OK) for a touchscreen, what do you expect for 50 bucks. But texting as with most touchscreens is very inaccurate and nearly impossible to do quickly. So i finally said enough and was going to look for something else, walmart had nothing, and raised the price on one i wanted. They use to have (do on the site) this phone in store for 59.99. So i decided to see what best buy had, being that a lot of times their prices are actually cheaper. Well i was pleasantly surprised to see my old friend, along with a free blue tooth head set(which works great) an extra 40 dollar value.So all in all this is definitely the best phone i've ever owned, sound is good, not overbearingly loud. Features are good, although the screen is small. Has the drop down from behind keyboard, which is the best in it's class, much better than LG. Typing is great, and very responsive, and the best part of the phone, if your a big texter. The bluetooth is great as i said, it's a little odd to get it to sync up at first, but eventually it will find it. Basically just hit the button at the exact same time on the phone, as you do when you hold the headset and hear the beep, it will turn red. A little tedious, but when you get it working it works like a charm. So my advice, get this phone if you like texting, or talking of course, and just want an all around VERY DURABLE phone, with no freezes or hiccups. Also if your prone to getting out of the car and it falling on the cement (like myself) don't worry, it won't even scratch the screen.:D So go to best buy and get one for 30 bucks like i said, this is way better than the new LG phones, with the same features for around 99$ or so. And touch screens are very overrated and frustrating, unless your an expert. Samsung is the best, i'll vouch for that for sure.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "net10 $30/month unlimited available and comments on Samsung 401G", "Author": "D. V. Gelder \"Connective Touch\"", "ReviewID": "RCG7W9QSCY2YD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First: an almost hidden fact. You can get UNlimited talk/text/web from Net10 for $30 a month if you agree to have it automatically deducted monthly from your account. You have to ask for it. It is only implied on the web. I found it when I was looking at the phone offers from a California zip code. When you look in a zip code area you get offers you dont see on the main page, mainly free time cards with the phones.  Since the operators are mostly from far-away-place you might need to state your choice again and again. It might feel like insisting but you helping them to understand. I had to call back to get someone better. I suggest daytime weekdays is more likely to get you a Western Hemisphere agent.tl;dr; $30 per month gives you unlimited everything at 3g or as good as your phone can do.Second: I've just gotten the phone and not set it up. My reading so far tells me it cannot do java apps, ie it cant do google maps.  Maybe not opera some say. But this page offers opera:[...]--- If I find out more and I can edit this review I will add things.+ There is a better manual online. It *can* take larger SD cards (SDHC?). It came out in December 2009, 2 years ago.+ This page has a lot of links and also mentions Opera,[...]+ This page lists some specs, [...]  It may mean that the 401 can only do EDGE internet speed, ie 2g. That's dialup speed.+ Howards Forum is a good place to interact. This phone has a history on some other providers. [...]I've learned a lot in writing this. My rating is 4  and that's \"on spec\" because I havent used it yet.  I rate it in it's own category it is what it is.  The Android phone I want costs $400 so I've hunkered down.

I have no problems with the phone or the service.  My son has gotton rid of ipods and put music on his.  It said only 2g expansion but it read an 8g expansion micro sd so I am not sure if that is a typo by amazon or not or just our phone.  But anyway he is enjoying it.

This is a very affordable, nice-looking, high quality phone with an easy to use slide-out keyboard. The no-contract talk/text rates with Net10 are a fraction of what they cost with Verizon, and the best part... there are absolutely NO roaming charges!!The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the tech support is a total joke! The agents can barely speak English and are incapable of solving problems you cannot solve yourself. Upon activating my phone, I was unable to set up voicemail, and it turns out neither could they after about 30 minutes. They also could not tell me how to update the date/time on my phone. Later, I learned from an online forum that certain functions including auto update and voicemail activation do not always work outside of TracFone service areas. Lesson learned - don't rely on Net10 customer support, they will just eat up your minutes.If you can avoid problems, this is a great phone to have and Net10 will save you lots compared with major contract carriers. Battery life is the best I've experienced in any phone. Texts only cost 1/3 of a minute and you don't get charged for receiving them unless you actually open them. Also, you get 10 free minutes with purchase of the phone that expire in 2 months, and if you add minutes on top of those then you get an extra month. In my case, I added 200 minutes for $15 so now my total of 210 minutes will expire in 3 months. Breaks down to $5/month.

I then succeeded in my international calls but it is not very good.  You have to call a special number first (like using a phone card) and then type in your tel number. Awkward. Also it only calls land lines and NOT international CELLPHONES!  Also it is not very cheap and the prepaid money starts being used as soon as you call the special number.

My service currently goes through T-Mobile (from what I've read online, you can tell by the sim card in the phone). The service is great at work (in a basement and still get 4 bars), but lacking at home (0-1 bars, dropped calls, etc).I ported my phone number over from Sprint, and the porting process took about 4 hours (they say to allow up to 2 days!) with no issues.

I have been a Net10 customer for over 7 years and I agree that customer service can be a pain as it takes too long to resolve a simple issue. They will keep you on hold for a good half hour at least while they work to resolve the problem.

There have been times where they have given me an extra 50 or 100 minutes.I don't do anything fancy with my cellphone and only use it for an important call or a text. I have also taken pictures or videos once in a way. Don't know all the tech stuff that goes with phones these days but this Samsung T401G has been great.

Net10 does not explain you will have a dead phone for 2 weeks, you cannot call out and no one can reach you through the new or old number, and Net10 will still charge you for service days.You activate a net10 phone with their new number. You then go through the porting process. 3 hours later the old number was on the new Net10 phone - for 2 days. Then Net10 deactivated the phone. They said they needed to send a new SIM card, which would take 10 business days (14 calendar days.) They keep subtracting service days from the dead phone.I called customer service who said \"I cannot help you without the tracking number\" Nowhere, ever, did they mention the SIM tracking number. Called again, got another person, explained it, the person took 1/2 hour to find the tracking number, then said I had to wait for the SIM card. I asked about the service days.

Customer service said sure everything will transfer over I do not need to use my old t mobile sim card but leave the tracfone one in there-that did not sound right.Nothing transferred over, lost all my numbers, and my t mobile monthly plan too. Customer service will lie to you and scam you. I kept the same number but lost my plan so now Net 10 is charging me like 50 sounds to check a text or to send one. LOL. Get real.Customer service sucks and do not speak english well in spite they are nice and try to help. I remember I had a tracfone like ten years ago and remember why I only had it about a month. Since Tracfone has a terrible reputation to practically everyone(the ghetto phone carrier) they are hiding being the name Net10. Very sneaky and I fell for it as I am sure others have as well.Needless to say I immediately bought another prepaid T mobile phone this time so I have no more problems with this nonsense with the carrier not being compatible with certain SIM cards etc. Trust me Tracfone just wants your money and will charge you disgustingly to make calls, receive calls and 30-50 cents just to not only send but check a text for 30 cents. LMFAO. Where as I am on unlimited text a month with T mobile for 15 dollars.Stay away unless you like being frustrated with customer service and love throwing  money away.

I pay only $16.30 a month for 300 minutes and they roll over and do not expire. Since I only use the phone when away from home and make few calls this amount of time is enough.  I consider it among the best buys if you can find a simple phone, simpler the better, and use it only for voice on a limited basis.  You will hate it when you finally have to call customer service. Their staff uses a tree structure check list which they will not deviate from when trying to trouble shoot. You will typically be transferred 2 to 3 times to different departments and have to start over again every time. The typical experience will take 1 to 2 hours and you will hang up thoroughly angry.  On my last experience they finally after nearly 2 hours told me to just go buy a new phone and call back in and get my 600+minutes and 90days of service transferred to the new phone.  My problem was an error message \"check restriction #34\" which they finally told me meant no service.  A friend said to drive to a known service area where you have made calls then remove the battery for at least 3 minutes then reinstall the battery.  This cleared up my problem.  I would not recommend any NET10 service for any phone other than basic voice with limited use, and you just have to be willing to put up with the terrible customer service in order to get the cheap price.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung cell phone", "Author": "CAM", "ReviewID": "R1LLDCWYHF3KWX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was my son's cell phone he was upset with it a good part of the time.
