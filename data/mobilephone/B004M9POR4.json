I expected that it would become my go-to e-reader and serve as a truly portable web access device. Despite the great strengths of the unit, I wound up having the strangest experience I've had with a piece of electronic equipment in 30 years. The problem was very simple: I couldn't keep the back cover (over the battery compartment) attached! It was impossible to attach the back cover securely enough to get it to stay on permanently. It might stay on for 10 minutes, or an hour, or more, but eventually it would fall off, causing the unit to power off while in the middle of a task. You can easily imagine how annoying this was.I eventually went online, looking for answers to this problem. What I found was that so many other people had experienced the same problem, there were forums discussing this issue. There was even a Dell tutorial on You Tube showing how to properly secure the back cover. The problem was, it didn't help.When I reported this to Dell, they were very helpful and promptly sent me a new unit. Even though I had a similar problem with the new unit, eventually I was able to secure it in place. Now that that issue has been resolved (at least for now), there is much to like about the unit. Dell, I believe, found the sweet spot between portability and viewability. It is a fine e-reader and web tool. If not for the back cover issue, I would give it 4 stars. It surprises me that Dell hasn't done more to promote this product!", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive!", "Author": "Tony L.", "ReviewID": "R1GTEQZOVHO80F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love love love it! It has a big 5\" screen but the phone is very thin. It fits nicely in my front pocket. The touch screen is beautiful and very responsive, which is really impressive. I owned an iPhone (I still own it) but I always wanted an Android device. Have tried Sony Xperia before and it's a disaster. All the issues I had with Xperia like lagging and unresponsive screen etc are nowhere to be found on Streak. Everything is smooth. The SWYPE keyboard is a genius! GPS is very accurate even without the data connection. I can use the Streak as an external USB device to copy and move files (not only on PC, but works on Mac too). Wi-Fi tethering is a breeze! I am seriously impressed by the built-in quality of Streak. But I do think Dell did a poor job to promote this phone. All we heard on Android is from HTC, Moto, Samsung etc but I am glad I chose the Streak.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice tab/phone", "Author": "Nicolaos Chrysanthou \"Nick\"", "ReviewID": "R1UQIFVAU1RAC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I too would like to extend my congratulations to the designers of this phone/tab.

It works perfectly for me and a large screen has much better user experience when you try to do something on it, like creating some office documents on the go. Not to mention a 5-inch screen is much better for web surfing and watching videos and pictures. I have used the streak for about a month and really enjoy it.

I have two degrees in IT so imagine my frustration when I finally had to say hell this is the most worthless piece of equipment that I have ever come across. I tested phones for my phone company for more than nine years, and I have never seen an outcome so undesirable. How this product ever made it to this level of is rather astounding.

At first, I had the problem others mentioned regarding the battery cover popping off.  This powers the phone off, and thus is a serious problem.  Since I had a skin on it, I just put some tape over the cover, and it's been fine ever since.  Low tech, simple solution.One reason I bought this was to replace a broken e-reader.  The large screen works well for reading and browsing the net.  I've never had any serious problem with the phone, and the sound quality is acceptable.  With moderate use, I can go about 1.5 to 2 days before charging, though I rarely use the internet on it.The only area I find it truly lacking in is the camera.  It works, but the quality leaves much to be desired.  If that is important, might want to look at a Note or something similar.  otherwise, the strak is fineUpdate: I used it for about 9 months with no issue.  One day, it started rebooting, and wouldn't stop.  The sho where I bought it referred me to Dell.  Dell deserves its reputation for poor customer service.  I was told that they do not make phones.  I was told that the warranty had expired about 8 months before I bought the phone.  I was told a lot of things, but nothing that would qualify as useful.  After a few months, I bought a Samsung and haven't looked back.I'd recommend not buying this.

The biggest advantage for me using this phone is the 5 inches screen because anothing more than this would hurt my hand during prolonged use and anything lesser than this wouldn't give such a great feel; The moment I opened the package I was literally surprised by its awesome looks and edges, setup was very much easy and interacting with the smartphone was like slipping a splinter into cheese! The features it carried along was so good right from wifi connectivity, bluetooth and so on; This phone was able to pickup wifi signals even far off (thou argueably the router also is a consideration); It has got very decent, good and worthy apps as part of its bundle right from quickoffice which was a great plus; thou its a little bigger to use it as a conventional phone a bluetooth enabled headset would always compensate when paired! I dont use 3G but there is one thing that's worth mentioning if you are planning to use only wifi; AT&T; automatically recognised iPhone and made the data option compulsory but when i used the same SIM with this smartphone (with WIFI only and disabling the carrier data services) they haven't forced any such data plans for the past 4-5 months; From my point of view there is only one thing that needs a little improvement, the speakers; Overall this is worth the money and it has become a part of everything that's in my schedule!", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Made in China", "Author": "stephen lynard steen", "ReviewID": "R3PCGDI7B4X3XX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Was not as clear as I thought it was going to be..
