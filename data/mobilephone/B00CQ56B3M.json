I bought it mainly as a temporary replacement phone that I could put a sim card in, until I can get a better phone after Christmas.  Opera web browser is extremely basic, and the Youtube app is sort of a joke. For some reason it does not like staying on my wi-fi for a very long period at all, it loses the connection when only 10 feet away from the wireless router lol.  After you restart the phone it's back online again.  The Internet situation may change once I install a sim card with unlimited data, we will see.  However, I bought it for talk and text, so if the Internet situation does not straiten out, it will not phase me much because I am in front of a computer all day anyway.  The TV app does not pick up any stations where I am located (Michigan) however the FM radio works like a Boss and it's extremely loud!  I will give an update once I install the sim card tomorrow.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Alright", "Author": "Noel I", "ReviewID": "R2JNE8R577LLIH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Im submitting a reveiw, but it really isnt comprehensive.  I put my at&t; sim in the phone and it worked, but when i added 2 more sims to fill it up all 3 of the sims were unable to connect to any network.  The reason i say its not comprehensive is that the 2 sims i added were cut down to micro sim size which i put into adapters.  Maybe if i had used uncut sims it would work ok, but the 1 thing that still bothers me is that when had all 3 sims in there even my at&t; sim could not connect to its network.  I love that it accepts 3 sims and wish that other manufacturers would do the same.  I have a couple of international sims roaming and wish i could have my at&t; as well as my roaming sims all in 1 phone rather than in mulitple phones.  The build of the phone is a little cheap but for the price i paid it is to be expected.  When i travel next i'll take the phone and use it, hopefully it will work well and I will update my review then.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small Yet Cumbersome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R28FLI99BG1ZF3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought it as a \"stopgap\" phone, something cheap to use before I update operating systems and transition to something fancier. And bought it because it's an unlocked phone that takes multiple SIM cards (one US domestic, one for travel. and even a third, that I guess might be used for pay-as-you-go temporary SIMs in a pinch). And of course, it's a feature phone, not a \"smart\" phone; though it seems to have a fairly useful suite of built-in apps.But I'll never know for sure. It's possible I got a bum unit, but all I can say is, it wouldn't/couldn't connect my AT&T; SIM card to the network. (This is a card that works fine in another unlocked dual SIM cell I have.) If I couldn't use it as a phone, the rest was moot. Make that mute.As to my limited experience beyond that, while I was setting it up and testing features, before concluding that I had to return it for lack of connection, I found the learning curve a bit tricky. The phone is made in China for a Florida company that primarily serves the Hispanic market. The little instruction manual is not very helpful, and you have to stumble your way to the language change function to switch from Spanish to English. For some reason (my fault) I had misunderstood the build of the phone, thought it was a keyboard/touchscreen combo, but it's ONLY a keyboard operated device, patterned, I think, on the Blackberry design. It took me a while to realize that the directional cursor navigation is achieved by pushing left-right-up-down on the little frame that surrounds the central \"rounded square\" button, which I had originally thought was just a cosmetic design feature (because, with great effort, you can achieve the same navigation by fingernail-pushing the button at the edges of its perimeter); but once I got the hang of that, making my way through the menus and icons was no problem. But I also found the navigation paths limited and a little too cumbersome (i.e. how often I'd have to return to the START screen to select other options). Then again, the Blue Hero Pro Q333w is a very tiny thing, and for thirty-three bucks 'n' change, which is about what I paid for it, elegance is not really expected. That said, I was actually a little relieved that the phone function wasn't working, because I felt uncomfortable with the design and operation protocols. I would have made the best of it, but not happily.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "linda", "ReviewID": "RTNCA8G90MC8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this one is a great little phone. the blue color is sweet.
