{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect blend of size/specs/durability.", "Author": "Brian Meola", "ReviewID": "R2YI1CPO69CAYD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for compromise. Initially, I was doing the S3/One X debate like most people who want a high-end Android phone. One X had the price advantage, S3 has a removable battery and SD card which is a huge plus for me. Specs were comparable. But the drawback of both was the screen size. I had been using the HTC Inspire 4G, which was already so big in its case that I had to carry it in a back pocket rather than a front, taking it out to sit down comfortably. Both of these phones are bigger.The current screen-size arms-race in the phone world is beyond me. I understand the benefit of a bigger screen, but when I can't comfortably fit the phone in my pocket anymore I think the return is diminishing. Apparently I'm alone on this (not really, I read more than a few posts on Android forums lamenting the issue), because the sub-4.5\" screen, high-spec Android phone is a rare beast. I briefly (very briefly) even considered going to that walled garden (beautified prison?) that is iOS because Apple definitely got the size/spec balance right on the iPhone 5.Enter the Rugby Pro.I'm not a cliffdiver or anything, but I am an outdoorsy person who also drinks a lot. Both of those things mean that if I'm going to carry around something daily that is worth over $400 I need to take caution. I kept my HTC Inspire in an Otterbox during our time together, and that's the only reason it's still in re-sellable condition. That also means that I am going to need to put an Otterbox on an S3, One X, or iPhone. Which, especially in the case of the S3 or One X, means GIANT AWKWARD PHONE. That's why the Rugby Pro caught my eye.Usually \"rugged\" phones are mid-level at best spec-wise. Not this one. Dual Core 1.5 ghz processor. Ice Cream Sandwich (yeah, Jellybean would have been nice, but that's really only a handful of stock devices anyway). Great display. Removable battery and SD card. And, best of all, REASONABLY SIZED 4\" screen. And no need for a bulky Otterbox. Overall it's smaller than my lady's iPhone 4S with an Otterbox.So, with the Rugby Pro, you get a phone that's a bit below top-of-the-line specs that fits nicely in your pocket, and also happens to be shock-, dust-, and water-proof. That was the perfect balance for me.Pros:SizeDurabilitySpeedDisplayBattery LifeCons:Camera Quality (good, not great)Charger input is recessed (due to its cover), which means some non-OEM cables won't fit.Caution:If you're going to test that this phone is waterproof, make sure everything is tightly closed. The back has to be fully snapped into place and the tabs on the headphone and usb inputs need to be tightly in place.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone - updated March 11, 2013", "Author": "Dave Tulka", "ReviewID": "R3V139RZLGYSKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smartphone. I am migrating from a 1st generation Rugby flip phone which served me flawlessly for over four years. Like another reviewer, I am not a cliffdiver or best buds with Bear Grylls. At the other extreme, I am not a phone worshiper, my phone is a tool, not an ornament. My 1st Gen Rugby rode in the back pocket of my jeans as long as I had it and left a wear pattern like a snuff can.Enter the Rugby Pro. Actually, enter the Galaxy S3... My employer decided to pick up my cell phone expense and they sent me an S3. I was skeptical of the S3 as soon as I took it out of the box. For my hand, it was too thin, too slick, and too fragile-looking (more on that later). The S3 is a great phone but not for me. SO... I jumped through some hoops and my Rugby Pro arrived three days ago. It has the same mil-spec 810g qualities my Rugby flip phone had which means, in theory, the Rugby Pro is dunk-proof and bounce-resistant, etc.  The exterior of the Rugby Pro is slightly textured instead of the mirror finish of the S3. The edges have some small ribs which make holding on to the phone easier. The headphone and USB ports have tightly-fitting covers.From a connectivity perspective, it syncs perfectly with my company's Exchange email servers. Sound quality is great. It seamlessly transitions from 4g to my home network as soon as I walk in the door. Keyboard: I am still getting used to the tiny keys but have gotten much faster in just a few days.I have very high expectations for the Galaxy Rugby Pro. Last year, I was eating dinner at a bar and the guy next to me loudly announced I was \"from the '80s\" because I had a flip phone. He got pretty quiet pretty quick when I dropped my old Rugby flip phone in my water glass and proved it still worked after extraction from said glass. He declined my offer to repeat the experiment with his smartphone!In conclusion, the Rugby Pro should be a rock star. It's sturdy to survive unfortunate drops and inclement weather and it has the fuctionality I need to work anyplace, anytime.The only con has nothing to do with the phone, but with the absence of a quickstart brochure in the box. Granted, I'm a late adopter, but some cursory \"how-to\" info would have been a huge help. Heck, I just found out this thing has facial recognition technology to unlock the screen by reading the description on Amazon, fer cryin' out loud!I've not yet subjected the phone to the beer test. I'll update this review with my results. It has already survived one bounce from four feet onto concrete. Otterbox has a case for the Rugby Pro in the works, but no detail yet. I've signed up for updates at Otterbox.com. Maybe then I'll feel comfortable putting the Rugby Pro in the same place my 1st Gen Rugby flip phone so faithfully occupied. What will that wear imprint look like?Thanks for taking the time to read my long review. I have high hopes for this phone and Samsung has a hard act to follow given my success with my Rugby flip phone!UPDATE:  - The phone survived the beer test and the water test. A friend has a very rugged case for his iPhone. I showed him rugged by dropping my phone into a pan of water. He called my phone and we could both hear it ring through the water!  - Just out of habit, I started carrying the Rugby in my back pocket as I carried my old Rugby flip phone. I've decided the Otterbox Defender for this phone will not be needed. I do carry it with the screen facing out so my backside does not press on the screen.I am very happy with this phone and highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do your self a favor and give this phone a shot", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "RHOP8WAHCAFD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The rugby pro will be the only smart phone I ever buy period, its tough for everyday life, it is not much bulkier or heavier than most other sm phones I have had, the display is great, If you are in the construction industry of any kind or have teenagers who are forever dragging you back to the store to get a new phone because they dropped theirs in the commode or worse then give this one a try, it will save you headaches and money in the long run, just make sure everything on the back of the phone is sealed correctly and locked and make sure after you pull the charger out you pop the cover back on properly, Yesterday i dropped mine in the mud and as luck would have it yes I backed over it in a full size chevy pickup, I figured it was done and I would have to get another one but I sprayed it off with clean water and it works like the day I got it, try that with a blackberry or one of the other smartphones, it has all the features the other phones do and this one has a cool corporate contact section with day by day and hour by hour scheduling which I am constantly going to, each one can have an alarm set for it as well up to 1 day out which I thought was pretty cool I am impressed so far, Trust me on this one guys and gals who work out in the elements get this phone, you will not be disappointed, The salesman at the AT&T; store gave me a demo on the phone and actually took his watch off and tried to scratch the screen with a sharp part of his watch band and he could not so I asked If I could give it a try and I could not and I was pressing down very very hard, I told him sold after that little demo.

This phone is exactly what I have been looking for - something I can beat up and not worry about all the time, without a huge screen.  I had my last phone, a Samsung Captivate Glide, for about 2 minutes before I dropped it in water.  While it worked fine after that, the screen quality never recovered.  I didn't think I could switch over from a physical keyboard when I bought the Glide, but that phone had such a nice touchscreen I ended up getting used to it and rarely used that physical keyboard.  The Rugby Pro has the same awesome screen (I don't know if that is technically true but it seems just as nice) so it hasn't been a problem at all.I guess I only really wanted to write this review to say that I was so surprised by how much nicer the phone is than the Glide, which was really not that much older.  The phone is super fast in everything I do, and the battery life is AMAZING.  I charge it every 3 or 4 days, which seems insane to me, as someone who has been pretty used to charging daily ever since switching to a smart phone.I had considered the Galaxy S \"Active\" but the salesperson really talked me out of it, saying that you couldn't submerge the phone in water at all, and that was pretty much what I was looking for.  They must not have had the Rugby around then because they had zero suggestions for a smaller screen or a more durable phone.  Went online and there it was, my dream phone.I haven't been as adventurous as others to submerge the phone, but it sure feels a lot more secure than my last phone.  It's nice that the coverings over the holes kind of hang in space - my last few phones have had little slider things that I never noticed and rarely bothered to shut.  You can't ignore these ones, it looks silly if you don't put everything back in place.  Oh, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that the back of the phone locks in - I am always dropping my phone and off goes the back and there goes the battery.This phone really was made for klutzes like me, which is why I really wanted it.

Vent", "ReviewID": "R3GFA3GXALI5C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm somewhat clumsy and hard on phones. I went through 3 fairly quickly before I bought the original Samsung Rugby flip phone, and that lasted me 4 or 5 years before it finally completely died. It was beat to hell. I loved that thing. So naturally when I decided to join the new millennium and look for a smart phone I started with the Rugby. I did not hear good things about the original Rugby smart phone; a buddy of mine had one and hated it. He said it was durable, but clunky and slow. Everybody raves about their Galaxies though, so I decided to give this phone a shot. And so far so good. It's lightweight. The screen resolution is excellent. Pictures look great. I've already dropped it a couple times on asphalt and there are only minor dings. I do, however, have a few complaints. As another reviewer pointed out, I have only been able to move pictures and videos to the SD card. It seems like my old phone was a lot more configurable. I could organize things in folders and move stuff around at will, and I haven't been able to do that with this phone. But, I haven't done any research on that so it may be possible. Also, every once in awhile the phone stops recognizing the SD card - I'm not sure why. Usually a reboot will take care of it, but I have had to re-seat it too. That being said I also have a Droid Bionic (wrapped in an Otterbox) for work and I like the Samsung 10x better. It just feels tighter, sleeker, and faster.

Second the buttons on the phone protrude from the phone a bit i suspect this is for being able to use gloves and operate but the drawback is, if the phone is in your pocket and you do any bending or physical things at you will reset your phone constantly.

I chose these phones because of their rugged features, I have a dad who traps, drops his phone in water, etc.,  as well as my husband working for the city so one can only imagine what his phone goes through! Since purchasing them we have had mild issues with them, nothing that would make us hate them or pine for another phone, they do the job of being a phone with capabilities of the internet etc. They are very rugged and have not died on us yet, the camera is a little slow, and sometimes there are screen sticking issues, but like I said they do their job and have not completely broken on us!", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "HUGE Cost saveings in long term", "Author": "Dale.E", "ReviewID": "RU7N0SGH1TO7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We run 55 of these in a construction company and have had them for almost a year now, NONE have all out failed, Two battery issues and eight of them have had the water door for the battery connector damaged.

A whole new level of productivity achieved!Even more seriously, this phone is a lot like the Galaxy S3 which I had for over a year before dropping, attempting to repair and ultimatley breaking. The rugby pro Is the replacement.The screen is a tad smaller, the resolution is slight lower and the phone is bulkier (cause its rugged). It seems just as fast (I've had the phone for 1 week).When water hits to face of the phone sometimes odd things can happen ... apps open, settings change ... so be careful not to accidentally send an email, call someone (shower dialing) or \"like\" something that you in fact do not like.UPDATE: dropped this while I was in the shower and the shell opened!  Phone was OK after pulling it out quickly. Drop height was about 5ft.... the height of the soap tray.  Everything about the phone is still pretty accurate: fast, long battery, good audio quality.NOTE: if you do take phone into the shower also be careful not to take unintended selfies!", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "KHale", "ReviewID": "R1AA0721I352LV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only had it a few weeks and so far it has been a great phone.
