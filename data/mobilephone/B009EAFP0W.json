Rapino", "ReviewID": "R2K8SCBJL167BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I guess the first thing you have to realize is this: it's not a smart phone.  It seems as though all phones are held up to smart phone standards these days, and it can be hard to filter through the reviews of people expecting an iphone when they buy a \"basic\" phone.This phone does what it's supposed to.  Calls are clear and easy to hear.  The AT&T; network is much better around my house than the Verizon network was, but I suspect that will vary from user to user.  The battery life seems pretty great so far.  Text messaging works as it should.  All the settings are easy to change and customize.There are a few nit picks I have:When a text comes in, it just says \"new message,\" but doesn't say who it's from.  Not a deal breaker, but a slight annoyance as I do like to know who is sending me a message prior to opening it.The qwerty keyboard is smaller than I'm used to, but not too bad.  I imagine people with large hands would have trouble with it though.  I'm getting used to it pretty quickly.The phone feels fairly light in weight, and it looks nice.  There are a bunch of internet features that I don't use because I only have the $25 a month plan, so I can't speak to their functionality.  Though my gut is telling me if you're looking for a phone that works really well with aps and internet functions, you might want to look elsewhere.One other thing I've been having trouble with (and this is more likely the AT&T; service, not the phone), but I can't seem to figure out how to check my minutes usage on the phone.  I've been going to the AT&T; online account page to check it.  The phone numbers they provide for accessing this info on the phone hasn't worked for me, though I'm not sure why.  Again, I'm not deducting any stars for this since it's probably not the phone.The camera and video on this are an afterthought, and since I have other devices for that use, I'll probably never use it with this phone.  But if you're looking for a great camera phone, this isn't it.There's also a standard headphone jack so you can use this as a mp3 player.  I haven't used this feature yet, but I imagine it functions as expected.Overall, this is a great little phone for someone looking for a cheap, basic phone.  Paired with the $25 monthly gophone account (on auto-renewal), it has saved me about $35 a month from my previous plan.EDIT (12/22/12):  After a few more days of use, there are a couple other little bothersome things about this phone (some of which were mentioned by other reviewers).  First, there *is* a one or two second hesitation after a text comes in, when I'm waiting for the \"new message\" alert to pop up so I can click it.  I didn't really notice at first, but as I've texted more and more, it becomes apparent that I'm sitting there waiting for the alert to appear.Another thing is that after you reply to a text, rather than bouncing you out to the main screen, it goes back to the message you just replied to.  So then I have to back out to the main screen manually.  And even though there is a \"conversation\" selection, I haven't figured out a way for the texts to automatically come in conversation mode.  Rather, it seems it's only if you select it after the fact.I know that seems like a lot of negatives, but really they aren't any big deal.  Just some things I've noticed as I use the phone.  I still consider it a 4 star phone for the price.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great non-smartphone", "Author": "Jennifer Laurent", "ReviewID": "RY8P4G82QM8BH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband needs simplicity when it comes to mobile phones.

So annoying. I always have my phone on vibrate and am afraid I will miss texts and calls if there is no way to make the vibration strongerEdit 12/28This phone is still decent. I think it is closer to a 3.5 star rating now though.More ProsThe threaded texting mode works well.The vibration setting given is actually okay most of the time even though I still sometimes wish it was stronger.It's actually pretty study, I have dropped my phone many times and that happens is it restarts, but it always does come back to life.On my AT&T; (not go phone plan) the unlimited Internet is $10 and this has a decent browser to check Facebook or my email or google the occasional question.The New ConI am a little annoyed by the fact that this phone just restarts sometimes but it seems to be a theme among lower quality phones; however, it could be a huge problem in an emergency.Update 8/5/13I have stopped using this phone and gotten a high end Android because of an available upgrade.I will miss this phones $10/month data plan, the easy to configure alarms, the relatively small size, and the full keyboard.I think that this phone was worth what I paid to get me through several months but it showed wear and tear when I stopped using it and I'm not sure how much longer it was going to last (I am a heavy user though several hundred text days and drops down the stairs were not uncommon).", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Adequate...barely.", "Author": "kindasorta", "ReviewID": "R31J2Y030RORXM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a basic phone with a QWERTY keyboard for sole purposes of making calls, and texting ONLY without having to subscribe to a data plan, this is literally just about your only choice on AT&T.;  It does those two functions adequately.  Call quality is good, and the keyboard while small, is adequate.  This is not a smartphone so its not to compare features to basic android phones etc, but this phone has many other quirks that would probably make me pick another model, if such a device was available.  Some of the biggest annoyances:Battery charging indicator is seldom, if ever accurate.  It will show full charge on AC then immediately drop to 75% when you unplug it. It does this even if you leave it plugged in all night so I never know if my phone is ever completely charged.  It does also takes a very long time to charge.  With the included AC adaptor it often takes 2-3 hours to charge from 25%, if not more.  The good news is that I often get 3 days out of a charge, even with heavy texting and moderate phone call usage.Extremely limited internal memory of only 8 MB for text messages.  This is criminal for a phone that is obviously designed for texting.  Even though you can add a micro SD card, you cant store text messages on it so you are constantly getting \"memory low\" warnings even if the \"auto delete old messages\" feature is enabled.GET A CASE.  This phone is extremely flimsy, lightweight, and fragile.  One pocket drop will kill it.  The screen scratches easy so get a screen protector too.It has the ability to play MP3's, but the playback volume is deafening even on the lowest setting.The built in camera is surprisingly good in all sorts of lighting situations, But it often takes 3 - 5 seconds to launch the camera. This is a case where the plus outweighs the negative though.Pairing with a Bluetooth headset is an absolute pain.  It only connects with my headset on the third try, every time.Overall this thing is laggy and slow.  No matter what function you wish to do, it will always take a few seconds to load up the desired feature.  There is an option to check att for a firmware update, however that feature on my phone does not work.  It did when I bought it, then it just stopped.So again, for texting and phone calls only, four stars.  For overall usage and performance for anything else, one star.  Unless you buy an unlocked cel phone from somewhere, this is pretty much the only ATT phone with a hard QWERTY keyboard that does not require a data plan.  Its usable, just don't expect to love it.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great basic for 4 this day and age", "Author": "J.

All I use this phone for is calls and texts, so please keep that in mind.  I am not a heavy texter by any mean, only doing two or three a day average.So, let's get down the the nitty gritty of this phone.  I've had it for about a month, and here's what I think:The good:-Thin and fairly light-Small size for having a full keyboard (this could be good or bad.  See bad for explanation).-It works pretty well for phone and simple texting, especially at the price I got it at.-Has some extras that I do like: alarm clock, address book.-Talk quality is good.  I've had no issues with hearing people or being heard.-Nice speaker phone.  I use this quite often, and I can't stand a lousy speaker phone.-Excellent price.  I put it in my cart and watched it.  It dropped to $20 here on Amazon and I grabbed it.The bad:-Small size for having a full keyboard.  The keyboard is small.  My hands are small, but it still took a few days to get used to the small size of this keyboard.  If you have any vision issues or larger hands, you may want to seriously consider this before buying.-Don't expect this to double as an mp3 player.  It has this as a function, but it doesn't work well.  It stops continually while you are trying to play the song.-It is true that you can't see who texted you until you open the message.  This is a little irritating, but since I usually only text a few people, it isn't a big deal for me, but might be for you.-I can't find a calendar on it.  Maybe I'm missing it.  If you know where it is, please let me know.  I do like to have a calendar on my phone.(See update)-Sometimes when I'm punching number in quickly for a call, it chokes just a bit and might miss a number.  This only happens maybe 20% of the time.Overall, if you are just looking for a basic phone and read the specs and know what you are getting, this is a decent phone.  It isn't an iphone or a blackberry, and when it tries to do too much you can really tell, but for calls and a few texts, it suits my needs perfectly.Update:  I found the calendar!  It is the button that says clr on the front.  So yes, it has a calendar, and now I like it even more for having that feature!", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "slower than molasses...", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R3E7IUW6ASQX4G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned this phone for one day before deciding to return it.

It's a feature phone, not a smart phone and perfect for those of us who have broken free of the AT&T; data plans. I purchased the phone at Radio Shack to replace my older phone that went through the washing machine. It's a go-phone. If you have AT&T; Wireless service already all you have to do is stick the SIM card into the phone and it's ready to use. It does the basics very well and seems well built. Phone reception is as good as the older Sony-Eriksson W810i that I used before. The QWERTY keyboard is not difficult to use but I sometimes need reading glasses to read the number keys in the morning. The 1000 mAh battery is big enough to last me a couple of days between charges. The screen is 2.3\", sharp and offers nice colors. The 2.0MP camera provides useful photos. The AT&T; Z431 user's manual doesn't mention anything about this but the micro USB port used for charging the phone is also a data port. I use a $1.99 micro USB/USB2 data cable to upload and download photos between the Z431 and my Windows 7 desktop computer.

It catches pretty decent service, and call quality is pretty good. However there is an annoying beeping nose during a call, as if there was a recording device of some sort. I don't talk on the phone enough for it to bother me but its there. And is really annoying. I can't tell you about other features since I don't use any, but I wouldn't expect too much out of this phone. Otherwise look for a smartphone, this is just something to get you by for a few months.

I'll share my pros and cons for you. I've had it for a month.Pros:Texting is in conversational format, so it's easy to keep up. Camera is decent at FAR AWAY objects only (what do you expect?). Keys are responsive, volume is good, semi-customizable. Has an earphone jack, can change text and dial number size, and so far has had good reception. Battery lasts 3-5 days with my normal texting, which is phenomenal, considering my last phone would only make it a day.Cons: (HERE we go)Phone is slow after taking photos and receiving texts. If the phone is locked, or on a different screen other than the home screen, it will cut off part of your ringtone; this doesn't conflict with functionality, but it's rather annoying. Prone to glitching and going white screen for a few seconds after hanging up phone calls. One day my phone decided a ringtone no longer needed to be there and it disappeared until I reset the stupid phone. When you get a new text and go to open it up, it will take about 5 seconds before it opens up and lets you do anything. When trying to hang up calls, it takes a very long time, so you're not sure if you're still on the phone with the person or not; it takes several presses of the hang-up button before it says that it has hung up. Also, after a fresh charge, I have to shut the phone off and turn it back on because it will automatically say I only have half a charge left.So yea, it's alright. Even with the little bothersome ticks it has, I'm ok with it.  The fact I paid $30 for it outright, I'm surprised it even has bluetooth.Don't expect an awesome phone, and you won't be disappointed.

I think I will get used to it.  For now, I am working out the bugs/quirks.Texting is much, much easier than on my flip phone, obviously.  However, the buttons are very small.

Text messaging works good, but you have to use the Conversation mode in order to track a conversation you're having with people, as a previous message will be displayed when a new message comes in, instead of the new message popping up on screen. The Internet works pretty good once you know which sites you can effectively use, but that is pretty much trial and error.For a messaging phone, this is a pretty good phone. Most of my issues seem to be with AT&T;'s service, rather than the device itself.

I really liked the Pantech and thought this was a nicer phone, at first.  Then the problems started.  There are times when I try to manually dial numbers and instead of the first 3 digits coming up on the screen, it shows letters instead. The battery is awful.  Less than a month out of the box, I would have it recharge all night long only to find the battery drained in less than 2 days.  This phone sits in my car while I'm at work all day and I use it primarily for texting.  I have no idea how the battery can go from 3 bars to 1 bar in one day with minimal usage.  The other day when I tried to text, it would not allow letters to show up, just symbols.  I tried backing out and starting again.  Still - only symbols, not letter.  I had to power down the phone and bring it back up to 'reset' the texting function.  Yes, I checked - it was set for Lower and Upper case letters for texting.Today was the real icing on the cake - it started dialing numbers on it's own.  I swear it really happened.  I use the bluetooth feature to connect my phone through my car.  All of a sudden the phone feature comes on and starts dialing a number.  I pressed the red hang up button and placed the phone down.  It was not rubbing against anything.  I placed it back on the passenger seat with the keys up.  A moment later it started to dial again.  I repeated the process over and over and over.  I finally had to pull the battery to prevent it from just dialing out.  I had it with this phone.  I miss my old Pantech.

So far it's impressive, considering its low cost.The most important thing you need to understand is *this is not a smartphone* and you should not expect it to behave as such.  It doesn't and you will be disappointed.This phone is very thin and light.  It also seems very durable.  It has a nice selection if ringtones and quite a few of them are very loud.  There are also several alert tones to choose from (8, to be exact), but for some reason the phone sometimes chooses to play a simple \"ding\" sound, rather than your chosen tone.  I do not find this a problem, as my phone is rarely more than 10 feet away from me, but some people might find this irritating.  (I think this may be a network issue and not a phone issue, as the network where I live is really terrible and that causes all kinds of strange problems.  Also, you can set a ringtone as an alert tone and this problem goes away.  About 3 seconds of the ringtone will play, not the whole thing.)I am a heavy texter and moderate talker and charge the phone about twice a week.  However, I do not ever let the battery drop lower than a quarter charge.  I have had no problems with the back falling off.  This phone has TONS of memory space, even without an extra memory card.I am on the fence about the keyboard.  It is not flat - the keys are raised.  I don't dislike it, but I'm not sure I like it, either.  It's also a little cramped.  The keys are a little stiff (you'll get used to that) but give a good, audible clicking sound when pressed.I do not use any options involving a data plan and so cannot comment on them.Like other reviewers have said, this phone is a little sluggish.  I really do not find this to be an issue unless I am in a hurry.  Hanging up from a call also sometimes takes multiple pushes of the end call button.  It would also be nice to be able to make the keyboard backlight brighter.My biggest concern is the long-term durability of this phone.  The screen tends to flash white at times, usually after a call or sending a text.  That worries me, but since the phone was cheap, it wouldn't be a big deal to replace it.My three little nitpicks are as follows:  1)  When typing an email or text and using the word \"I'm,\" the M will automatically capitalize itself.  It looks like you make a type-o and that irritates me.  You can change that by hitting the case button and switching to lowercase, but my point is I shouldn't have to.  2)  When you first begin to use the phone, the city of your caller shows up in the caller ID.  I think this is pretty cool, but what nobody will tell you is that this is a free trial of an app (really bloatware) you have to subscribe to for $2 a month once the free trial expires.  Bummer.  3)  You have the game Uno on the phone, but you only have 5 games before you cannot play anymore and are prompted to buy the full version.  Uno is one of my favorite games so this was a real disappointment.In spite of the little things - and they really are little - I still give this phone 4 stars.

For $10 you can add an unlimited ATT non-smartphone dataplan. I believe this is worth it:-Yes, these phones have apps. It runs on Qualcomms Brew OS along with a Java ME VM. There aren't that many apps but the ones that are available are very high quality and pass various certifications if they do anything serious on the phone. I suggest downloading UCBROWSER signed browser(this removes warnings that you are using data). Takes a bit of getting used to but with 3g I can surf almost any site when I'm on the go. Definitely check email using mobile gmail site (it also has built in email). There is also Opera browser, though I prefer UC. The browser that comes with the phone, NetFront I believe, is very mediocre.-Can watch most Youtube videos, albeit at a lower quality. The other day it helped me troubleshoot something on my car when I was on the road. The video is like mid-90s quality.-Has Free GPS app to locate you on a map and find restaurants, movies, etc. Uses TomTom maps. GPS directions though cost extra from ATT. Third party apps can't really access GPS on this phone (I am a developer and tried) because Location apps must be signed and approved by ATT (I guess for security and profit).-Tight, mature Java sandbox environment with high security. Unsigned apps are limited to games and can't access data.-Multitask mode (like alt-tab on a pc). Has special button for that. Can easily switch between tasks. Very respectable speed, but it is no new Iphone.-Has a barcode scanner to identify products and see them on Amazon, other sites (its decent, not the greatest, YMMV by item).-There are some Java games and other apps if you search.

It has a calender, alarm clock, stop watch, calculator, and all the other random stuff phones have. Can you show proof of insurance with this phone? Probably not.

(NOTE: Cable sold seperatly. Not an issue for me though. I haven't tried this yet.)Can use regular head phones/earbuds. My Koss and Skullcandy buds worked great with this!Micro SD card compatable. NOTE: Micro SD card sold seperatly.Uses a SIM card.Calls sound clear on both ends.Can play multiple types of sound files.If you download or save music files to a Micro SD card you can use them as custom ringtones and message tones.The keypad is relatively easy for texting. It's Qwerty!Web Connection: Update 3-5-2013 I bought one of the cheaper data packeges just to try this out. The speed and signal strength seem pretty decent to me. The browser didn't take long to load Amazon's mobile site. Worked well with Fanfiction.net's mobile site too. Not so sure about sites that don't have a mobile version. I have to admit that when it comes to speed, this works better then my basic DSL service at home.Code Scanner. Update 3-5-2013 Works great for me. TIP make sure you have enough light and that code is not missprinted. You can find the code scanner in the App Manager. Not only will it scan QR codes but bar codes as well. I tested this with codes that contained web links and I was able to open and browse the sites with ease. Update: 4-21-2013 The code scanner will not scan codes that are smaller then 1 inch by 1 inch. This will only scan black and white codes. This will not scan tags with a rainbow colored \"houndstooth\" pattern.Update 4-28-2013 Video playback: It plays YouTube videos. Not Sure about Netflix or Hulu Plus. I don't have a paid subscription for those sites. As long as it's YouTube compatable, I' happy.Things that are just MEH.. When I say \"meh\" I mean it's not great but it's not total deal breaker either.The camera. Takes pics OK. You can take pics in landscape mode or portrait mode. It's 2 mega pixcels. Not the best quality but good enough to take a pic to use as a wallpaper.Font. There's not much you can do about customizing it. You can change the font size for texting, date/time display ect but you can't change the color or type. Not much of a problem for me because sometimes I have trouble reading fancy fonts even though I have good eyesight.Color and icon theme sets. There's only 2 themes you can choose from. Default Blue or White. I kinda wish there was more.Downloading Apps. Update 3-5-2013 I just found out that this phone runs on BREW.(Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless)Heh NO WONDER!

I ordered it for my wife, as her old phone would not link up to her new car's system.  My iPhone did easily and quickly.  So did this one.  However, each time she gets in the car, a \"No Connection\" message appears and we have to link it again.  Not sure where the fault lies yet, but I have in mind that my phone works just fine with the car's system.Still, the keypad is hard to read because the letters on the keys are so small and close together, and the numbers over the letters are even harder to read.  There are a number of specialty keys that are not at all intuitive and will be hard to remember as we're not kids texting constantly.  It's neither fish nor foul.  Neither a good basic phone nor a real smart phone.On the pro side, it  has good sound quality both on and off speaker and is easy enough to navigate through.  Size and weight are good and battery life is good, although it's still nearly new.  It accepted the transfer of my contacts when taken to an AT&T; store, but I think that was just the SIM card.  I'm not technical enough to know, but I believe that is what the AT&T; clerk said.I hope I'm not being too tough on it.  A young person might find it easier to use.

I decided to downgrade to this phone since my Note was too distracting.  I wanted a phone that was functional as a communciation device, but not an entertainment device.  I bought this phone for the following reasons.1)  It is a 3G phone.  I need 3G for the phone to work with my At&t; 3G microcell, which is a signal booster for my home.2)  I wanted to use the phone as an MP3 player.  The 32gb microSD expansion sounded great.3)  Blue tooth & GPS1)  As a basic phone it seems to be fine.  As mentioned in other reviews, it would be nice if the vibrate setting was a little more noticable.  When setting up the key shortcuts, I was disappointed at the limited options.  For example, you can't set up a shortcut to text messaging, instead you can only set a shortcut to compose a new text message.  It won't let me set a direct short cut to the music player, it will only let me set a shortcut to \"My Stuff\", from which I can select music, and then music player.  This is annoying, but not a deal breaker.2)  As an MP3 player this phone is completely unacceptable.  With 29Gb of music loaded onto my microSD card it takes the music player about 1/2 hour to open, each and every time I use it.  I was hoping that it would be a long initial scan, and then after that it would operate more quickly.  No such luck.  The phone simply can't handle the capacity that it claims to.  I plan to only load a handful of MP3's on it at a time.  Also, it doesn't support M3U playlist, which I thought were pretty much universal.  As far as I can tell, you have to create playlists on the phone and cannot import them.3)  Blue tooth is fine, and I was pleasantly surprised it was included on a phone that only cost $50.  The only GPS available on the phone is At&t; navigator which is a subscription service for $10/month- a total rip off.  It does have a maps app, which although slow, could be useful in a pinch.The most frustrating thing about this phone so far is that there are no online resources to answer my questions.  I read through the users manual, but there isn't anything in there that you can't figure out by playing with the phone for 10 minutes.  If you do a google search for the Z431 looking for helpful information from an online community, you will find nothing.  I emailed customer support at ZTE (the phone's manufacturer) and their tenuous grasp on the english language makes them less than helpful*.* In case you are wondering, I asked them about playlist, long loading times and about transfering google contacts onto the phone.

Anyway...This phone is pretty easy to set up and definitely functions. Calls seem to be of pretty good quality. Texting is fine though the keys are a bit small even though I have small fingers anyway. I have already dropped it once onto tile floor as the phone is a bit small and not much grip but it still works perfectly well (I have a cheap case on the way...case+shipping = about $4). The internet is so-so. Nothing like on smartphones but it shouldn't be for the price tag. Camera decent at least. Display nice size. The entire phone lags a little but again for the price I didn't expect it to be snappy in it's functions. I do really love that it fits easily into my pocket....haven't had that in a phone for a while!My main complaint is the texting application. It will pop up to view text and when you do view the text it only shows you your new one....to see the entire conversation (or what you said to get the response you did) you must go in the messaging application and click on 'conversations.' I wish it automatically went to the entire thing as sometimes I forget what was said or what we were talking about.Another con is that I have music on my SD card. I go to the music player and it takes a while to refresh...even after I weeded out what I could live without until I get my other phone back. The sound is also not the greatest but, again, I did not buy it for an mp3 player.While this is annoying I feel I must still give it 4/5 stars as for $30 I cannot expect much else. It was worth the money vs. going through the headache of finding somebody with a spare phone I could borrow temporarily.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't import exisitng contacts from sim card", "Author": "Sea Buyer", "ReviewID": "R9LPYJE7U4O6N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Within the address book there should be a function called SIM Management, this option does not exist with this particular phone.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "NIce Basic Phone", "Author": "Davis43080", "ReviewID": "R1K61LLKLNTX60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is nice for my parent that doesn't have any use for a smartphone.
