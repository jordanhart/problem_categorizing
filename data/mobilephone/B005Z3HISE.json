Davenport", "ReviewID": "R14LLBJPQ7AF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If anyone travels internationally or needs dual numbers for business, like I do, this dual sim worldphone is a godsend. This phone offers everything one of the expensive smartphones do, but at a fraction of the cost. A phone, media player, and ereader, all in one, for less than you would pay for any of those machines individually. Same idea as one of the i9 sciphones, but this one actually works. Great Buy!", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "SVP M1 Cell Phone", "Author": "deathstar300", "ReviewID": "R29YFL227VQ77Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone.and I am sorry I bought it. You cannot capitalize the name in your phone book. The key board for texting is the numeric key board not the qwerty. It is just a basic touch phone. It doesnt even have a calculator.
