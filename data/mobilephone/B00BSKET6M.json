I wasn't even considering a BlackBerry because I use the older ones at work all the time and always thought of them as a necessary evil for corporate email. I am not a Google fan so I wasn't considering one of their phones.That all changed when I started my crash course \"must buy a phone now\" research. I was looking for a phone with easy app switching, easy app closure, hard core messaging integration, NFC (just forward thinking really), Bluetooth 4.0, Wifi, replaceable battery (they do eventually build memories regardless of what anyone says), upgradeable storage (so I don't have to know what size I will initially need up front), the ability to play my iTunes songs, etc. Ultimately I wanted a phone that was intuitive to me and would just work and not one that felt like a toy.I started reading rave reviews of the Z10 so I decided to put it on the table for consideration. Using my wife's iPhone 4 as a comparison I dug into the Z10 and the more I read the more I liked it because it nailed every single wish list item I had. Then I went to the AT&T; store to play with it and once I got around the annoying demo software I was truly impressed with the phone so I bought one.The app switching and closure couldn't be easier, and the message hub is really awesome. This phone to me represents a true culmination of multiple UI approaches, and as a result it made me feel like my wife's iPhone was more of a toy in comparison. Don't get me wrong, I like the iPhone very much and was leaning in the direction of a 5S until I saw the Z10, I just feel like the Z10 is more down to doing what I want a phone to do.The only regret I have is there aren't more apps on the BlackBerry store, but that has nothing to do with the phone. I have 0 regrets with the phone and am still showing it off to anyone who is interested.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Brilliant Phone OS + Tricks for Outlook Contacts & Calendar Sync", "Author": "Trevor L \"God is on the side of the army with...", "ReviewID": "R38MHL4C9HCGB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Blackberry has developed an amazing phone and an amazing phone operating system.  I have been through three generations of iPhone and two generations of Android (my current work phone is the HTC One X) and the BB has a lot of compelling features that make you more productive. What sets this phone apart is the ability to easily multitask between applications and the ability to isolate work related communications from personal communications. There are no buttons needed, you navigate around using swipe gestures. True one-finger navigation. On the back-end Blackberry has implemented ActiveSync technology to enable Outlook & Exchange sync.

I was very pleased with the performance of both of these phones but there hasn't been a whole lot change in either OS for the last few years.  Yes, they have both added useful new features and upgraded the hardware but at the end of the day it has been the exact same user experience for the last 5 years and I am ready for a change. When the Z10 was released I didn't expect much in the way of performance or innovation because I have used the Torch and Storm and absolutely hated them both.  One of my best friends had recently purchased the Z10 and said it was the best phone they have used so I decided to check it out at the store.Within 5 minutes of navigating the phone I realized that Blackberry had created something truly amazing and nothing like its previous attempts at a full touch screen device.  Ok enough stories, I will give you 3 reasons that makes me believe this is the best phone currently on the Market.1.  SPEED - I have used dozens of phones and the Z10 is hands down the fastest operating system I have ever used as well as the fastest mobile browser by far that I have ever seen.  There is no home button and navigation is performed exclusively through gestures making navigation between apps, messages, running programs seamless.  As well it is the only phone that offers true multi-tasking, all of the programs that are running remain running in the background even if you switch to another app.2. User Interface - The completely new operating system Blackberry 10 is what really sets this phone apart from the others.  The introduction of the blackberry HUB is genius! all of your Calls, email, texts, BBMs, Facebook messages, tweets,etc all come to one screen known as the HUB and you can reply to any messages directly from the hub without having to open your email program, facebook, BBM, etc.  This saves loads of time navigating in and out of Apps just to check/send a couple of messages.  If you receive a message and you happen to be reading a web page or writing a text you don't have to switch screens to read what it says, all you have to do is swipe to the right and you can \"peek\" into your hub and see what the message says and who its from instead of getting an annoying popup message that you have to acknowledge before continuing what you are doing.3. Connectivity - I use several different devices daily (laptop, desktop, Phone, smart Tv) and I have always had issues (especially with Apple products) playing media from my laptop or desktop on my phone and other devices. First of all with the Z10 there is no proprietary software required to add media or copy it to another device, I can connect it to any computer and add or remove anything I want without any special software.  The phone can also connect via WIFI to any computer or TV in my house so I can add or play movies, music, documents, etc. with the phone in my pocket or anywhere else in the house for that matter.  This has saved me hours of messing around with Itunes and other apps just to get a couple of songs on my phone before work. It's easy now I just drag and drop any file and it's on my phone, even if my phone is in my car in the garage.  The same goes for playing media, my bluray player and TV are both connected to the home network and I can play anything that's on my phone on my TV or stereo by simply selecting my Z10 and then selecting the song or movie that I want, and the best part is you don't have to plug your phone into anything, technically you don't even have to know where your phone is as long as it is in your house and connected to WIFI.I could go on and on about how this phone is superior to the other phones on the market but the only way to truly know for yourself would be to put one in your hand.  I have owned the phone for just over 2 months and I absolutely love it, and would recommend it to anyone whose main use for the phone would be calling, messaging, internet, and multimedia viewing/transferring because it does these things better than any other phone I've ever used.  If this is Blackberry's first attempt at a true smartphone then I can't wait to see what is next because this phone is Brilliant!", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "amazing keyboard", "Author": "df33", "ReviewID": "R1SQKOT2SGB1IN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Z10 and love it.

As of today I already have many of these apps on my Z10 including: Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Maps, UFC.tv, OpenTable, theScore, Ebay, PayPal, Pacemaker, NHL Gamecenter, IM+ Pro, Splashtop Remote Desktop and Eventseekr.Also some great games such as: Angry Birds, Wheres my water?, Jetpack Joyride, Run in Crowd, Lets Golf 3, Doodle God, N.O.V.A. 3, Asphalt 7, Great Big War Game and Need for Speed Undercover.The new feature, called \"hub\", makes checking and responding to messages a breeze. I have never found it so simple to keep my emails, texts, facebook messages and instant chats organized.Having used ios and sndroid, I can honestly say that I believe BlackBerry is on to something with their new operating system. It is so user friendly and intuitive, as others have said, I find myself \"swiping\" on ipads.Another great feature is the keyboard. It is ultra-smooth and adapts and learns words that you regularly use. Don't believe me? Google \"octopus keyboard\". Its essentially a direct copy of the new BB keyboard available for apples ios. The only touchscreen keyboard that even comes close is the 3rd party keyboard called swype on android.If you are in the market for a new phone, and value security, stability and quality... I highly recommend a trip to your local smartphone retailer to check out the new BlackBerry 10 operating system on the all-new BlackBerry Z10.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "SIMPLY AMAZING, FAST, BRILLIANT OS, KEYBOARD UNMATCHED TO ANY OTHER", "Author": "THE CHENBOT", "ReviewID": "R3D8I9KF079ZG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE MAY 29, 2013:just want to let you guys know that i LOVE THIS PHONE more today than the first day i bought it.  its just an incredible powerhouse.  typing is no longer a frustrating experience (unlike with the iphone), and its made my life a million times better. being able to be in one app, then quickly swipe to see the message i just received is an unbelievable GIFT.  i dont miss ANY apps and have been able to sideload all of my favorites.

Thorsten Heins is my hero.  theyve done an amazing job rebuilding the OS that it was worth the wait.YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE.  super fast, the gestures are just so brilliant and make me realize how advanced it really is compared to all the other phones in the market.  if, however, you live your life on apps and have no patience for development time, or the latest fad software to secure your phone, then i suggest you keep your iphone instead.gmail, icloud mail, exchange mail all set up on my phone, come INSTANTLY.  no foolish waiting 15mins for the manual push like the iphone.  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, the LOVELY MESSAGE LIGHT when you get a message! its still there!  the blinking red goodness blackberry invented that i have ALWAYS MISSED when i left their phones!and lastly, THE EXPANDABLE micro SD compartment.  you can use the 64GB micro SD card for more storage.  iphone..can you?  nope.BLACKBERRY IS BACK and i couldnt be happier.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "10-tastic", "Author": "Ajay", "ReviewID": "RI6AJWS6AW2OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was Blackberry power user and went on to try various platforms like Iphone 4S/5, Galaxy Nexus and S3 while Blackberry was in transition to BB10. Al-tough the competing platforms were eye candy but a huge a let down when it comes to productivity - namely email (unified inbox), key boards, notifications, multi-tasking and finer nitty gritties that Blackberry is known for (example : bedside mode, message compression, attach photos in email with lowered resolution on the fly, exceptional reception, security etc). Last 2 years for me was painfull since I have been patiently waiting for BB10 that has the eye-candyness of other platforms combined with productivity features of good-ole Blackberries. Here comes the release and BB10 doesn't disappoint.The size, weight and tactile feel of the BlackBerry Z10 is a win for BlackBerry's designers and in an era where every smartphone vendor seems to be going towards bigger and bigger screens in an attempt to provide differentiation, the Z10 is perfect for single-handed use.The Z10 seemed to me to offer up crisper images than the other S3 and Iphone 5. Maybe that is because the Z10 tops the other two at 356 pixels per inch (ppi), compared to 306 ppi for the Galaxy S III and 326 ppi for the iPhone 5.Z10 has an 8-megapixel rear camera; however, the Z10 boasts a 2-megapixel front-facing camera , while the iPhone 5's camera is rated at 1.2 megapixels and the Galaxy S III's at 1.9 megapixels. All three have fast processors, with both the Z10 and Galaxy S III running the 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4. The iPhone 5 runs the Apple A6 processor. All three support LTE and up to 802.11n Wi-Fi.The Z10 offers NFC for file sharing and mobile payments, something the Galaxy S III also includes (but not the iPhone 5).BlackBerry Z10 is more than a piece of hardware - it has BB10 operating system that offers various services that add value to the overall user experience. Some of the cool Z10 features by BlackBerry are Story Maker, Remember, Balance, Hub and voice control and we would like to take a moment to discuss them as they add to the overall experience tremendously.The Hub acts as the single point for you to check all your updates, like new Facebook notifications, tweets, emails, LinkedIn messages, SMSs etc. If you want to open it, you just have to keep swiping towards the left of the screen till you cross the first menu page and task switcher. It is very easy to navigate and gives you options like posting new messages, emails and social network updates, depending on the service you are working on in the Hub.BlackBerry Balance is a feature aimed at corporate users who want to keep their work and personal lives separate - on their phone. It allows users to store apps and data on two distinct profiles - Work and Personal. Users can easily switch between the two profiles and users who bring their device to office can easily format the Work profile when they switch jobs without having to change any setting in the personal one.Call Quality is exceptionally good with HD voice and reception is better than Iphone 5 or Galaxy S3. Battery has improved by 30% after the first OS update (it better than S3 and more or less same as Iphone 5)The phone and OS looks much better in person than in photos or videos. Check it out at your local store and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful device -  a joy to use", "Author": "whitbags", "ReviewID": "RIBBTVDCU3YZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You know when you really like something when you pick it up when you don't need to just to get a kick out of the user interface. The gesture based UI on this device is just amazing.When I first picked it up in the store and had an App open I was thinking \"Err, how do I close this?\"  It was quite disconcerting, but I reckon it only took me around 5 minutes or so to get used to.  And now, everything with a screen I'm trying to swipe to navigate.  Just a beautiful and satisfying experience.One-handed use is a doddle, but it also works just wonderfully well with two hands too.  Actually two thumbs.  The size is pefect for both, which is an indication the screen size is just about right.  The typing experience is to die for, as the keyboard is magnificnet.  If you're sitting down - two thumbs, and boy it is QUICK.  If you're walking, then a single thumb and rely on the auto-correct.  You don't even need to type spaces - it puts them in for you if you forget.  Again that takes a little getting used to but once you have it dialed in, that convenience is superb.  What is even better, though, is the flicking words off the keyboard into a message.  That really tickles me.  You end up using a combination of all of these features which makes typing on this device a real pleasure.  You know how on most phones you go for short and sweet 'cos typing anything longer is a chore?  You just do not feel that way on this device.Apps.  Well there are now 100,000 in BB World.  That's a lot and thus far I'm not thinking where is...?  Amazon Kindle was released a couple of days ago - my most used App.The messaging hub with the 'peak and flow' thing.  It's another joy to use.  What is a phone really for?  Communications.  And this phone does it soooooo well.  The swipe up and then right gesture that takes you straight to your message hub is brilliant.  It is always on, a single gesture away, behind whatever you are doing on the device.  You're in the middle of a game and a message arrives.  You swipe up and right; the game you're in minimises and you can immediately see everything in your unified inbox.  Email, SMS, Twitter, FaceBook, Linked-In, WhatsApp, everything.  You can decide to go in and deal with your message there and then, or note that it can wait and go straight back to the game you were previously in.  And speaking of games, there are loads and the gorgeous screen on the Z10 is used to best effect.  If you're a bloke of a certain age (like me) you will have enjoyed the plastic Battle Ships board-game.  There is a Z10 version called War Ships; it is visually stunning and easy to play as you're walking along.

I like the Z10 a lot. Hub, flick typing, are awesome.  In fact, the Z10 blows away the iPhone with multitasking and flick typing. But, still use my iPhone because app selection for Z10 just not \"there\" yet.A MAJOR point for those of you who rely on Outlook for keeping your life organized: if you are accustomed to syncing your old RIMM device, or iPhone, with Outlook using a desktop USB connection, be warned that BB Link software that now comes with the Z10 (and Q10) (formerly BB Desktop Manager) DOES NOT To DATE HAVE TWO-WAY DESKTOP USB SYNC CAPABILITIES WITH OUTLOOK. Only recently did the BB Link software get updated with the capability of a 1 time transfer of contacts and calendar to Z10. This is not of much use for anyone with active business obligations.It is possible, as others have noted, to sync with Outlook if you use Outlook.com, and/or Gmail as well as other methods if your information is in the cloud. However, for those who keep contacts and calendar info on your desktop or laptop, and do not want your personal contact information in the cloud, where it is not encrypted, or backed by two-layer authentication, and you are not ready/comfortable making the transition to loading your personal information to any of these unencrypted cloud based systems, you may be very frustrated. They are not fond of the idea of Microsoft, or Google, etc, having access to that personal information.This issue is reported widely in the BB forums with > 10,000 views. Third party products are available for USB sync, but as of yet, still have glitches. One of the main features people like Blackberry, ie security, is the same reason they/you may not want this personal information in the cloud: if your email is hacked, so is your personal contact information and that of family, friends, etc.Unlike Blackberry Exchange Server, the Active Sync capability BBRY offers for this synchronization to Outlook.com is NOT encrypted.So, if you rely on two way sync with Outlook to manage/organize your life, setup/keep appointments, etc, you may want to wait until BBRY's BB Link software has two way sync, which is \"coming\".Otherwise the phone is great, but it was a real shocker to get this home and find out I could not sync with Outlook via USB as I've done for years. Neither BBRY nor sales reps are informing users about this limitation. Rating will change to 5 star once this is addressed.Just glad for now I can still sync to Outlook via USB with iTunes/iPhone so I have access to contacts and calendar on the go.I'm eager for this fix, but want to save others the potential disappointment of getting the phone home and seeing this limitation.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Z10 ROCKS", "Author": "FLAZZ", "ReviewID": "R1LM53YGRTV9J9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up a Z10 today and amazed so far by the amount of detail that went into the phone.

Barry", "ReviewID": "R14F31X9L38VQT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been an iPhone user from the very first day they were available, but I have never enjoyed typing on them.  As you can tell from any message you receive with the \"sent from my iPhone\" tag line, the process is incredibly error prone.  If writing on your phone is important to you, then you must try the Z10.The keyboard is a software triumph.As you start to type, the Z10 guesses what the most likely words will be that you want next and places them above the key for the next letter in each of those words.So for instance if you were entering the previous sentence, when you type \"a\" the words that appear are \"as\" above the \"s\", \"are\" above the \"r\", \"also\" above the \"l\" and \"and\" above the \"n\".  To select a word you just flip the key with the word above it with a short upward swipe, and the word goes into the display with a trailing space.  The process is made simple by the fact that if it has guessed the correct word, then that word will be above the next key that you plan to press, so you don't have to hunt for the word, it is right where you are looking.  Going back to our sentence, the next word we want is \"you\" and the Z10 has that ready for us above the \"y\", so one swipe gets us that word.  Now we want \"start\" so we touch \"s\", and find above the \"t\" the word \"still\" so we just touch \"t\" without swiping, and lo and behold above the \"a\" we have \"start\", and a single swipe gets us that word.When you have finished the sentence you will have done only 91 keystrokes for 165 characters, and almost certainly you have no mistakes!You have to try it to see how good it is and how it transforms the chore of entering text on a touch screen.  If you are holding off, waiting for the Blackberry with the physical keyboard, you should take a look at the Z10.  You may find that you decide not to wait after all.  I used to avoid sending emails from my iPhone unless I really had to, preferring to wait to get to my laptop.  I have no reservations about doing e-mails on the Z10.This review is really about the keyboard, but I can't finish it without saying how good the rest of the interface is.  It may take a few minutes to get the hang of the swipe gestures, but once you do, it is a joy to use, much more intuitive than the iPhone.  The interface is responsive and a great help to being productive.I have only given the phone four stars, because there are clearly things that it isn't so good at, or doesn't have yet, such as Bejeweled!  But this is only the first release of the software (actually there has been one minor upgrade already) and I am sure that features will be added just as they have been for the iPhone, and games and other third party software will be developed as the number of Z10s out there increases.If you are all about content consumption (movies, music, etc) and are wedded to iTunes and the Apple brand, then the reasons for you to switch are few, but if your work demands that the major function for your phone (other than actually being a phone, which the Z10 seems to perform admirably at) is as a mobile e-mail machine, then you owe it to yourself and to your productivity to seriously look at the Z10.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "BB is Back", "Author": "MJ", "ReviewID": "R1KF2YJ6CEP9ZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Blackberry user for the past 4 years or so. Over the years, Android and IOS have grown in stature and left Blackberry far behind. I decided to stay faithful to the brand and I am so happy that I did.For the last 6 - 7 months, I used a GS3 (company issued phone) in addition to my personal Bold 9900 and on occasion, I found myself picking up the S3 instead of the BB for browsing, social media and maps. The larger screen just made these experiences more pleasant.After months of waiting for the US release, I picked up my Z10 at the AT&T; store and I am absolutely in love with this phone. It is difficult to put into words just how buttery smooth the OS is in comparison to IOS and Android.The peek feature that I kept hearing about I thought would just be a gimmick. However, it is something I find myself using every time I pick up the phone. The experiences just quite simply \"flows\". The Hub is also any excellent feature which I am growing to love more and more. Being able to access all my messages in one central location by a simple gesture without having to go in and out of separate applications is a massive time saver and extremely convenient.Next up, we have the display. The display on the Z10 is nothing short of gorgeous. I have always been impressed with the display produced by the Iphone 5. Ladies and Gentlemen, the display on this phone is just as good if not better than the beautiful iphone 5 retina displayLastly, we have the keyboard. As I mentioned, I previously used the bold 9900 which is a physical keyboard. I worried about having to use a software keyboard full time considering the fact that I hated the keyboard on the GS3. The keyboard on the Z10 is just plain awesome. The word suggestions are extremely accurate and unlike anything I have seen on any other software keyboard. I believe this keyboard is as good as a software keyboard can get.The only drawback so far is the app support. There are a few key apps missing, However, I am sure with time they will all grace Blackberry world. In the mean time, the browser is so good that it can be used in place of the few missing apps.Overall, this is an excellent phone and one where you really have to use it to see its true power and potential. Blackberry is definitely back.

I waited until it came down in price before I got it, but I am very pleased with this phone.  This is my first full touchscreen phone, and I find the keyboard plus the \"flick typing\" word prediction to be great.  I don't find myself missing the physical keyboard of my BB Torch 9800 very often.  Every once in awhile I do miss the click of a physical keyboard, but certainly nor often enough to regret this purchase.  The phone is very slim, sleek, and a great size for one-handed use.  The UI is very smooth and I like how the UI slides about, it's hard to explain lol.  It like panes or slides that sort of are layered and slide over and flip over,  It's just really nice and smooth.  It uses Active Frames to allow multiple apps to run in minimized windows that you can tap to close or bring back up while the others stay minimized but running. The BlackBerry Hub is where all of your texts, emails, calls, twitter, facebook, and numerous other notifications and messages are found.  The Hub is very easy to customize, allowing you to pick what appears in the Hub.  The email is different from what I was used to with the old BBOS.  It's like the email is now fully merged, and all folders that you have on the account appear on your phone and you can file them away directly into the folder you choose and once I figured that out I grew to like it. I love the \"Peek and Flow\" feature so you can quickly glance at notifications and decide whether to deal with it right away or postpone it.  I can be using an app, get a notification, and with a few swipes and taps can delete, file, or reply to a message and jump right back into my app.  The app selection is nice, and is growing by the day, some of the bigger apps are not on here yet, but thanks to the Android player, some can be sideloaded and work decently.  I'm not that app-happy so it wasn't a huge selling point for me, but for email, texting, games, and basic phone usage, I am very pleased.  I haven't take many pictures as of yet, but the few I have taken have looked nice, low-light isn't all that great, but I think I'll live..LOL...there's also the Time Shift feature that allows to correct a closed eye or to catch just the right pose.

It learns your writing style and suggests words to help you type faster, if you were to type a few letter of a word it will complete the rest of the word and you can swipe up and it will appear in the text box.Now if you don't have time to type even with the best touchscreen keyboard every from blackberry.

My other phone is a Galaxy S4 and I've owned and used every iPhone and Nexus devices that has come out so far.So my thoughts on the Z10: - Build Quality:  Excellent with a nice understated executive look/feel to the device.  It feels fairly light, with the back cover material being soft touch with good grip. - Screen: Size is just about perfect (for me) for one handed use but still being big enough to enjoy the content.  Screen quality, resolution, and colors are all very good.- OS: REALLY good.  Fast, fluid, and intelligent.  Very easy to multitask, look at incoming messages, with a great search function that allows quick actions.  I really like not having \"soft\" navigation keys always present (like the S4) and much prefer the multitasking to iOS. - Apps:  Apps that are specifically built for BB10 are first rate and perform better than any other platform in my opinion.  Android ports (not side-load) from the BB World have all worked fine for me but I don't like the menu/navigation on them.  I've made it a point to buy/download apps that are identified as being built specifically for BB10 and those are very good. - App Selection:  Not as much of an issue as I though it would be.  There are so many excellent apps available that I don't really miss anything that I have on my S4 at the moment (this may change as I use it more).  Also, because I'm not defaulting to my normal apps it's making me look at alternatives that I am finding may be better.  This is very subjective and personal to my app tastes so take it with a grain of salt. - Camera:  Functionally the camera is very fast.  Takes pictures quickly with no lag.  Time-shift feature works as advertised and is very useful with kids.  Quality wise its not as good as my S4 or iPhone.  Indoor pictures so far have tended to be washed out and grainy but I also know that I'm not metering properly at the moment.  Over time I'll get used to where to spot meter for better results.  The built in editing features are excellent. - Battery Life:  Not great so far.  This one is hard to judge since I'm constantly fiddling with the device and trying out new apps/games.  I'm still finding my way around which apps/notifications kill the battery (even when its idle) so this one will take time to judge.  I will say that IT IS getting better as I normalize my use and it is not far off of a iPhone daily usage time at the moment (but not near my S4 or any Nexus I've had). - HDMI:  The HDMI connection to the TV is a very very good feature.  Being able to play games (kids love this) and browse the web when we need to look at things as a family has really been great.Overall I'm VERY impressed with this phone.  It just \"feels\" so much better to use than the other phones I've had.  Of course part of that is the fact that its brand new to me, so we will have to see how I feel after several months of use (when tech boredom/familiarity sets in).Too bad BlackBerry is having trouble moving these out the door and developers are not giving them the support.  It really is a great platform and communication device.  The new OS update (10.2) that is right around the corner will only make it better.

From the lockscreen, a simple down swipe will silence all notifications (optionally allow calls) and display a large orange clock with a black background. You can toggle the alarm and set the alarm time right from this display mode. When the alarm goes off you can tap, slap or mash anywhere on the screen to snooze.The form factor is great. Not too big, not too small. Sleek and clean with a feathery backplate. Fits in pockets well. The battery lasts a full day for me, of course usage will vary.High resolution screen. It has higher pixel density than the iPhone 5. No blurring or 'pixilation'. Colors are sharp and black is very nearly black.You can change volume/LED/vibrate light for each type of communication, e.g., email, text, calls. You can set custom ringtones or silent. You can set custom ringtones (or none) for individual contacts.The Hub is phenomenal for actually using your phone for, well, communications. No matter where in the phone you are - file browser, photos, browser - all your email and messages are a simple gesture away.The phone shipped with OS 10.0 and I experienced random reboots. About 2 weeks ago AT&T; released the 10.1 update and I have not had a single issue or reboot since upgrading.The integrated file browser is great for managing files on your phone. It has seamless integration with DropBox or Box.net and you can copy or move files between cloud hosting and the device. If you install BlackBerry Link (the desktop software) on your PC you can access all your computer files remotely.It is so convenient to compose an email while standing in line for lunch and attach a file that is ON YOUR DESKTOP COMPUTER. The rest of BB Link is rather lackluster and pretty laggy. Sadly (or not) it seems you need to have Link installed to access your phone as a removable drive via USB. If you have an SD card, you can access that without installing BB Link.However, you can set up wireless access to your phone and access all the files on your phone via WiFi from within your regular file explorer on your PC.Saving the best for last, the keyboard is beyond amazing. Every phone manufacturer claims to have the best touch keyboard, but I have never used a keyboard this good. It learns your words and replaces misspellings. It even lets you swear and remembers that you like to swear. So when you type 'ducking' it substitutes the word you meant. It's ducking awesome.I use the HDMI output to watch TV in bed and it works well. It has 2 output resolutions: full 1080p and 640x480. If your display doesn't support 1080p you will be stuck with an awful resolution. While HDMI is connected you can listen to audio from the phone or from the TV.Security: You can encrypt the entire device and optionally encrypt any SD cards. BB protect is an opt-in feature linked to your BB ID and lets you find your phone from your PC, ring it, set or change the device password and lock it. You can also display a message on the lockscreen if you do lose it, or even initiate a security wipe remotely.

But, Important FYI...", "Author": "BMoore", "ReviewID": "R1EKAC16OOAJG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, the bad:1. When I received my Z10, there was no new SIM card with the phone. I called up AT&T;, and they said that I didn't get a new SIM card because I was supposed to take the SIM card out of my BlackBerry Torch and put it in my new Z10. When I told them that my old SIM card was too large for the new phone, the phone rep said, \"Oh, yeah, we hear that all the time\". So, I asked the obligatory question as to why they don't fix the problem they are fully aware of by sending along a new SIM card to account-holders like me, and of course, she seemed puzzled that I would even ask that question. She then explained to me that I would have to get in my car and go to an Authorized AT&T; Retail Center (not a reseller, which are everywhere) and they would give me a new SIM card. Sigh.2. After getting a free SIM card, I set up everything myself, and it was easy. The transfer of everything was easy after I downloaded BlackBerry Link, setting up my 10 email accounts was easy, etc. However, immediate problem, I could only receive email - I couldn't send it. This was on all my accounts, not just a couple of those, and was on both POP3 and IMAP accounts. So, I went online, and quickly found out that a software update for my Z10 put out months ago was a fix for this problem. The Link software I had just downloaded was supposed to show me if my phone needed an update, but, it didn't. So, I went to the BlackBerry site, found the update, downloaded it, installed, and everything works perfectly now. But, once again, the question begs itself: Why was I shipped a phone one week ago that didn't have the update from MONTHS ago already installed? I guess these Z10 phones have been sitting in the warehouse for quite awhile. I guess that's why I only paid 1 cent for it from Amazon...3. If you loved having Google Maps on your previous BlackBerry (as I did), it is now gone. I downloaded a Google Maps application from BlackBerry that is made by a developer, not Google, and it works just fine. It costs $1.99, and is worth every penny.Now, the good:I love this phone in every way. The teething problems (problems that AT&T; and BlackBerry caused through inattention to their customer's needs) were a huge pain, and were making me very unhappy, but once I got it set up, this is a wonderful OS, and the phone itself is a very nice piece of hardware. I use an iPhone, which I dislike, and a new Samsung with the Android OS, which I like very much, and now I just want to use this Z10 all the time. This is a better phone and has a better OS. There is no point im reiterating all the good things said in these other positive reviews, point by point, so I won't. The summing up is this; I am pretty savvy in terms of smartphone technology and hardware, and I think this is the best phone on the market. Yup - my opinion, doesn't mean it's true for everyone, but it is definitely now my point of view.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "The direction Apple should have gone with IPhone 5", "Author": "C.

THE NEW BLACKBERRY IS AMAZING!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "RVM64UDPGNM27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start by disclaiming that reviewing a phone these days is more about the OS than the physical phone itself, so I will start by talking about the OS first, and then move on to the hardware itself below. If you're deciding between the Z10 and Z30, I give a few thoughts below on both, since I own both. I am also posting this same review for both the Z10 and the Z30, since it applies to both.First and foremost, and I wish BlackBerry made everyone aware of this:THE OLD BLACKBERRY IS INDEED DEAD!I emphasize this because most people don't realize this new OS is not in any way an *upgrade* to the old BlackBerrys; it is a COMPLETELY NEW operating system, with far more in common with Android, iOS and Windows Phone than the old blackberry. Except for one thing: it retains its focus on ease of communication and security. What does this mean? It means they took all the modern aspects of smartphone OS's and made them better! Did you know the new BlackBerry has the best web surfing experience of any smartphone? That's according to BGR, PhoneArena, TechRadar, etc. Now the Hub. Oh my, the Hub...Once you have used the Hub, anything else will seem clunky, outdated, inefficient and cumbersome. Why? Because anything else is indeed clunky, outdated, inefficient and cumbersome compared to the Hub. I predict the other OS's will eventually have an equivalent of the Hub, because it's just so much better than having to: open an app for texting; open an app for calls; open an app for gmail; open an app for yahoo mail; open an app for work email; open an app for WhatsApp; open an app to check voicemails; open an app for notifications; etc. In the Hub? Just swipe left once, and that's it. They're all there. Together. They are NOT merely notifications; the Hub is a conglomeration of all of those accounts (apps), together, or sorted by category with just one touch. You have to try it to really understand just how useful it is. And it's always just one swipe away.What I also find amazing is how bug-free the new OS is. I'm very picky when it comes to bugs. I simply cannot deal with Android, and even iOS got under my skin, but this OS has fewer bugs than both of those, despite the fact that it's brand new. Kudos to BlackBerry for that. (I'll admit my only experience with Windows Phone is with the Nokia 520, which was less than stellar, but is such inferior hardware that it wouldn't make for a fair comparison.)The apps: yes, for now, there are far fewer apps on this platform than others. Personally, I have everything I really need on this platform. I wish there were more Bank apps, but frankly, nowadays, the mobile sites are usually as good and even better than the apps anyway, so I use shortcuts to the mobile sites in my app screens for whatever is still missing. I don't buy a phone primarily for gaming, and most big name games are available, as well as thousands others, so I have all I need. I'm not a huge app user myself; I use my phone primarily as a work tool, and this phone has everything I need: DocsToGo is included (and works well); built-in integration of DropBox, EverNote, etc; a native File Manager; great communications as discussed above; the usual suite of apps like videos, music, pictures, calculator, tasks, lists, maps/navigation, weather, calendar, etc (basically all the same stuff as other platforms); as I said, pretty much everything I need and actually use. If there's an app you really need but is not available, BlackBerry OS 10.2.1 is capable of running most Android apps, and it is now a fairly easy process to load these onto your phone.Onto the hardware:The Z10 is a great device. Size is perfect for me (4.2\" screen), but that's really a personal preference. It feels good, looks great, and is extremely fluid in handling the OS and all apps. The one downside is the battery life, which is OK, but not great (1 to 1.5 day with average use). The advantage of the Z10 is that it has a removable battery, so you could pack an extra one with you to swap in if need be (kind of a pain though, better off using a battery pack like the BlackBerry Battery Charger Bundle, which is about the same size as a battery and can just power any microUSB device).I recently upgraded to the Z30, which has AMAZING battery life (3 days with average use, which includes web browsing, emails, phone calls, texting, streaming music, playing games, downloading, etc), although I'm struggling with the large size (5\" screen), and may go back to a Z10. The Z30, however, does not have a removable battery, but frankly, who needs it when the battery lasts that long anyway? The Z30 also has better speakers, but be warned that because of this, if you have good hearing, you may notice a slight hiss coming from the speakers when the phone powers the speakers in preparation for various sounds, which is normally inaudible on phones with inferior speakers. The Z30 can also act as a DLNA server, and OTG USB capability (which means you can plug in a flash drive directly to the phone, using a USB to microUSB cable). The Z30 will also be capable of playing the radio directly, when it gets the latest update released by BlackBerry, 10.2.1 (Verizon Z30 is currently on 10.2.0 as of this writing).They are both great phones. They both have good specs, but you will find phones with better specs out there, albeit they won't run better, because this OS is far more efficient and requires less power to run. Simple as that. For the average user, between the two, I think the only truly relevant differences come down to battery life and size. The Z30 has MUCH better battery life, but also has a significantly bigger screen. I love the battery life, I don't like the bigger screen.One final note: you may wonder, if these phones and the OS on them are so great, then why is BlackBerry not more popular since it released this new OS? Well, remember that line from Rain Man (the movie): \"K-mart is caca\"? That's pretty much what everybody thinks of BlackBerry now, because they lagged behind for so long until now, and their previous OS really did suck compared to the competition. Unfortunately, old perceptions are hard to change, and that's what BlackBerry is struggling with now. Most people still feel that way, because hey: they have NO IDEA that the new BlackBerrys are completely different, and that they are actually kick-a**, modern  smartphones now.Give it a chance; I don't think you'll regret it! Just look at actual consumer reviews of the phones everywhere! (Here, on Verizon, AT&T;, Sprint, etc...)

Gibson", "ReviewID": "RX9Q7VIWNI1TP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Z10 for about a month now. We've had all of the usual suspects in the house beforehand including Samsung Galaxy's, Iphones, and Blackberry legacy devices.  I personally used a Blackberry 9900 just before my upgrade and always appreciated that for its excellent business function as a primary communication device.  The QWERTY keyboard was probably what made me a holdout for so long since I could actually type without looking.  The unfortunate part was that I had always felt (like so many others) that the 9900 lacked anything that would make it a competative phone and appeal to the masses.Enter the Z10. I have to be honest that I was very reluctant to go with this phone (or any other touch screen device) because I'd loose that tactile feel.  Yes I missed it at first but after about a week, I was flying around on the Z10 about as quick as I was on the physical QWERTY.  The autocorrect is that good.  For example, I just finished typing a paragraph's worth of e-mail on the fly without checking for typos.  The predictive text only misspelled two words.  Unbelievable.Swipe gestures are unbelievably intuitive and become second nature after a short (talking like a day or two) learning curve.  In fact, there are so many shortcut commands that it's kind of fun discovering them for the first time.  Swipe from bottom to top minimizes your app into an active frame.  YOu can have up to 8 active frames running at the same time.  Swiping left and right will get you in an out of the hub or to scroll through your app pages.  Hold your thumb while swiping will allow you to peek ahead or behind.  Other gestures too to let you work in an out of apps.It's got a blazing fast browser, all the apps I could ever want and more coming in by the day.  The ability to sideload apps (I understand that OS 10.1 is Gingerbread compatible and the soon to be released 10.2 will be Jelly Bean) is a great feature.  Time shift is cool, the hub is a a very different and unique concept allowing you to either unify your inbox or indiviually select accounts or social feeds on the fly.  Peek is a very novel and convenient idea too.  Active frames are also very cool allowing you to minimize an app but keep it running, similar to Live Tiles.  For instance, shrink your picture album into an active frame and a little slide show rotates all of your files in miniature; a nice touch.No problems setting up POP, IMAP, Gmail, etc. etc. accounts other than a Roadrunner internet issue that was on their end, not Blackberry.  A quick phone call to service, a change to a port setting, and I was up and running.The bottom line for me is that I found so much to like about the phone that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  Is it perfect?  Of course not, no phone is.  Does it have some kinks?  Yes with a new platform, that's to be expected but I've already had a new OS update and another maintenance update all in the span of a month so, it's nice to know that the company is trying to make the phone the best there is.So is it better than IPhone or Android? That's a very subjective question because they all have their quirks.  I can tell you this, however.  The Z10 is just, different.  It flows seamlessly, as there's no closing in an out of apps or in and out of texts/emails/social feeds.  Traditional phones, you get a notification and you might open up your e-mail app or text app, you then read your e-mail, you close your e-mail or move onto another and you might close the e-mail app.  With the Z10, nothing is wasted. You swipe into the hub, read your e-mail and then swipe out of it. If you're in an app, like say Facebook, and you get a text, you can swipe right into the hub (make a gesture like an upside down \"L\") and the Z10 will automatically minimize the app and go into the text.  Facebook's still running in an active frame and is just waiting for you to finish up with the boring work stuff. Very very cool.More to like, swappable SDCard, drag and drop PC files (the phone shows up like a harddrive), great camera, HDMI, and, did I say, keyboard?In short, if you are a Blackberry fan, you will love this phone.

But For How Long?", "Author": "John A. Bertels", "ReviewID": "R2XPO30CPBLA5X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The BlackBerry Z10 is an innovative entry by RIM to the current smartphone market. The clever BlackBerry Hub is worth its weight alone and puts e-mails, phone calls, texts and notifications all in one place for the user to view.  Having owned a BlackBerry Curve previously that was not only outdated but ceasing to function in its old age, I was primarily interested in e-mail, call quality and a browser.  Sure, it's nice to have some useful applications for the phone but the core of what I need is there, e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.  Frankly, I don't have the time to sit there, downloading useless phone apps that will only drain the battery more quickly. Now, about the phone:**************Thumbs up!!****************************-The BlackBerry Hub!!-The swipes/gestures took a little getting used to, but the process was manageable.  The software is intuitive and easy-to-use, once gotten used to.-The keyboard also takes getting used to. Basically, one has to type with the very tips of the fingers in order to make comprehensible words. At first, it took quite a while to complete one sentence, but I am now used to it.  I will profess that I did not initially care for going from a physical keyboard to a virtual one, once I had actually experienced the process with the latter.-Receivers of calls on the other end report that the quality is clear, however, I have not heard for myself.-Excellent dial-pad feature when manually dialing a number. The numbers were large, clear and easy-to-read. When ending a call, the phone dial-pad reappears, making it easy to do by simply pressing \"End Call\".-Excellent-sounding speaker (which I would not use, anyway). I finally had the chance to transfer music via BlackBerry Link and the sound quality of the speaker is very good.**************Thumbs down!!****************************-My initial experience with the \"out-of-box\" experience was not stellar.  The phone prompted me to download the version of the OS that had a built-in problem.  I could not open/read/send texts or open attachments. All well and good until I was told to re-apply the update via BlackBerry Link.  For a long while, I had a problem with installing the BlackBerry Link software on my laptop, until I could figure out how to get the laptop to install .NET Framework 4.0, which is required by BlackBerry Link.  I eventually solved that but the resolution of the problem and actual installation of BlackBerry Link took forever.-At times, the phone is overly sensitive and opens the camera or some other window on its own. I sometimes see the camera activated on the phone after setting it down and am just puzzled. I suppose that one has to be tremendously careful and handle the phone by the edges, lest one obliviously start snapping photos of the immediate vicinity.-The Hub periodically freezes and can't be scrolled through. A manual shutdown/restart of the phone is necessary.-At least once every few days, the Hub freezes on a Visual Voicemail and also forces a manual shutdown/restart of the phone. This is particularly annoying.-Reconciling between the phone and the mail servers is slow.-This phone is a battery \"eater\".  Without heavy usage and simply just incoming e-mails, the phone has to be charged daily.  Opening an app such as Facebook and leaving it an open state greatly accelerates the frequency  that the phone has to be charged. Same goes for the Weather icon, but to a lesser extent. I just leave them closed now and open them when I need to. Too much fuss and bother, otherwise. I had also read forum posts by other users about apps that drain the Z10's battery very rapidly.  Can't compare it to the iPhone or Galaxy, but I think it could be a weak point of the BlackBerry.-The Voice Assistant character appears by the \".\" period character on the virtual keyboard. While composing an e-mail, the Voice Assistant dialog box annoyingly popped up when accidentally touching the character/icon. Typing a \".\" period requires a dainty finger.Overall, this is a great phone. The BlackBerry Hub is an innovative feature that makes it worthwhile, despite the 1.5 months to straighten everything out and point things forward.Frankly, I don't need to spend countless hours, downloading useless apps....but the real question here is, can BlackBerry get a share of the app market for those that ARE seeking those enhancements?  Also, prices of this phone have plummeted.

Before I was 100% against all-touch device b/c of the terrible input with text/email composing, however the z10's flick texting is bar none the best keyboard on the market- -- it even keeps marks with the q10 physical keyboard because what it lacks in feel, it makes up for in function by actually previewing what you are going to want to type. It is truly amazing, and I actually miss it. However, I am not going back because in the end, the q10 does everything the z10 does in about 60% of the size, and for me that is the determining factor; I have to be able to comfortably carry my phone in my front pants pocket otherwise its not the right phone for me.

If you do experience this issue, you need to contact AT&T.; For anyone with an older Blackberry, you can get paid for trading in your older Blackberry for a newer model. Check out the link below.[...]Switching devices is simple. There are apps that can be installed on iPhones and Android phones from [...] The same app can be downloaded from Blackberry World. There are multiple ways to move your data from an old Blackberry to the Blackberry Z10.The Blackberry Z10 is a great for business and leisure. The Blackberry Flow allows me to navigate smoothly and quickly in between tasks with one hand. It is easy to quickly minimize an app and start a new one. I can minimize the NFL Mobile app and open the StubHub app with my thumb. The Blackberry Hub is a centralized location for messages and is always easy to get to with one or two gestures. It is easy to switch between text messages, e-mails, calls, etc. from the hub. The smart keyboard and gestures help me quickly type what I need, so I can get back to performing other tasks. When typing, I do not need to press a button to switch between text and symbols. I can just swipe a finger up or down the keyboard. The words that the smart keyboard predicts are very accurate and easy to flick up into my sentences. Once you learn the right gestures, it is easy to delete multiple e-mails. When I'm ready to lock my device, I can just press the power button at the top of the device and the screen provides me an option to lock the device.The browser is smooth and fast, especially in the 4G LTE areas. Adobe Flash and private browsing can be enabled in the browser. Video clips from any website can be viewed. The browser supports HTML5. I can open multiple tabs and save my favorite pages as bookmarks. The reader feature puts the text and graphics from the website in an enlarged and easy to read format. The best way to describe the reader feature is to say webpages are converted into a e-book format.  Google Maps is accessible through the browser.  It is easy to share webpages from the browser with the share icon, which is available from most screens on the Blackberry.I love the voice control feature on my Blackberry Z10. If I do not have time to look at the Blackberry and type, I can use the voice control feature to make a call, send an e-mail or text, schedule an appointment, search the internet and take notes.I love that the Blackberry Z10 has Near Field Communication (NFC). It was already easy to share information with the Blackberry Z10 via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE), e-mail, text message, BBM, HDMI and Skype. I can also share files from my Blackberry Z10 by tapping another Blackberry 10 or any NFC enabled device. Unfortunately, you cannot tap and share with your friends that have the expensive iPhone 5S because the iPhone 5S does not have NFC.The Blackberry Z10 has a built-in screen shot feature, so there is no need to download a third party app. Capturing a screen shot on a BlackBerry Z10 device is simple as holding both the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until you hear a shutter sound. The screen shots will be saved in the camera picture gallery.The cameras are great. The Blackberry Z10 quickly takes beautiful pictures with either of the two cameras. The time shift mode allows me to find the best facial expression from those memorable moments. I enjoy using my Blackberry Z10 to Skype with family and friends. I like that I can switch between my two cameras during the Skype video call.The BlackberryZ10 is great for listening to the music stored on my Micro SD card.  Of course, I have albums from artist like Alicia Keys and Gyptian on my Blackberry.  I used my music on my media card to make my ringtones. My Blackberry Z10 can play music using earbuds or through any of my vehicles' sound systems.  Blackberry Z10 has Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) with aptX(tm) enabled, so sound is exceptionally great via bluetooth.  I can also download TuneIn Radio from Blackberry World to listen to local and international radio stations from my Blackberry Z10.Parents will like that the Blackberry Z10 has built-in parental controls, so there is no need to download a third party app. Parents can set a password to access the parental controls, so that the children cannot change them. Phone and text messages can be limited to just the individuals in the contacts. Parental controls allow parents to turn off features like the camera and video, Facebook, Twitter, uploading to YouTube and purchase content just the name a few. Content restrictions can also be set.My Blackberry Z10 has many other security features. My Blackberry Z10 makes it easy to encrypt the data on my device and my Micro SD card. If my Blackberry Z10 is ever stolen, Blackberry Protect allows me to track or wipe my Blackberry from a remote location.The Adobe Reader app is great. It allows sharing via e-mail, BBM and NFC. I can navigate the PDF by using the bookmarks. I can zoom in and out of the text and images. I can even enter comments, signatures, highlight and strike through text and click hyperlinks. My changes are saved automatically upon exiting the document. It is great for conducting business on the go.  Blackberry 10 devices have a built-in zip file feature that allows me zip files, which is convenient when I need to attach multiple large files in an e-mail.The phone call quality is great on the Blackberry.  They phone has many features available from the phone app, such as dial pad, phone history, voicemail and contacts.  The dial pad has large keys and is available when I need to use it with an automated system.  It is easy to switch between phone, speaker and Bluetooth.  These options are available during the call.There are two minor things I think you should note. There was not a holster included with the Blackberry Z10, so you will need to purchase your own. The Password Keeper did not come with the OS, but it can be downloaded from Blackberry World.For the Blackberry Haters:Blackberry and Blackberry devices will be around for a long time. People counted Blackberry out before they really tested the new Blackberry 10 devices.  Blackberry is known for its security, which is probably why BlackBerry was awarded \"Authority to Operate\" on U.S. Department of Defense networks. Blackberry will retain its reputation for secure Blackberry devices and software for managing and securing mobile devices. Do not go to sleep on Blackberry. In the future, Blackberry may provide means for the auto industry to manage car software.[...][...][...][...][...][...][...][...]It is funny people complain that Blackberry does not have enough apps.

The BlackBerry Z10 is truly an amazing device, and this is coming from someone who made fun of Blackberry fanboys for years. I have been a Palm user through several generations, up to the HP Veer and Pre2, and have loved webOS as the most intuitive and fully integrated cloud computing OS in the mobile world. When my Veer started to age, I tried our the iPhone5 for several weeks, but could not get any speed or accuracy on the virtual keyboard. I thought I was going to have to go back to the physical keyboard world, but when I went to check out the Q10, the 5-star rating for the Z10 caught my eye. Review after review of not only long-time Blackberry users, but died-in-the-wool IOS and Android users as well were proclaiming it the best cell-phone ever. A bit dubious, I was able to secure a loaner unit, and I quickly learned there was some serious substance here. Blackberry has re-invented the smartphone.My business is a people business, so my interactions with clients and partners is the focus of my work day. I am out of my office for much of the day, so I need to track my interactions of every type, and keep up on what everyone is doing. The Hub is an amazing tool for that. To be able to swipe right from any screen and see all your incoming and outgoing interactions is a gold mine to me. To further be able to click on a contact and see our interaction history, along with aggregated, up-to-date information and statuses from FaceBook, LinkedIn, etc. is invaluable.Then there's the coup de grace: the keyboard. I feel like I've died and gone to heaven! The longer I use the keyboard, the better it adapts to my writing style, vocabulary, stock abbreviations, etc., and offer suggestions that hover above the keys I could possibly hit next. If a suggestion is correct, I simply flick the word up into my document, email, text, etc without typing. There are times I flick 7 or 8 words in a row without typing a single character. The longer I use it, the more often that happens. There is no question I can write much faster on the Z10 keyboard than on a physical one, and it just keeps getting better. It even keeps track of where my fingers land when typing each letter. If I frequently mistakenly hit the \"i\" key when I intend to hit \"o\", BB10 keeps track of that and migrates the sweet spot for \"o\" so it's closer to the \"e\"...amazing!I am a pretty straightforward user, but the customization depth and granularity of BB10 is amazing, as others have noted.

I'm going to give you MY perspective as simply as I can put it, with things that stand out immediately, as if I were telling a friend who is thinking of buying a z10.Love:1. The OS. It's fluid, it's definitely revolutionary where Apple is dropping the ball. Not having to worry about buttons, and relying on gestures is BY FAR the best way to navigate any electronic device until we can get to the mid-air controls as seen in Minority Report.2. The Camera. I really like it. It certainly has its flaws, but I think it's pretty spot on. I took some nature shots of different grasshoppers out in the country, plus some really awesome scenic shots. With the BUILT IN editing (brightness, saturation, red-eye correction, sharpness, etc.), I was able to make those pictures sing and wow anyone I displayed them to. I was enjoying my BB photos so much that I started Dropboxing them (using the pre-loaded \"Connect to Dropbox\" app) to upload them to Instagram via my old iPhone. It's got some Instagram-ish filters that aren't too shabby as well, but they're not great either and pretty limited. I can't tell you about low light situations however, as most of my shots have been taken in decent lighting.3. Battery life. When I first got the phone, battery life was awful. After discovering a tip to lower the screen brightness, battery life improved significantly, tho I'm not sure why the sensor for brightness wasn't more adequate for this sort of situation. Regardless, battery life is pretty solid for me to enjoy all the things you get out of a smart phone, plus I could easily buy a second battery if I wanted to ramp up my activities and swap, something I couldn't do with my iphone.4. The keyboard. Very solid keyboard. Typing is a breeze. Though I didn't notice a *remarkable* difference over my iphone keyboard experience, it's a fantastic keyboard. Swiping up to select a specific word isn't as fast as typing it out, but I'm sure that benefits users with lower wpm speeds than myself. A critical note here though: the internal dictionary has an unbelievable amount of omissions. I feel like a moron having to type legitimate, normal english words into Google to make sure I'm indeed spelling a word that exists.5. Multitasking. It multitasks like a beast! Youtube videos even play in the background while I'm doing things in other parts of the phone. You rarely miss a beat on BB10.6. Contacts. It has some facets to Contacts, like an activity stream that shows all of the ways you've been in contact with a specific person, and a feature that will autopopulate the latest news on that contact's company (if it exists) to a feed in the contact app. That is some excellent streamlining to make doing business so much easier. Don't remember what that customer said a few text messages ago that was so important to know before this call? It's right there in the \"Activity\" feed. Need to have something to say about their organization before you call? It's right there under \"Updates.\" Neat feature for sure. Integrates with Facebook well and adds their profile picture as the contact photo, which of course you could change if you felt necessary.Hate:1. The app store and Blackberry's manipulation. There are plenty of stories on the net implying that they essentially turned their cheek toward a specific app developer, whose programs make up an entire third of the apps available on BBWorld. Most of them are just junk copies or derivatives of other apps the developer has made and they completely pollute the store, which already fails to make discovery easy with its haphazard choice of categories. It does, however, give them the ability to continue touting all those thousands of apps. It's just a far cry from Apple's app store. I've had the phone since April, and still, so many amazing apps I at least expected to be buzzed about coming to the platform will probably avoid this sinking ship altogether. I'm not a gamer, but productivity is a necessity, since I'm an entrepreneur. Considering BB caters to business users, never thought a lack of solid productivity/business apps would be a problem... boy was I surprised. Even Evernote skipped over a full blown app for the lackluster \"Remember\" app built into the OS that syncs with Evernote, but doesn't hold a candle to the real deal. Such a shame. Such a pitiful shame from this company.2. Text messages do weird things. Sometimes they don't send for no apparent reason even when you have LTE service or Wifi. I had a close friend with an iphone that would swear he was sending me messages that I was not receiving. I didn't seem to have this issue with other iPhone users, but for some reason his phone in particular was just not getting along with mine at all. There is also a pretty noticeable lag in switching threads or even typing a new message while the phone is sending a message. Negligible, but pretty aggravating when you require rapid-fire correspondence.3. Lots of tips and tricks to make common processes with the phone easier, but you have to do the footwork yourself. The best example I can give of this was when I became frustrated that there was no button on the side menu in the primary browser that would send you back to the top of a web page. Ugh! You mean I have to scroll up?? Finally I became so frustrated that I did a Google search to see if I was missing something. Found out through a Crackberry forum (bless them) that a tap of this tiny little bar up top, when it was there at least, would fire me back up to the top. It took months before I learned that trick, yet it was apparent in iOS almost out of the box. I also had the same problem for \"Mark All Read.\" Why they didn't just tell me up front how I could do such a thing when it's obvious the hub is going to be loaded with tons of notifications, since that's what it was designed for, just baffles me. This was actually the perfect opportunity to have BlackBerry 10 specialists in places like Best Buy, the same way they have specialists for Samsung phones, to show you all sorts of neat tricks, shortcuts and things you could do with your phone... and yet we've been left with having to crawl forums and Blackberry's sites. Sheesh. It's like they don't even TRY to engage with their customer beyond digital evangelism.4. I hate that I was willing to give up life on the iphone, my unlimited data that has now faded into history due to my switch, my precious productivity apps, and itunes for $200 and just a few months later, the phone is basically being given away for free. Wow. Since I've been on iphone for years and purchased the two I owned at the new release date, I never knew what that feeling was like. To see your investment snuffed like someone's savings in a Ponzi scheme, just depressing.5. The Facebook app is awful. Like it or not, Facebook is becoming a legitimate way to conduct business and connect with customers, no matter the size of your business. It's one thing if I used it only for personal reasons, but there are certainly business needs that I depend on the site for. Uploading a photo of a new campaign for one of my clients one day was one of the most frustrating experiences ever. For whatever reason, it kept uploading without the text I had typed nor the links. Being on the go, and on a deadline, this was a major snafu for me. I even tried uploading through the site via the browser, which was futile in a whole different way.Ultimately, I'm on the fence concerning a recommendation. I truly want others to experience the fluidity of a button-free OS, but I just can't justify the lack of care concerning the app store, and how instructions are communicated to improve the user experience. Judging from the price drop and the signals that upper management has been sending, they're going to abandon this phone soon. Not completely, but enough to make it a trivial pursuit for a customer switching from Android or iOS. I truly believed in this phone and left my unlimited data on iPhone behind because of it. I ignored a warning from a close friend who works in the phone industry and even the sales rep at the AT&T; store who tried to steer me from buying it. Now I feel a bit robbed honestly. Certainly a great device, but it has too many crucial flaws that keep the gap between the BB10 devices and Droids and iPhones that I just don't see Blackberry addressing or even planning to address.

(Apple comes in 2nd but only because due to it's glass and metal body weighing it down) Z10 is excellent, and the only thing I complained about Z10 during the period I owned it was the size. It seemed a bit too narrow for us power users, coming from 9700 and now using 9900, I felt cramped trying to hold it and type it with two hands. I believe the upcoming Z30 will address this issue.  I will not go into detail of what is great about this phone, it has been said in other reviews, it's really an excellent device overall.The other problem was the bandwidth, if you are traveling and using this phone with roaming data, be prepared to pay ten-folds of what you paid with BES on OS 7.1 device. I used over 2 GB in 2 weeks while I barely go over 300MB with my existing plan on AT&T;, and this is when I stream music, when I don't I am not over 100mb/mo. This is invaluable to those who travel. Sadly BB10 eliminated BES completely and due to this it is causing a bit headache.. If you do not care about that or don't travel much, then that's fine. You can always use wifi or bring your OS7 device when you travel. This is not any worse than any other platform.If anyone is considering a BB10 device and coming from Apple or Android or WM, I think they are in for a very pleasant surprise, it is an excellent device with great features right out of the box. If you are an app junkie, then stick to Apple or Android, because you won't even find Google Maps running on BB10 (at least not natively, but in about 2 minutes you can side-load the Android version). While you can side-load almost any android application to BB, it is a matter of compatibility and full functionality because it won't run \"native\" this means if there are submenus/pages/etc you won't be able to use the swipe gesture to navigate, etc.. But it still runs unless it is a very complicated app that requires camera, microphone, storage, etc all free to the app. Coming from OS 7.1, I don't think 10.0 or 10.1 will satisfy most power users, you will run back to your older BB device. Hoping that 10.3 fixes the BBOS, making Z10, Z30 or Q10 all great devices, I am sticking with BB.There are major shortcomings with the new Blackberry email platform, which relies on Active Sync instead of BES or BIS, actively making BB just another Android with a better \"email app\", but it still does not solve very severe issues that AS brings with it. I did not use 10.2, so I cannot comment if the new release will fix it when it finally gets deployed but when you receive an e-mail and reply to the e-mail on your BB, you do not get a \"replied\" indicator on your Exchange server, so exchange server does not reflect that on your Desktop. When you finally get to work and an all your emails are synced with Exchange server, you get bunch of e-mails, they all have been read, but you can't tell which ones you replied to.. Obviously Exchange and Outlook can tell you replied when you hit \"Reply\" and it tells you you are not responding to the latest in the thread, but it is missing the \"replied indicator\" that little arrow.Another issue is, if anyone is like me in a business environment, we rely on carrying all our contacts with us, and within contacts we have groups/categories. Some may categorize customers, competitors, personal, territory, etc.. even Custom categories. Sadly BB10 does not support categories within contacts, not only that, it goes so far that it removes your categories when you edit a contact. Basically it removes ALL fields from your contact and send back only the fields supported by BB/ActiveSync. Now, I understand this is not BB's fault, and I saw the same thing when I used TouchDown on Nexus, but at least it was able to gray-out the fields that were not editable but still displayed them. BB and MS needs to fix this.Sadly, BB10 does not offer charging terminals at the bottom of the phone, so you cannot use a charging pod anymore, I wished they focused on wireless charging when they removed the terminals.For more you can check Blackberry N.A Official Support Forums' 500 page topic with a list of hundreds of features missing from BB10 that was available in BB7.1 and earlier (still, non of them are available in iOS or Android anyway), but as a final point, I would like to say that BB10 is a great device and people who use their phone for daily work and do not need advance functionality should go with Blackberry, because it just runs and gets the work done very fast, not as fast as OS7, but a whole lot faster than any other platform out there.

I could multi-task easily thru the screens. Since I never had a home button before, the lack of one on this phone was not an issue for me. So, I ordered the phone and received it with great anticipation. From the onset I experienced nagging OS/apps issues. I experienced Outlook setup issues that were ultimately resolved thru 3rd tier support @BB. The service was excellent, I must say. Fixed my situation 100%. Other apps I wanted on my phone were not yet available, namely Spotify and Skype, among others. I knew that going into it, but was willing to wait for app development to catch up to the new OS (there has been a Skype app ported into Android-I didn't feel like undertaking the workaround fix. I just want to download and go).  I wrestled mightily with keeping the phone or returning it to AT&T.; I ultimately chose to return the phone for an iPhone 5. I just didn't want to hassle with the occasional OS freezes and lack of apps. This all occurred in June, and it appears I am not alone. Had the BB Z10 handset had the same trouble-free operation of the iPhone and at least the mainstream apps I was looking for I would have happily kept the phone. Absent that I wasn't interested in wading thru the glitches of an initial roll-out. Best wishes, Blackberry. I hate to see a once great tech company eg. Kodak or Polaroid fall by the wayside.

Many are complaining that Z10 Freezes a lot, especially when using AppsAs I am evaluating Smartphone cause I am planning to upgrade from my old iphone 3gs (almost 4 years old) I am evaluating Smartphone based in blackberry, iphone, android and windows 8. That is why due to hype about this device, I initially considering buying BB10 Z10 tried many times to test it and see its worth. My budget is between 500 to 800 dollars. As I am reading reviews, trying the product myself and even went to blackberry website about Z10 complaints well there is a lot of them mostly operating system, hardware and software related. One thing that's get my attention is the blackberry Z10 having no home screen button, this is important because since many of blackberry apps are not develop and optimize for its operating system but is originally for android if the apps freezes (Due to bugs or outdated software) there Is no way for a user to go back to the home screen but to reset the Z10. Since this is most likely to happen a lot of times as the apps really not optimize for new blackberry operating system resetting devises and waiting for it to boot is very stressing. The maps for Z10 is useless my wife has the old BB7 and she hated it, her company provides it so she has no choice, but this year her company is pilot testing iphone so maybe this year or next year they will convert. I think blackberry should lower the prize of Z10 to less than $100 for the consumer to get fair price since you can most likely use Z10 or Q10 for texting, instant messaging, voice and internet browsing. Close to $700 for Z10 is very expensive considering that you can buy old iphone and android phone with the same capability plus good ecosystem, good popular apps are available and gadgets integration for less than $100. Do you know that you can get iphone 4 and 4s for free if you sign a two year contract with the carrier? This is much better than paying $200 for Z10 with poor selection of apps, close to isolated ecosystem, face with a lot of bugs since it has the new operating system and softwares, dismal apps developers support etc. One more thing, this blackberry phone same as the old one is difficult to dispose cause you can't sell them or give it to your kids they will not accept it and you will end up throwing wasting monies, this may holds true with this Z10, no apps developers support, no big hi tech company backing/supporting it most likely this new operating system will be gone just like the others.

I am sharing my review and research so that others will not waste money buying expensive smartphone. For now I believe considering the future direction of modern technologies like good ecosystem, integration, device manufacturers support it is better to buy smartphone based in apple IOS, google android and Microsoft windows 8.
