I like it alot.", "Author": "MLA", "ReviewID": "R1HJKQACJPFROO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I downgraded, I found I have no actual need for a smartphone.  And I hate the touchscreen, I found.  I digress....Bought this the end of August 2011, after lots of looking and research and Cnet reviews among others.  I really like it a lot.  It is cute and compact and does what I need.  The hybrid qwerty is awesome and just as easy as full.  Great call quality and love that I can create and use my own ringtones with the voice memo option!  Goodbye 1.99!  LOLMy cons that have not allowed me to say; I LOVE this phone are just annoyances, to me;1.  This phone has the shortest battery life of any phone I have ever had.  I charge nightly now.  not a major deal)2.  The text message inbox - man I am not all into deleting at all, my e-mail has like 50,000 e-mails in the inbox. LOL.  It holds only 40 inbox texts then tells you to empty.  While my outbox will have 120+ at the same times.  again no major deal)3.  2 out of 10 times, if I am replying to an e-mail on the Blast, when I am in the middle or nearing the end......the phone reboots, no warning!  And no, the phone version of my yahoo does not auto save to draft every minute or so.  So, that is a huge WTH Grrrr, at that moment.The camera is not bad at all, for a phone.  I have a nice digital camera, as most do for those needs, but, do not carry it 24/7 so in a pinch - no complaints.I do text a lot, call a lot (gave up landline a few yrs ago), FB, e-mail, and light web on the Blast and it is all good so far for what I need!  If anyone who reads this can tell me how you download that better browser, can not recall name at the moment, I would appreciate that, but again - no major deal!I do know this Blast T729 made its debut a few yrs ago, but for me got better ratings than some newer 'basic' phones and have always had great luck with Samsung and Motorola myself.

Has good sound quality on songs and while on the phone. Microphone is good too.this phone feels solid and doesn't feel loss when the sliding motions yup and down. And love the design of this phone as well.

Appreciate the price and it arrived in a timely manner. It's the phone itself. I need to upgrade and get a phone where I don't have to press the screen (wears out) - maybe a flip phone.

It says it has a Querty keyboard.  This keyboard is terrible.  Each letter does not have its own key, instead its much like using a regular number pad.  Very cheap.  If you want an inexpensive phone that doesn't do much and you don't ever text, it might work for you.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "RKLW7RLANS6DJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone back in 2007, and it lasted me for 3 years, and its still alive, at the time period this was a cool little innovated phone, it was not very expensive, and other then the black berry and side kick this was the closest thing you were going to get for a qwerty style keyboard through t-mobile, even tho it was 2 letters per button, it still made it easier to text with besides doing that whole 123 BS, because you only hand to hit each button once and it would figure out what you were spelling or gave you a list.Despite what people say about the battery life, i did extreme texting with this thing, with its small out and inbox due to lack of internal memory, emptying my in and out box 7-8 times a day, my battery still lasted me 5-6 days before i hit my last bar to put it on the charger, with having Micro SD slot, it still would have been nice if it let you flood your messages on there, it would have probably gave you another day on your battery life, but the Micro SD card slot was just to put music and pictures on to and off of the phone, which was cool, meaning i didn't have to buy ringtones or wallpapers!all and all with me this phone went through hell and back, and still works, even tho i moved on to a new phone in 2010 (the samsung gravity touch) which you could almost say is the blasts distant relative of messaging phones. but that's another review. if you are looking for something simple, buy this phone, learn it and you will love it (make sure you have a sim card) even tho im long moved on from the samsung phone line, im giving the HTC mytouch 4g slide. a chance. but this blast was is still in my top 3 favorite phones out of the 11 phones ive had since 2006", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "not a blast with my Blast", "Author": "mazdagirl73", "ReviewID": "R1JYBUVTAUQPGQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Maybe this was \"the bad one\" in the batch, but I didn't even have the phone for a month and without dropping it at all and very gentle use just for calls and texting it suddenly turned off and never came back to life.  I researched several phones and just needed something simple and I admit I loved the phone, but sadly I got attached just when it turned off twice in a week and on the last time, I gave up and returned it, fortunately I did get refunded.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "BLAST????", "Author": "DKenkel", "ReviewID": "R6KP0ECQOL7UD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased the Blast to replace the Gravity phone I bought less than a year ago. The Gravity phone's touch screen would not work properly if I got even mildly sweaty or if it is raining making the phone not usable. Having purchased extra 110 volt adapters and car adapters I decided to go with the Blast since it appeared that the Blast used the same mini USB port for charging. IT DOES NOT SHARE THE SAME CHARGING ADAPTERS. So now I have to have dual adapters since my wife still uses her Gravity phone.The GOOD. The Blast phone is nice and compact. Call quality is fine. It has real keys to dial which even work when slightly wet.The BAD. The different adapters needed. The battery lasts for 2 or 3 days if not using bluetooth. It lasts about a day if using bluetooth. The keyboard is modeled after the blackberry keyboard with the keys sharing duties. I find this more difficult than the keypad method of entering text. It will only use 2 gig or less memory cards and nothing is mentioned in the owners manual about this aspect. When a memory card is installed you CANNOT use it as the default saving place for photos, videos, files, etc. When using the camera the phone always asks where to send the picture, which causes a longer wait to be able to take another picture. I end up closing and opening the phone to reset the camera.Based on my experience I do not think I would ever purchase another Samsung phone at any price.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap", "Author": "Dire_Wolf", "ReviewID": "RHY2NNVWZ6292", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is very light weight and is very flimsy, feels more like a kids toy than a phone.  The sliding mechanism doesn't work well well.  The movement of the sliding mechanism feels like it is plastic on plastic, very weak spring.
