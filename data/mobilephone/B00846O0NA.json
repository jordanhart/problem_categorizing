{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I need a working phone", "Author": "mark s mirek", "ReviewID": "RXP2VKLH6EQ1E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I'm trying to dial a number the phone shuts off. Also, I put it in my pants pocket, turned on and take it out, turned off. I am sure I charge it whole day, every day, and I use it very, very, very little, so I'm not giving the battery any hard time, whatsoever. The battery shows that it's fully charged, too. The phone has a solid flip case so there is no possibility of my pushing any buttons when I'm not using it; it just turns off by it's self. I need a phone for basic communications about what to get in a grocery store or just in case of an emergency. But this phone isn't even good for those things. I have to get a new phone, now. I wish I can have my money back for this utter lemon.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00846O0NA"}}
