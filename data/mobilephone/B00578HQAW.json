{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quite an amazing phone device", "Author": "ActionAndAdventure!", "ReviewID": "R2PK8CEY3S4SXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only owned the Samsung Infuse 4G (using ATT) for a few days, but it is truly an impressive device. I would strongly recommend it to anyone considering a top-line smart phone. Period.My smart phone history is (recently) six Dell Streak 5s (which is an amazing device, but with a few flaws), a Blackberry Bold 9000, and temporarily (recently) an LG540.Samsung Infuse is a beautiful phone. Vivid display (clearer and larger than any similar smart phone), logical functionality (16 Apps per page that scroll sideways), and the flexibility of Android.It's capacitive touch screen works very well, and the onboard memory (and capacity to upgrade) is excellent.The only weak point is the battery, but I've only had the device for days and it's not quite fair to criticize quite yet. However, having said that, it seems that if you allow all manner of back-ground programs to run (which is what will happen - unless you intervene), that you may spend some part of your day re-charging this device just to keep it alive.However, experience users (e.g., ATT reps who own this device, & other US citizens) advise me that selecting Task Managers (installed) or Market-available task managers (free), will extend your battery's life well beyond default settings. Not sure yet, but it seems the battery will last the majority of the day IF you are not using Wifi, GPRS-web, running onboard programs to the max, and/or talking simultaneously throughout your day. Perhaps all that activity is unlikely, but it's possible.Purchase a protective case immediately. This device is very thin, and its form-facter offers very little built-in impact-absorbing space (none), and you'll need to add some survivability to put your mind at ease. I selected the Case Mate, and it fits as tight as a drum head, but seems to offer some impact resistance; haven't tested it, nor do I want to.The Power-up key (top right) seems a bit of an odd place, but this probably prevents it from being pressed inadvertently. The volume rocker keys (top left) function as you would expect (up-loud, down-quieter), which is a breath of fresh air (Dell Streak varied its volume rocker functionality based on whatever direction its AutoRotation determined was UP - which I found very strange).This is only a quick \"First Impression\" evaluation. But I must say, I am blown away by the absolute beauty of the large 4.5\" display (not as big as Dell Streak 5, but much brighter and clearer), and the ease-of-use of Samsung Infuse. Infuse ships with a charger cable, wall adapter (no car power adapter is provided), an HDMI to phone plug (this phone will connect to your HDMI television for playback), quite nice ear buds (two extra different-sized ear bud sets), and a code sheet for one free HD movie. Loaded HD movies look amazing on this device, by the way.Email, Internet, Messaging, Phone use (speaker phone and handset, Application functionality, \"feel\" in-hand are all superb.I would buy this phone again. My competition was iPhone 4 (which has a lovely screen, but I found to be too small for the programs I use in my work: aviation weather programs; I'm not an Apple-hater, I own 9 Apple computers, but so far, I cannot cross the line into mobility with Apple; perhaps it is the iTunes strangle-hold that bothers me so much), Samsung Captivate, HTC Impress [all ATT so far], and US Cellular's offerings (nothing interested me), Sprint (same), Verizon's (all Droid phones - but their pricing was not attractive enough to swap service), and T-Mobile's smart phone offerings (which was/is very attractive - due to their cost-vs-benefit-%functionality ... and their unlimited data plans for 2 devices). Jury is not out yet, and the trial period for my ATT Infuse(s) has not expired. T-Mobile may yet get my business.But until then, and based on this device's performance only (notwithstanding the provider - which is hard to isolate!), I strongly recommend Samsung Infuse. Remember to purchase a protective cover & insure this device through Amazon's warranty service (i.e., \"SquareTrade\") or you may need to buy another on your own dime.Cheers!", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Beautiful Smartphone, Please Readon for Many Details", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "RAFAVODGYL9DD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned this phone for about a year with NO PROBLEMS. It is just that I change out phones often as I am a techie and have to have the latest phone/tablet, etc. And so I upgrade very often. However, the phone worked perfectly for the time I owned it, so here is my detailed review, and I hope that it will help you make a good decision if you need a great smartphone at this great price!***Keep in mind that this Sim Unlocked phone will work fine in AT&T; and even T-Mobile for calling and texting. But for Internet and MMS, you may need to set the APN settings. If you need the APN settings for At&T;, T-Mobile etc, just ask me in the comments and I will send them.Pros:- Very clear and easy to read 4.5\" screen.- Outstanding colors and outstanding screen clarity.- 2.2 Android allowed me to save many installed apps on my SD External card. (Cannot do this anymore after OS 3.0 and higher).- Great camera - I took many high quality pictures.- Wonderful music player app (the stock one was just right and makes great playlists,etc). Sound quality excellent.- Got 4g on the Internet Data.- WiFi came in clear and fast.- Overall a easy to use and perfect size phone and comfortable to hold with big enough screen.Cons:- NO FM Radio. However, I installed Tune In Radio so if I had WiFi on, I could listen to all kinds of radio stations.- Could use more memory, yet it still ran fast for me.- It has OS of 2.2 Android, possibly 2.3. However, this is still a good OS and will run most Apps. I still have a Galaxy Player with 2.3 and all apps I installed run fine...Good phone, after owning it for about a year, I upgraded to Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 with 5.3 screen. However, that one was too large and heavy to hold and I upgraded again. However, at times, I kind of miss my old Infuse as it was big enough at 4.5\" and not a heavy phone to hold. And at the price offered, it is a good deal for a nice phone.Also, I am a techie and know a lot about Android devices that is smartphones and tablets, so if you have any questions, please ask me in the comment section.Hope that this review has been helpful to you and thank you for reading it.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Infuse !", "Author": "SAM", "ReviewID": "R2UP0NG7JQG7OW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an advanced user and have been using this phone since past 3 months. This phone has an amazing huge s-amoled display which blows away all other phone displays I have seen till date. I have owned Blackberry,Nokia,iphone,etc but this phone is the best of all. I purchased this unlocked phone and rooted it immediately and installed custom Zeus rom (Gingerbread). It removed all the AT&T; bloatware and it can bump up its cpu speed from 1ghz to 1.6ghz with auto speed on demand setting as some graphic intensive games require higher processing power.Phone is incredibly slim so you need to buy a good case to protect it plus a scratch screen guard. Battery drains out quickly as the screen is a monster power consumer and phone heats up very very fast with GPS and screen turned on for longer periods. The sound quality is superb, display is super good and its on par with iphone its slim body.For advanced users like me, Iphone is really a piece of junk as I have customized each and every aspect of the phone which android allows and in my opinion, its far more advanced OS than anything in the mkt with tons of freeware available for downloads unlike paid apps from iphone. I am considering buying a second phone for my dad. At this price of under 350$, its a steal and it matches uptp 650$ dual core phones in the mkt with customized roms which can bump up the speed dramatically. It also has a state of the art GPU and phone is extremely fast inspite of loading it with so many apps. You can setup a wi-fi hub with your phone data connection too. Samsung is the worlds largest manufacturer of s-amoleds and other manufacturers have to buy from them to use it in their devices. Checkout xda developers site for installing custom roms on your androids !

I've had it for about 5/6 months. I loved the size, the two cameras, and everything it had to offer. I wish I had read further before purchasing this phone.

It kept doing this, nothing I tried worked. I looked it up online and found out that you have to take your phone completely apart to fix the boot loop. I did everything it said to fix it and it still didn't work. A guy told me I'd have to throw it or bang it against something to get it to stop. I ended up banging it on the floor and it fixed it for all of 6 hours, and it started doing the boot loop again.

It doesn't have a \"Retina\" display, and some reviewers constantly knock Samsung Android device displays; frankly, I don't see a problem. The screen looks good with both video and graphics. Battery life has been good even when watching video; however, some games seem to eat more battery than others.The device is no longer getting any update support from Samsung, but it's easily rooted and there are plenty of ROM options out there on the XDA forum. Although Gingerbread was the last \"official\" version of Android on the Infuse, I'm running Jelly Bean via the Carbon ROM with no trouble whatsoever. With a 64gb microSD card in the expansion slot, I've got plenty of room for app data and media.The Infuse has been a great media player since I got it, and there's the added bonus of having a spare phone if something happens to my S3 mini.

I am so happy that it was shipped so fast and it is in excellent condition and seems to work great.  I was a little hesitant to order it through e mail but I lost my original Samsung Infuse a week after getting it from AT&T; and unfortunately I had no insurance...bad idea. They wanted $699 for the phone and it was $341 at Amazon through Surge Telecom.  I e mailed Surge to ask about their return policy (if mine showed up or the one sent was not right)and they immediately responded to me with their policy.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again.....very pleased with all of the process and I am not one to spend more than $50 on the internet.
