Eberlein", "ReviewID": "R1HKOLVR5SCQN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone when it first became available, mid-contract (so it cost the full $250 it was priced for when it first came out) and it was the hot thing to get at Nokia (for awhile) due to its incredibly small size.  It's a really good phone--too bad the cell phone company I got it from, Edge Wireless, isn't!  It's as said before amazingly small and compact, colorful and elegant but still cool.  It's compact design is, of course, the major selling factor, but it's reception is awesome, polyphonic tones, text messaging and other uses make it a worthwhile phone as well.  Highly recommended from someone who doesn't know much about cell phones--it's hot, but so easy to use.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Little Phone!", "Author": "cinji", "ReviewID": "R2GK8WSPIX6YZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is an excellent basic phone.

Those are the things that matter in a primary phone.Power on/off button on top of the phone is a little hard to press, but how often do you shut your phone anyway?It comes in a lot of different eye candy colors. Very attractive.It has the basic functions of a phone (eg. alarm clock, stop watch, countdown timer, calculator) which is great.Ergonomics is pretty good too, and the size is perfect. Not too bulky, just right.I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Takes A LOT of abuse....and still works.", "Author": "Tennessee Tea Lady", "ReviewID": "R47LOBUSRW0F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Take it from a klutz....this may not be the fanciest phone in the world, but it can take a lot of hits and keeps right on working.

Michel", "ReviewID": "R24FEMGIDM1VFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this phone as a rental for 10 months in Israel, and put it through hell.  Dropped it, stuck it inside a backpack that not only weighed about 30lbs, but it also got tossed around allot.  Its got all the basic functions that you need, and it's very simple to use.  Personally I'm the flip-phone kind of person, but once I got into the habit of always locking and un-locking the keypad, it took me the same amount of time to get it out and use it to either text my friends in Israel, or the US, and make phone calls to whomever I wanted. Though the best part about this little phone isn't the size, battery life, or its weight, it's the fact that this thing can take a beating and come back for more.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Small Phone w/Many Features. LOVE MINE.", "Author": "J. Russell", "ReviewID": "R2WKFJ68FYB7SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mike, Most cell phone screens are hard to read against Wallpaper or a photo for wallpaper in the background. Go into you Settings, Wallpaper and set it to OFF. Then go to Settings Color Schemes and pick a background color that gives you good text/background screen contrast. I found Blue worked for me.Next, all small phones that fit in pants pocket have a lock-out function to prevent keys from being activated until Unlocked. Go to Settings, Phone Settings,Automatic Keyguard and set it to ON. This will automatically lock the keyboard, if you forget, after about 1 minute on no key activity. To Unlock keyboard, on the Main screen press Unlock softkey then Asterisk key. To lock keyboard manually, at Main screen press Menu softkey followed by Asterisk key.Tips:1. The Speakerphone works great on this phone. It is also usefulfor a higher volume in you need it when using the phone nearyour ear. Be sure to hold the phone away from your ear, saywith your index finger inserted between you ear and the phone.To activate Speakerphone, when a call is connected SPEAKERwill appear on screen above right softkey. Press it. Adjustvolume using left/right direction keys to decrease/increase.2. Use Calendar to alarm yourself of Birthdays and to Noteevents. After you have Saved the alarm, press the Optionsleft softkey and select Repeat to set in a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly reminder alarm. Birthday are automaticallyrepeated yearly.3. Use the 'Add Detail' Option to a Contact to store Addressand Notes about the contact. You can add more than one Noteto the same Contact if you run out of space(about 32characters) on the first one.3. Use Settings,Personal Shortcuts, to set the right andleft Softkeys for what you phone functions you want quickaccess to. Consider assigning one of them to ShortCuts thenmake a list of Function Shortcuts you want at Settings,Persona Shortcuts, Assign Shortcuts. You can also OrganizeShortcuts here to prioritize your shortcut list, top to bottom.4. Use Nokia's free software to Backup and Sync Contacts on yourcomputer using MS Outlook/Express(a must if you have lots ofcontacts and information data on your phone). You will needthe Nokia DKU5 USB cable. The DKU2 cable is for the 3120's bigbrother, the Nokia 6230. DKU2 is not usable with Model 3210.Find them cheap on Ebay.THIS IS A GREAT AND RELIABLE POCKET PHONE WITH ALL THE ESSENTIALS!! Not a Digital Camera. A phone is not a good camera, buy one. Not an MP3 Player. A phone is not a good MP3 player, buy one. Just more things to go wrong and act funky on your phone.", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Mine was a lemon", "Author": "M. J.

That was a mistake.Unlike previous reviewer, mine was delivered promptly.  Return address on box was Smart Tech USA in Houston, TX. There was no receipt or other forms in the box.Phone came with the battery partially charged, so I could determine that functions other than charging are good.  However, it does not charge. I tested the charger on my old Nokia 2126 and 1221, and that worked, so problem is in phone, not the charger.Package was a Nokia box without a model number. There is a slight bulge, indicating that box was not quite the right height for the plastic tray inside.  Does that mean I am not the first customer to receive this unit?Checking instructions for returns to Deals Warehouse, there aren't any. Site runs you in circles.  I did submit message via Amazon.
