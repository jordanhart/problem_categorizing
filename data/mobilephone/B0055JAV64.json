{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sprint Samsung Epic 4g Android Cell Phone - no contract", "Author": "D. Rub", "ReviewID": "RV665ZG8GUWTT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been playing around with both phones and because I belong to Sprint for the rest of my life's tenure, I shall let you know that these are the two best phones available in the market but let's compare which is better at what.Appearance - The Evo 4G does not have a slide-out QWERTY keypad like the Epic. The Epic despite the keyboard is about an ounce lighter in weight and that says a lot about the AMOLED screen and the absolutely flawless design on this phone. The charging port is located on the TOP of the phone and also has a little slide you need to drag open before accessing the MICRO USB/Charger. The phone looks a terrific black (like the best looking iPhone, oh yeah we care, no sarcasm) when the screen is not on. UNLIKE THE EVO, the standby key is on the right hand side of the phone and does the same thing. On first appearance, the design of the Epic is mouth watering. I've always found Sidekick like phones cheesy and even that DROID from VERIZON looks very plastic to me but I shall diss no more, the Epic might just win on this account (but I know plenty of Evo users who would disagree but this is my opinion). Because of size, weight, 4-inch screen (Evo's 4.3), design of the slide out, the Epic wins this round.Call Reception / Loud Speaker -> While playing music, I noticed the Epic was a little louder than the Evo is but at full volume, it can be a tad too loud too which is obviously such a WELCOME FEATURE. The Evo has a loud speaker alright and also a dedicated home page where you can easily play your music but what matters is the sound because both phones offer excellent customization.Battery Life - This is one of the primary reasons the Epic is likely to do good. I fume when I hear people say the DROID X has a better battery life than the Evo. On Epic, the AMOLED screen ensures you don't need to charge this phone more than once a day. I managed to make this last for atleast a day but I did find the battery readings to be inaccurate from time to time. Maybe this happened because I was trying the phone on Airplane mode and then switching to CDMA so that could be it. There was a difference in the battery life, sometimes the bar would be short and sometimes substantially longer. Maybe it is just a software update that is required but at the end of the day, You can have all the features on a phone but what matters a lot is battery life and the Epic takes this round too. By getting the Evo you will need to buy an extra battery unless you like carrying your wires everywhere you go. If you're getting the Evo make sure you get an extra battery charger and oh save yourself some money and NEVER INVEST ON EXTENDED BATTERIES. You wouuld think Samsung and HTC are more clever than not to have come out with the extended battery in the first place. Feel free to discuss, throw things at me on the comments column.Screen Brightness - HTC Evo is about AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN, absolutely incredible brightness, it's like watching the most expensive HDTV sometimes. The phone even on low brightness is surprisingly bright and I always appreciate brightness. While the Epic is not dull, I'll be lying if I say the screen is as bright as the Evo or even comes close to taking this round. The Epic has a jaw dropping display but the brightness and screen quality while you're on a webpage makes Evo the winner here. The brightness may come at the price of battery life but when you drive a HUMMER, you worry not about the battery life but about the drive.Build Quality of Plastic on the BACK - The Evo certain feels a little more solid and smooth. The back on the EVO is better than the INCREDIBLE. Evo's kickstand is an added feature but the quality of the plastic on the Evo is 15% better than the Epic when you're holding the back though Epic is quite good as it is. **Caution** Do not remove Epic's back size by the SPEAKER, you may damage the phone cause you're such a strong individual, locate a small opening at the end and then LIFT UP the back plastic covering the battery. The back is obviously not RED like the HTC EVO.Bundled Accessories - Epic comes with a 16gb card, in ear earphones, a thicker BASIC manual I haven't opened and read yet. The Evo comes with an 8gb card and no earphones. They both come with a Micro USb Cord which coverts into a wall charger. I have tried and used almost all earphones bundled with phones and have never seen any Sprint phone with such good quality \"in-ear\" earphones which provide NOISE CANCELLATION. An excellent extra for the fifty bucks you pay depending on where you're buying the phones from. 16gb is like having 2 x 8gb cards.Mobile Hotspot - DRAWTask Killer App - If you hold the home button down on the Epic, an excellent task killer pops up. It is so easy and fun to use that this alone was a big big big deal for me. I've used it on the Evo before but it's just so much hassle free and cleaner on the Samsung, it tells you the percentage of the CPU being used for variety of apps in REAL TIME! Deal-MAKER for me. EVO owners, please correct me if I'm wrong.CAMERA *BIG DEAL FOR ME* - Epic. Epic. Epic. Epic. The customization is Godly. Samsung is slowly becoming very clever. The camera quality is that of a digital camera, I dare say. Also if people are moving and pause for a second, the phone still takes an absolutely astounding photograph. The Evo makes things yellow and although it's 8megapixel, the camera doesn't quite seal the deal. The other thing is that the Evo doesn't have that many customizations for the camera. Samsung has pulled a magic trick with this one. Some envious Evo users tell me that because the screen looks better on the Epic, the images look better but if I were to upload these to my computer, there'd be a difference. This is my response to people who say something like that. How often will I be uploading these pictures? Maybe once in four days, I will be mostly viewing them on the phone so I don't care about that. Mind you, though I haven't uploaded anything yet, I shall upload them and send you a sample picture if you request one. PLEASE BARE IN MIND, while the SAMSUNG has more options, it will take a real techoholic to want to figure out each and every feature, I'm still getting WARMED up to it.Google Sync - The google sync on both phones immediately got all my contacts into the phone, there are a ton of applications so if you have a gmail account even with a blackberry, all your contacts are gonna be SYNCED with either the EVO or the EPIC. Google has a very funny deal-sealing way of having the google sync on the BLACKBERRY. If you're dumping your blackberry, make sure you do google sync and sync all your contacts before activating the EPIC. Ask a store rep to do it for you before buying it BLINDLY from them.BROWSING - Browsing on the Evo is the best browsing I have ever seen. It still wins over the Epic by just a single point. Epic still gets a 9/10 while Evo because of it's multi-touch gets a perfect 10. There is no lag while browsing or using the touchscreen at all. This is a dream come true for people who've ever had the Samsung Instinct from two years ago. These two phones make my Blackberry look so bad and that's one thing to love and admire about Androids, the fact that they have such capable awesomse fast, intelligent browsers. I have no complaints whatsoever. I have an iPod touch and its half as good at best and I'll tell you the iPod touch is amazing. EVO wins by a life because it's the best at it. Epic is still about two and a half times as good as my Sprint BOLD.On-Screen Typing : On screen typing on the Evo is way better because of HTC's on screen Qwerty. Swype comes built in with the EPIC. I've never used it, I don't believe in it, just looks too cheesy. Evo has a great typing mechanism but EPIC assumes that unless you're typing casually, you will use the physical keyboard to type. The Evo's typing is better than the iPhone's or the iPods. I haven't played with the iPhone 4 yet.SLIDE OUT / PHYSICAL KEYBOARD : I will go for the Epic over the Evo because it has a wonderful, non-cheesy, idiot proof keyboard slide out. This is the best addition possible besides the camera and the bundled accessries. I despise the Moment's keyboard in comparison though Moment isn't a bad phone. The EVO is supposed to be Sprint and Samsung's replacement for the SAMSUNG MOMENT.I've been away from my 2 day old Epic. I will discover more things and shall let you know. Any cons? The capacitive keys on the front could've been a touch more responsive. On the Evo they seem more responsive. I'm in no hurry for the Samsung Epic to get 2.2 and I'm sure they won't disappoint.Wallpapers look brighter, more alive, sleeker, sexier, more sophisticated on the Epic. When you're in your menu on the Evo you go from top to bottom while on the Epic, if you click Applications you go left right right right. So it's horizontal menu browsing on the Epic and vertical on the Evo.There is so much more for me to discover. I told someone earlier this year that no phone will ever match the iPhone but technology has an astounding way of shocking me. I'm an absolute geek and am glad that the Epic exists. It's like action sequences on the Lord of the Rings : Twin Towers while Evo is like the Matrix chase scenes from Reloaded. Both are feature packed phones but I love to type and the additional keyboard is fantastic for typing.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Favorite!", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R1JGW3L6L14M9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my favorite phone evaaaar!  I bought it from Amazon because I had cracked the screen of my previous one.  Not because the phone is bad quality, just because I'm retarded.  Love this phone.  I had no problem connecting it to my number via Sprint.  ESN was clear, like the description said.  I received it a little later than the site estimated, but I got it within 2 weeks, so no big deal.  If you're just shopping around for smart phones, this one is awesome!  Camera is amazing.  No use for a digital camera anymore because this phone has a high quality camera.  I like the conversation-style messaging.  You can Swype or pull the keyboard out.  I don't have 4G in my area, but the 3G internet is still very fast.

This was the best shipping experience I've had with a seller on amazon. I played with the phone for a few days before writing this review and I am very happy with it. I had an evo 4g and found that it was lagging probably because I have to much on it but I was really looking for a great phone with a keypad. I have finally found what I consider to be the best of both worlds. I give the product and the seller a 5 star rating. If your looking for a phone that offers both touch and key pad I say go for the Samsung Epic :)", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone, no need to look any further", "Author": "Aguilar", "ReviewID": "R1Y91R6EFSFPSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my Iphone 4s that was tragically stolen.I was really hesitant to get a phone that wasn't an apple, but I must sayI was quite pleasantly surprised.

(GPS, Pandora Radio, voice search internet, Google Maps, Netflix, exc)Futher-more three things really seem to make this phone stand out on its own.First the phone can be used completely using its touchscreen but also has the added bonus of having a sliding keyboard, quite useful when writing out longer emails, or text messages.Second the phone is quite light, seems well built, and doesn't look too bad either.Third: The speakers on this phone are quite impressive, well enough that you really don't have to use headphones unless yourstudying and have to be quiet.-Sincerely a Happy CustomerSeriously no need to look further", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Rose Holmes \"dymond k\"", "ReviewID": "R347OOCDMXUCIQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "phone in great condition only thing is its battery caused my phone to be slow and hard to use so i swapped it with my old battery other than that its great it came 2 days after ordering it it was a week early. the pictures are lies it only comes with charger, phone, battery, and sd card. i didnt receive a case or head phones or a car charger", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well Pleased!", "Author": "STL_CITYGIRL", "ReviewID": "R2UDJ9L78GB2TE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose to purchase a replacement phone from Amazon because I felt that I could trust it better than other sites or dealing directly with private sellers.

There's a little micro-USB protector door that slides over the USB slot so it's not constantly open when you're not using it. That feels much better than a little plug for it! When you slide it open, it snaps open around halfway through the push. It just feels high quality and I really love that! It comes with a 16 GB microSD card!!! I LOVE THAT SO MUCH. I am too cheap to upgrade the 2Gb card that comes with every other phone I've had! It came with pretty good quality headphones (they went through the wash cycle and STILL WORK!!).Cons: Once a week or so, it freezes and I have to take out the battery to restart it. It doesn't receive FM Radio signals like my HTC Evo Shift... which isn't really that huge of a deal, but I really want to listen to christmas music at work and no one else wants to! I don't have a wifi/4G connection in the building and I don't want to download a bunch of christmas music to my phone for 3 weeks. The keyboard sometimes doesn't register that I hit a key if I hit it too soon after hitting another key, or if I hit it twice quickly (like for Fn/Shift lock).Problems with Android OS I suppose: Why the fudge does my 4G turn itself back on 30 seconds after I turn it off?? I genuinely want to know. I don't want 4G draining battery while I'm at work but I have to turn it off at least 5 times in order for it to stay off!!The goods definitely outweigh the bads.

I still prefer to use an actual computer with a human size monitor and keyboard for actual work. I relegate my phone for calls, texts, solitaire and the occasional browse.

I just moved up to the Samsung from a Kyocera Rise (whose size I really liked). If you're like me and hang on to your flip phone as long as possible then you will miss the convenience of the one hand open-flip-speed-dial maneuver.Screen: the screen is a great size and has good resolution and a good display. As with most screens, it is tough to see in daylight and with glare.Performance: it has its occasional sluggishness and hesitations as I have come to expect from smart phones. Not too bad but sometimes it doesn't respond in time when I try to answer an incoming call. I have no idea what it's doing or why it can't just answer the call.Software: lots of bloatware on the phone-- games and stuff that I will never use that came pre-installed and that you cannot uninstall. I have no idea what they're really doing, or how much of my data they are reading. Things like NASCAR, Amazon MP3, and of course the dozens of little Googlettes (Google apps) that I will likely never use. They all take up memory, and memory means battery power.

The Epic has 441mb of memory and the transform ultra had 952mb. I had to move EVERY app that can be moved to an sd card to the sd card to save memory. It was advertised that the Epic had 1gb of memory but I'm guessing that's including bloatware. A few months after receiving my phone, the phone started to freeze/lock up on its own. When it freezes I am not able to receive ANY text messages or calls. They will never come in even if I take the battery out and restart the phone. So If I'm texting someone and the phone freezes I will have to be quick to take the battery out and restart it so I won't miss an important message/phone call. And just recently When my phone is on standby I tend to loose a signal, the wifi and the 3g symbol will be up at the same time causing my phone's battery life to get worse. I sometimes have to check and see if my wifi is on and it is while the 3g is still up and its on. I rarely use the 4g because the 4g kills my battery life.

But the phone is great and will dedfinately buy again here.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone and service", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R7W750SATBHFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an EVO and it was completely destroyed so I needed a quick replacement. I found a few but decided  on this Epic and I am glad I did. I ordered the phone on Thursday morning and I picked it up at the post office on Friday morning. Three minutes after opening the package I had the phone up and running. This phone is in pristine condition. Absolutely no scratches, cracks, or problems. I am happy I went with this vendor and I will use them again. I use Amazon for nearly everything and I have experience with many different sellers and this one I would highly recommend.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what it claimed to be", "Author": "Cookies", "ReviewID": "R3LMD9KNXD59GC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The prices was hefty, expected, smartphone.

My only complaint would b that the screen isn't very sensitive, but that's ok. It's a good starter phone for someone who only occasionally uses it for social networking and/or internet browsing. If your looking for something to manage all social networks, emails,  personal accounts, basically your daily life, you'd be better of going with something more current with more memory and a bigger screen. But overall I'm very happy and satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product was not in the best conditoin", "Author": "Janet", "ReviewID": "R3TS73O9SKB0JH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The product was not brand new.

Then I dropped it in the toilet, and, because I thought I purchased phone insurance but somehow didn't, was left to use my 3-year old Sanyo SCP-2700 (which is fine, but it's not my Epic). This was a good price, so I bought it. Shipped quickly, no problems, but I couldn't activate it. Why, you ask? BECAUSE IT WAS LISTED AS STOLEN. I got all my money back and I didn't have to pay for shipping, but that's probably something that should be checked before an item is put up for sale.
