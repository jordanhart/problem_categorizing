It's the one they give you free in the store when you sign up for a plan.

I send 250 texts a month tops, and I constantly have to delete old texts.

Instead I received an old outdated model #U450 not the model U460 Intensity II which I ordered. To add injury to insult the phone they sent me was a month to month contract that I would have had to pay $50 a month for 6 months before I could transfer this phone to my existing 2 year contract I already had with Verizon! Nowhere in the add was this indicated, and in my opinion this was out and out FALSE advertising. The only positive thing I can say is that the guarantee through Amazon enabled me to get a full refund on my purchase price. Nothing can compensate me for the hours and days I spent trying to resolve this issue, and the tremendous frustration I still feel for having been put through this ordeal.What would I do differently? Well after this experience, I would suggest that Amazon etc, should hold their suppliers responsible for #1 providing the products they advertise, #2 require that they clearly disclose any hidden loopholes (like this 6 month minimum useage fee), and #3 have their suppliers state in writing that they will provide the products they advertise, or legally agree to pay the customer back at least 3 times the original purchase price, and give a written apology for the \"mistake\".Without some type of agreement or guarantee like this, I will find it very difficult to do business with Amazon, or anyone else online in the future.Sincerely, Ron S", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Didn'd know it was a prepaid phone", "Author": "Kris", "ReviewID": "R3UJ856SK7XB0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Looking for a phone that I could activate on my current family plan without hassle from Verizon.

The only good thing about this phone is it's durability. The OS is extremely quirky and not very stable. The worst part about this stupid phone is it won't allow you to edit past date entries on the calendar.Say you want to keep track of the hours you work and set an alarm for your coming work day. That's all fine, but here's the maddening part! By the end of said day, you might work less hours than you scheduled and want to edit the end time of the scheduled event. NOPE! You can't do that because the scheduled event's alert time has already past and there's no way to turn off the alert! You'll have to enter a new calendar event to go off in a few minutes and title it something like, \"worked until such & such time\", or \"finished work at...\" There is absolutely NO way around this! No other phone I've ever owned or played with at the store does this!!! They all let you edit past calendar events except THIS FREAKIN PHONE!!!There are other quirks about the operating system that drive me crazy, but to list them all would bore you.As I said, the only good thing about this phone is it'll take a bad fall on concrete and only get a scratch on the plastic shell. I know cuz after being frustrated with a system crash or freeze, or some of the other quirks, I've thrown the phone few times (around 12 or 14 feet up) above a concrete floor with it surviving (unfortunately).DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!

Even if you just want a phone that will only call and text, I definitely encourage you to look elsewhere. Every day when I use this phone, I think about how much I hate it and want to upgrade. Sometimes I feel like I hate it more and more with each day.Anyways, I should be telling you why it's bad. I do admit this phone has its pros, but I have more cons than pros. I made a list of pros and cons about this phone below:PROS* Pretty cool design for its time (that being the mid-2000s)* Doesn't heat up often (usually it does when it charges, but that's normal for phones)* Easy to charge* Good texting pad (feels smooth, nice)* Pretty good battery life* Pretty durable (usually when I drop it, the back and battery usually don't come out)CONS* Screen and phone itself too small. I personally hate having a tiny screen with a horrible resolution* MAJOR CON: It pocket dials/texts A LOT!!!! Even when it is unlocked, it manages to unlock itself and do whatever (call a friend, text a friend some random messsage, etc.). One time, it pocket-subscribed me to Jamster, so I was billed $10 to my account!* Whenever you put in a command (number, letter, etc.), it makes an annoying beeping sound. You can turn that off by putting it to vibrate, but still...* The number pad is WAY too small, but again, that's my personal con.* It also lags at lot, too. Sometimes it's really slow when opening up text messages, and it's also slow on commands sometimes.* Lots of bugs* Too many horribly-placed shortkeys* Disorganized layout (at times complicated)* Bad camera (again, it has a horrible resolution)* Horrible, awkward locking feature. This can be bad for those who would like some security for their phones. If you get this phone, use a double lock. But still, it can unlock on itself and do whatever. There's also no password feature, so that's pretty bad.* Not much customization whatsoeverI think Samsung makes great products, but I gotta say that this is one of their worst. Again, even if you want a phone that simply calls or texts, look at another dumbphone. I will be upgrading this coming Christmas, and I am most likely getting the Samsung Galaxy S4 (one of Samsung's better products). So please, whatever you do, DO NOT GET THIS PHONE! But that's just me. I bet there are people who have this phone and are fine with it, so this raging review is just me.

The camera is worse, it doesn't take any video, sometimes it freezes more than my 4 year old phone. The only thing that's better on it is the keyboard, but the keyboard is available on many different phones so that's not too impressive either. My 4 year old phone had flash which this doesn't, and the speaker phone is way to quiet to use for hands free driving. The phone is good for calls and texting with the keyboard, if you don't mind deleting your texts often. If you want a phone for calls and texts this is your phone, if you want a phone that's good for technology look elsewhere.
