Resolution is amazing, videos play smoothly, games play without any hesitation, HDMI lets you connect to TV (altough I never tried it), microSD lets you upgrade memory, tethering with T-mobile works amazingly fast, perfect sound quality, nice cameras (altough I use them very rarely), etc... I was hasitating buying this phone only becouse of T-mobile network. I wasn't sure if TMo HSPA would work, but it does... and it does very well !!!BTW... to the reviewer who left 4 stars... Sony just released update to Jelly Bean :)", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good deal.", "Author": "gypsyair", "ReviewID": "R1D4G3LGUZHYAO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone when amazon sold it at 379.99 with an extra 10% coupon, total cost is $371.91.The 16GB Nexus 4 with California tax and shipping would be $20 more.The Nexus 4 wins at: 1) OS,Android 4.1 vs 4.0.4; 2)RAM, 2G vs 1G; 3)Battery, 2300 mah vs 1950 mah. 4)Wireless charge.The Sony wins at: 1)Micro SD Card support, 32GB vs None; 2)Call quality; 3)Camera; 4)PC software.Both are pentaband unlocked GSMs with NFC enable, no problem for tethering.For this price, I prefer the Sony Ion, its screen is very clear and the video playback is super. to me, there is no different between 4.1 and 4.0.4, micro sd card support is a big plus.I will recommand this phone.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Improved Xperia Experience", "Author": "Dr. Johnson C. Philip \"Author of over 100 boo...", "ReviewID": "R282OCTFF6KAYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been a fan of the Xperia series. It is one of the most successful series by Sonly (also, formerly, or Sony Errickson) and over the years I have used a number of models from this series.Actually I came across this series a few years ago when I was looking for a phone with the following characteristics:1. Very compact2. Easy to use3. Superb camera quality4. Reasonable priceI found that the Experia series met all the above requirements.This model from the series maintains all the above features, but at the same time it has improved upon all the features and specifications. Those who have used the earlier models will be pleased at the vast improvements. Those for whom this is the first-time buy of a machine from this series it will surely give a pleasant surprise.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "good quality, handy, it works in asean countries, photos are in great quality", "Author": "NELSON R.

It's a great piece of hardware that does everything you'd expect from a modern smartphone, and does it with flair.  The custom Sony interface is snappy and delightful to use. The touchscreen is responsive and large enough for all your web and media needs. The build quality is good and it feels nice in your hand, although perhaps slightly hefty. The screen is beautiful - plenty bright enough and extremely sharp.  Battery life is sufficient, although I found it drains rather quickly when using 3G/4G internet. However, it actually lasts a surprisingly long time when watching full-screen movies.  Call quality and signal strength are excellent - better than my previous Blackberry. Comes with a decent-enough set of earphones with built-in microphone and clicker. Also, this (unlocked and unbranded) model has 5 receiver bands, and should work pretty much everywhere in the world.Slight negatives are the touch-navigation buttons along the bottom, which are sometimes tricky to use, especially in the dark.  Also, the loud speaker isn't the best around, but is adequate.Although it might not be as slick as an Apple device, I prefer this to iphone 5 due to the larger screen and huge amount of customizability options available in the Android interface.Overall, a great smartphone from 2012 that should keep you happy well into 2014.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone for this price...", "Author": "faisal", "ReviewID": "R3BD6NMS7U1KA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it is a bit show with a little lag and sometimes applications close by themselvesOtherwise it is a good phone", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "jhon", "Author": "Jhon Chacon", "ReviewID": "R3RVMXI3F3VYD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelente tel\u00e9fono muy rapido y la panatalla ni se diga de muy buena calidad aun q  la camara tarda un poco en enfocar.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Happy faces.
