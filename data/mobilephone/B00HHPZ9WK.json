{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone once Access Point and Name was set", "Author": "victorb", "ReviewID": "R2ITNKV4PDHSXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When we received this phone from Amazon, my daughter was ecstatic. Phone was great, BUT she could not send or receive messages with photos. Went to T-Mobile and spent several hours with their people trying to determine the problem and fix it. The problem: the phone would not connect to a data (2G/3G) network. In the end, the T-Mobile folks declared that the phone was defective. We returned the phone through Amazon (which worked very smoothly and quickly) and purchased another DEFY through a different vendor on Amazon, and when it arrived, it had the same problem. After deciding that the likelihood of two separate vendors selling defective phones was unlikely, I did some \"research\" on my own and discovered that the actual problem was that the APN was not setup in the phone (actually found the settings on T-Mobile's web site). After inputting those settings, the phone works like a charm!My only complaint about the phone is that Motorola, the vendor, or whoever is selling these phones does not include the information about setting up the APN even if that meant consumers had to contact their service providers for these settings! It was a very simple \"fix\" in the end, but we went through lot of unnecessary run-around to discover it.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "A bargain price for a full featured and quality phone", "Author": "Randal Calvert", "ReviewID": "R1ZW1VL10YH0TB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best price I have seen for a phone with a 4-inch screen, dual core processor, and a good name brand. Have only been using the phone for a couple days but battery life seems better than that of the 2x as expensive sony xperia TL which I had previously. Screen quality is comparable to an iPhone 4. Phone came new in box with USB cable, charger, and headphones. Android UI made it simple to set the language of the phone, set up gmail account, etc.Construction of the phone is solid and it looks great too. My only real complaint is that you must buy an SD card to put in the phone before you can take pictures or download apps. Despite the otherwise good specs, the internal memory is very tiny. [When you get the phone google \"most recent APN\" for at&t;, t-mobile or whoever your carrier is.] [Then on the phone go to \"settings > wireless & network > mobile networks > access point names.\"] Access Point Name or (APN) is where you will type in the info which you find on google to get this unlocked phone working with your mobile network. It is an easy process once you find the APN settings online. Keep in mind that this phone will only run @ edge data speeds even when 3g service would be available on at&t; network. The signal frequencies on many unlocked phones, like this one, were designed in alternate countries, therefore their 3g frequencies don't match ours. However keep in mind that signal strength of this phone is still great running on edge speeds.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Above my expectations.", "Author": "Jason Bolinger", "ReviewID": "R3I950I6UO6XK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wasn't sure how well this phone would work with the limited reviews over the net. This phone was made for another country but works just fine with GMS servers here in the U.S. Wifi if available is faster then the 2G. But then 2G isn't that bad when loading a video off youtube, takes about 30sec or so. Picture quality is wonderful and clear and has a great sound for a phone. Battery life goes fast but I guess that is normal for smart phones when messing on the net or playing on apps. Had the phone service tech set our phones up for us and he had problems with the phone wanting to revert back to another language. As I have used the phone it has not done this so not sure what he was doing to cause that. Also to take note the area we had phones set up had 4G service and the phone according to the tech guy said the phone picks 4G up. I would think so as a video on youtube was nearly instant to view. Have herd comments that the phone looks and operates like the Galaxy III from an owner of that phone. Phone does have a lot of options and takes some time to get to know. Instruction manual did come in English. And the Phone did come with USB cable and a wall charger which is used with the USB cable.  Will need to purchase a SD Micro card 32g or less as this is the largest it will accept. 32g is probably more then enough but for around 10 bucks why not.  Our phones did come new and unlocked.

The app is called Tapunlock and there are many others to look out for.  After giving Motorola my IMEI they let me know that this was a phone from China over which they have no control over sale and no WARRANTY-thus no help.  I tried to do a reset with no luck.  I was left out in the cold until I came across a reset procedure on You Tube by Resetpedia.  That worked, but for any other problems that may happen, its SOL.Other than that, if you want a toy or a mini computer thats a fun thing, this will work.

It looks good, has great camera, connects to Wi-Fi easily and works with all the apps I tried. But that's it. As a phone...it sucks. Spent hours at AT&T; to try to make it work. It usually worked for 1/2 day and then it either rejected the SIM card, or decided that it can't find a carrier. It also has an annoying, built-in, non-removable, China Mobile browser and it will not allow you to replace the built in Chinese voice-mail number. Motorola USA will not acknowledge the existence of XT760 and you have to call Motorola Canada for any information. Despite all these negatives I would have kept the phone if it worked...which it did not. Based on other reviewers gushing about his phone, I can only imagine that either I got a lemon, or they are not really using it as a phone.

Your provider should help you with this. Without these settings the phone will not access the internet without WiFi.It was obvious that this phone was made in China since that was the default setting. The odd thing is that if you go the Motorola website for support, you won't find this model on any list. These means that you won't be able to view or download a manual. It is also hard to find accessories.The phone worked well in most respects. I was very disappointed when I did a video recording of a chorus.
