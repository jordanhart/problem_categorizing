Never let us down.  All the features seem to be placed in places where they make sense.  The other net10 phone we had was stupidly set up, but this one is set up well.I would recommend this phone to anyone getting a new prepaid phone, mostly because it is so much easier to use than the cheapest ones they offer at places like wal-mart.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Kristal R. \"Saphyrya\"", "ReviewID": "R31G3ILB6O3XT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this little phone.. i actually got it under a regular cell phone plan back in 2006, battery life is excellent, it comes with some pretty ringtones, like the crickets chirping.. i switched plans over from cingular to verizon so i couldnt use it anymore, but it's my favorite of all cell phones AND it's absolutely gorgeous!! buttons work nicely, it's very glossy with a steel grey color.. silver rim with a nifty design then another silver rim around the outer screen.. gets good signal too, hell i might buy this one just to have a bill free worry free cell phone..", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do NOT recommend this Phone.", "Author": "Steve Maxey", "ReviewID": "R3DGJCHS900I7Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone would not work in my area code.
