Only after I paid I realized that I might have a problem with the system language and with OTA updates to the ICS. Well, there was nothing I could do and I prepared myself for the worst scenario - starting to Google how to install Hebrew on the device and how to manually update. You can imagine the nice surprise when I opened the box and discovered it has Hebrew as one of the preinstalled languages. The strange thing is - that this specific phone is not sold in Israel and is not advertised on the Israeli web site of Motorola. It is actually made for Malaisya! Then,I had something else to worry about - will I receive the Android update to 4.04 like anybody else??After about one week - I received the notification, downloaded and updated.Stupid but lucky!", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST SELLER on Amazon", "Author": "Mir", "ReviewID": "R13MYDKTQLUJPB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as international gift and they sent the wrong phone.

Mistakes happen sometimes and it may be a technician by mistake put used, previously owned unit in the spot where new one should be. This needs to be resolved in first 30 days even if it is our fault, that is why there is 30 days policy, plenty of time to find out what condition item came in, new or used, dont you agree? As far as I know, without investigation those units were Brand New and we have confirmation for Motorola or Amazon, if unit's software was updated or reinstalled that does not make unit used, and I have seen that happen, because some phones that we buy are coming from Motorola of Hong Kong or London, UK. Motorola may not cover it, but it does not make unit used! Also, as far as I know there is no policy on all items being sold having 1 year warranty with Motorola Manufactory unless you buy from channels such as T-Mobile or AT&T;, Verizon or Sprint, so assuming it will have warranty based on a reason it does not say in the listing \"No Warranty\" is really just an assumption. We only gurantee what listing offers + 30 days amazon warranty, since we do match amazon warranty.Thank you!-TanyaNGP Team--- Original message ---Dear NGP team,  1, Feb, 2013  There seems to be some confusion as to what the issues may be, soI'll gladly tell you the information that was shared with me. After muchtime on the phone with Motorola USA, Motorola Hong Kong, and Amazon.com:  (1) On a recorded conference call with Motorola, Amazon.com, andmyself: Motorola clearly stated that this phone, although marketed as\"Brand new\", has actually been altered (software) before it's sale to you.Thus, it is no longer considered \"Brand new\" and will NOT be covered underwarranty.  See, your company sold me a phone that was advertised as a \"NEW,Motorola RAZR MAXX,\" Simple math work would lead me to believe that yourcompany sold me a product under false pretenses, AKA: FALSE ADVERTISING.  (2) Your company WITHHELD VITAL product information that influencesthe decision making process of purchasing this product from you. Whenpurchasing products of this nature and expense, that are marketed as \"NEW,\"a Manufacturer's warranty is implied unless otherwise disclosed by theseller. NGP did NOT disclose any such information.* A factory Warranty is considered part of the product, unless otherwisestated by you, the seller.  The fact you defend yourself on the basis of OMMITING the fact that thevery expensive products you're marketing as \"NEW,\" don't have warranties isnothing short of disgusting business habits. I'm not too sure Amazon.comwould want to be affiliated with your business practices either. Well, ifthey want to lose customers they'll continue business with you.

Mauriello \"Tracie Maurie\"", "ReviewID": "R2AK7M3IG3VU2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The best thing about this phone is the battery. It's very good, although it definitely doesn't last as long as advertised, and I'm a person who (usually) remembers to use task killer, to reduce screen brightness, turn off gps, turn off wireless, etc. Still it's better than any other phone I've used so I can't complain.Call quality also seems pretty good so far.The camera, however, is very disappointing. I end up with a hazy blurriness in the middle of every picture. Also, when I set it to \"HD\" the screen goes very, very dark and the photo comes out very, very dark too, as if I'm shooting in a dark room even when I'm in daylight. I don't get it.This is a problem for me because I am a mobile journalist who takes news photos on the run. My old phone (Samsung Stratosphere) had a much, much better camera. I guess I'll have to go back to carrying a camera in my gear bag again, which I wanted to avoid because it weighs me down. Too bad.Also, when I switched to this phone, Google Voice started acting weird. I never had this trouble with the Stratosphere.Lastly, when I try to sync gmail, which I do several times a day, it takes literally 2-3 minutes for the messages to download.

Well, it started out fine. The phone was nice, pretty powerful, responsive and suck. Everything was pretty acceptable. Then about 5-6 months later, the phone starts to get some real lag and some issues with performance. Applications, even factory loaded ones, like the Camera, will run ridiculously slow. When you click the camera app icon, the app will open, and it will take about ten seconds for the app to become usable. Then, if you switch over to movie mode, it takes another 5-10 seconds for it to switch modes, and also, when you tap the record button, it takes about as long to start recording. What is very very annoying. Most applications, both factory loaded and acquired from the Google Play store act this way. The only ones that really don't are the most simple applications. Then about8 months later I started noticing that the screen wasn't as accurate as it was when it was new. This was especially evident when typing text, both in the vertical and horizontal mode. Quite a few times per text, instead of the letter that you intended to be entered being entered, it would enter the letter to the left or right, and it just stayed that way.. Until, about 10-11 months after purchase, my phone started not holding a charge for long at all. It was to the point where I would walk out the door at 8am with a full charge, and by time I was getting off at 6pm, the battery would be about dead, giving me 20% and 10% and then finally the 0% Phone Shutting Down notifications. Also, when your battery dies with this phone, you can't simply plug it into a charger in immediately turn it on to use it. You must wait 5-10 minutes in order for it to reach a 5% charge for the phone to allow you to turn it on and function... Finally, about a week or so after I noticed this happening, one day I plugged in my phone to the charger, and noticed that it was charging very slow, if at all. So I figured I would leave it on there for a bit longer (this time when I initially plugged it in to charge, the battery was at 30%, not completely dead). BUT, when I came back a little bit later and picked up the phone to look at it, I noticed that the phone was very hot. To the point where it was uncomfortable to hold in the hand, and where you would NOT want to hold it to your head to use it. ALSO, I noticed that the battery indicator read 0%. Which was ridiculous, because when I plugged it in initially, it had a 30% charge... Needless to say, unplugging it resulted in the screen immediately going blank. After that, even plugged in, it wasn't responsive at all and would just get very very hot. So I called Verizon, and they replaced it.. Well, with the new one, the phone is responsive, though I've only had it for about a month.. The touch screen is inaccurate already, having the same problems texting, after only having it for a month. Also, a new issue with this one, it's constantly going in and out of 4G. Here in the Melbourne, FL area, we have a steady strong 4G LTE network. The last Razar MAXX constantly held a 4G connection. Now with this one I see it in 3G an AWEFUL lot. Also, the talk reception sucks at times now too...If you want to go with a Razr MAXX...... Good luck....", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice phone but shouldn't be anywhere NEAR $450 now", "Author": "Sporty \"Sporty\"", "ReviewID": "R2PRD3AM7SZ6RC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own this phone and it's been a great phone.
