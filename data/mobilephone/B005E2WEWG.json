I was skeptical about it at first due to the bad reviews, but for me it does the trick. All I use this phone for is texting, internet, and the occasional phone call. For the most part I just text on it. The keyboard is really nice, but it is the first keyboard phone I have ever had so I wouldn't know what a nice one really feels like. The touch screen is amazing in my opinion. I used to own a Samsung Eternity, and I hated it. This phone is much better than that one. Overall, I am very please with the Sharp FX.

My mom said her phone holds a charge just fine.  I have dropped the phone numerous times and the screen is just fine however, we recently went to see fireworks at the beach and the high humidity caused the screen to stop working temporarily.  It took about a week and then it started working again but response is spotty so I would say do not get wet or use in extreme humidity.  It is easy to use which I like.  It is considered a smart phone without the smart phone fee which I also like.

I honestly cannot say one good thing about the screen.I got it because my husband and I text a lot while he's on the road. I don't even talk on it much. I liked it originally because the charging cord disconnects from the wallplug and doubles as a data transfer cable.

Wasn't able to get ANY apps to work on it.But now, the S.O.B. won't even hold a charge. Left it plugged in all night about a week ago and discovered the phones microUSB hub is loose and you have to wiggle it certain ways to get it to charge at all. Finally got it to charge fully, according to the battery display, and boom, 10 hours later it was dead again, even though I hadn't used it ALL day.

I am not a child, or a little old lady, but someone who is very familiar with electronics and computers in general.Previously I had an iphone, but due to expensive data fees i decided to drop down to a 'freebie' phone.  It seemed to have decent reviews, so i went with it.This phone is utterly useless.Let me make a list of all the drawbacks of this device, starting with the most prominent (i promise you will not have to read past #1 before you are convinced to not buy this.)1.  This device turns itself off, even when it is fully charged.  The only way to turn it back on, is to pop out the battery, then put it back in.  If you don't do that, you can hit all of the buttons you like, and it won't do ANYTHING.2.  Touch screen is pitiful and akin to what you would expect on a touch screen device from the late 90s.  It is incredibly laggy and inaccurate.3.  Apps are useless and unless you get a data plan with this, you cannot get new ones without paying both for the app and a bandwidth fee for the download.4.  Documentation on anything as simple as adding ringtones is scant and can only be found after about an hour of googling.there are many many many more complaints I could list regarding this device, but those are the big ones.This phone was so terrible that I had to resort to resuming use of my nine-year-old Nokia N-Gage in its stead.  For the record, that N-Gage is much more stable and reliable than the FX.Long story short, if you do not mind your family members thinking you died in a horrible accident, by all means get this phone.  otherwise I completely advise against it.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "i love this phone", "Author": "C.
