I figured for the price I was paying, it wouldn't hurt so bad if it was junk.  When I got the phone I was a bit disappointed by how worn it looked.  But that all changed.  I got to Cologne Germany and put in my Ortel Sim card.  I then placed my first call to my wife in the US.  The phone works great.  Excellent talk quality and decent text capability.  If anyone is considering this model for the same purpose as I did, I would highly recommend it if the price was what I paid. $15.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "LgCG300 Cell Phone Quadband Unlocked", "Author": "KC", "ReviewID": "R2OYD4UQG67HK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first got this phone it was unable to detect any network in Jamaica and was unable to keep a charge for more than 30 mins, however I contacted the dealer who was very co-operative and provided the relevant information that allowed the phone to detect a network and sent replacement batteries. I am not sure whether the replacement battery works as I write this review, but the effort of the dealer made me give this product five stars. Thank you sir.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Replacement Phone!", "Author": "Johnny H.", "ReviewID": "R4Q4JM3Q18NOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this LC CG300 cell phone to replace my old one, which just froze on me.  I had the original phone for over 5 years and it was a great phone.  That's why I was very happy to see I could get one just like through Amazon.com.  Very happy with the phone...it works great and saved me a bunch of money!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good Phone", "Author": "M. A. Figley \"Bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R2W6QH9HK36NLE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone worked well for a few months, but then gave me some problems that I just couldn't deal with over time. Though I don't remember exactly what the problems were, I do know that the phone was worth what little time for which I was able to use it. Basically, it's a decent phone to use for the short term, but by no means something I'd want to use as a permanent communication device.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Took it to Europe", "Author": "Sarah H. \"Sarah\"", "ReviewID": "RRA7Y1U87S5C1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Took it to the UK, went to a phone store like they have there and got an Orange SIM card which they installed, and it worked fine. Some issues with delay in receiving texts and also it being difficult to set up the sounds and so on. Full of last owners' contacts. But good enough for short term use abroad.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "HAPPY WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE", "Author": "CAPTAIN BUDDY", "ReviewID": "R160ZKR03UKR6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I HAVE HAD AN EXCELLENT EXPERIANCE WITH THIS SELLER AFTER I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO HIM ON THE TELEPHONE.
