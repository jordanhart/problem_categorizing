IE10 was a surprise I didn't expected. May be the best thing is the screen, good resolution and looks great down the sun light. At the same time, the automatic brightness performs in effective and unnoticeable fashion. Responsive tactile panel... The camera, even not the best, is very good for the price tag and the battery duration is more or less like the other devices (one day and half).The only bad thing is the the app store is not nourished as Windows Phone competitors are, and normally WP is the last platform to get updates from the most popular applications.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Will L \"Sleepwalker\"", "ReviewID": "R1U64ISRDZZRAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia did a great job with this phone. The build quality of the phone is very good, exceeding my expectation for this price range. The back cover is plastic but the color (yellow) with some transparency makes it look fun and fresh. Definitely recommend getting this phone in the fun colors, black is too dull. The display screen quality feels surprisingly good. Good resolution and color.A plus side is that this phone allows you to change battery. The back cover comes off just like the good old times of the not-so-smart-phones.Software wise, the OS and the standard apps feel responsive and easy to use. Buying Nokia will give you access to a bunch of interesting apps. Windows Phone is still lacking in terms of apps, but it have most of the apps that I intent to use so that's okay for me.If you want a good phone for a great price, this is it. If you want to latest and greatest, look elsewhere.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for a reasonable price!", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R1L9OT3S8ACFRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great with AT&T.; If you have AT&T; already, just go to a store and get the micro sim for FREE.Network shows as H or H+ instead of 4G.Some minor differences in OS text as it is an international phone (i.e. Favorites is spelled \"Favourites\"). All the features of the phone I have used work great. Had to setup more of the phone than a US locked phone (speech to text and voice languages) but not a big deal.Phone shows it was manufactured in Malaysia and the carrier is CV Malaysia.Definitely planning on utilizing the microSD slot as after first boot the available internal storage space is about 4GB.Speaker phone is a bit distorted in a call but music playback is clear. Very loud speaker both external and ear.Confirmed this phone ACTUALLY DOES HAVE a dual band WIFI transceiver so I can connect to my 5GHz band.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "So happy with Lumia and Windows Phone", "Author": "isabel chaparro", "ReviewID": "R3W2LS1XSDW5YV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My iphone got stolen, so I needed a replacement.

After owning several smartphones, I decided to buy something smaller and the 620 was a perfect fit. Plus, it was cheaper than the 920.For this phone I had to buy a GoPhone SIM from Amazon that was already cut for MicroSIM. The activation process was pretty straight forward, and even after activation I was able to port my old Sprint number when its contract ended.I'm giving it 4/5 stars because the loudspeaker stopped working after 2 weeks of use. I decided to take apart the loudspeaker part to see if something burned or broke (using a T4 screwdriver) but didn't see anything unusual. After putting the part back, it started working normally, so I'm assuming the component was lose or not making contact.Compared to my old HTC Evo 3D, the loudspeaker is much clearer and louder. However, the 620's vibrator is pretty much useless since it is way too soft and you can't configure it to vibrate for longer periods of time.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great dwvice vfora good price", "Author": "V.

While I love the phone, you have to buy a GSM micro SIM card that will connect in your area. There are only two GSM carriers in the US, AT& T and T-Mobile (which uses AT & T if not in a T-Mobile area). There are a lot of GSM SIM cards on the market, but all of them require connecting to one of these two networks in the US.Unfortunately, my home town is locked down to only two carriers, there is no AT& T service here, and while T-Mobile advertises 2G voice in my area, in reality it doesn't exist. The phone works great in a town 20 miles away with T-Mobile. Just make absolutely sure your service area can access the two networks. If you live in a major city you'll be fine. One small plus is you can use the phone with WiFi and use Skype if you're stuck without service.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little phone", "Author": "John B.
