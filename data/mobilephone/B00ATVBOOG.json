{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than others selling for more", "Author": "J_Furst", "ReviewID": "R13NP80IGO3KNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted an affordable Android phone that would sync with Google Calendar and Contacts online. This was a precaution so that if the phone was lost, stolen, or went faulty, such information would still be safe. All I had to do was get a replacement phone and 'download' the information. So I started out with an entry-level LG Optimus GT540 Android phone that had a fairly good review. I paid US$120 for it in July 2011. I am surprised to see it is still being sold now for even more (up to US$165).Well in trying to upgrade the LG phone, it became unusable so I started the hunt for another low cost phone. Well, I eventually chose this Samsung Galaxy Discover a month ago. I am glad I did. This phone is much better that the LG Optimus GT540 and at a lower price. Looking at different aspects:.. Screen: This phone has a capacitive touch screen versus a resistive screen. I find it much lighter to touch, more consistent and more responsive. Also there is a little more finger room and screen space with the slightly larger screen of 3.5\" compared to 3.0\"... Memory: I ran out of memory trying to download apps on the former phone. But I have loaded this new Samsung with similar apps and still have much more room. In fact, I note that this Samsung has over 12 times more internal memory than the LG... Operating System (OS): This Samsung with the later OS 4.04 has an improved onscreen keyboard and I no longer need to download a dialer and contacts app to overcome the limitation of the LG with its OS 2.1... Camera: This is about the same as before, but with 3 MP it is better than some similar phones with only 2MP. One disappointment is that it does not carry an LED flash, although gsmarena.com says it does. But considering the price and also that my former phone did not have this feature, I am still satisfied... Battery Life: Battery life has not improved much, with a lower capacity battery of 1300mAh (vs 1500 mAh). However, in actual usage, it appears that the Samsung has a slight advantage. Just checking now, the phone has done some 23.5 hours on battery and it indicates that the battery is now 52% of its capacity. This is with moderate use.Considering all the factors reviewed, overall I give this Samsung Galaxy Discover phone a 5 rating, especially for such a reasonable price of US$118. (I paid US$110.) And I would certainly recommend this phone way ahead of the LG GT540 even if the latter was fetching a lower price, which is now surprisingly higher.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "maury", "Author": "Rafael Mauricio Roitman B", "ReviewID": "R2D2Q8G20Q2GW7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this cell about one week ago , and it has been working without any fault.

I did have to pay to ship the item to them, which always irks me a bit, but I understand a company needs to make profit on a phone they're selling for a very reasonable price.I knew the phone was great (because I bought two and the wife is loving hers) and when the replacement finally arrived I was treated to a phone for Under $100 that plays most android games I can throw at it with no problem. **Shout out to Frozen Synapse if your looking for a turn based, reasonable tactical game to play against friends** and is running a version of the Android OS that none of the other phones in that bracket are updated to.It's responsive, solid battery life (after the return I was able to run 24hrs with some fairly heavy use during the evening), looks great, and just feels solid. I'm not worried about breaking it like I am a lot of the plastic options that are in the sub $100 price range.Overall nothing I can really say negative about it once the battery was solved.

I have one of these on the Net 10 service, and I will soon have a new phone.  I had the Galaxy Proclaim before I had this and it's a lot better(I gave it 5 stars).  The Discover looks good and feels pretty good in my hand, but it is slower than the Galaxy Proclaim.  Because of the fact that it has the newer operating system(Android 4.0), it's not completely useless, though many reviewers before me would make you believe such.  I admit, texting can be challenging if you're use to swyping, but if you ever had a keyboard phone, you can adjust to using the Samsung keyboard for typing.  Sometimes when you swype, the words you're trying to swype won't appear on the screen, which can be irritating.  Also, it's senses are kind of bad because when you swype for some simple words(such as simple), something completely different will show up and you'll be wondering how the system figures that was what you wanted to type based upon your finger's motion.  If you want to swype better, there are several swype apps available in Play store.Something else to adjust to is the fact that this phone does have 2 gigs of memory, and if you download a file managing app or an app such as Olive Office, you will have the internal and external memory options.  Your micro SD card is the external option.  And inserting the micro SD card requires you to remove the back cover; another change from the Proclaim, but the cover is easy enough to remove and reapply.Finally; I didn't like that this didn't come with a music player automatically; and I need one of those.  If it did, I totally missed it.  I know there are apps for it, but a lot of the better apps for them have ads, which get annoying after a while.  Maybe some other phones do have music players on them.Overall, this is a good phone and a good starter for someone wanting to get into more advanced Android phones, but if you've had something like the Galaxy Proclaim, you should probably get one of the ZTE's from Net 10; they'll be faster and probably better than the Discover.

I returned it to the seller and asked that he send me a fully tested phone.  To his credit, he exchanged the phone for one that he ran an overnight test on.  This solved the battery problem nicely, the exchanged unit will standby for at least four days and operate for a couple of days with use.I took the phone to Mexico and used it for a week. It worked fine as long as it had a strong signal.  It seems to be very insensitive to cell signals and wifi although both were usable.  The real problem for me is the GPS.  It's so insensitive that it's useless.  I was trying to use the Sygic GPS offline maps to navigate the streets of Mexico City.  I rarely received enough satellites to get a GPS lock on my location.  I used my Samsung Galaxy 7\" tablet with the same software and it worked perfectly.  Even when the phone is in a place with a clear view of the sky it takes forever to find it's position and will frequently lose it  as soon as you start moving.I didn't have a chance to try the phone's 3G data network capabilities since I didn't have a data planVoice calls sounded great and I rarely experienced and dropouts.  Texting was easy to use.Overall I like the phone enough to keep it in spite of it's shortcomings.  The size is perfect for a pocket phone and the Android system works as it should.  I only experienced one system crash over a period of a week.  If you're looking for a basic Android phone that's easy to use, has good sound, and GPS isn't a priority then you might like this phone.
