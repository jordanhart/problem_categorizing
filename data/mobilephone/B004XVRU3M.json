Unpacked it, installed one of the 2 batteries and turned it on. It asked to insert sim so I put my T-mobile sim card in it and it powered up and worked fine. paired with my Plantronics Voyager Pro bluetooth headset and worked well. I inserted a micro sd card and it recognized it quickly but when I took it out the bezel around the face of the watch and the power button fell off. I did get them back on but still it was not very secure. I then charged both batteries and and wen to bed.I decided to wear it today while I helped a friend move. After about 6 hours, I looked to check the time and the screen was blank. I though the battery had died so, when I got home I installed the spare battery. Still would not power up. The bezel did not fall off today, until I changed the battery then I had to put it on again.I have contacted Amazon about return and am waiting for reply, but one thing has me rather puzzled. In the listing, it says that the item is sold by PGD Group and Fulfilled By Amazon. Which means that Amazon is supposed to handle customer service for FBA orders. However, when I visited the returns page for the item I saw this notice.\"This order was sold and shipped by an Amazon SellerUpon completing this page, the details of this return will be sent to the seller for approval.

Otherwise, we'll need to wait for the seller to review this return request and provide a label or instructions on how to return your items.\"Now I am curious as to how this will affect my return and refund.I will update this when the process is complete.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The watch is OK", "Author": "james wilborn", "ReviewID": "R36C7LFOAZ25F9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The additional battery that was included never took a charge.

I just plugged in my sim card and dialed. What I would have a complaint is on what they charged me for the shipping , so watch out for this matter before buying ,I simply confused the shipping thinking that it was a total plus another item I sent for. The watch is good and has a lot of features for something so small, no body has that item here so I will be the first to show it off!!", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Waldemar Koziol", "ReviewID": "R2JLK5SJRT9TEN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Works in USA and Europe.
