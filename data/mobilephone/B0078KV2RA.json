{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good cheap, no data plan required phone.", "Author": "Jefferson B.", "ReviewID": "R13NTX3CCXJU3W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the best feature phones you can get without having to get a data plan. The screen is sharp and contrast is great. The main issue is the lack of an LED flash and it is easy to turn it off by mistake when it is locked. It doesn't ask you to confirm if you want to shut down.  Also the on screen keyboard is a little smaller than I would have liked.  Connect it to your WiFi to pull down updates without having to use your cellular data as there are updates available for the phone..Worked with AT&T; US without having to configure anything. Uses a micro sim so you'll need to cut it yourself or get a cutter if you are currently using a standard size sim.Overall, a nice phone that you don't have to have a data plan for.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "not good at all", "Author": "teresa", "ReviewID": "RM3MO63WRJJF2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone brand new as a gift for a friend ,the phone was not taking charge, neither was it turning on.How embarrassed was this.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly nice phone at a surprisingly great price!", "Author": "Book Glutton", "ReviewID": "REY68WUG4TWFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a backup for my Nokia 808 PureView Black Factory Unlocked 41MP GPS. The screen is a bit smaller. The camera is only 5mp. However, the functionality and the capability are hardly noticeable when comparing the two in day-by-day operations (excluding the camera, because the Nokia 808 is an incredible camera that lets you make phone calls and organize your life). The same Apps are available, including Microsoft Mobile Office and the Opera Mini Web Browser (pretty much the same that is available for Androids and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 32 GB). One great difference is that the Nokia 603 cost me only a fraction of the price I paid and would have to pay for a new Nokia 808. I feel that this is a great bargain to be able to carry so much of my life around with me on a small phone: hundreds of contacts, my Outlook calendar, 32GB of Audiobooks in mp3 format + so many other things. Who needs and iPhone or Samsung Galaxy?", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA... will give another try", "Author": "Gang", "ReviewID": "RPACRQXBJNCII", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I know Nokia build solid phones. and the price is so good for the features. So, I bought it from Breed store on Amazon. The phone comes dead as brick. It won't turn on. It won't charge. No response to any touch. Happily , Amazon took the return.
