It's not completely a smartphone since the platform that it runs (WebOS by HP) is not a smartphone company. However, you can download tons of free apps & it's as fast as any other smart phone out there. It's like the underdog of the competition. So don't slack on it.I ordered the phone through one-day shipping so it got here fast and came in a legit sprint phone box that looks fresh out of a sprint store. Everything that Sprint would give you with the phone, was included in this package. The phone also didn't cost that much either. With over-night shipping included, it only came to $60. For this phone and this shipping quality, that's a bargain.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small, small, small", "Author": "KJ", "ReviewID": "R1ZL3S4UKER46K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is very small and not really designed for people with larger fingers/hands.

It has a camera (not fancy or high quality, but definitely acceptable), web browsing, gps etc... and it works just great!  I would recommend this for young users or for anyone that needs something affordable and totally user friendly.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Phone! Replaced My Blackberry Bold", "Author": "Olivia", "ReviewID": "R36PO92GBAF37O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-Easy to use-GREAT simplified calendar-SMS format/layout is easy, simple and cute-Touch works well-Fast internet connection(compared to the slug BB speed) even without WiFi-Buttons are softer plastic, easier to type on even though they are small-Fun way of exiting apps, flick them off the screen-Battery lasts about 1.5 days for me. Med-moderate use, texting, phone calls, reading news between classes and checking email.Cons:-App catalog is lacking-->Fewer free apps,-Restart takes about 5 mins-Menu/phone operating takes some getting used to-Few options as far as customization of phone settings, like back-light, font, notifications, menu style, email notification.-I can't figure out how to delete preloaded Sprint apps, (about 10) they clutter my menus.-NO SPELL CHECK, AT ALL-->I've looked. No update, no patch, nothing to help out a poor speller like myself. Has 'auto correct', changes abbreviations to full words.. Not very helpful.-->I downloaded a free dictionary app to check myself, still a major inconvenienceOver All:-100% happier with this simple, intuitively designed little phone than I was with my BB Bold.

Both epic fails.Spent hours trying to upgrade to newest (1.4.5) WebOS given app catalog would not work.Finally took to local Sprint store where they graciously spent approximately 5 hours trying to upgrade WebOS and get the phone to work. They were unsuccessful.Tried to call HP customer service, their website customer service number is DISCONNECTED.Returning phone for refund. HP/Palm, I will never consider another product from you again.Amazon as always was fantastic and refunded me without question.

I've had and iPhone, Android, and Blackberry before this, and I have to say that palm is way ahead of the game as far as operating systems go. The specific phone I had just prior to this was a Blackberry, and although I liked it, it was starting to act up and do all sorts of crazy crap. I needed a new phone but wasn't due for an upgrade. I had a friend who had owned a Palm previously, and her only complaint was the apps. This, I must confess, is a major drawback, which I personally can't understand. Palm is light-years ahead of even the iPhone as far as how the phone actually FUNCTIONS. If they could take the WebOS system Palm uses and put it in an android phone with a 7\" screen and an onscreen keyboard, everyone would love it once they tried it. So why palm can't get better apps is beyond me. Apparently it's gone downhill since HP bought it out, but the phone still functions great and I highly recommend it.It takes good pictures(better than iPhone pictures, but not super great either).I love the card feature for apps so you can move on to something new and whatever you were working on is still there and you can come back to it later.It's so simple to just plug it in and load/unload music and pictures in the blink of an eye.The calendar is, in the vernacular, \"boss\".Email and facebook work like a charm, and what may be fast becoming my favorite perk of this phone is the CHARGING STONE/TOUCHSTONE that palm comes with! How is it that palm is the only phone with that? What the heck?! It's BRILLIANT! All I have to do is set my freaking phone on the freaking stone and voila! It's charging and securely held in place!Music plays great on it. Everything I can't get an app for that I want to do, I can pretty much do through the browser.One thing negative I will say is that this phone is not great for gamers. I don't play games on my phone so I don't have that problem, but this, I understand, is a major turn-off for people who want to play words with friends, hanging with friends, and whatever else people waste battery time doing. And once again, this is palm's own fault. If the only drawback is stupid little app games like that, why the hell NOT offer them for people? Do what you have to do to move the dang product, and this product is sublime. It's the perfect professional phone, the essential blend of blackberry and iPod meets something even better than either. If the only thing standing in the way of that is a couple apps...get the dang apps and give people what they want.

This showed me that newer isn't always better.The palm had all the things the Xpert had but it was smaller and easier to carry especially in my bra (don't judge me). My favorite thing is how you can navigate what you have open, with the palm you can open numerous windows and apps and have them open see them and move easily between them this is not the case with some other \"smart\"phones. I also liked pandora on the palm better than other phones. It had good audio and I prefer the QWERTY board because of my nails, they aren't talons but they do get in the way sometimes especially because I text more than I talk. The spell check was better and the auto correct wasn't as jerky. I just prefer it. I wish that they would come out with another one just a little upgraded with a bigger screen.

It's not even worth what I paid for it. Seriously, it is that terrible. Do not get this phone, even for free. If somebody offers you this phone, punch them in the face because this phone is an abortion.Bullet points on why this phone sucks:- Cover is confusing to remove- Randomly goes to the power down screen for no reason.- Sometimes powers off when you're in the middle of something even if the thing is fully charged.- Takes a long time to power up. When combined with the above, this can be extremely frustrating.- Not many apps are compatible with it.- YouTube player is of poor quality.- Texts sometimes go out slow or not at all.- Sometimes the screen orientation shifts when you barely turn the phone and sometimes it takes several good hard turns of the phone to get it to shift.- Web pages often don't load all the way.Seriously, DO NOT BUY OR OTHERWISE OWN THIS PHONE! IT IS ELECTRONIC GARBAGE!", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Out dated, but OK for Non Social Media People", "Author": "J.
