I believe wholeheartedly that BREED sold me a returned item. The back cover of the phone was not properly closed and when I opened the inside box, ALL the components that came with phone are out of their plastic bags and the bags were bunched up and shoved into the comers and under the components. I don't care how cheap the phone is I still paid for a new one. The USB cable doesn't even fit in the port all the way. There were other slight problems with the phone but at this point it doesn't even matter because I'm returning the phone regardless. I'm very weary of BREED as a seller. It's a shame that they seem to be among the very few people who sell BLU phones on Amazon if not I would stay away completely.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't handle basic cell phone functions", "Author": "shadow460", "ReviewID": "R1NKR2VCOMSS3N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone strictly as a backup while I'm between smart phones. It makes and takes calls as you'd expect, but unfortunately, no matter how hard we try, it's impossible to stop the barrage of text and multimedia messages. A simple multi recipient message was all it took to make this phone go completely crazy.The phone does not have facebook and social media functions like the description said. Again, it's just a backup, so that's OK. The TV function doesn't work. Again, just a backup phone, so no loss. It doesn't recognize all my ringtones. Again, it's a backup... you get the idea.Where I drew the line was when a simple message caused it to receive gibberish text messages at a rate of two to three a minute. I could no more put the phone down than it would ring again, and there would be more gibberish coming from the same source. Adding that source to the phone's blacklist did nothing to help--the \"messages\" came through even FASTER.I plugged my SIM cards into an unlocked Android, set up the APN, and the group message showed right up as it was meant to.IF you can convince your friends to never text you again, maybe this phone would be a good choice if you wash your Android like I did. IF you could disable text messaging on this phone (or through your provider), then maybe this would be a good spare phone.If all you want is a simple, basic, phone that makes and takes calls, then go buy that phone over there instead.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Did what I needed", "Author": "Arleen", "ReviewID": "RBXLH7XBMB6TB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For various family reasons, we needed to be able to make affordable voice calls back to the US while traveling in Costa Rica.

I have embraced the freedom of just having a basic phone. I don't need to check the weather every morning--I can look out the window like my ancestors did. I don't need to look at photos that are limited to only 3 inches. I don't need apps that more than waste my time. I don't need a music player which diverts me from engaging in conversations with real people. This phone from Blu--a Florida-based company is very functional. Call quality if fine--great volume, although just slightly muffled. There is jack for head phones, contrary to some reviews. the FM radio has very good reception and is easy to operate if you so inclined. There are many settings for the camera, including white balance! Texting is the old-fashioned way and its works great (texting is something I appreciate). The phone powers up from a shut down in just 8 seconds, and is ready to use. There are three ring tone to choose from and three message alerts as well. The menus are intuitive and a little more complicated than you would expect. The larger screen size is very nice and the graphics are bright, even if not the most crisp like you would see on a smart phone.I ride public transportation to work. Often, every direction I look there is a sea of humanity transfixed, seemingly by their gadgets. Many with earphones on and many playing games. One writer coined the term that we are \"amusing ourselves to death.\" I now think less about checking my emails (can do at home or at work computer) and getting sports scores and more about life and what's happening next to me and what I need to think about in order to grow as a human being. A cell hone is a nice convenience. This phone does the basics very well for such a low cost. And, another benefit, I was able to lower my data plan with AT&T; and saved over 70 dollars a month!

They have worked great as basic phones with SIM cards in both Europe and the US. Lycamobile offers unbelievably cheap never-expire pay-as-you-go deals in both Europe and the US (using T-mobile network in US). Fantastic battery life. Not great for texting since it is an old-school telephone keyboard with no predictive feature. They are really excellent alarm clocks..alarm still works when phone is completely turned off, so batteries last for weeks. Nice snooze function.They also have a nice LED flashlight that has come in handy many times. Strangely, what they don't have is a phone jack, even though they have an FM radio and mp3 player. Until recently I would have said that this phone with a Lycambile SIM and pay-as-you go is the very cheapest combo for simple low-use talk function out there. But now it looks like the BLU Aria (about ~$20) and BLU Zoey (about $18) are even cheaper AND have a headphone jack. So I would probably go with the Zoey instead.

I needed a \"local phone\" and spent time on Amazon looking for inexpensive phones that \"just worked\" and always saw BLU popping up in search results. I looked at the price and took a pass, figuring that they're not worth it at that price and looked at things that were 3x the cost.  But I took a chance and bought the Jenny TV 2.8 and figured, why not?I was pleasantly surprised.It's a quad-band GSM phone, so it'll work all over. The phone feels light and is very plastic-y, yet solid and took a few accidental drops without any issues. Swapping between local SIMs in Europe was no problem, and I appreciated this a lot. The call quality was nice. The Jenny TV did a halfway decent job of taking photos (for a $30 phone, I didn't expect much). What I did like the most was the fact that I could throw in up to a 32gb microSDHC card and use this as a mp3 player. I loved that it had a radio and worked well to try to listen to local music. The TV will only pick up analog signals, so it's virtually useless inside the US and will become more useless over time.
