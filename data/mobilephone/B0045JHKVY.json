At first I was having troubles linking the phone to my Facebook/Twitter/E-mail account and the default internet browser could not connect on the 3G network. I was about to send it back but I eventually got it to work. The battery life is horrible though so I would suggest buying a second battery if you are away from home all day. I went a day without charging it and the battery life was critically low at the end of they day. I only used it to text and maybe one or two small phone calls. Great phone though. The OS is amazing and it's working like a charm!Edit!!!!!I've had this phone for almost a month. 4 more days and I wouldn't be able to return it. I don't know if I got a faulty unit but the phone that I got is horrible!!! The facebook application quit working on me. I have tried re-installing, looked for updates and there are non available. I gave up on Facebook for this phone. I keep getting delayed text messages. The time it says on the text message is on average 5 min. before I actually get the message. I have 3G signal about 20% of the time (I live in the suburbs with an at&t; store right down the street so there shouldn't be any reason for this. Although I have at&t; it would've been better if the logo and at&t; software would've been erased. I paid for a FULLY unlocked phone so I expect a FULLY unlocked phone with no cell-phone company logo/software. The battery dies in less than a day. I'm a college student and an employee. I don't have time to charge my phone every 5 hours! I also don't like the idea of carrying my charger with me every where I go. The default browser on the phone doesn't work. I tried to go to pretty much every mainstream website out there and this is the message I get: Access to this URL has been blocked. Why on Earth would it be blocked in the first place?? It's not illegal to unlock your phone so is at&t; behind this? I plugged in brand new headphones for the first time and the tip of it broke off in the audio jack. I have tried every method in the book to get it out but it is really lodged in there. I don't believe it was a faulty headphone unit because unless it came covered in super glue then it is the audio jack in the phone's fault. I don't wish to open up the phone and remove it that way because I don't want to give the sellers a reason not to refund my money completely. I'm just going to send it back as is! I've never had such a bad experience with a product bought via Amazon.com. I originally rated this product 4 stars but I lowered to a 1 star. Again, it might just be that I got a faulty unit but this is completley unnacceptable and should be noted and published in the form of a review just to warn other shoppers what they might get. I hope no one else goes through this experience.Sincerely,One outraged shopper2nd Edit!I talked to their customer care service and they were prompt, friendly, and helpful.

Brady", "ReviewID": "R1TOK8OTGTISXI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned a number of phones over the years and I've never had a phone that breaks so easily as the HTC Aria does. I am now on my third one in seven months, after the screens of first two broke when they fell. I'm not the kind of person who is careless with their phones and I rarely drop them; the second one even had a silicon case on it. However, both broke on the first fall on a hard surface. The issue appears to be that the edge of the screen is exposed so any fall in which the phone lands on the edge will cause it to break. The only solution seems to be to get a bulky hard case for the phone, which kind of defeats one of the reasons for choosing the Aria, which is to get a smartphone that is relatively small. Otherwise, I am mostly happy with the functionality and performance of the phone. Too bad HTC made such an obvious mistake in the design.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice phone...when you can get it to work.", "Author": "dragonlp86", "ReviewID": "R1QPAEXRLZT32X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for about six months now.  When I say 'using this phone', I actually mean that I'm on my second one.  The first one I had to turn back in to AT&T; after about three months because the system kept crashing or locking up so that only taking the battery out would help.  AT&T; replaced it with what I assume was a refurbished version, and that fixed that problem.  So I thought.  For the past month, I have been fighting such slow response from the phone's operating system.  Text messages take anywhere from 2-5 minutes just to show up after someone sends them (even after you hear the chime) and the same for when you're trying to send them to someone.  And just earlier today, I was trying to view my text messages, and it got stuck on a 'loading' screen that I couldn't get past without turning the phone off.When the phone works, I'm happy and content with it.  I love the shortcuts and Andrdoid marketplace.  The MP3 player is also easy to use and load music on to, not to mention it's very easy to create your own ringtones.  But lately it's been working less and less often.  I'll definitely not be sending this one back for replacement.

I've always liked HTC's phsyical phone construction, and this phone was no different.  I found it easy to get the battery cover off, and never worried about anything breaking, even when dropped.  It's small and compact, fit very easily  into any pocket or bag.  Of course, it had no problems with my account on AT&T.;Cons - I knew it was smaller, I was unprepared for how small it really was.  I believe it's a 3.2\" screen?  Trying to type on it as a touch screen was a nightmare, and it didn't have the power to run voice to text well.  Perhaps an even bigger issue is the internal memory size - at 512MB, it runs out of space very quickly.  Performance was poor across the board.  It's inadequate for anything other than basic phone functions (calls, texts, contacts)I ended up loading Cyanogenmod onto it so I could better manipulate what little resources there are.  Once i had root and CM loaded, I was able to use simple2ext to extend its internal memory onto the 32GB add-on sd card.  Once I had 4GB internal, it was much easier to do what I needed to, but performance issues never went away completely.I swapped to a new phone as soon as I could get one that was half-decent.

The interface is very user-friendly; it has a very good layout, enabling simple and quick navigation. Physically, the phone is on the smaller side, making it easy to fit into a pocket of a pair of pants. However, for those who like to watch movies on their mobile devices, this is not for you. The screen is perfect for normal smart phone functions, but unfavorable for videos. There are two problems I had with this phone. First, the touch screen keyboard is terrible. Coming from five years of iPhone use (first geneneration, 3G, 3GS), HTC's touch input is tremendously sub-par in comparison. Second, the Intruder is not durable. I dropped it once from maybe two feet off the ground and screen cracked. But, then again, this cracked screen has held up for over a year. Overall, it's not a bad phone.
