{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid tablet, works great in the US on T-Mobile", "Author": "Wayne \"Omegafiler\"", "ReviewID": "R33TYW8VZXCUHG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SM-P605 vs SM-P600I'm going to focus on the SM-P605 specific features of this tablet as there are already a ton of reviews for the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition). Although most are the Wi-Fi only version, which is model SM-P600. This version we have here is the international LTE version, SM-P605. Unfortunately these international versions rarely support the US LTE bands, so we're stuck with 3G/4G (i.e. 1900 MHz) here in the US.The P605 also has a Snapdragon 800 instead of the Samsung Exynos processor. I'll go into more details below. Otherwise in addition to the data & phone capabilities of the P605, they are virtually identical. Or a another comparison might be that this is basically a really big Galaxy Note 3 with a USB 2.0 port and higher resolution.NETWORK PERFORMANCEWith T-Mobile in my area (Austin, TX) I'm in a \"re-farmed\" area. In other words, they've taken some 1900 2G spectrum and re-purposed it for 4G connectivity. If you have AT&T;, they already use 1900 so you're good to go. But it is nice to be able to have multiple carrier choices, when possible. I do get a strong signal in my area, although I'm only seeing about 2.5MB to 5MB down with H+. This is likely due to limited bands and network limitations. T-Mobile likes to use the 1700 and 2100 bands (AWS) together for 4G, which this tablet doesn't have. My Galaxy Note 3 phone on T-Mobile 4G/LTE can easily see 20+ down and 15+ on HSPA+.I'm hoping future network improvements will help those speeds, otherwise it's more than enough for surfing, Skype calls, or even streaming High Quality YouTube videos.PHONE (VOICE)Yes, the P605 has an actual phone modem built-in to just like my Galaxy Note 3 does. I popped in my T-Mobile pre-paid SIM that gives me 100 minutes, unlimited text, and 5GB of data ($30/mo) and it works great. I can make phone calls and still have access to a ton of data. Why make phone calls on a tablet? Because it's awesome, that's why. :)Seriously though, while making tablet phone calls isn't something I do all that often (i.e. rarely), it is nice having Google Voice forward calls to multiple devices and being able to answer when and wherever I want. It's all about flexibility and having options.TABLET PERFORMANCEI've owned the SM-P600 (Wi-Fi Only) and now the SM-P605. I really wasn't a big fan of the performance in the P600/Exynos. I frequently found lag and stutter throughout it's usage. The UI worked OK, but switching apps and multi-tasking was a bit annoying. Once I moved over the P605 I found everything to run much smoother. Now that is not to say it's all 100% perfect. There is still an occasional stutter here and there, usually app related, which shouldn't even be an issue with a $600 tablet... but it's far more livable.For most usage such as switching apps, playing video, multi-tasking, navigation the UI, games, surfing, all work about as well as they do on my Galaxy Note 3; maybe just not *quite* as smooth at times when certain apps get in the way. Keep in mind this tablet is pushing a lot more pixels than my phone. And I'm personally very sensitive to frame rates and such. Although I'm hopeful future updates will continue to improve in this regard.Let's wrap this up with my overall Pro's & Con's, even though I didn't touch on most of this stuff due to many other reviews already covering it.PROS:* Noticeable performance improvement with Snapdragon 800* Built-in Phone Modem (Accepts normal Phone SIM)* Supports 1900 Mhz Band for US 3G/4G Data* Excellent 2560x1600 (WQXGA) LCD* Solid high-end specs* Light weight and portable (~1.2lb)* Finally a tablet good enough to keep* Descent sounding speakers (for a tablet)* Great battery life, even on 3G/4G* MicroSD Card Slot* Textured back feels nice to hold* Unlocked!CONS:* Would like to see further performance improvements* No US LTE Band Support (or AWS)* No USB 3.0 Port* Fixed home/navigation buttons can be annoying* Plastic bezel looks cheap* TouchWiz still too heavy (resource hog)* ExpensiveCONCLUSIONI returned the SM-P600 after about a week of usage before I even got the SM-P605. I had almost given up on Samsung tablets, but I'm glad I kept looking! The tablet has handled everything I've reasonably asked of it and even gives me added flexibility of basically having both a smaller and larger portable voice and data communication device. It'll do. :)", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Mariela", "ReviewID": "R17A77EL9KRAEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "easy, good to write with pen, fast. you can do many things with the pen, good colors and graphics. love it!!", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "a wonderful machine!!", "Author": "AMAR", "ReviewID": "R3FP739HIKA81I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a tablet as good as computer + the benefits of android system.super fast & reliable. a tablet that can match & beat apple tablets.it a slot for micro sim & micro sd card with full hd visual display!!i am waiting for t mobile 4g sim card with world roaming & enjoy internet all the time.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet 4g", "Author": "Roberto Ferreira Filho", "ReviewID": "RVTB9N0EITLLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is a ver fast tablet,  4g works very will in Brasil.

At least where I live this means that I don't get LTE on T-Mobile, but this may vary from place to place since different carriers have different LTE bands in different places. I didn't really get it for the LTE anyway so that's not a big issue for me.Also, someone else mentioned it was set to Chinese. At least the one I got, it turns out it's the version normally sold in Hong Kong (by looking at the exact firmware version you can find out, mine was P605OZSBMJ6). This isn't a big deal though, the first screen that comes up, the first drop down menu is a language picker, so you can easily change it to whatever you want. The default keyboard has features for Chinese typing and seems inferior overall for English but you can just install a different keyboard.This is actually my third Note device. I previously owned the Note 10.1 2012 and I have the Note 3. I've usually felt that the S Pen features were kind of gimmicky (I just use it to take notes) but on this version they are actually pretty nice IMO. But S Note is pretty unresponsive which makes it frustrating to use; I just use Papyrus.Build quality seems pretty good, I'm one of those who doesn't mind Samsung's plastic obsession and I actually really like the fake leather because it's more grippy than the slimey plastic they used to use.The hardware keys are kind of dumb, since tablets are used in portrait quite often I'm not sure why Samsung put them there. I often end up hitting back while reading, and it's just disorienting in general to use in portrait now. A definite step back from last year's model.Screen resolution is quite good of course, text is much sharper than the old 1280x800 tablets. The colors are a little weird to me, but it might be just because all my phone have been AMOLED which has different color characteristics and tends to be oversaturated.Software wise, I used to prefer vanilla Android (usually using a ROM like CyanogenMod) but as of yet no AOSP ROMs are available (though I intend to try to port one) and I actually am finding that I don't mind the stock software. Samsung's additions are mostly useful, multiwindow is actually implemented really well, and nothing seems laggy or slow. Well, S Note is actually kind of laggy, but I use Papyrus anyway.Specific to my unit:Not sure if this is common, but on the one I got the box was already opened (the seal was broken on one side). All the stickers and screen protectors were in place but it's still pretty shady that the box was opened. I bought mine from Mobile Front. I wouldn't make a big deal about it except it randomly rebooted when I went to install Swift Key. So far it has not done this again but if it happens repeatedly I will have to take action. Either way, it's pretty lame that the box was opened.Bottom line, this seems like it could be a good tablet, but I just hope I didn't get stuck with a returned unit or something.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Language issue", "Author": "Thanh Phan", "ReviewID": "RMK0BPKIMCGY4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just received last night, Didn't have much time to play with it yet, the Galaxy Note is nice and fast.
