Both questions were answered in minutes. Phone same sealed in OEM box. There was also another box that included an adapter to convert the EU plug to US, directions on how to change language to English and instructions on how to setup APN to get HPSA+ speeds. Those weren't quite correct. If you're only getting edge speeds make sure to apply the following settings:Name: AT&T;APN: wap.cingularProxy: leave blankPort: leave blankUsername:WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COMPassword:CINGULAR1Server: leave blankMMSC: [...]MMS Proxy: wireless.cingular.comMMS Port: 80MCC:310MNC:410APN Type: leave blankIf you're a Mac user like me, make sure to download android.com/filetransfer. Otherwise the device won't show up on your computer.This phone simply put is amazing. I like iOS and I now have come to like Android. I don't see one phone as better. They both are great in their own ways. However, if like me you've been using iOS since 2007 or even the last year. The galaxy 3 definitely provides a breath of fresh air.I won't get into specs. There is no lag what so ever on the device and it is very fluid.As far as S-Voice. For the person that said it only comes in German. I can kind of see their complaint. When you first turn the device on you can set the language to English. However, when you launch S-Voice. It is still in German by default and you have to click the right arrow through several screens of German text before you can change the language. Typically the right arrow is ok/accept, so I was able to guess my way through it. Realistically though one would assume you only need to set the language once so I don't blame them. Again you can set S-Voice to English as well as other languages.The 4.8 inch screen is beautiful. Having an iPhone and iPad 3, I find this screen large enough to serve both purposes. I can comfortably browse, watch videos as well as read books.The browser is great as well. The larger screen again helps and it is nice that you can take advantage of flash.The rear camera uses the same parts as the iPhone 4S so expect similar quality. However, the camera has a ton of settings. Almost as many as stand alone cameras. The front camera on the S3 is higher quality and very crisp. One thing that I hadn't heard mention of was the LED flash. BE CAREFUL. In a completely dark room I literally temporarily blinded myself. In that respect it blows the iPhone 4S away in my opinion so I did get better night pictures.I didn't want to get too technical as for many they're just looking for a great screen, fluid OS and great browser / camera.

I got this this afternoon.  Cut down my Sim to a micro...stuck it in and zoom.  Quandrant was 5476.  ICS is so fluid and easy.  TouchWiz is amamzing also.  This is quad core and it is hard to keep up with.  The only thing I have noticed so far is when you push the home button it really seems to lag to get back to the home screen.  Maybe haven't tuned up all the settings though.  I played with the One X at ATT.  The real difference is the sound on the SIII is LOUD and clear.  Plus, the fact of having an SD card and replaceable battery was the no brainer decision for me.  The only other real problem with this and the One X is that in six months, or less, they will be outdated.  Oh Yes, S Voice takes longer than Siri, but the replies seem to in more detail.

I was excited about upgrading to the S3.  The reviews convinced me to make the switch.  I've had the phone for about a week and although I think it has some wonderful features, there are just too many glitches.  Here are the two main issues I've encountered:1.  It seems impossible to connect the phone to a PC or a Mac.  I tried to connect the phone to several PCs, and I always received an error message about the computer being unable to install a driver.  This seems to be a widespread issue: googling this problem turns up many complaints in various forums.  I also tried to connect the phone via the Samsung Kies program that comes in a Mac version, and that also failed.  This is a pretty basic thing that you want to do with your phone.  It's unacceptable that it doesn't work.  I spent quite a few hours on the phone with Samsung tech support.  I discovered that if I revert the phone back to factory default, it can connect to my PC.  But once I've used it and installed a very few apps, connectivity is lost.2.  Less of an issue, I think it's resolved.  However, shortly after getting the phone, it was unable to connect to the internet.  I tried all solutions to the problem, but couldn't resolve it.  Then, mysteriously, several hours later connectivity resumed.I'm always nervous about being an early adopter, and I think in this case those who rush out to get this phone are going to suffer inconvenience as these bugs are resolved.PS I finally returned the phone, and this one is able to connect to my PC and my Mac.  I was careful to connect the phone and install the drivers right out of the box, before setting up any accounts or downloading any apps.  It's also a different sim card.  Who knows if it was a hardware issue or something involving the configuration of my phone.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like it... but....", "Author": "L. Breda \"L.\"", "ReviewID": "R271CK07F7VL95", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My relationship with the Samsung Galaxy S3 has so far been a fairly good one. It runs circles around my iPhone 4 speed wise while browsing the web on the go, the screen is a really nice size for browsing and video chatting, and there is no lag when unlocking or swiping from screen to screen. The battery life is fairly decent getting a full days use with moderate email, web browsing, text messaging, and Pandora listening.There are a few gripes I have with this device. Let me start out by saying that I am extremely careful with my electronics, I hate cases because I feel like they cover up the true beauty of my new gadgets so I like to leave them bare. The Galaxy S3 is very easily chipped and scratched. While the screen stays scratch free my main gripe is with the backside and especially the bezel. Both get marred extremely easily. The back can be easily replaced with a new Samsung back to make it look like new, but once the bezel is marked your screwed.I also have to say that I have some call quality trouble. If I hold the phone flat to my ear the person on the other end of the line struggles to hear me. I have found that I have to hold the phone at an angle away from my mouth, this feels really unnatural and I can easily forget to do it, which results in me having to repeat things when I realize the person on the other end thinks they have lost me. It is VERY frustrating!As far as the android system goes if you have previously had an iPhone you will find yourself feeling like a kid in a candy shop when you get around to customizing the S3. But like a kid in a candy shop, you will also find yourself not caring after you have had the phone for a few weeks.Another HUGE issue is the key pad. I am a huge text-er and I have yet to find an onscreen keypad on a phone that rivals the iPhone keypad. The S3 is VERY responsive but it is still not up to par with the iPhone. I get pretty frustrated when typing long emails or texts, as they need allot of correcting after I am done. The auto correct is awful and I recommend that you turn it off if you don't want to throw your S3 in a frustrated rage.Overall if your wondering if you should get this phone I think you should decide what is most important to you. If web browsing is your thing, then the S3 is a good choice because of its bigger screen and lighting fast speed.I am happy using this phone until my contract is up in a few months, I don't think I love it so much I will want to use it beyond that. In my opinion I like the iPhone better, its OS might be stale and boring, its screen might be extremely tiny, and its 3g speeds lagging far behind the S3's 4G, but its smoother, simpler, and more reliable and in my opinion sturdier and better made to hold up to scratches and dings.Overall the S3 is one of the best phones available on the market, it is a phone that will do whatever you need it to do well.

We bought our first phone on Amazon from  SHOPEBEST , Using AmazonPrime the phone arrived the next day, It came in authentic Samsung packaging and was of the same quality as our retail bought S2's. after a short battery charge i inserted my sim card, changed the apn settings and away i went !! The phone has been rock solid reliable, the battery life is EXCELLENT, twice the life of my former S2. The phone was extremely easy to set up as far as changing the on screen language and time zones.. I was very afraid of this part after reading other reviews, but it was so simple an 8 year old could do it.. Sometimes i wonder what is wrong with these other reviewers, To sum it up the phone is very dependable, has great battery life, 3G works excellent and has a great internal WiFi card. If your tired of paying over $100 a month to the big cell companies, buy this phone and obtain a sim card from the inexpensive companies like straighttalk/tracfone and get unlimited everything for less than $50 bucks a month..

Amazon needs to hold them accountable. I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300 from (My Wish-List). I am stationed overseas and had a close friend bring it to me. I received a phone that looked like a Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300. It was even in a Galaxy S3 box. It also had a factory screen protector that had Quad Core written on it. It was also missing the charger that is suppose to come with it. When I got back to a laptop I plugged it in and noticed it was searching for a T999 Galaxy S3, which is from T-mobile. I proceeded to take the battery out and look at the back label. It's listed as I9300 which is a European model Exynos CPU. The EMEI number matches the one in settings, about phone. The hardware inside is from T999 T-mobile version. CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 1.5 dual core inside a European made frame....shady to say the least. I have no way of getting anything accomplished this far from the US. But I can do lots of damage online. I will be making a video of my phone and experience with Amazon and My Wish List. Amazon you are just as responsible. I am not the only that this has happened to, there are many. As I keep reading their negative reviews it is starting to add up... Buyer beware.....AMAZON BEWARE.

I tried to put a review up on the US version, but Amazon wouldn't let me.  So hopefully this helps out people deciding to get the US version of the phone.  In case people are wondering this is for the Sprint network.The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version.I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great!  Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion.  (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet.  I signed up and got a free $10 to use.  (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but there is no 4G LTE on the Sprint Network.  Other networks such at AT&T; and Verizon should be better, but I'm stuck with 3G speeds for now.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X.  The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "From Apple fanboy to S3 Fanatic", "Author": "PersianPride", "ReviewID": "R29ITCGR3UMQ8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that I've been using iPhone's for years and know them like the back of my hand; however, the iPhone has been getting increasingly boring as it is so restricted.  So I decided to try out the S3 and my mind has been blown!  There is a learning curve if you've never used an Android device before, to be honest the first few weeks I disliked this device, that was until I truly figured out how to use the open source formatting to the fullest potential.  In order to have the iPhone compete with the S3 in anyway you would have to jailbreak it (which voids warranty), whereas with the S3 you simple can download ROMs/Launchers from the play store.  I would highly suggest goLauncher, it allows you to customize your SMS screen, icons, docks, widgets, transition effects, you name it this launcher can customize it.  There are several other great launchers, such as NovaLauncher and ApexLauncher that completely customize the look and performance of your S3 as well.  Another great addon is to either download Swiftkey or Touchpal from the app store, both are fantastic keyboards that blow the iPhone's out of the water.  Another powerful aspect of this phone is the fantastic camera!  The flash of this camera is far brighter than the iPhone's.  Not only that but there are so many features of the camera that make it so much more functional.  For starters the front facing camera is crisp and clean, while the iphones is so pixelated and cheap looking.  There are also several features such as \"smile shot\" which will automatically take a picture when the person smiles.  You can also change the scene effects, for instance if you choose \"night\" the camera takes superb images in very low light, while the iPhone struggles to focus . I will say that the S3 in some ways does have a few flaws:1. Power button placement is on the right side, it would be far better if it were on the top like other smartphones2. S3 has no volume switch that would allow it to be set to vibrate quickly3. The back material feels like cheap plastic once removedNow lets compare that to the flaws of the iPhone:1. Small screen, which looks even smaller after viewing an S32. Can't change the theme, icons, transition effects, etc.  the iPhone is not customizable at all!3. No live wallpapers4. Kiddish app store, you will find several mature apps in the Android market5. No widgets (there are numerous clock, calendar, and statusbar widgets for Android6. Heavy and blocky feeling, while the S3 is thin and light7. You can't download jailbroken apps from the app store; however, you can download rooted apps (Android equivalent of jailbreaking) straight from the android market.  This means less malware and viruses.8. No external memory, that means if you buy a 16GB iphone you will only have 16Gb of storage, the android has removable cards that can add 34GB and even 64GB of storage for all your photos, music, and videos.  The only way to get more room on the iPhone is to delete stuff you already have.I could go on and on with the flaws of the iPhone compared to the S3!  So in conclusion the S3 decimates the iPhone, trust me when I say that! The only people that would prefer an iPhone over the S3 are the technological illiterate or simply casual users who just want to text and call.  If either are the case then just buy a prepaid phone, because for the price of the iPhone you're throwing your money away. The iPhone 5 will also fail miserably to the S3, do you know why? It's because the iPhone is about money and not making drastic changes that will satisfying the customers; for instance, they don't allow memory cards because they want you to spend more money upgrading, they don't allow rooted/jailbroken apps in their app store because they don't want you to simply download apps that can create wifi hotspots for free.  The only way you can truly believe the iPhone 5 will be the king is if you've never experience a true open source phone like the S3 or you're simply too technologically ignorant to know how to use it.  So you have the choice buy the iphone 4s or wait for the iphone 5 and the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want or you can buy the S3 and see how deep the rabbit hole really goes.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone makes talking a pleasure", "Author": "dmchenry35", "ReviewID": "R1CNN4FBKM474Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not to often that a phone is actually used for a phone these days, but with the Galaxy SIII ([...]) it works like a charm!I've used this exact version overseas as well as in the USA and its by far the best phone out there right now.

Note that the good far outweigh the bad.SoftwareAs with all smart phones, Samsung occasionally issues updates for their operating system.  With their most recent update they forced installation of several pieces of bloatware (junk apps that you can't delete).  This adds to the tons of bloatware that came with the phone in the first place.  Hey Samsung: if we want these apps, we'll download them.KeyboardObviously there is no physical keyboard which is a difficult adjustment coming from a Droid with a really nice slide out keyboard.  The auto spell, auto completion and whatever other 'smart' editors are available are just junk so you're left with a virtual keyboard where you have to poke around to hit your letters.  Fortunately the screen is huge so it's easy to use relative to, say, the iphone.Useless FeaturesThe feature where the screen stays on if you're looking at it simply does not work.  I've been using my GSIII for almost 4 months now and the feature has never activated (indicated by an eye icon that pops up) regardless of lighting except for about 5 times while not even looking at the phone.Another bad thing is the alarm clock's fancy features.  The phone is supposed to hear you say \"snooze\", \"sleep\" or a couple other similar words.  This is supposed to turn the alarm off for a few minutes and then try again.  However, my first word in the morning is usually a groan and the GSIII hears this and interprets it as \"Please turn my alarm off and do not wake me again.\"  That's right, it not only doesn't \"snooze\" or \"sleep\", it just turns off.  I recommend not trying this feature if you really do have to get up early.GlitchesThe GSIII is not immune to freezing and occasionally requires a restart although the need to pull the battery has been rare.Be careful because if you turn on tethering (a service that costs extra) and then turn it of, you will get a pop up message frequently that tells you tethering is turned off and will bump you out of any writing you're doing (i.e. will erase a text message you're working on.)Adjusting the volume isn't as simple as the hard buttons make it seem; I still haven't figured out how to make my text messages silent without vibrating.The cameraOkay, we all know how good the picture quality is.  Let's kick it up a notch.  How about optical image stabilization?  How about optical zoom, even if it's only 10 or 20 mm?  Where is the native video editor like iphone has?Wi-FiWhile my PCs and all other connected devices blaze on my home network, my GSIII usually tells me I have a poor connection and won't connect, even with full signal.  This is pretty bad since I'm on a somewhat limited 3G plan (we don't get 4G here yet) and I don't even have the best signal for that.That's about all of the bad I've encountered with my phone.  Overall I love it although some Samsung-specific software changes would go a long way towards making this the perfect option.  I am hopeful that the GSIV will have a next gen camera and possibly even a slide out keyboard option.

Baker", "ReviewID": "R36NYMFIK76CSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone works very well with very good battery life. With moderate to heavy use I can get over 24 hours. Going all day is not an issue.Yes, it is only 3G in order to own the quad core. The U.S. 4G dual cores will be out soon.On WiFi I can download large Flash intensive pages in 2-3 seconds. Faster than anything I have seen. On 3G it appears to be as fast as Sprint Epic 4G Touch (in 3G mode). Maybe the Sprint Galaxy S2 is faster in 4G mode but I haven't tested it against my other phone. The AT&T; 3G is reaching spots where Sprint 3G and 4G were not getting. And as a disclaimer, I am not a fan of AT&T.; Reception seems very good. No dropped calls and it is perfect inside my house (which has been very difficult for almost every other phone I have owned). I have not tested reception extensively.I pay about $140 a month with no contract for service. That is unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 5GB/mo of data. A bit pricey.There are a couple of things I dislike about the operating system, but it is overwhelmingly an upgrade from Android 2.3.6. The camera is not quite as fantastic as I was hoping for. But maybe that is because the S2 camera is so good, it was hard to improve on it. I am talking about picture quality, not features. The picture quality of my S2 seems better.The notification system is all or none. You get beeped for a text, but also for every new email. Wish that wasn't the case.I really like the S2 screen. There is something about it, the S3 cannot top. I do like the fact the screen is bigger on the S3.One question I had was the charger. It came with a U.S. 110 Volt charger and not the European 220V. That was good to see. It is compatible with Samsung's other chargers.Overall, a fantastic phone. A good upgrade for S2 users with a few caveats.

My previous phone (and main reference point) was the original Droid, which had served me pretty well.  I'd been following the hype about the Galaxy S3's release for months, and in my experience--after a bump in the road or two--it's met my expectations.First, I had upgraded to the Razr Maxx initially, and returned it to get the Samsung because of the Samsung's better specifications that may translate into faster speeds.  My biggest concern was whether I'd regret the loss of the Razr Maxx's massive battery, and when I discovered during the first two weeks of use that my Galaxy S3 was draining rapidly on standby, I was not happy at all.  After being fully charged, leaving it unused overnight (but unplugged) would drain 35% of the battery by morning.  I applied the battery-conserving features, to no noticeable effect. I installed the Juice Defender app, to no noticeable effect.  I called Verizon tech support many times, receiving wildly different responses, from \"that's normal\" to the reasonable suggestion that I install the Phone Info app, allowing me to turn off 4G reception  at night.  All to no noticeable effect.  I called Samsung twice.  No help.I finally removed an app or two, stopped the unwanted Backup service, and played around with the phone and, suddenly, no more draining.  If I leave it unplugged overnight, I'll lose only 5-10%, which is reasonable since it does receive emails and flash LED lights, etc. I wish I knew exactly what solved the problem, but it's a mystery to me (and apparently Verizon and Samsung as well).  Bottom line: I've yet to come close to running out of juice after a full day's use.The phone itself is well-designed.  Although the screen is quite large, it  causes no problem in my pocket and I don't find it difficult to grip or manipulate. It's slim, and reasonably sturdy--although not quite as solid as the Kevlar-backed Razr Maxx, it's not cheap-feeling. With Ice Cream Sandwich it has a variety of clever functions, including one that keeps the screen on as long as it detects someone looking at it (if you want it to), a good 8mp camera (plus a forward-facing camera for video chatting) that snaps pictures immediately and will take bursts of shots (if you want it to), the ability to edit videos you take, automatic dialing of contacts that you're texting, and so on.  It all works pretty smoothly (although the Facebook interactivity is poor for some reason).The phone can be very fast, at least when 4G LTE is available, which isn't a given even if there's 4G service in the area--it varies from moment to moment. Don't expect instant page-loading all the time.

Since then, I have been playing around with it and setting up all the apps from my previous phone (HTC Inspire). Activating the phone was quite simple and easy, AT&T; Customer support was extremely helpful. The phone has lived up to its expectations from what I have been reading on the web so far. However, it is too thin and the (cheap) plastic back is slippery. One has to be extremely careful handling the phone. I'm thinking of buying a bulky cover so that I feel the phone in my hand when I'm using it. The big screen is awesome. A little hard navigate with one hand, but it is manageable. The quality of the screen and the colors is excellent.My biggest peeve on my old phone was the battery life. I had to charge HTC Inspire almost 3 times a day. Samsung Galaxy 3 seems to withstand my moderate use, with 50% battery consumed per day. This is a big win for me. I use the phone to check e-mails, catch up on news and Facebook, couple of YouTube videos and a few phone calls (I do not use texting), pretty average use. The 4GLTE is wicked fast. So far, I'm very happy I made the switch.The phone looses one star because of the cheap plastic back, which makes the phone slippery. Probably it is just a matter of getting used to it. The Motorola Droid is supposed to have a bigger battery.

Just got this phone Friday (July 20th) so I haven't tested out all the features. But I still say that it's just amazing and worth every penny. Apple fan boys beware cause Samsung is here to stay. The phone is extremely light and the display is very big and beautiful. The phone does look big at first, however web browsing, reading books and playing games is very easy due to the screen size. In addition after a while you do warm up to the size and it's hard to go back to a smaller phone. In addition the user experience is great.I had read tons of reviews and articles about problems with the battery and mic etc with this phone. However I have not experienced any of these.CNET and other sites published an article about the top 5 problems of the Samsung S3 which some of you maybe aware of...so I'll use the rest of this review to speak on those as well as some of the cons I noticed:***Battery***Battery is great. After charging it for about 4 hours or so and browsing for about 3 hours, downloading games, making several phone calls (over 3 hours in total), taking pictures, playing music and using S Voice; I got over 36 hours and counting on the phone on a single charge. I should note that I did make some modifications however by occasionally turning off WIFI, turning off Bluetooth, syncing and a couple other battery draining options. In addition Samsung has a cool power saving option that helps to maximize battery life.***Microphone***Had no problem. I could hear the other person clearly and they could hear me clearly too. There is also a volume boost option for when you are on a call and what extra volume. Pretty cool if you ask me and it does make a significant difference.***No Overheating***I haven't had that problem at all. Even with a phone case on the phone did not overheat.***Charging***Phone charged perfectly fine. Didn't get stuck or anything. And it also charged very quickly. Probably charged less than 4 hours. Didn't really time it, but after 4 hours it was fully charged.***WIFI***The WIFI connection is great. Signal didn't drop or anything.SOME CONS:1. User Manual and set up - Had some problems at first because the phone came with a printed Spanish manual. But luckily they have the user manual in all languages online and the set up is also pretty easy to follow on the phone. Several programs like S voice also defaulted to Spanish even after setting up the phone with the default language being English.2. Back Cover - Some people did complain about the back cover which I agree could have been designed better as it does give it a somewhat cheap look. However it is easy to remove, clean and who doesn't love a removable battery. I have also seen at least one pic on the web where the back cover was cracking, however I have not experienced this for myself.3. Color Saturation - Another thing is that though the camera takes great pictures, the phone display makes the colors look very saturated when compared to other phones. Will see if there are any options I can select to improve this.4. S Voice - S voice unlike Siri can open up all the apps on the phone and has some other cool features. But S voice can be a little annoying as it doesn't get what you are asking or telling it to do at times (Siri does have similar problems but not as pronounced). It also at times didn't recognize my wake up voice command (Hi Galaxy). If you ask S voice if you need an umbrella it is smart enough to pull up the weather forecast for your area. However I had some difficulty setting an alarm as each time I would say 6:00 am, it would register it as 6:00pm. I eventually got this fixed by changing how I said the command. If you also speak too slowly it doesn't pick up on what you are saying. S voice also isn't as funny or intuitive as other voice recognition tools. If you ask \"what sound does a cat make?\", it will ask if you would like to Google it rather than just be proactive and google it. The only workaround is to tell it to \"search for what sound does a cat make\". Not a major game changer; but again if you are expecting S voice to be as perfect as you see those \"Andrew\" Android straight talk ads, then forget it. Be prepared to repeat yourself a couple times before S voice gets it right. But as annoying as it is, it does make hands free driving and cooking some what easier. Had no problems telling S voice to make calls or send a text.***Please Note***Though the phone has Gorilla glass 2, it doesn't mean the phone is indestructible. Other elements of the phone as with any other device can be damaged from a fall. Therefore I recommend getting a slim soft rubber or silicone gel case to absorb the shock of a fall. I bought an iGadgitz Black Silicone Skin Case Cover with Tire Tread Design. It gave me a great grip and didn't make the phone bulky. Some reviewers stated that their camera lens broke after a fall. The camera lens is not gorilla glass so that can and will break. If you are clumsy like me, get a case!Again don't let the Apple fan boys and haters discourage you from getting this phone. It is a great phone. Do your own research or see if you can go to an AT&T;, Sprint, Radio Shack store etc and actually play with one.=====Update - October 13, 2013=====So I have had the phone for over a year now. And thought I would do an update.Pros:The phone is still working great for the most part and is still ahead of even the latest iPhone. So I made a very good decision there and still love my phone.Cons:* Gorilla Glass has a scratch on it...not really sure how that happened, just noticed it one day.

I love Apple's mobile and tablet offerings because of their hardware and user experience. As Google has improved its mobile operating system, I kept seeing friends and colleagues using them; but like most Apple fan boy's, I dismissed Google based products as being inferior. That all changed when phones with larger screen sizes started coming to market. I love larger screen technologies. I like my T.V.'s big, I like my computer screens big, and, most recently, I now have a cell phone that fits the bill in the size department. The large screen attracted me to the phone. Once I started playing around with the phone at the store, I noticed the sophistication and beautifully integrated user interface of the Android operating system. Without larger screen offerings, I would have never been shaken out of my Apple fan boy apathy.This brings me to the Samsung Galaxy S III. Not only has this been the phone that I was waiting for (and didn't even know it), but it has completely changed my perception of what a cellphone could be. The S III is fast (4G capable, I'm on AT&T;), aesthetically breathtaking, and amazingly light in weight (thanks to the AMOLED screen). It comes with the \"ice cream sandwich\" version of the android operating system (I can't wait for the next iteration, \"jelly bean\"). The interface is vastly more sophisticated than the IPhone operating system interface. Quite simply, the IPhone interface has far fewer options for customization and user experience. You get a plethora of more options on the android platform. The user experience on the S III is far superior to the IPhone.I have now started to look at other Android phones out there on the market. There are very few with the specs and the screen size of the S III. The only other manufacturer of Android phones that I like is HTC. But I think that right now, for the money, Samsung makes the best smartphone on the market with their Galaxy series. If you have a two year contract that's about to expire or you are new to the smartphone world, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S III. Because of this phone, my eyes have been opened. I will forever look at all offerings out there in the future and not be blindly obedient to a particular manufacturer. So thank you Samsung and Google. Thank you for showing me everything that a smartphone can be.UPDATE. After using the Samsung Galaxy S III for over three months, the larger screen is not worth the hiccups that the Android operating system has. I discovered, rather quickly, that Android has trouble with even the simplest of features. For all the functions that the Android community touts on these phones, the operating system just doesn't get any of them right. It takes several screens to get to some of the basic functions, which rarely work due to system crashes and buggy behavior. Most of the apps in the Play store are of inferior quality without any safeguards to speak of. Malware is rampant in the ecosystem. I have had to factory reset this phone over twenty times. Unacceptable. The phone itself is cheap plastic and when you push on the screen to navigate, sometimes you can hear the screen backing make a popping sound.What was my mistake? Moving away from Apple. That was a huge mistake. The screen size on the Galaxy S III was the hook, and I fell for it. I have since ordered the iPhone 5 and I will never leave Apple again. I now realize I wasn't an Apple fan boy, I just got used to the superior quality and user experience of their products.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Updated: A Clear Winner in a Sea of Smartphones", "Author": "R. V. Downing", "ReviewID": "R30PAY3OR3P98W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE(11/4): So I repurchased the SIII shortly after iPhone 5 was announced as I realized that it would still be the best phone available for quite some time. I've had it (again) for just over a month now and I'm absolutely in love with it. I purchased an extended battery that I've also reviewed and it makes this thing a tank for long travel, etc. I don't know whether the firmware was updated or if my charging habits have adjusted but I rarely even use the extended battery getting satisfactory performance from OEM battery nowadays. This is an amazing phone. I also went with the Pebble Blue this time around and that's a much better color in my opinion. Not enough bezel to make the white look as good.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I owned a 16GB White Samsung Galaxy SIII for approximately 28 days before I reluctantly returned it. Previously I had owned an iPhone, iPhone 3GS, and an iPhone 4. So let's talk the SIII.The hardward design is fantastic. The device is super slim and very lightweight. Seeing the phone and it's magnificent screen, you initially think it's going to be very heavy and bulky but it's really light and thin. The plastic backing helps with the weight savings yet doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. The form will simply be too big for some, but for those that really enjoy using a smart phone the massive screen is a dream come true.The Android 4.0 ICS is great and really responsive allowing you to multitask and switch apps like a pro. I've noticed that implementation of some functions is not quite to \"Apple standards.\" I use that analogy not because I think Apple is the gold standard, but because that was my previous experience. For example, the Bluetooth seemed much less relaible skipping much more while using my headphones. Additionally, the device seems to struggle with wired audio as well having playback loss when connected to my car stereo. I will say that I can't be sure whether the issue with these are hardware, firmware, or the particular app I was using. The beauty of Android is that you have more flexibility but that flexibility can make it difficult to identify a culprit when things are not up to expectations. Also some of the stock programs like the email and text message are not great but having Android allows you to easily enough swap them out with many of the free alternatives in the Play Store.The 4G LTE is fast. Amazingly fast. Faster than my home Wifi. A joy to use but I was surprised that you seemingly could not disable it where you were concerned about saving battery.The camera is worthy of point and shoot status taking brilliant pictures.So why on Earth would I return it? The answer is battery life. I'm not techie enough to know whether the battery itself is insufficient or the SW is not optimized to preserve battery. All I know is that the thing just drains in standby, even with all the background apps killed. I didn't think this would be a big deal as I always charge at home and have spare chargers at work and in the car. The last straw was when I fell asleep after a late night charge but without charging overnight. Both times the phone was dead when I woke up. Coming from the iPhone, which has its own battery issues but will usually last through the night uncharged, that was simply unacceptable to be left with a dead phone after only 7 or 8 hours of standby.So as much as I love and want to keep this device (and generally hate Apple as a company), the bottom line for me is that it's a phone first and nothing is worse than a dead phone. I may re-purchase the SIII if some attractive aftermarket battery options become available but for now I had to return it and preserve my phone upgrade for something that gives me a little more juice.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really?", "Author": "Holly", "ReviewID": "R2Z621EC3GFKSH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got the phone less than a week ago and already having trouble with it.

It didn't seem so long ago that the same group think was in line for the release for Windows 95.  Now that Apple is the Microsoft they fought in the 90's and in a way the IBM they fought in the 80's I felt it was time to 'think different' and try the android OS I so much enjoy in a phone.  We have an amazing Android Asus tablet in the house that just far surpasses the ipad and I'm seeing that same unlimited customization in this new blue phone.  The physical design of the Samsung nicely meshes with the features particularly the menu button at the bottom left and the return on the bottom right.  Although they use reds, whites, and blues for the colors I would instead prefer silver or bronze.One thing that is a little confusing is all the trash apps they install on the phone.  For a new convert like myself it is hard to identify the essential google apps versus the register your credit card Samsung ones.  It would be nice to start with some very basics and learn to appreciate them before downloading others. I'm really glad to be free of having to install itunes on every pc in the house.

[I'm color-blind, so the colors I see look great to me. YMMV] For watching videos, it simply doesn't lag. Load times are one thing, but once loaded, the playback is amazing.  Auto-brightness levels are too low, however.  I wish the default auto level could be reset higher. I just switch auto-brightness off and set brightness manually. Not optimal, but not a big deal. During the Olympics, I've been using both Samsung's summary app and NBC's video app.  The videos play beautifully, and sound is very audible.Speaker volume is really good although it's placed on the back alongside the camera lens, so laying the phone on its back seriously muffles sound from videos, games, radio, etc., and NAVIGATION, which is unfortunate. The protective case I have actually worsens this problem by creating a cupped area around the back speaker.Phone call volume is excellent, too, both for the sender and the receiver of phone calls.  Everyone I've talked to says the phone sounds as good as a land line, and I hear them all wonderfully well, too.Battery life is surprising for such a fast phone with a big screen, but I can go all day with my normal usage no problem.  Those who are experiencing bad battery times may be missing some of the battery saving settings, including the \"power saving\" button that's part of the drop down upper notification bar, or they may have a lemon.The camera takes good photos, and gives you a choice of resolutions from 640x480 (.3MP) to 8MP with four intermediate levels: .9, 2.4, 3.2, and 6Mpixels. Flash is very bright on closeups. Burst mode is interesting and can also choose the best shot in the group. Tons of built-in features in the camera app, and Android has many more available in a variety of solid apps. My biggest complaint with the camera is in the auto-focus - slow and touchy. Lens is on top of phone (portrait), but camera seems to default to landscape mode which makes finger placement a bit tricky. Phone will shoot in portrait mode no problem, which is much better with one hand.Android software is ICS-based on this phone, like that new notification bar, and most of it works well.  I've had issues with some of the widgets, especially the one used by the lock screen, not updating their readouts (weather), but I've been playing with the various personalized settings so much, it could be me. [***UPDATE: It WAS me.]S Voice is not yet ready for prime time.  It does some things well, but it's easily confused, so I just do everything myself.  This phone is so responsive and quick, it doesn't really matter to me.  Google Voice Search is my Go To app anyway.  Still works well for me, certainly better than S Voice. [***UPDATE: I finally sat down one night and talked to my phone for over a half hour. During that time, my estimation of S Voice improved.  It's still easy to confuse, but once you learn ways to get it to understand you, it can be helpful.  I particularly like how it can set up appointments in the calendar.]If you already have Google account(s), setup is easy and almost automatic. If you aren't a Google user, consider it.  Many Android apps setup immediately with Google account info.I've had an on-going complaint with Android, and specifically Samsung, with their lack of a universal group texting app that preserves threads within the groups. Apple, for one, does have this capability built-in. The ONLY Android phone I've EVER seen it work on was Samsung's updated version of T-Mobile's Sidekick 4G.  So Samsung HAS done it before. That app only works on that phone, however - but it would be a GREAT thing to add to this one. (Yeah, there are plenty that allow group sends, but if someone replies to the group message, the software does not include a way to continue the thread as a group.  The reply comes through separately and is seen as an individual thread from that person, so you have to check at least two places to figure out what's being said by members of the group - loathe it.) [***UPDATE: I've now tried several, and am currently using Whatsapp, which is very satisfying, but not free. It only works if your other contacts use it, too.  My daughters have it on their iPhones and they like it, too.]Wi-fi acquisition is very fast on this phone, and I have experienced very few drops once connected.  On a normal day, I travel between three separate Wi-fi networks, and since initially setting them all up on the phone (easy), switching between networks is completely seamless.Bluetooth works great, too.The Home button on the bottom of the screen is somewhat laggy. It seems to be \"thinking\" a lot when you press it.  I've been trying out several alternate launchers since getting the phone, lately Nova Launcher, and it's clear that the phone's programmers have given the Home button the ability to do different things, which is undoubtedly what explains the lag.  I wouldn't consider it a negative against the phone, but others may. [***UPDATE: I still think this is true, but I must also add that a built-in way to access S Voice is by pressing the Home button twice in succession.  This supports my theory that the button has to do some extra thinking in its programming.]I haven't been too thrilled with the feel of the case back - too slippery, but I purchased an Acase SuperLeggera case for it, and now think that was both a necessary protection and an improvement in feel. [***UPDATE: I think this combination is even more outstanding after nearly three months of use.]The phone is a good size. I really wanted a bigger screen phone, but the Samsung Note seems a notch too big for me.  The SIII is about a half inch longer than the SII, and very similar in width, while the Note is about the same length as the SIII but wider. With protective case, it still fits in a man's shirt pocket and doesn't feel that heavy there. It's light enough to easily maneuver with one hand, especially with the case I have for it.I like this phone very much, and have no qualms recommending it.  Like every phone, it's not perfect, but it's getting pretty darn close.  T-Mobile coverage in my area is usually excellent, although in some places it's missing.  I went to the ballgame a couple times since getting the phone and it won't receive anything there, which is a shame because the MLB app (which works great on the phone at home) would be a terrific enhancement at the game. One daughter has Verizon and never has problem with coverage there, and the other has AT&T; but coverage varies depending on where we sit in the stadium.  I've never gotten good reception anywhere with any T-Mobile phone there. Also, they both have iPhones.  One is a die-hard Apple fangirl who will get the next one out no matter what, while the other one wants my phone. They both prefer the big screen on the Galaxy SIII, though.Again, I wrote here mostly about little complaints; things that can affect your day-to-day experience based on mine.  I'm not much of a gamer, so I said nothing about that, but clearly this device has speed, brains, and stamina.

Bad decision in my opinion for Apple, which makes me lean towards the new Android phones even more.I also think this Gorilla Glass 2 hype is rather over-exaggerating itself in the community. This stuff is pretty scratch resistant to the point you wouldn't need a screen protector, but like with any glass it CAN be cracked, especially on the S III unfortunately. Dropping this thing on it's side in any way will most likely send a multitude of cracks from the impact point to the middle of the screen. Being dropped on the face or back won't do very much though. I'd recommend getting some kind of silicone case for it, NOT hard plastic (that stuff does nothing when it comes to impacts). Otterbox already has designs for the Commuter version for the S III, which features a silicone base with a hard plastic outside, which is more than enough protection.At any rate if you're looking for something with a stable Android OS (with MORE battery life than other Androids) and a lot of power, go for this. The price is definitely worth it, and as with almost all Android phones its got the expandable memory by buying a cheap MicroSD card and a replaceable battery.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Far surpasses iPhone in my opinion", "Author": "ismynamedrew", "ReviewID": "R2R7V1MFAD0QTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The beginning of this review cover elements other than the phone itself... If you would rather not read that, just skip to the next dotted line. I hope this review helps.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know that there are alot of bogus reviews for both iPhone and Galaxy s3 saying that the one is better than the other, when really it's just a biased fanboy trying to sway you one way without any real reasons other than love/hatred for a certain brand. This will not be one of those reviews. I will compare them in some ways, but I will not be biased.To start off I'll just say that my whole family owns iPhones. This includes my mother and sister. I say that because for them, I recommended the iPhone. They are about the farthest things from 'hard-core' smartphone users--my mom especially. They're the type of people that ask where the settings app is and why the phone says 4G at the top. Honestly, Apple designed their smartphone for those people. People that before would've been completely intimidated by smartphones. If my mom owned the Galaxy S3. She would probably only use it for texting as other things would have just been too hard for her. Or I would just have to spend all day explaining to her how to do certain things. This is not to say that the Galaxy S3 is complex. I don't think it is, but I understand how others might. Which leads me to one important thing that really defines my comparison of the two in one sentence.------The Samsung Galaxy S3 can do way more than the iPhone! IF you know how to use it correctly.------- The iPhone is a much simpler phone and appeals to a different audience-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're scared to have a learning curve for your phone, than this is not the phone for you. If you aren't afraid of a learing curve and digging a little deeper to find some goodies in your phone, and just want to get the best phone out there that can power its way through anything you ask it to, THEN THIS DEFINITELY IS THE PHONE FOR YOU.Screen - 10 - The screen is the best in the business. Huge, high pixel density, bright, and rich with color! Nothing can beat this screen.......nothing!Form Factor - 10 - The smooth curves that go all the way around the device make it very comfortable to hold! It's also super thin, which me likey.Build Quality - It may be made of primarily plastic, but this plastic is strong as it's polycarbonate.User Interface - 9.5 - The UI moves very fast and is fully customizable. Android 4.0 is amazing.Battery - 8.5 - The batter is very good considering the load it has to bare, given the screen and super fast processor.Google Play Store - 10 - I have found an app for everything I need with the phone. Plus, some of the games that this phone can run have amazing graphics.Texting - 10 - Considering you can download any keyboard you want from the Play Store, you should find exactly what you want for texting your friends.Calling - 9 - Call quality is good. Simply put.One more thing - I was pleasantly surprised with many features that are baked into the OS. There are so many I can't even name them all but here are a few.1. When in the messaging if you put the phone to your ear it calls whatever contact your texting - very cool2. You can have 4 hand picked apps that you can jump straight to from the lock screen - very useful3. Face Unlock isn't exclusive to the Galaxy S3 but it still is a great feature.There's also many many more!Get this phone, you won't regret it!", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "The jury is still out, but users beware---", "Author": "Austin reader", "ReviewID": "R1OTMQ6AH70SGO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Important Note:  The following is written regarding a Samsung Galaxy S III that I bought from another vendor for use with Sprint, in the states.  It is NOT the phone shown on this page.This phone will NOT give you true 4G UNLESS you live in a city where 4G LTE is active.  It cannot access the 4G WIMAX network.  Sad fact, I thought I was trading up from my 4G Wimax SII.  Now I have a much slower phone that is stuck in 3G until Austin rolls out 4G LTE, by this year's end, according to Sprint.  Also, please note that you cannot shift your apps to a mini SD in your SII and then have your SIII see them.  It is not able to read apps off of an SD card.  Music and pics worked OK, for me, but others have complained, online, that their old SD was invisible to the SIII.  Better to dump old files to your computer, do a reformat of the mini in the SIII and then load it up.  As far as the screen, speaker volume, extra features are concerned, so far, so good.  I've had the phone less than 24 hrs.  I will update, here, as things move along. UPDATE: 9/14/12--The battery life is not much better than the SII, if you are using your phone for GPS, texting, a few calls, a few internet fact checks, each day.  I get about eight hours, just like with my SII.  The main reason I bought this phone and traded in my SII was because of a site that compared them, feature by feature.  In looking at that site, again, I honestly believe it was put up by Samsung and/or Sprint, to generate interest and sales of the SIII.  This is not noted anywhere on the site.  What is on the site is a \"stretching\" of the truth.  If I had it to do over, I would have kept my SII until 4G LTE was firmly established in my area.  Thinking about that, if 4G Wimax was to stay up, knowing what I know now, I probably would still have kept my SII.  I don't see much difference between the two.  UPDATE: 9/23/12---Just tried this phone with wi-fi at Sprint store---Blazing fast!  Amazing!  The salesperson said the 4G LTE will be faster, yet, and it will be in Austin by Jan. 1st, 2013.  This phone is looking better to me, right now.  UPDATE: 11/18/2012:  You need to check out exactly what your version of this phone comes with.  Because of the international consumer base, those companies marketing these phones try to give the impression that everyone gets the same unit, same features.  WRONG!  The US version of this phone does not have remote control.  Signing up for a Samsung account does NOT suddenly put this feature on your phone.  In the settings menu, the remote control option is missing, entirely.  That being the case, you cannot remotely lock or wipe your phone, in the US, like you can with the Iphone.  You cannot find your phone, remotely.  There are apps that supposedly give you this capability.  They are all garbage, and you should know that those touting their efficacy are, most likely, shills for the companies putting them out there to fill the void left by this feature's absence on this phone.  In the comments section, here, you will probably find a few saying how great this program or that one is for remote functions.  Try them all, like I did, and you will find that they are worthless.  Be careful, while trying them, as well, since you will give the companies permissions that may make you ripe for identity theft.  You've been warned. UPDATE, 1/7/2013:  My area now has 4G LTE.  The Verdict:  Nothing to get excited about. I was told that 4G LTE was faster than the Wi-Fi I tried at the Sprint store. Nonsense! It drags and, at times, is just about the same as 3G, sluggish.  Also, push e-mail has disappeared from the phone with the last few updates.  You are never cued when you have new email. You must refresh to load it.  This is a pain, and is not fixable, at this point, as the many, new internet posts on this problem will attest to.  I am not excited about this phone, not excited about Sprint, and I've been with them since the time their name was leased by a local company, starting in 1992!  They used to be cool, used to give me deals that others didn't get.  Now I'm lumped in with everyone else, and that's that.  In the end, this phone is OK, but only OK, all things considered.  As the competition falls by the wayside, as phone manufacturers and servers drop off and yield to the two or three remaining, you can expect that all of the hassles we put up with, with the old Bell System, will come to the fore. The only difference will be that vocal quality will probably never be as clear as what it was on 1960 land lines.  Kind of ironic, that. UPDATE: 2/28/13:  I am on the verge of leaving Sprint.  Their 4G LTE network is a joke, in much of Austin.  I cannot stream anything in my home location.  The tower techs say that the issue may be resolved by Sept. of this year, but they're not sure! Bah!  What they're not saying is that tower climbers are hard to find and those with the tech smarts to tune dishes and antennas are rarer still. It is a dangerous business with no national certifying body.  I've actually looked into becoming a tower climber as my present profession keeps me sixty feet up trees, and I love it up there.  As for the phone:  The buttons for volume and shut-off are very poorly placed: When you go to change the volume, you often turn the phone off because the buttons are exactly opposite each other, on either side of the phone.  This is an annoying design flaw and needs to be remedied in later versions. As the phone struggles to find signals on the terrible Sprint network, it gets very hot.  I'm sure, at times, it gets hot enough to cause serious burns.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "response samsung galaxy s3", "Author": "fernanda alio", "ReviewID": "RGV12PBN3LH61", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "good afternoon, I bought the samsung galaxy s3 new unlocked, firstly the product arrived in a blue box that does not is the ORIGINAL cell, secondly the charger is not corresponding to the model samsung galaxy s3 that I bought, third hearing aids are not samsung galaxy s3, are a few normal white that have nothing to do with the phoneroom equipment is used and fifth also include manual or instructions of any kind, I hope a response on the part of you that this product was not what I buy for which I feel badly ripped.

After a few weeks I have become used to it and there are things about this phone I really like. As a loyal HTC phone person, it took a lot for me to switch to Samsung, but I took the chance and am glad I did.Cons:1. My sister says the voice quality is not as clear. I've played with the settings, but she still says I sound a little muffled. This is both with and without using a bluetooth headset.2. The size takes some getting used to. It's hard to do the screen unlock with my thumb.3. When you turn the phone on, it goes back to the last screen you were on versus the home page (maybe I can change this somewhere?). This doesn't seem like a big deal, but it means I have to remember what I had on each screen and scroll over to where I need to be. With my most used items on my home page, it would be nice if the phone would wake up to that.4. There are other little things, like speed dialing, that aren't as user friendly as they were on the Evo. I can add a phone number as a widget, but I'd love to have direct speed dialing from the phone window to a particular number. Now, I have to have a screen full of widget speed dial numbers. The speed dialing from the phone only allows you to speed dial a contact and you still have to choose the phone number to dial, then hit the call button. Things like that take a few extra steps which can be cumbersome. My Sprint guy tells me that is the new operating system, but he could just be saying that.5. I'm not that crazy about pushing in the home button. A smooth button would have been better.6. It may sound stupid, but when you type the letter i and a space, it doesn't automatically capitalize the i...it should. You can hit the capital i above the keyboard, but you really shouldn't have to do that.Pros:1. The speed. It is fast to navigate around the phone. LOVE that. The few silly games I play run super fast.2. Battery life is simply awesome. While I use my phone mostly for email and work related syncing, I just can't believe how long the battery lasts. I don't have to charge the phone every day and it charges quickly. Also, when the phone battery gets low, it doesn't seem to use up the battery any faster like it did on my Evo. Once the battery got low on my Evo, it seemed like the phone was completely out of juice before I knew it.3. The Bluetooth works well. I never have trouble connecting to my bluetooth headset. Even better than that though, is when I play music through my buetooth sound system, I don't lose sound quality. On my Evo, there was a significant loss in sound quality.4. There are so many nice little things that are cool....like how fast the screen rotates to how responsive the volume/power buttons are.5. The camera is fast and can shoot multiple shots in a row. It takes good photos.6. When you slide down from the top of the screen you can easily access common settings (mute, bluetooth, wi-fi) and that is quite nice. I use that a lot.7. Swype works really well once activated. It is actually a lot more accurate than typing.8. Voice to typing is way more accurate than I have ever seen.I'm sure there is more, but hopefully these comments have helped.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Smart Phone, Current iPhone User", "Author": "Armando Arpys Arevalo Carreno \"Arpys\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q1EMTPE0VYVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is really slick.

Drove around town and found 1 spot about 10 miles away where I finally got 3 bars, but, um, my office is not there! Since my initial purchased,I've talked to Verizon countless times. They \"boosted\" the signal, reset it, and did some other stuff to it to no avail. I took the phone back and they quickly gave me a new one. Once again, same issue except now the phone is dropping calls like crazy plus the camera if way off. The pictures, specially anything vertical, leans to one side and/or looks like it has a \"fish eye\" effect. So I go back to Verizon, and within 24 hours, they sent me a new phone in the mail I'm excited, this is it,right? 3 minutes into a conversation, the call drops! So, guess what I'm doing in about one hour? going back to Verizon and chosing a totally different phone.It's a real shame, I really like this one. The screen is huge and it's easy to navigate.

THANK YOU", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "GS3 vs iphone5", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R3MYQUD7OZ2OVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Galaxy S3 could arguably the best smart phone on the market. The Samsung Galaxy S3 can call, text, watch movies, surf the internet, take pictures, transfer data and much more. The Galaxy S3, successor to the Galaxy S2, which is a touch screen phone designed and sold by Samsung electronics, appeared in the market May 29, 2012. Lets take a look at why the S3 can be the best smart phone on the market today. First, it has an outstandingly huge 4.8 Super AMOLED screen (Samsung Electronics). If you don't know what that is, its screen is 4.8 inches diagonally across the 1280x720 pixel display (Samsung Electronics). With its huge screen, this phone is relatively big in the hand. Measuring in at 136.6 millimeters tall, 70.6 millimeters wide, and 8.6 millimeters thick, it is advised you get a hold of one before purchasing (Samsung Electronics). It is also 133 grams, almost .3 pounds, which is very light considering its large body. This smart phone comes in a sixteen or thirty two gigabytes of internal memory, which can also be expanded with a micro SD card (Samsung Electronics). It has two cameras, one eight mega pixel rear camera with LED flash, auto focus, and image stability. The eight mega pixel camera is standard, a twelve mega pixel camera would be more fitting since there are already phones like the HTC Titan 2 which has a twelve mega pixel camera or the Nokia Pureview 808 with a whopping forty one mega pixel camera. The Galaxy S3's eight mega pixel camera is so outdated. The front facing camera is 1.9 mega pixels, nothing fancy. The Galaxy S3 has a big 2,100 milliamp battery which will keep your phone running for days on a single charge, definitely a great feature of the phone. Finally, you can get this incredible phone in a pebble blue color or a marble white color. The Galaxy S3's top competitor is Apples Iphone 5, now the second best selling US phone after the Galaxy S3. The Galaxy S3 is 136.6x70.6x8.6 millimeters while the Iphone 5 measures 123.8x58.6x7.6 millimeters (Apple Inc.). The S3 weighs 133 grams verses the Iphone's 112 grams (Apple Inc.). The weight difference is due to the Galaxy S3's big body. Even though it is a lot bigger than the Iphone, the weight is relatively light for such a big phone. The S3 boosts a 4.8 inch display, while the Iphone 5 only has a four inch screen. The point eight inches makes all the difference, since when you look at the screen, its screen length is proportional to the screen width the Iphone 5's screen is much too tall compared to its width. The body of the Samsung is made entirely of plastic, which doesn't feel very high quality when holding it. Also, it can easily slip out of the hand because of the glossy plastic finish. Its battery cover is also made of flimsy plastic, not high quality at all. Spending two hundred dollars with contract for this phone, you would think it should be more toughly built. The Iphone 5 on the other hand, has a metal casing with an aluminum backing. It sure feels sturdy and well made in the hand. While the metal and aluminum both contribute to its sturdy build, there is a drawback. The aluminum backing is very easily scratched (Williams par18). The Iphone's size is also more hands friendly, its slim design makes it easier to hold and use with one hand than the Galaxy S3. One of the great features of the Galaxy which trumps Iphone's is its removable battery. So, when the battery runs out of holding its charge, all you have to do is purchase a new battery. Whereas with the Iphone, you would have to buy a whole new phone. Another incredible feature on the S3 is its incredible battery life. Because of its big body, Samsung was able to fit a big battery in. The S3's 2,100 milliamp battery will really last you a while (Samsung Electronics). I have used it heavily texting, calling, and surfing the web all day, and it can still last me two days on a single charge. Although I don't have much playing time with the Iphone 5, I know it has a 1,440 milliamp battery (Apple Inc.). Its significantly less than the Galax S3's, and not as great because it is non-removable. The Galaxy S3 and the Iphone 5 both have an eight mega pixel rear camera with led flash, high definition video recording, auto focus, and image stability. What sets them apart with cameras is their front facing camera. The Iphone only has a 1.2 mega pixel front camera, nothing special (Apple Inc.). The S3 has a 1.9 mega pixel front camera, way clearer images for when you want to take self portraits or use it as a mirror. As for the colors of the phone, the Iphone 5 comes in white or black, while the Samsung Galaxy S3 comes in blue or white (Samsung Electronics). When we go under the hood of the smart phones, one is android and the other is IOS. The Galaxy S3 runs android Ice Cream Sandwich, and the Iphone 5 runs IOS 6. If you like to customize your phone, the S3 will let you do that. On the other hand, if you want a phone that is easy to navigate, the Iphone 5 is the way to go. The Galaxy S3 can run more applications more smoothly than the Iphone can. The S3 has two gigabytes of RAM, while the Iphone only has one gigabyte (Samsung Electronics) (Apple Inc.). If multitasking is your thing, the S3 can run all of your needs more smoothly than the Iphone. Some more benefits of choosing the Samsung Galaxy S3 is its NFC capability (Samsung Electronics). It uses Near Field Communication to transfer data quickly by simply tapping two NFC capable devices together. That's instantaneous data transfer. Also, the Galaxy S3 boosts Smart Stay and Direct Call (Samsung Electronics). Using the front facing camera, smart stay tracks your eye movements and keeps the screen bright. It only turns off the screen when you are asleep or not looking at the device anymore. Now, usually if you want to call someone, you have to go to your contacts to find the person you want to call, but with Direct Call, it is as simple as putting your phone to your ear. Say you are texting someone, and you want to call them instead. All you have to do is put your phone to your ear, and the S3 will automatically call that person. Sadly, none of these features are present on the Iphone 5. When reviewing the Samsung Galaxy S3, you quickly realize that this phone is a lot different than any other phone in the market. When comparing it to the Iphone 5, they both have strong points as well as weak spots, but you can clearly see that the Galaxy S3 is better than the Iphone.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "not a GT-I9300", "Author": "korey", "ReviewID": "REP17KF1WVZX8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I studied up on this phone before i purchased, phone showed up on time, but as soon as i turned it on i started noticing things.

It was reliable, this phone is NOT reliable.  My screen flickers when playing games, the keyboard is a crap shoot.  I can't even type a text message without having to go through and edit it.

Users can turn down brightness to conserve power as necessary, or replace the battery with a spare. A brighter screen would certainly be a vast improvement. Why is max brightness only half that of the iPhone 5 (whose nits output is reportedly nearly double that of the S3)? Really handicaps an otherwise superior product!

My old Brigade died and they do not make it anymore. So, I finally went with the white SG3.At first, this phone will put you in tears learning how to use it.For example, how to actually answer a phone call. We hit every button, every knob, everything. We even tried yelling at it, \"answer phone.\" The instructions were of no help nor was Verizon. The first tutorial on the phone did not address how to answer, only how to call. Finally, the third tutorial told us how to answer it. You put your finger on the green phone button and swipe it toward the middle of the phone. Took two days to figure this out.Another example, how to transfer old ring tones or download them. We followed every direction on Verizon, but the directions and what is on the screen are not even close to matching. It told me it downloaded and installed but no one could find it. So, I went to Verizon again. A huge team of Verizon scientist gathered around could not figure it out. Finally, the Verizon Certified Jerk went to a website, downloaded another ring like the one I tried to install, and downloaded to my phone without my permission and told me that is how you do it. Finally, they told me they did not know how to work it. I left unhappy. You must hit the orange downloaded message more than once even though it tells you it was downloaded and installed.All these initial things aside, the phone is great. You can do custom fields on almost everything. One of the best calendars I have ever used. The camera is freaking awesome. The phone is light weight and nice in appearance. You can pull your finger from top to bottom and it will list all the parts you can turn off and on, such as 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. Quick and easy.This is the first electronic device that can actually understand my southern accent with the voice commands on SVoice. I just tried it for fun and said, \"call mom.' It immediately called my mother. I tried it again thinking that was a fluke, and said, \"text S**S**\" and it went to that screen. I was able to send a detailed text with unique words easily.The ring tones on this phone absolutely suck. They are all made for females or kids. I do not want Twinkle Toes (not a real ring tone but that is what they all sound like) as my ring tone. Not one ringtone for a man unless it is a man that likes Twinkle Toes.Overall, at first this phone might drive you nuts trying to figure it out but once you overcome that, it is a great phone.

IMO, the OS matches and beats Apple's IOS in terms of fluidity. Throw in there the ability to customize your phone - there are literally hundreds of options to customize - and it's obvious why many are jumping ship from Apple and its outdated hardware/software.The GS3 is the best phone out there across any platform.

I bought this phone unlocked and in the international version because I routinely travel outside the U.S. and having a phone tied to an American phone company is just not practical.  My iPhone 4 was also purchased unlocked, that proved to be the correct way to go.  The GS3 comes with 16GB of user available space plus a slot for micro-SD to add morestorage space.  I have a 32GB SD card in mine.  I have put a lot of videos and photos on mine in the year that I've owned it.  I routinely clear the card and keep file backups in other places.  I have dropped the phone with two different protective covers on it - on numerous occasions - and I still have no issues with it.  I bought the GS3 because of the videos I saw users post on YouTube.  In my opinion this phone records very good video and yields nice results online.  This phone also allows the user to transfer photos and files wirelessly to other Samsung devices, including Samsung TVs.  I learned that last one by accident - I was trying to transfer photos to my daughter's Galaxy Note and my grandson came out of his bedroom and said, \"Hey, someone is posting photos on my TV set.\"  SWEET!  Personally, I think ALL phones should have the on/off toggle button on top of the phone like Apple does it so it's out of the way.  But it's the hypersensitive nature of the haptic sensors on the lower bezel of the phone that keep me from giving this one five stars.  Still, even with the GS5 new on the market, I can easily recommend the unlocked GS3 i9300 to anyone.

William Cupp", "ReviewID": "R3374GFL451PQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone after nearly a year of careful study.  This is my first smart phone (moving from a pre-paid only, flip phone ... yeah, I took a while to get into mobile phones as well).  After nearly a month of exhaustive use, I like it.  It has sufficient power and storage to be viable, and it meets my needs for a smart phone ... that is, a hand-held computer which also serves as a wireless phone.I am not wild about the interface.  In a slate format with a touch screen I don't know how it could be much better.  But the touch screen interface is loaded with difficulties in day-to-day operations.  Some of the better apps have adequate work arounds to address the worst problems, but some of the apps are cumbersome to operate.  For example, most of the music players and playlist editors are designed around the viewpoint of someone who plays only live streaming music and occasionally adds a song to a \"favorites\" playlist.  My audio library, which consists of thousands of tracks has proven quite tedious to load into the phone and I haven't a good way to create playlists yet.What's missing is a good app that essentially enables the USB cord to make the phone mount as an external storage device.  Although several claim to do just this, in reality only a few file system operations are provided.An annoyance is the number of Google-provided apps which come preinstalled on the phone and cannot be removed.  Their icons can be deleted from everything except the apps menu, and updating of these apps can be prevented, but you must live with them on the phone.  This form of \"push marketing\" of software is not appreciated.One feature yet to be tested -- but about which I have little doubt -- is the international versatility.  Technically I've read it is a simple matter of purchasing a new SIM card in other countries and putting it into the phone.  I am confident this will work, but haven't had a chance to test it yet.  Given that it does, it will be wonderful.  After taking the time to learn the interface and software it will be great to use the same handset wherever I travel.A caution to prospective purchasers: plan on taking some time to properly learn how to use this device.  That's a natural consequence of the power and adaptability.  The basic telephone interface is simple, but the contacts list has some learning curve.  The wide variety of Android apps which can be obtained is a good thing, but the other side of that coin is it means you might have to try two or three parallel apps which do the same thing, to find the one that works best for you.  It's not difficult to learn how to search for apps, and does not take long to install (or uninstall) them, but it does mean you have to work at it a little while.Overall a good purchase value.  (Yes, the Galaxy 4 is out, but I went with the 3 series on the time-tested thought that by buying one model out you can get a lower price.  If I continue to enjoy using this machine, I expect I will eventually upgrade, purchasing each new model shortly after its successor becomes available.)", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Trouble with unlocking", "Author": "Aurelio Concheso", "ReviewID": "R62ATOYQDKYQJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone was advertisdwed as \"internationa unlocked, which it was not!!

This particular model (i9300) is a broad, international category. The one I received appears to be Chilean, or that set. It works great with a MicroSIM from Straight Talk on the AT&T; network with H+ data almost everywhere. The FM tuner is a nice bonus to buying the i9300 model. OTA updates work. So far no JB update for the Chilean market, but easily overcome with a EU ROM flash if needed. The phone is smooth and lag-free with the stock ROM. Having tried a Galaxy Nexus S before this, I find this well-worth the extra money over the other. The GPS is quick and responsive. I personally love the stock apps (music, clock, etc that so many custom ROMs like to replace) so I have yet to find a reason to run anything but stock.Cons: None.Other Thoughts: I migrated from a Captivate (i897) and am finding the cell signal and call quality is dramatically improved with this phone.

It is my first Android phone.  Battery life is abysmal and I have tried using the Power Saving mode to slow the very fast drain.  Literally, the battery goes down in 2% increments in a few minutes time sometimes.  I will look into an extended battery, but this situation is really worrying me. How can I travel any distances with such a battery-draining cellphone?  I have had to turn this phone off at times during the day just to keep it going while I am away and even then it is at the critical \"almost dead\" zone before I get home.The phone freezes up at times.  Several times I have had to take out the battery and reboot the phone.  The Facebook app freezes up.  Sometimes the phone just acts weird - like when it kept calling my daughter when I was trying to call other people.Not sure what is up, but if it weren't for the larger screen size and the lower price tag of the Samsung Galaxy S3, I would have opted for the Iphone 5.I am hoping that a trip to Radio Shack for some pointers will help me with this cumbersome phone.

I do own an Ipad2 so I did not want to have an Iphone 5 as well. It seemed silly to have both products while they can virtually do the same thing. I had the first galaxy that came out and fell in love with it. I ended up getting a new phone later on that was not a galaxy and hated it.

I already figured out to turn off the separate browser brightness settings but whites are not white and the screen is too dim.S voice might as well not exist. At least siri is funny when it is frustrating. S voice is just frustrating.Apps that I have used on other phones don't seem to work as fluidly on this phone. I am talking anything from navigation native to android to Slacker radio.Smart view is supposed to keep the screen on by tracking your eyes with the camera.

Just visit play.google.com and click \"install\" as long as your tablet/phone is compatible with the app you can install it directly from your laptop/tablet/desktop. It is very easy to use.The audio is nice. I don't have any complaints about it. It doesn't have beats audio but it sounds like it does. /coming from someone who hasn't really used beats on anything but her laptopBefore I purchased the product, I saw it in a T-Mobile store and new I wanted it. It was so sleek and the screen was so big. The little card that T-Mobile has really explained all I needed to know when I got it. I wish I knew how cool android was before this but I would have gotten this phone anyway. Hahaha.*********IMPORTANT-- I tried to buy it unlocked from AT&T; on eBay but when I went to go use it my sim card was too big so I went to a T-Mobile store and used one of their sim cards made for the phone to make sure it worked and it only got EDGE service. I was not able to get 4G. I knew I should have gotten 4G where I was standing because one of the T-Mobile agents had the Galaxy S3 in white (version I got) for about a week and I held them side-by-side. So, just beware of the seller's return policies when it comes to unlocked phones. I didn't think this would happen but now I know. I was able to buy it brand new from T-Mobile that day but I would have been SOL otherwise.**************The default TouchWiz launcher is what the phone is made for and everything runs extremely smooth using that launcher. I have used up 12.05GB of my 16GB white version of the phone. I have 1.81GB in apps (about 50-60 apps; if I have more then wow! hahaha), 3.56GB in Pictures & Videos, 20KB in Audio (about 15-20 songs; just chose the one's I liked the best from iTunes), 24.54MB in Downloads (saved screenshots; instagram images, etc.) and lastly 6.02GB of Free Space. I have not purchased a MicroSD card as I do not have the money to do that yet but I plan to purchase at least one 32GB MicroSD card to open up more space. Once I do that, I may root the phone but I am afraid I will break it.Overall, the phone is perfect. I don't really have any demands or anything that I would like to change about the phone except the battery life. It doesn't last as long as I would like it to without using the app 2X Battery but if I have to use an app and an extended battery that is fine with me.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Light fast and sharp looks", "Author": "Abhishek D.

Secondly, this is by far the best phone to hit the shelf this year.  Better than the iphone 5 which is not even out yet.  There is so much you can do.  ICS is smooth, Android Jelly Bean 4.1 is set to be released later this year to this handset.  People complain that it is only a dual core processor but in benchmarks it actually out performs the quad core international version.  Plus the US version got 2 Gigabytes of ram, where the international only got 1 GB.Battery Life:Coming from the Samsung Infuse, the battery in the S3 is freaking EXCELLENT.  I have went almost 2 days with light usage.  On medium usage it lasts me about 24 hours.  Heavy user's your going to get about 12-15 hours out of the phone.  The phone charges very quickly and holds charge great.S-Voice:Best thing yet to Siri.  In my opinion it is better.  They do a lot of the same stuff but there is some stuff S-Voice can do that the iOS Siri can not.  S-Voice can schedule reminders, send texts, phone calls, emails, etc....  Find local restaurants in the area, automatically calculate a route via Navigation by you saying directions to \"This place\".Overall this is a GREAT handset.  If your looking for the best device  (especially on AT&T;) to get this year, this is it.  Honestly, if I were not married and I were single, I would marry this phone.  Maybe even make love to it.

Yes, the data speeds on 3g are horrid. I thought it was the network, but either this phone is good enough to overcome that, or Sprint actually has been performing upgrades as promised. Just seems so much better with this phone.  When I first saw the specs of the Galaxy S2 (Epic 4g Touch) a year ago, I had to have it. When I first got it, I fell in love with it despite so-so battery life (which was still better than the Evo 4G I was using at the time but that's not really saying much). Coming from an original HTC Evo 4G, which was a pretty good phone for a while, I was amazed at how good the E4GT was. So much faster, lighter, crisp, no lag, etc. I didn't think it would get much better than that. When the Galaxy S3 was announced and I saw the specs, I wasn't too crazy about it. I was looking for a giant quantum leap over the GS2 and this didn't seem to be it. So I figured I'd wait until around Christmas this year or early next year to see what else was out there. I was going to hold out for the possibility of the Galaxy Note 2 for Sprint, but whatever. However, the time came when an unfortunate accident necessitated the possibility of using my upgrade. Even with insurance, my GS2 would've required being sent away and fixed at a cost of $150 (don't ask). So I bit the bullet and upgraded to the GS3. All I can say is that if you're even considering getting the GS3, just do it. DO IT DO IT DO IT!!!!!! I walked out of the Sprint store with a bit of head-down uncertainty, but after a couple of days I am amazed. Even though I upgraded my GS2 to Android 4.0 a week or two bwfore, it's a completely different and better experience on the GS3. I never realized how choppy and grainy the screen of the GS2 was until I saw the glory of full HD Super AMOLED (even with PenTile which was a huge turn-off...or so I thought). I know a few people with the original Epic 4G with the PenTile display and it looked as if you were looking through wire mesh. For this phone, you REALLY have to look to tell. Just wish it was a tad brighter, but no biggie since I live indoors. SO smooth, so many new features to play with! Can't say enough about it. I love switching phones because I'm a gadgethead and love the newest and shiniest \"thing\", but I hate it at the same time because it takes a while to get your phone just how you want as far as settings, widgets, photos, contacs, arranging home screens, etc. You get a new phone and you have to do half of that stuff all over again.  Don't worry...it's worth the effort here. Samsung has stepped out of the box and made an incredible phone that looks, feels, and performs like nothing else out there right now and they now have a customer for life so long as they keep at the forefront of innovation! Oh, and if you're a \"gadget-head\" like myself, do yourself a favor and pick up some TecTiles. They're little stickers about the size of a postage stamp that you can program to enable certain functions. I just put a sticker in my car and programmed it to turn on Bluetooth whenever my phone comes in contact with it and it connects to my car automatically without touching the phone. You can stick one on your nightstand and program it to set your alarm and turn off the ringer when you touch your phone to it! How cool?!?!?

The photos are absolutely beautiful.  Last note: I am using T-Mobile as my service provider; you will need to go to the store to get a compatible SIM card for this phone, as it requires a smaller one than comes with many of the simpler phones (I tried to configure it with an old SIM card from a 40-dollar phone at home - didn't work!).Seller: I bought this phone from VIVA2013 and completely recommend buying from this distributor.  It was said to arrive in 6-8 days but only took two days from over 2,000 miles away.  You will note that there is only one shipping-speed, but the product arrived quickly, in brand-new condition, and was well packed for protection.  This seller also necessitates the customer sign for the item on delivery, which is a great bonus as many of my amazon items are simply left at the door, whereas this item is far too expensive to be left unattended.Edited to add: This phone is a GT 19300.

Why? Read one if you're curious.I've had 5 Galaxy S III's. They are, unfortunately, quite lacking in build quality and reliability.- My first one had dead pixels on the screen. These are small black specks on the screen you can  see when your phone has darker/black backgrounds (such as during movies). It doesn't affect performance but my goodness, it really does get annoying. Had this one replaced after just 2 weeks owning it. Apparently it's a quality control issue that comes up on many GS III's. I had this one replaced.- My replacement started overheating and draining my battery very fast within just 3 weeks of owning it. I had this one replaced too.- My third one worked alright for about 3 months. Then, one day, the front-facing camera started displaying a green hue of light on each side of it. It showed up in pictures too. I don't use the front-facing camera much but still, it was deemed a hardware failure by Samsung and was sent yet another replacement phone.- My fourth GS III went for a month or so. Then this one started eating battery very quickly as well (without data or wifi on) and I sent this one back.I just got my fifth GS III a couple weeks ago. Needless to say I sold it because my warranty would end in a couple months and if I had another failure, I would be stuck with it this time around. It's a shame because out of all my phones I've had (I've had quite a few), this was my favorite in terms of capability, user interface, and value. However, the physical quality and reliability is very subpar and needless to say, I picked up an iPhone 5 last week.In terms of software, the iPhone is an EXTREME DOWNGRADE IMHO, but hardware-wise, it puts the GS III to shame. It just feels so much more premium and well-built.I may have just gotten unlucky (four times) but BUYER BEWARE!** NOTE: I had a Ghost Armor screen protector and case on each one of my GS III's and none of them suffered from water damage or were every dropped.

I've had two previous smart phones(Iphone and HTC Inspire), both of witch I used for approximately 2-3 years.  I'm not a careless person, but things happen.  So obviously these phones were dropped on numerous occasions, not to mention the normal wear and tear associated with just common usage. Both worked brilliantly, and I got new phones simply to upgrade the technology.  This Samsung Galaxy S3 is literally dropped one time(yes, I did have a case), and not only did the screen crack like a spider web, but the screen would just light up green with lines all across it.  Now the actual phone still worked, but what good is a phone with a non-functioning screen???

I've never had any issues with breaking my phones, so I saw absolutely no reason to get the insurance...I've literally never lost or broken a phone.

After having the phone for 8 months I'm very disappointed in it and I'll cover this with some pros and cons below.ProsBright Vibrant large display!Very lightweight and slim designGood cell, WiFi, and Bluetooth receptionExcellent feature set!ConsBattery Life is Terrible! Terrible!!  Terrible!!!Using my S3 phone about the same amount of time for apps (less probably because many of the apps I had on my iPhone were not available for Android plus I got a tablet which I used a lot for casual surfing as I used to on my iPhone), phone calls, etc. as I did my iPhone I could charge my iPhone every 2 days;  with the Samsung S3 it's AT LEAST once a day if not twice.  Yes, I tried all the tips for saving battery life but I did not have to do that on my iPhones and I bought the Samsung for some of those fancy features that I'd have to turn off.Case is cheap plasticI was warned by friends of this and I did not listen.  Subjecting the phone to the same wear and tear as my iPhones (less in fact as one dark day I had dropped my iPhone 4 onto a cement floor from about a height of four feet;  not a scratch on it even though it landed face down!) after four months I was seeing cracks in the case of the S3 by the volume rocker.  As time progresses they are getting bigger and it's only a matter of time until they break all the way through and small pieces of the case come off!Poor Quality GlassTurn off the display on the iPhone 4 I had for almost 2 years and not a mark could be seen on it.  Do that on my S3 and there's a myriad of scuffs and tiny scratches.Resale ValueNone!  Based on the case and glass issues there's literally no resale value and I got top dollar for all my iPhones selling them to one of the electronics resellers online.Conclusion:  While I was blown away by the performance and feature set of this phone the cons listed above made it for me a very bad purchase decision!  Last month I finally ordered a large capacity battery which now lets me go two to three days without a recharge, but it also makes the phone twice as thick and significantly heavier.  Very disappointing experience for me with this phone.UPDATED 17-October 2013Last week the glass cracked on the screen.  It's weird because I had dropped the phone some weeks back and the screen was fine, perhaps it was a delayed reaction due to a small fracture I could not see.  I've ordered an iPhone 5s to replace the S3 and I'll soon be able to put this major disappointment of a phone behind me.Note I had conversations with Samsung online about the battery life and I was basically told to disable all the fancy features and other background processes on the phone to improve battery life.  One of the reason I bought the phone was for the features.

The GUI is extremely non-intuitive.  What used to take me one or two keystrokes on my HTC Evo 4G now takes at least 4 or 5 keystrokes.  As with all new tools, I know that sometimes it just takes time to adapt to the new UI but after 6 months of using this dog, I have still not adapted and the only conclusion I can come to is that the GUI is just poorly designed.  The GUI is also VERY slow... for all the hype about how fast this phone is, I was very disappointed... response time from hitting a reply key to the keyboard actually coming up on screen can sometimes take as long as 8 to 10 seconds.  While this seems like a nit, for someone like me that uses their phone a LOT for business, it is extremely annoying.  The phone also performs very poorly on the SPRINT network... Sprint has enough problems with lousy service to begin with but couple this with a phone that has poor network performance and you have a disastrous combination. I generally feel that 2 tin cans and a string would work better.  And last but not least... battery life is pathetic on this phone.  In conclusion... get yourself an HTC!!!

I was surprised that none of you guys care about how bad the screen is, the Amoled is tooo harsh, it is like some light blinking to your eyes and you get eye sore right away. color temperature is too cold (a white background is always blue), trust me, you will never see white color with this phone unless you get the white color body one and look at the phone itself, and there is no option to adjust it. color saturation is way too over, it means what ever you see in the screen is overly colored. I cant even read something with this phone for over 2 minutes. enough for the screen, this phone is all about plastic, when I was opening back cover, it felt like it is gonna break any second. this phone is way over-priced.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "CHEAP MATERIAL...

But later, couldn't make a phone call because the the phone icon didn't open and, again, turned it off/on to make my phone call.This wonderful machine is so complex, that sometimes, it decides not to respond to your comand. May be because it has to decide when and what to do by itself.My beloved, dearest and already gone Iphone ...I've sold it to a friend...cannot get it back, unfortunatelly.And for you, who didn't make this unwise change, I leave my last words:Look before you leap....", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "unhappy", "Author": "ines", "ReviewID": "RQ0NYV3BONFQW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the phone Samsung galaxy s3 I buy here  the internet Is not workIng at all .I went to check it up and they say the phone is  international unlock It and the phone Is socks. that s  why the internet not working at all. so please please don't buy in amazon they don't say they true about they produce please please don't buy don't buy", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Performance Issue with APPS", "Author": "Venkatesh", "ReviewID": "R3P8Q5DI9CUZKG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The issue of RAM utilization is there in all Samsung phones and just 1gm RAM is not good enough as said by other users too.
