{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice 2010 Texting Phone - Now Obsolete", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R38Q62AKW5RH0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Back in 2010, I wanted a phone that had a large physical keyboard for writing mobile e-mail when I am away from my computer.  This was a great phone, but in 2013 there are many far better phones.The Sanyo Incognito from Boost Mobile has a terrific, and very large physical keyboard.The Incognito is the perfect phone for writing e-mails. It opens up into a \"mini\" netbook, with a physical keyboard that is easy to use for fast typing. When opened, it works well as a speaker phone. I can use the voice recognition app to dial numbers or dial by speaking a name in my contact list.I can easily read even lengthy e-mails on the Incognito's screen. The electric company sends me e-mails with graphs of my hourly electrical use. The Incognito can open those e-mails as a web page so that I can see the graphs. However, the Incognito does not have the ability to open a PDF attachment to an e-mail.The included web brower is very basic, so I downloaded the more advanced Opera 5 mini web browser and installed it as a \"Favorite\" on my apps page. It plays videos from YouTube, but not from websites that use Adobe Flash (99% of the world likes Adobe Flash, but not Apple or Sanyo).I have been able to view short (under a minute) videos from the New York Times, but attempting to download longer videos from the New York Times results in getting an error message. The Times is using different software than YouTube.The \"native\" Sanyo web browser is rather clunky, but it allows adding a list of favorite web sites. So, if I don't want to take a few seconds to open the Opera web browser, I can just click on a site on my list of favorites.The camera is very basic, and requires that the phone be opened to its mini-computer shape before taking a photo. The lens is positioned exactly where your fingers will be. All in all, don't bother trying to use the camera.You can install a mini-SD card of up to 16gb to hold music transferred from your computer or to hold photos. There is no easy way to download music wirelessly...I suspect it may be impossible. I was unable to find a way to connect to any internet radio site, such as Pandora or LastFM.When closed, the phone is dialed from an invisible touchscreen on the front cover. To make a call or answer a call, you release the screen lock and the screen lights up to display the numbers on a touch screen. The numbers vibrate to confirm your touch...a feature I turned off to save the battery.The first week or two, it is irritating to have to remember to release the screen lock to answer a call. Eventually, releasing the lock will become more reflexive. The screen lock IS useful...no accidental dialing.The Boost/Sprint signal has been strong, even indoors, in the Houston, Texas area. Voice quality is good through the earpiece and the speaker phone. When holding the phone to your ear, you must keep the lower part of the phone from touching your cheek or you can touch the disconnect button. You can prevent accidental disconnects by using the phone's menu to re-lock the screen automatically after a call is connected.I recharge the battery every other night. If you like to watch You Tube videos, you will need to recharge every night.If your primary use for a cell phone is mobile e-mail and you want a large physical kieyboard, the Sanyo Incognito from Boost is a good lower cost alternative to a Blackberry.Amazon.com is the best place to buy accessories for the Incognito. I was able to buy the ORIGINAL Sanyo wall charger and a spare battery made by Sanyo for 75% less than the Sprint store. And, I found a plastic phone \"protector\" that snaps around the lid of the phone and over its back to protect it from nicks and scractches. It has a slightly \"sticky\" feel, which makes it easier to get a secure grip on the phone.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "a good, pre-paid, non-rip-off, pseudo-smartphone", "Author": "cinephiliagal", "ReviewID": "R1EGD9U9ZGTQRG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone from Boost for a year+ now. I consider it a smart dumbphone (or a dumb smartphone). Let's call it a pseudo-smartphone.I originally bought this Sanyo Incognito as an 'interim' phone. It ended up serving me so well, it's been my permanent phone for the past year. I've dropped it far too many times, yet it never stopped working and has survived intact (with minor scratches and chips of the shiny \"mirror\" finish).Note: the Incognito does not have iDen push-to-talk service. It is strictly CDMA.PROS:Clear sound/calls, even on speaker phoneQWERTY keyboard (flip rather than slider)MicroSD slot to access/save MP3s/video/docsPlays video (Youtube)Records video (176x194 or 128x96 res) with modes (day, night, beach/snow, etc)Camera (up to 1200x1600, 2MP) w/editor, modes (day, night, beach), & special fxMulti-shot camera shutter option (instead of 1 photo, can take 4 or 8 in a row - so you don't miss that shot of the game/baby/pet in action)Few dropped calls (in Chicago)Accepts java JAR/JAD mobile appsBluetoothTough phone: dropped a lot, never broke (with no skin/case for protection)Outer touch screen doubles as mirror to check teeth, makeupNative email app is goodWeb access not crippled by BoostGPS (can be turned on or off)Flip protects color display screen (unlike slider phones)Voice controlVibration feedback for outer touch screen dialingClick feedback for QWERTY keyboardPhone is not \"dumbed down\" or restricted (Straight Talk phones are)You can customize your desktop/main menu 'wallpaper'Outer dial screen lockout (so no butt-dialing)CONS:Weird overall design (external vibration feedback touchscreen,  only low res B/W, to dial numbers?)Touch-screen dialing sometimes temperamentalAwkward camera shutter button and lens placementNon-standard 2.5mm headphone jackLittle customization of main menu/submenus/appearanceOuter touch pad doesn't textCan't natively open/edit MSOffice/PDF docsNo 1-handed texting (QWERTY keyboard=too wide; flip-open is more like slider)Native calendar doesn't sync w/Google Calendar/Outlook50 email limit/max 3K text per email with native email appNative browser=crapNative music player=lousyBluetooth is limited, clunky, user-unfriendlyVoice control unreliableClick feedback for QWERTY fatigues fingers/thumbsCan't use your own ring tones (at least, I haven't figured out how, yet)Some details:You CAN'T dial while wearing gloves. The outer touch screen vibration-feedback dialing face makes this impossible. But if you live someplace warm, like southern California or Florida, this probably won't be an issue for you. Sadly, it is in northern Illinois, Wisconsin, etc.After I updated the data service on my Incognito, I could not download apps directly from GetJar.com using the native browser (which I previously could do). I have to use Opera Mini, Bolt Browser, or UC Browser to go to GetJar.com. When I do, GetJar.com can't detect my phone version automatically. I have to choose it manually/enter it. When I click to download apps, Opera/Bolt/UC then opens the crappy native browser to download the java app(s). Stupid work-around, but necessary.Java apps that work well:Opera Mini 4Foreca (real-time weather satellite pix! Gorgeous, flawless app, highly recommended, despite transition-screen ads, which are fairly unobtrusive)GmailGoogle Maps (works!: I've gotten un-lost with it)Moon and MoonPhase (apps to show moon phases/ephemeris)GWeather (simple weather app)Wattpad mobile e-text/e-readerZipUtility = opens zipped files (e.g. .SRT subtitles of movies/TV shows; TXT files)MTextReader (to open TXT files)DocX Reader (for MS Office .docx files)Many games, such as:AsteroidsMr Hungry=PacManSudokuBreakIn/Arkabrick/SimplePong = PongSimonSol = SolitaireGcal (local access to Google calendar w/o browser)HangmanMobileDiary = to do/shopping/task listMobileInvaders = Space Invaders(Yes, I like the retro-arcade/Atari game ports. If I could find a port of Tempest for this phone, &/or Leisure Suit Larry &/or Adventure &/or Pitfall, I'd be tickled pink for months. It's not that I don't like Call of Duty... I just get nostalgic over Frogger and stuff like that, the same way I can appreciate the best of Bowie yet sing along with Trio's \"Da da da.\")I've also downloaded many (MANY) public domain e-reader books. These also tend to be old (hence in the public domain because copyrights expired). These include books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the Sherlock Holmes stories), Jack London, Jane Austen, Mary Wollstonecraft (Frankenstein!), Charles Darwin, William Blake, Goethe... these are all available from Project Gutenberg or U Penn's Online Books site.The native MP3 player doesn't allow playlists or favorites, and won't allow organization of MP3s by artist folders and album folders within the artist folder. It looks on the MicroSD card for MP3 files and displays them in order by ID3 tag info. (MP3s are played in order numerically by track number, then by titles arranged alphabetically, then by artists alphabetically.)This is especially irritating when you have disparate music genres (rock, dance, electronica, classical, opera) on the same MicroSD card . The native player MAKES YOU load MP3s on the card by dumping all MP3s into the MUSIC folder. If you organize the MUSIC folder by artist folders (and album folders within the artist folder), it can't \"see\" the MP3s.So instead of playing track 01 - song title1 - artist1, then track 02 - songtitle2 - artist1, etc., instead it plays 01 Carmen - Overture (Prelude) - Bizet, then 01 Erotica - Madonna, then 01 Gimme Shelter - Rolling Stones, then 01 Purple Haze - Groove Armada, 01 Symphony No. 9 in D minor ('Choral'), Op. 125: Allegro ma non troppo - Beethoven, then 01 The New World - X, etc.After it plays all the \"01\" tracks, it starts playing the \"02\" tracks. This is irritating. And if you  didn't rip 'em right (or edit ID3 track data later to fix), track 11 plays after track 1, track 12 after track 11, and track 2 after track 12. Very annoying, this 'track 1' vs. 'track 01' issue.On the other hand, if you're used to an Ipod Nano, which only plays randomly, this probably won't bother you...The lousy native MP3 player, and inability to view/edit MS Office and PDF files are not deal breakers for me.  I'm happy that I can listen to the MP3s on my old Palm Centro and Blackberry MicroSD cards at all, and with services like Google Docs, inability to view/edit MS Office or PDF docs are less of an issue.Or maybe I should say, Because I've saved $50-100/month on my cell phone bill since I got this phone, the lousy native MP3 player and inability to view/edit MS Office docs or view PDFs is not a deal breaker. If the cost difference was closer to $10-20, those might be deal breakers. But in this economy, to save $50-100/month on my cell bill, I can tolerate the lousy native MP3 player (and the buggy java app LPlayer).With the Opera mini browser, you can sync your desktop Opera bookmarks/tabs with your Opera Mini browser on your phone, so you have access to all your Opera desktop/laptop bookmarks, tabs, and \"Speed Dial\".Xmarks is a Firefox Add-on that also allows you to synch your Firefox (or IE or Safari on Mac OS X) bookmarks with their online server.  You can access your bookmarks and open browser tabs from any browser, on any Internet-capable device, by going to [...], and logging in.Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to convince you the Incognito is a smartphone. It's not.But if you are slightly technically inclined, and you like to use/appreciate open-source/freeware apps,  or if you're a gadget-y type of person, or really into customizing your stuff, and enjoy researching, searching for, finding and downloading apps to customize your phone - you can make this into a pseudo-smartphone and it will serve you well.You will have to put in a little work to make it into a pseudo-smartphone, but if you enjoy exploring tech gadgets and customizing them, not to mention exploring all the wonderful open-source/freeware apps out there, it' won't be work to \"smarten up\" this Incognito; it will be fun.Has it crashed on me? Yeah, a few times. Often when the battery is on its last bar. Usually, just popping out the battery and putting it back in and restarting the phone is enough to fix the problem. A couple times I had to pop the battery out twice in a row.Boost is the pre-paid arm of Sprint/Nextel, so Boost uses the Sprint/Nextel towers. Boost never charges for roaming; it's nationwide talk/text/web. When I go visit family in Wisconsin or Indiana, service continues along Interstate highways. But it is spotty in rural areas on rural highways or state routes, and calls do get dropped when I drive into a dead zone where there's no towers. It's also not as reliable in mountainous areas.But I  really, really, REALLY appreciate the fact that my monthly cell bill is now $55 instead of $95, $115, $140. I broke out of a contract with US Cellular and was charged $150. But I was paying $100-150/month for my Blackberry at the time. In 3 months of Boost's $50/month unlimited talk/text/web, I basically paid for the $150 contract-breaking fee.So there you have it.

Being a Boost customer, I had seen the different types of phones (I really wanted a Clutch when they came out), but I had one of their more simpler bar phones.Once the Incognito made it to the stores, it was always out of stock.  A chance encounter at a Best Buy far away from my home set up the right conditions for me to get it and one for my boss.The things I like most are the qwerty keyboard (I never had one before), built-in camera, and the micro SD slot.  I have not had many problems with the network. There are some dropped calls and dead zones here and there.I love the convience of the mobile web and the included FaceBook application.

At first they started with huge, bulky, flip phones that have a walkie-talkie feature. They have finally upgraded to newer phones. Some phones aretouch screen while others are not.  One phone in particular is the incognito made by Sanyo. This phone has a lot of different features. Some of these features include, a ful QWERTY keyboard, GPS enabled, hands free speakerphone, glow-through touchscreen, and much more. Even though these ar some of the upsides to the new phones there are some down falls.  If you are looking for a compatible phone, I would not buy this phone. The Incognito constantly drops calls and freezes up. I am finding myself always taking out my battery and re-starting the phone a million times a day.  Also, if you want to text message someone, but you want to be discreet about it this phone is not the phone for you.  When typing on the keyboard the clicking noise is really loud, so everyone can hear that you are texting.  Lastly, this phone is horrible when it comes to volume. You can adjust the volume to exactly how loud or quiet you need it to be. A down fall about this feature is that the vibrate option is terrible. When the phone vibrates to let you know hat you have a phone call or a text message, it is so loud that no one can miss it. Everyone around you will look at you like you are crazy.  The boost mobile the Incognito is a horrible phone to have if you want to text discreetly, have a virate feature that only you can hear, and a phone that doesnt freeze up every ten minutes. Even though it is one of the newest phones boot mobile has come up with and is touch screen somewhat, I still would no reccomend buying this phone.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Gabrielle2128", "ReviewID": "R11ZZEG9QTENDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Considering the price, I think this phone was a good purchase!

I thought it looked good and its a mirror, I'm a girl what could go wrong. I got it...quickly realized it will get dirty SOOO much. When there is smuges on the outside you can't even function the buttons, you need to either open it or clean it right away. I personally don't have time for that when I am on the move. About the second week I had it, it began to freeze. I'd have to completely shut down my phone and take the battery out. It does it atleast 3x WEEKLY. I never get alerts for my email. The format is horrible. I love boost. I have no problem with them, but I really am waiting for my Blackberry now, I plan on crushing this phone under a car. I cannot believe this is this bad. My husband got the new upgrade. He is having the SAME problems. Sometimes we cant even hear each other. Its annoying. He has the same problems.

Yes, it's a Sanyo but it's also made in China - like everything else in the U.S. Some things from China are okay but this phone is definitely not on that list. After only three months from buying this phone brand new at Target, the house charger no longer charges the phone. I'm not sure if it's the charger or the phone itself. It doesn't make the connection at the port. And the phone hasn't been dropped, submerged in water or subjected to any other type of abuse. Either way, it doesn't really matter because now it's off to either buy a new charger or else scrap the phone. I'm choosing the latter option. One of the other reasons is that the ability to use the touch pad requires that one slide a switch on the side; I think that is an inferior design choice, especially when looking at a similar model from Samsung which requires only that you push a button on the side - much easier than sliding a switch. Also, the mirror finish on the Boost phone gets so greasy from normal, daily usage. I'm going back to my Motorola phone - a much better phone so far, even without all the bells and whistles of this Sanyo. One more point, after I performed a software update on the Sanyo Incognito, it stopped working as well when trying to read email and watch videos on YouTube, for some reason.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "danielle", "ReviewID": "R2QNWHPETO8GCU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from worldsource on amazon, since i recieved the phone the front screen work when it wants to.
