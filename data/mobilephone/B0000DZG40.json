{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic Little Phone Is Almost Perfect", "Author": "Matt Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R2R31VP0UVQW5W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I switched to this phone from the Motorola T720i, and boy what an improvement.  The T720i was large, flimsy, and slooooooow - naviging the menus was an excersize in frustration.  The E105 fit the bill perfectly with its small size, good construction, and fast menus.The E105's full color screen looks fantastic and adding a picture is as easy as sending an email to your phone with an attached 128x128 pixel jpg image.  Callers sound good on the phone and not at all tingy, and I've had good reports from people I call about how I sound.  Polyphonic ringtones sound great and plenty loud, but unfortunately Samsung didn't include an option to assign specific ring tones to individual contacts or to assign downloaded tones to some events such as an incoming message.  Battery life is good enough for even heavy use, meaning you'll never run it out in less than a day.  A Lithium-ion battery is included, so you can charge the phone whenever you're near a charger without worrying about battery memory.The case is very well designed and all the parts fit together nicely.  It is not at all wobbly at the hinge like some clamshell flip phones can be.  The buttons have a good tactile feedback and logical placement.The built in organizer is very useful and the monthly calender is a great feature (you can view a standard calender layout for the month).  You also have the ability to set three independent types of alarms with the option to have the phone power on for an alarm event.  It also has a voice memo feature to leave yourself a reminder, though there is no voice dialing feature on the phone.The WAP browser (Tzones) works quickly, though somewhat oddly.  Depending on what kind of link you're viewing, you may have to choose Options > Select to select the link rather than just selecting it...there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.  There is also no way to access bookmarks stored on the phone once you're in Tzones - you have to exit out of tzones to get to them.  Fortunately, T-Mobile has the option to store bookmarks online in your Tzones menu.  When viewing pictures or listening to ring tones online you don't get an option to save, as they are automatically saved any time you view/listen to one.  If you didn't want it, you have to go into your phone and delete it.  If you did, you'll want to go into your phone and  rename it.All in all, despite some minor issues the phone is strong in all the areas required to make it a great phone and I'm glad I purchased it!Pros:Compact & LightweightGood Construction (not wobbly like some clamshell flip phones)Fast MenusGreat Color ScreenLoud Polyphonic RingerGood Buttons w/Tactile FeedbackCons:No Voice DialingSome WAP Browser OdditiesCan't Assign Ring Tones To Individual Contacts*Edit 08/18/04:The phone is still going strong, and I'm still very satisfied it!  A couple of items to correct though:First; although there is indeed no way to assign ring tones to individual contacts, you can assign ring tones to contact groups (of which you can have 10), and then you can assign individual contacts to one of your 10 groups.Second; the Tzones browser has some features that I missed.  For selecting links, you can use the Tzones button in the center of the navigation 4-way, which eliminates the oddities that I found using the top-left soft key.  By pressing and holding the # key, you CAN access your saved favorites while in Tzones.  And finally, pressing and holding the * key will bring up a Tzones-specific menu while you're in the Tzones browser.", "Date": "November 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good little phone.", "Author": "S.

I think Samsung makes a quality phone overall. However, they do some things that aggravate me. The holster that comes with the phone does NOT allow you to make or receive calls or txtmsgs while its in the holster! You simply can't open the cover at all while its in the holster. Therefore, you also can't turn it on or off. Also, the headphone jack is not a standard 2.5mm jack - the jack is standard - in fact, it looks identicle to a regular jack - but if you plug a \"universal\" headset in there, it will redial the last number you called - this is because Samsung requires a \"special\" 2.5mm plug for this phone - that means you either have to go back to Samsung for one of these headsets or you have to buy a particular one made for this phone.  Other than that, its a great phone. Battery life is good... I can even read the display in the sunshine (which is a nice improvement from the S105).", "Date": "November 10, 2003"}, {"Title": "some new trick with E105", "Author": "Khue Q. Ngo", "ReviewID": "R1ILNQVWDYB3P6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello, thank you guys for sharing very useful information about this phone. Here are some new tricks that i found recently:1. In address book, a contact person is not restricted to 4 fields(home, office, cell and email address) only. You can put as much as you want about contact information of one person, say, some person might have more than 1 email address or more than 1 office phone number. Here is how to do: go to the contact person, select Option/Add Entry then you can add any information you want such as new email or work phone. Off course, it will eat up one spot in the memory.2. Customize your email address: your cell-email that your friend send sms to, have the form ten_digit_phone@tmomail.net, for instance 850339XXXX@tmomail.net, you can change to easy-to-remember-email such as yourname@tmomail.net. Here is how to do it: Go to t-mobile.com, log in then select \"Communication\" tab, select \"Text Messaging\", on the left window, at \"Power Messaging feature\", select \"Change my phone's email address\".On this, you can creat spam/keyword filter or forwarding email or set up alert to your cellphone.3. To know how many anytime minutes you used so far: just send sms to #646# number (#MIN#), the system will instantly reply you. The nice thing is you do not pay for this message (both sending and receiving) and you can check as often as you wish. It updates pretty fast.4. Send one sms to more than one person:One sms can be sent to a group of people buy putting \",\" between people email addresses or tel numbers.Although this phone has some minor drawbacks but with t-mobile carrier, it provides great quality and services more than I expected (compare with some poor services provided by my old carrier CINGULAR)", "Date": "January 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fine as a phone; bells and whistles need work", "Author": "Jim Carson \"http://www.jimcarson.com\"", "ReviewID": "RUYP884TOKJY1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded phones (and carriers) from the venerable Nokia 6100, which I've had for three years.  My first impression was amazement at how light and tiny the phone was.  Folded up, it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket.My next impression was one of despair: I had over 150 numbers and there was no way download what I already had in Outlook and my Sony Clie running PalmOS into my phone.  (To be fair, this was the same with my Nokia 6100.)  Manually entering them is incredibly tedious.  The T9 mode would initially seem like the best way to go, but it goes on tangents for some of the stranger names.  The alpha method of entering has an annoying delay before you can toggle case.  There's a function for Camel Case, but it doesn't work at the beginning of a new entry.  The phone \"crashed\" itself once, but soon recovered.I do like the ability to organize multiple contacts under the same name.  Unfortunately, if you make a mistake in which bucket (cell, home, work, email), you can't edit it.Another strange feature is storing the phone numbers in the phone versus SIM.  There's no way to transfer them, and I'm unsure why you'd store any in the \"phone\" if the SIM still has slots left.Ring tones can be made quite loud.  The standard array of tones include the T-mobile jingle, some strange polyphonic tones, and a bunch of songs like the Chinese Tea Dance tune from the Nutcracker.  You can download additional songs for a buck each.  While it was initially funny to have my phone play \"Stairway to Heaven\" with each ring, the joke gets old quick.  One problem is it's easy to blend into the background, another is the song is longer than th eperiod before the incoming call rolls over into voice mail.  I'd prefer some more subtle tones and/or lighting that is less likely to bother the people I work with.The screen is 128x128, with 65k colors.  This is a vast improvement over my ancient Nokia.  However, it's really only useful for small bits of information.  Beyond that, it's cumbersome.  For example, all four java games are difficult to see, and chess is the only one that's close to playable, despite the board being set up incorrectly.  There are more games available for download for a fee.The WAP browser is very slow to connect and almost as slow navigating between links.  There's a shortcut for saving links, which is great because finding the \".\" in amazon.com required more keystrokes than it should.  Given the lack of screen space and the delay between pages, I'm not sure how useful I will find this feature.I haven't done that much with the organizer yet. As a standalone personal information manager, the screen's too small and the input is too tedious to be the primary tool.  On the other hand, assuming the synchronization works with the calendar.  The T-Zones service purports to give access to calendaring, though it has a lot of other stuff that I don't have a particular interest in.  (Horoscopes, anyone?)The phone's voice quality is good, though the profile is slightly small for my head.  Battery life is fine, too.Overall, the phone's okay, but bells and whistles need work.", "Date": "February 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2FE29JG5FV5WC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great!  Much improved over the previous S105 model (except for the fact that the S105 is GSM900/1800/1900 and the E105 is only GSM900/1900).  Here are my observations regarding this phone...PROS:* Loud ringtones and ear volume* Good colorful screen* Good AIM interface* Infrared* Handset connector _IS_ standard 2.5mm (unlike the S105 which was not)* Perfect compact size... one of the smallest phones I've seen* Decent battery life and reception* Phone has a solid feel and buildCONS:* No bluetooth* No GSM850 band which makes the phone somewhat less useful if it is unlocked for use with AT&T or Cingular* Some annyoing minor software issues like Java which is not compatible with all midlets, no real ring and vibrate at the same time (instead the ring and vibrate feature is actually vibrate first, then ring)* Rather limited selection of included ringtones (though you can download plenty of new ones off the internet using infrared or cable with free software available Samsung)I think anyone who buys this phone for use with T-Mobile will not be dissappointed.  Also, it is really worth reading the manual becuase there are a lot of 'hidden' features like lighting up the external display with the flip closed by pressing one of the side buttons for a few seconds or how to assign different ringtones to different caller groups.", "Date": "November 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "Insight on Upgrading to Family Plan and Number Porting", "Author": "\"vj0\"", "ReviewID": "R2GABJMYEW0OVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon does not offer family plans, and the number porting process is relatively new, so I want to share my experience with these processes (based on the instructions from this website), in addition to the phone itself.Got my phone a week ago from Amazon, with the intent to upgrade to a T-Mobile family plan and port my old number (both these have to be done directly with T-Mobile, not Amazon).  The new phone arrived  earlier than Amazon predicted, activated with a new number.I went to a local TMo store to do my intened changes, as outlined by Amazon.  I already have another T-Mo phone, and the family plan upgrade was a breeze:  the rep called it in and when I checked online my plan was indeed changed.The porting part was more tricky; they told me up to 7 days to change my number from AT&T.;  Two days later my account with ATT was terminated, but still not active on TMo.  After being on hold 30 minutes with TMo, I was told \"if you're porting a number to replace an existing number (which I was), it's not done automatically -- you have to call it in a we manually do it.\"  Good thing I persevered on hold; within minutes I got a text msg saying it's done.The fun part now is waiting for the rebates to be processed.  With the changes I made, my plan and phone number now don't match  up with my purchase, even though it's all legit.  You know how they're sticklers for detail for these rebates.With the phone itself, I'm happy with it and its features.  Call clarity on my AT&T; TDMA Nokia 8265 was better, however.  I do hear the voice hum and amplified ambient noise as others have indicated.  Reception is too sensitive: I move the phone a few inches and the bars go from full down to 1.  But I guess I'm not as picky as other reviewers; I'll live with the minor phone drawbacks to save money on the monthly plan fees.After a year on this contract, I'll be on the prowl for better service as the competition heats up.", "Date": "January 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "a few helpful shortcuts", "Author": "William Hargen", "ReviewID": "R3VO1DN6DLVNRM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone from T-Mobile about 10 days ago.  I have beenvery happy with the features, but I have had some problems withthe outgoing voice quality.  I swapped the phone once already.The new one is better, but still rather poor on some calls.  Itisn't the T-Mobile service since I have tried the same call froma Samsung R225 and that one is much clearer (and that was the*free* phone!).  I will probably try swapping this for aMotorola V300 which was just released.Now, regarding a few of the user interface issues that otherreviewers have mentioned:- When using the browser, sometimes the left soft key is \"Select\"  and one click will go to the current link.  Other times, it is  \"Options\" which brings up a menu, the first item of which is  \"Select\", so it takes two clicks.  It turns out that you can  use the \"T-zones\" button in the center of the four navigation  arrows to do the \"Select\" function.  A single click on that  always works.- When browsing, you can press and hold the \"*\" key to bring up  a menu with the following functions: Reload, Home, Goto URL,  Show URL, Edit Home, Clear Cache, and Inbox.  So you can use  this to go to a new URL without having to exit the browser!- When browsing, you can press and hold the \"#\" key to bring up  your \"Favorite URL\" menu.  So that is another way to to go to  another URL without exiting the browser!- I haven't found a way to associate a ring tone directly with  a phone directory entry.  But you do have ten \"groups\", each  of which has a ring tone (and you can use the same tone for  two or more groups).  And you can set the group for each phone  number.  Note that I said phone number and not directory  entry.  You can put Bob's work number in one group and his  home number in another.  I found this to be annoying since I  never wanted to do this and it means that I have to set the  group for every phone number in an entry and not just once for  the whole entry.  But maybe someone might want to.- And speaking of phone number types and group membership...  That information seems to be stored in the phone and NOT in  the SIM.  When I swapped out my phone and moved the SIM card  to a new one (both Samsung E105's), the numbers that I had  stored in the SIM moved over, but they all became \"cell\"  numbers and lost their group association.  And all the email  addresses were lost too since there wasn't a way to store  them in the SIM.  What was really annoying was that there  doesn't seem to be any way to change the \"type\" of a phone  number.  So the only way to change those 40 or so home and  work numbers from \"cell\" to \"home\" or \"work\" was to delete  them and reenter them.  I suspect that this is a general  limitation of the SIM cards (only able to store certain  standard common attributes), but it sure limits the utility  of that technology.  Too bad.- Sending a text message to an email address is truely bizzare!  As reported, you put the destination email address at the  beginning of the message text, and then send to the number  \"500\".  This smells like a user interface designed by an  engineer!  However, you *can* get the email address from the  phone directory.  As soon as you get to the \"Write New\" screen,  press the \"Options\" soft key and pick \"Add Phonebook\", and  then pick the desired name and email entry.I'm sorry to report voice problems with this phone since it isotherwise quite nice.  Perhaps it is just a few bad ones.  TheT-Mobile customer service rep I spoke with hadn't heard of anyproblems.Anyway, enjoy the shortcuts.--Bill", "Date": "January 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Horrible software?", "Author": "\"la_crumudgeon\"", "ReviewID": "R3JZGUL6RST2RB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone (with T-Mobile service) because of its diminutive weight (under 3 ounces!) and size. Unfortunately, I am now saddled with a horribly juvenile interface. Beautiful hardware has been married to moronic software. Still, regardless of what follows, I am keeping the phone and rating it 3 stars.Now for the annoying stuff. First off, as others have pointed out, there are no normal ring tones. The closest is T-Mobile's theme song. Great. Now I'm a walking advertisement.But that's not all. Turn it on and you get tropical fish; a light house; a fantastically ornate, spinning hour glass (to comfort you while the address book takes forever to load); and an obnoxious animated \"Hello from T-Mobile\" logo (and a corresponding \"Goodby from T-Mobile\" version when you shut it off). Then there are some beautiful icons, in riveting color of course, for each functional category (including the sub-adult \"Fun Box\"), plus some unbelievably tacky 1-bit graphics dancing around on the outside screen whenever you receive a call or have messages. A screen which, by the way (as another reviewer has noted), displays incoming numbers not in full, but by scrolling. I suppose that's supposed to be advantageous and cool since the numbers are moving.And is there a way to turn all this garbage off? Noooo, there is not! I waded through the 160 page manual and then consulted T-Mobile. The rep told me I should get a phone with fewer features! Ha ha. Features indeed. These seem like small issues, but they aren't--any sensible person will want to stomp this thing after a couple of weeks. What a pity that such an amazing piece of hardware has been ruined by marketing dopes (?), clueless software engineers (?), an art department run by 12 year boys (?).One reviewer says that multiple phone numbers cannot be assigned to a name. This is not the case. You can add as many numbers as you want to each name (the menu system makes this confusing--if you've just entered a new number then Options, Add Entry allows you to add another number. If you are adding a number to an existing name then the sequence is Search, View, Options, Add Entry). The numbers, however, cannot be annotated with anything but the three defaults provided by Samsung (Home, Mobile, Work), but I have found that adequate for my purposes.A final note: While I was amazed that the phone can play chess (how well is hard to say, since even at the lowest level it's too slow), I was not surprised that the board is positioned incorrectly, with the white queen on a black square, and that it's almost impossible to play the game because the designers have opted for a flashy three-dimensional representation which obscures the positions and identities of the pieces.", "Date": "December 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Very pleased overall", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"DMac\"", "ReviewID": "R31B8KH9SJDDGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried quite a few cell phones out and I must admit this has been my best to date (muchhhhhh better than nokia, motorola, and sony ericson).

I upgraded from Motorola V60 and I have to say that this phone is far superior. The reception quality is quite good and so far sound quality is good also. There are some great features to the phone such as the huge 64000 color display and polyphonic ringtones. It is small, (smaller then the v60) very light and sleek. The battery life however is mediocre. I usually have to recharge after about 2-3 days especially when writing text messages since the display is a power hog. The phone sometimes seems to be slow while going into menus from the main screen and there are no sound profiles other than the main one and silent mode. If you don't use predictive text writing then writing can a bit clumsy because of having to constantly switch from predictive mode which can not be disabled as the default.

I am happy with the phone overall. No problems and the looks and feel are very good. I also have 2 S105's and 2 Sony T68i's in the family. Up until a couple of weeks ago I was very happy with all the phones and T-Mobile. However one morning when I flipped open my S105 the LCD screen was dead. I knew the warranty was 1 yr and it was just about a year old. When I called Samsung the said T-Mobile warranties the phone and I needed to contact them. When I did they said my service was activated on the same day last year and the phone is therefore 1 day past the warranty and not covered. I argued  how can it be beyond the 1 yr warranty period if I bought it on the same day last year. They said \"the warranty is for 365 days and not 1 yr\". Long story short after numerous phone calls and Samsung intervening they still refused to cover the repairs. I later found my receipt which indicated I actually bought the phone 1 week later so it was clearly within the warranty period. Armed with proof they finally agreed to a warranty replacement. I was then asked if there was any cosmetic damage to my phone.I told them the cheap little plastic cover on the front of the phone has a small crack. They said your waranty is void. WHAT? \"Any cosmetic damage to the phone voids your warranty\" WHAT? Thats rediculous I said. You mean if theres a scratch on the phone the warranty is void? \"Yes, it is considered abuse and voids your warranty.\" I couldn't believe it. I said a scratch is normal wear and tear and I have never seen a phone that did not have a single scratch. They said they consider it abuse and can deny warranty coverage per the warranty agreement. I told them the lense cracked 6 months ago when I put the phone in my pocket and my keys pressed against it when I squatted down (this is true). I never bothered with it because the phone was still working fine. Besides the lense is so thin and cheap it cracks way to easily and has nothing to do with the electronics going bad. Their only response was telling me I was out of luck and they can deny me coverage for any type of cosmetic damage regardless of whether it has anything to do with the defect or not. I told them up until this point I was very happy with T-Mobile. I switched over from ATT and added 4 addtional phone to my account. For a lousy plastic lense you are willing to lose me as a customer in such a competitive industry? Nothing we can do they said. I told them since they say my 1 yr is up just out of principle I am cancelling all five phones from their plan. They said sorry to hear that  and is there anything else they can do for me. What a joke. Anyway if you sign up with T-Mobile and you can't prevent signs of normal wear and tear on the phone, based on my experience if anything goes wrong with it look for T-Mobile to get out of covering it any way they can.", "Date": "November 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Great Phone!", "Author": "\"ktke52\"", "ReviewID": "R1NAIYK8XIKHPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is definitely worth the money.

I am not going to get into any specific shortcuts but if you really want to learn them, the manual shows you all different kinds. or you can look at the generous review below me entitled \"a few helpful shortcuts\"-[light keys] the keys are very easy to press.-[GAMES!] one of the things that impressed me about this phone are the games (includes four: MobileChess, Ultimate Golf Challenge, Bubblesmile, Fun2Link). plus you can download more for a cheap price on the net.-[battery saver] I use my phone (which I have owned for almost a year) throughout the whole day (and might I add, for hours at a time) without it dying on me. All it needs is a good recharge throughout the whole night and it's good to go the whole day. The reason why its so energy efficient is mostly due to the fact that while you're on the phone, it turns off the entire screen after being idle for a while and comes back on with the simple press of a button.-[strong signal] this small phone has a strong signal, even in my basement. I never had a problem with it unless t-mobile itself was at fault.-[etc.] for more details just refer to the technical specifications.Cons:-[scratches galore] although it's extremely durable, it scratches very easy.-[mediocre ringtones] the phone comes with a generous list of ringtones, however, I have found myself only mildly interested in about 5 of the preset tones and ended up downloading more tones instead. also, if you download HiFi ringers (voice ring tones) they only sound for about 6 seconds until it reloops, plus the sound quality is not so great. I recommend motorola for better quality ring tones.-[no camera] if you havent already figured it out, this model has no camera.-[bad quality photos] If you are sent a picture on this phone, the picture's quality is lessened.-[etc.] for more details just refer to the technical specifications.These are only general pros and cons, I have not listed all details. However, as you have read, the cons of this phone are merely minor ones and are outnumbered by the pros.

If all you need is a phone to make calls and not to take pictures, the E105 is for you. Even without a camera, there is a lot to like about this phone as it has a nice sturdy, modern design and is loaded with great features. The most striking feature about this phone is its gorgeous 65K color screen. There is also a grayscale display on the front that displays the time, date, battery and reception which is also quite useful. Another great feature is the indicator light which flashes a different color when receiving calls or messages. You'll instantly know when you've missed a call or message and you can set the default color to your liking. The reception on this phone is quite good even in buildings and the quality of the sound is clear. The E105 also has a nice selection of games including chess and golf. The battery life is average but understandable considering the screen. If you spend your life on the phone, this could be a drawback. The only real fault I find with this phone is its poor selection of ringtones. Some of them are downright weird and there is no standard ringtone which I prefer. Ringtones today, are generation y's version of elevator music. I cannot remember the number of times I have cringed at the sound of a popular song badly rendered as a ringtone. Sometimes, they are about as obnoxious as the person using them. The selection on this phone does not help the problem.", "Date": "November 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good Phone", "Author": "Cool Carla", "ReviewID": "R3FK9A94JDNW4G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I really like this phone. I've dropped it a million times but it keeps on working. Even worse, I've dropped it in the toilet twice! After two days of dry-out time (each time) I turned it on and it worked perfectly! I find that pretty unbelievable! I was shocked actually. And relieved. I thought for sure I'd have to buy another one. Unfortunately, in one of my droppings, the antenna broke off. T-mobile said they would fix it for $60! Instead, I went on E-bay and bought a replacement antenna, unscrewed the back and changed it myself.I agree with some of the complaints:*Screen is hard to see in bright sun*phone book takes too long to \"initialize\" after you turn the phone on*scrolling numbers across the screen is annoying*reception can suck (though I think this is more a function of T-Mobile's coverage than of the phone itself. I think this is true because I've had other phones with TMo service and had the same problem)*very juvenile selection of rings tones.On the other hand:*I like the\"one-touch\" txt msgsing -- just push the left key and you're ready to type  -- bang!*T9 feature (the default) for text messaging is great! For those who say it gives them the wrong word and then they have to go to Alpha Mode -- WRONG! If you finish a word and it isn't the one you want, BEFORE you put in a space, push the down key and it will begin giving you alernate choices. Example: if you want the word \"food\" it will actually give you the word \"done\" first -- which isn't what you want in this case. So simply push the down key and it will change to \"food\", push it again and it will change to \"fond\", push again and it will change to \"dome\", etc. When the word you were trying for comes up, just put in a space and keep typing the rest of your sentence.*Another T9 tip: for contractions, such as \"can't\", type in c-a-n-then the number \"1\" key (which will give you a period) - then \"t\". As soon as you hit the last letter (\"t\") the period will magically change to an apostrophe. Neat!*Still another tip: Sometimes you don't realize you've got a wrong word in your sentence til after you've finished. No worries! Just scroll back (with the left key) until the cursor is positioned just after the last letter of the word you want to change. Now push the \"down\" key to get all the other word options.*But that's not all: For punctuation, hit the number \"1\" key. It will give you a period. Push the \"down\" key and you will get a comma, a dash, a question mark, and exclamation, an apostrophe, an @ sign, a colon, a semi-colon, a slash, and a number 1. You simply keep pushing the down key until what you want is displayed.*Remember in T9 you can access numbers from all keys too. If you press the \"a\" key for instance but really want the number \"2\", just push the down key for options and keep pushing til the \"2\" displays.*Here's a T9 feature I discovered by accident: If you're spelling something weird that is not in the phone's dictionary (and by the way you can add your own words to the dictionary), then type the first part of the word (let's say you want the name \"Darrel\" which isn't in the dictionary) -- simply type in the first part of the word \"Dar\", it will first display \"Far\", now push the down key multiple times until \"Dar\" appears. Now, push the # sign to get a space. Now push the Clear key to back up. Now type the balance of the word \"rel\" and you will have the complete word. It seems that putting a space after a word, then hitting the Clear key to move back, somehow locks what you just typed from changing anymore. Now only the new letters you add on will change when you push the down key. It's VERY fast once you've done it a few times and keeps you from having to go into Alpha Mode.*I like the fact that the ringers are very loud. And so is the earpiece volume.*Once person said that there is no way to send a person to voicemail without opening the phone, which is then of course, the same as answering it. WRONG! When your phone is ringing, push the button on the side -- it silences the ringer -- but the phone is still actually ringing and will continue to ring as long as it normally would, except now you can't hear it.. When that time elapses it will click over to voice-mail.*This can be handy if you're in a place where you need time to look at the screen to see if you want to take the call but need to silence the ringer immediately. Even if you have silenced it by pushing the button, you still have as much time to decide to take the call as you would if you could still hear it. If you decide not to, it simply goes to voice-mail.*Someone else said they needed a special headset to fit the phone -- but I bought one at a thrift store and it worked fine. And unlike another's complaint, it allows me to answer and talk on the phone without flipping the phone open. It's great.*Another tip: Type up a little sticker on your computer that says \"If found, please call (friend/spouse name) at (their phone number).\" I have inadvertently left mine several times, and someone always calls my friend to say they have the phone. I made my daughter do this to her phone and one time I got a call from the Phoenix airport in the middle of the night telling me they found her phone.*To keep names together in the phonebook, I put a common word in front. Example: for restuarants, I put \"Eat.\" in front of each one, then their name (like \"Eat.Outback Stkhse\"). This keeps all the restaurants together as I scroll through my phone book (I don't really like having the extra keystroking to find them in a \"group\" -- I just like to have them right there with the rest of my numbers).", "Date": "April 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Phone Is Perfect", "Author": "\"macbain00\"", "ReviewID": "R3SI5RY2O3LZAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Almost every review is right except the individual ringer part.

Case = no scratches or dings.  For some reason flip phones are delicate flowers while brick or candy bar styles like Nokia are tanks.  Spend $10 for a case or cover and forget about it.2) The ringer could be louder and there's no vibrate then ring option - just vibrate OR ring3) Really bad ringtones easily overcome by downloading new ones at T-Mobile.

I am a vibrate only guy. The problem is I probably miss 60% of the calls I get because I don't notice the vibrate. Unless I am just sitting quietly, it is hard to notice the vibrate. Lastly (and to be fair there may be a way to rectify this, but I couldn't figure it out), the VM indicator is sent to the phone as a text message which doesn't get automatically erased after listening to your VM.

Just after the warrenty stops.  I would suggest that if you are extra careful when you close your phone, it will probably prolong the life of the display.  But I digress.  I had the previous S105 model and the display went bad about 16 months after I purchased it.  I had the 1000 minute T-Mobile plan for 9 months, and then I dropped down to the $10 cheaper plan for one month, and then went back to the 1000 minute plan for the past 6 months.  When the phone went bad, I asked T-Mobile what they could do, and since the phone was out of warrenty, they offered a new phone which I did not like for $50 out of my pocket.  I had the bright idea that I could order a new phone from Amazon for basically free, and have a replacement Samsung and still come out ahead.  When I went to cancel the current contract, T-Mobile told me that I was still under contract for six months. When I switched back to the 1000 minute plan, it started my contract time all over again.  They wanted to charge me $200 to terminate the contract. I spent 20 minutes complaining to the supervisor, and she offered to reduce the termination fee to $100, which I had to accept since I would be paying for two phones.  Apparently, they consider the 1000 minutes to be a promotional plan, and they had the right in the small print to not give me credit for being a T-Mobile customer for the past 16 months on a 12 month contract.  I have never had this problem with Sprint before and I was very upset that T-Mobile would treat their customers in this way.  I have written a letter to their customer service asking for a refund, but I have had no response to my letter, which is also a major disappointment to me that they could not even acknowledge the they even received my letter.  So if you purchase a T-Mobile phone, DON'T CHANGE YOUR SERVICE or else you will be responsible for a new 12 month contract the second you make the change.  The phone is a great deal, and if you handle your phone carefully, and don't change your service, you will come out ahead.  I fault T-Mobile for NEVER telling me when I made the change in service that a new contract would be starting, and they should be like other carriers that don't care if you change plans as long as you  stay a customer.

First is the painful way to send email - not text messaging - to others.  You can't set up an email address in your phone book and simply send a message there; nooooo... you have to type in the other person's email address as the first line of your message, then guess how many characters will be used as a subject, then type your message; you actually send it to \"500.\"Here's the rub - the email address has to be part of the message, not where you send the note to!  The T-mobile techie said the only way to \"automate\" that is to set up your templates as email addresses.  So you can only include 9 email addresses (if you blow up all your existing templates).  That's so ridiculous.  Just about everyone has an email address now, why do we have to monkey around with this klunky way to send to emails?The second thing about this phone is its small size.  It's almost too small.  It keeps slipping around in my hand.  I was tossing up between this one and the Motorola V300, which has slightly rubberized trim; I'm almost wishing I had gotten that one (except I've heard horrid things about Moto's phones).I'm not overwhelmed with the T-mobile network's sound quality, but I had such a bad experience at ATT that I made the switch.

M. Myers \"lenimo\"", "ReviewID": "R1MIX1XP1RQSTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for three years. It is basic--no frills (other reviews list the features)--but never irritating. What a delight to own one device that fulfills its intended function.My calls don't drop, and the menu navigation is intuitive. The backlighting is excellent--I can always read the screen. Every month or so I drop the phone on concrete, tile, or some other hard surface, with the only result being scars on the casing. I've dropped it in a sink filled with dirty dishwater and, um, down a toilet--soaped it up after the latter adventure and it was a little funny-acting for 12 hours until the battery contacts dried, but then everything was back to normal. Amazing.A year ago I noticed that the hinge action was not as tight as it used to be, so thinking it was on its way out, I was going to upgrade my phone. For silly reasons I missed the upgrade boat when I re-upped my T-Mobile contract. However, the hinge loosening turned out not to be an issue--it hasn't gotten worse. The phone has outlasted three chargers and several friendships. Pretty great for a planned obsolecence product.I gather battery life of newer cell models is generally two hours longer than the e105 (up from 3 to 5), and I bet the memory cards are bigger--I'm a text-message pack-rat and don't get to store as many as I'd like. I never set it to view pic messages--don't even know if it can. These are nominal downsides given how I use it. And, I dunno, I feel sort of attached to it at this point.", "Date": "April 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "With only a few downsides, a great phone", "Author": "Philip M. White", "ReviewID": "R3LQGDJK4WZMU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this phone for 15 months now, so I pretty much know the ins and outs of it.First, let's cover the negatives:1) It does not synchronize its clock with the tower, and the clock loses about a minute per week.2) The antenna permanently protrudes and may break, given enough pressure.  (This has apparently happened to at least one reviewer.)3) There is no way to turn off useless animation on the main screen.  Apparently every background has been designed with animation in mind, with the PURPOSE for said animation being a distant minor issue.  For example, my background of choice is a monthly calendar.  Above it is a large number that indicates the month (right now, \"7\"), but beside it are three mysterious cubes of differing sizes which rotate once per second.  WHY???  Also, in the period of time after I dial someone's number but before they pick up, there is another very mysterious animation: it looks like balloons on the bouncing up and down on the surface of water.  I would rather preserve the battery than to waste valuable power on puzzling me with useless animations.Despite the fact that I've had the phone for so long, it still sometimes surprises me with its well-thought-out design.The shell:I'm impressed with how durable the flip aspect of the phone feels.  I've compared it to other phones, and those just feel flimsy.  This one is either reliably open, or reliably closed, like a seat belt.  The earbud jack is tightly plugged by an attached rubber flap.  However, the power jack is not -- the phone came with a detached rubber plug which I lost soon thereafter.  The only control accessible when the phone is flipped shut is the volume control which also serves the purpose of activating the backlighting of the front display as well as of silencing an incoming call without disconnecting it, allowing you to silence it, make a very rapid exit, and to answer it then.  Very good design.The front display:The front display is generally not backlit but still on, like typical calculators.  When there is no action, it shows the time, date, signal strength, and battery life.  When someone calls, the display lights up and displays the person (or the phone number) calling.  When I receive a text message, it displays a mailbox.  If you are in a dark area and want to see the display, you can hold the volume toggle on the side and the backlight will turn on for a few seconds.The main display:Aside from negative item #3 above, the main display is well-designed.  In the white bar at the top there is signal and battery strength, and the bottom bar displays what actions the top two keys on the keypad will perform.  (Typically \"Menu <---> Ph. Book\")  Above the bottom bar is a clock, and the rest of the screen is occupied by a background of your choice.  I like the calendar because it's the most useful, but the phone comes with wallpapers such as \"Season\", \"Eagle\", \"Bird\", as well as several other semi-useful ones such as \"Digital Clock\" and \"Analog Clock\".  The main display will dim after about 10 seconds of inactivity, and will turn off about additional 20 seconds later.  (I think this is configurable.)Visual alert:The phone has an LED next to the antenna in the top-right front corner.  Typically it lazily flashes green once every ~10 seconds just to let you know that the phone is alive.  When someone is calling, it frenetically cycles through all its colors, about 5 per second, to get your attention.  When someone sends you a text message, it blinks about twice every second.  Quite useful.The menus:Every option of the menus can be reached either by scrolling up and down through nested menus, or by entering a sequence of digits on the keypad.  Here, too, the top-level menu shows just one option per \"page\", with the rest of the page being filled by another animation.  However, these animations are actually pertinent to the option rather than mystifying me.  This phone is very configurable: there are separate top-level categories for Sound Settings, Phone Settings, and Network Services, and they contain all kinds of stuff.  For example, you can configure whether the phone answers an incoming call when you flip it open, or whether you have to press a button explicitly.  You can choose from the standard three languages for the interface.  You can set up an approved list of phone numbers that the phone is able to dial.  You can set the clock to display military time both on the front and main displays.Phone book:You may add multiple phone numbers per contact, and the phone can differentiate between home, work, and mobile numbers as well as an email address, by displaying different icons next to each number.Predictive text:There isn't much to say about it since it is a standard feature nowadays, but it is well-integrated: in almost every text field you can choose to enter text in predictive mode.Stability:I've heard many stories of the operating system on cell phones being unstable and requiring a reboot every so often.  Not this one -- I never need to turn it off.  Furthermore, I haven't discovered a single flaw.  (The negative aspects mentioned above are by design, so I don't consider them flaws.)  It has been said that the phone is slow to initialize, which I suppose is true, but the simple solution is: don't turn it off!Battery life:To continue with my \"don't turn it off\" suggestion: there is just no need to, as the battery life is very good.  The indicator has three bars total, and I've only *once* seen it go down to two bars -- this is after about 24 hours of being unplugged and occasionally used.  It charges very quickly, too.

Menu access response times are laggy (often 1- to 2-second pause after a button is pushed before a menu will come up, sometimes longer).4.

The sound quality on calls is excellent, and having AIM is awesome! I have friends on T-mobile and the text messaging is a hot ticket!! The whole organizer section (calendar, alarm, to-do list, calculator and phone book) makes this phone practically indispensible to me. Add cool Java games and a huge selection of ring tones (and the ability to download more) and I don't know how I ever lived without it.I have two minor complaints - one is the number of steps it takes to delete things (numbers from the phone book, text messages, etc.), I have to go into the message, click options, select delete and then confirm (my old phone was half as many steps). The other feature missing is personalized ringtones (different rings for different callers).", "Date": "April 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Tiny, Light, a Real Delight", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RSJQYXDZ5E8BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first cell phone and while it has it's share of negatives (the same negatives that many phones have), I am very pleased I ended up with it. It is small, but flips out to a rather \"full sized\" profile to fit your face pretty nicely and clips to your belt unobtrusively. Here are the major features I bought it for and what I now think of them:0. Size - it had to be small, and it is. It is fairly tiny. I ended up purchasing a CellStar leather case/beltclip for it (which I would highly recommend, available at BestBuy, where I got mine...it's a pretty well thought-out and well-made piece), which makes it a fair amount wider and more \"conventionally-sized,\" but at least it is conventionally-sized when *protected* from drop damage, etc.Thumbs up for size.1. Voice notes - I was hoping I'd be able to get rid of my current digital voice recorder, but no such luck: you only get five voice notes at a maximum of thirty seconds each. What's more, you have to go through all sorts of steps just to record a blasted note (Menu > Organizer > Voice Memo > Record > Record (again, to actually start it) > Stop)...what a pain! Well, I guess I'm keeping my Digital Voice Recorder for now.2. Easy entry of a phone number - I would say this is *pretty* easy, except for one thing: the LOUSY text entry. All you do is enter the number, then hit \"Save,\" then go through the process of selecting where you want it saved (SIM or phone memory...you SHOULD be able to just set this to a default to skip this step, but you can't), and naming it. The memory location selection thing adds an unnecessary step, in my opinion, making this process *just* step over the point of being annoying, Ultimately, it gets faster as you learn it.As an aside, I'd like to say that while I didn't give other phones as much attention as I gave this one, the text entry on this unit is really awful, and not terribly intuitive: I've played with other units that are automatically in \"Ab\" mode (first letter capitalized, remaining letters lower-case), but here you generally have to switch to that mode with far-flung keys in different corners of the pad. What's more, the \"T9\" mode (where you press a key once and it matches the keys with known words to try to guess what you are trying to say) is pretty much a joke: out of every three words I attempt, it maybe gets one right. Well, it generally does select an actual word, just not the one you want! This means you have to back-track and redo it, but first you must switch to \"uppercase/lowercase\" mode, blah, blah, blah.To sum the aside up, TEXT ENTRY is a PAIN. It should just default to Uppercase/lowercase mode right away, and let you select the not-always-awesome T9 mode if you wish.Other than those two main features, anything else would be icing on the cake. This unit, as mentioned previously, has no voice-activated dialing. This is not ideal, as I'd like to be able to shout a name into the phone in my car and have it do it's thing, but at least it does have speed dials. Plus, in public, I wouldn't want to be using voice-actived dialing, anyways, so it's not a total wash.The front display is nice and is nicely backlit. It has all the expected icons (voicemail, sms, signal strength, battery power, and then the time printed large with the date as well).The color screen on the inside of the unit is very nice looking, certainly brighter and prettier than others I saw in the T-Mobile store. Setting the settings is relatively easy, as is navigating through the menus and stuff.Changing the volume is easy and intuitive, right to the side of the unit. It has an IrDA transceiver on it's other side, as well, and has some IrDA functions, which I  don't use!The reception outside is always five bars, but inside it can dip as low as one bar pretty easily. This is in our thick-walled house; I was warned about T-Mobile service in our area (Verizon was recommended), but T-Mobile had better minute deals and such.Browsing WAP sites is pretty OK. The phone certainly can't just take any old site and give it to you; it seems a little erratic in what it can and cannot do. Some sites have surprised me and have displayed, while others just wouldn't display. Any WAP site is fine, generally speaking. Yahoo, Google, MSN, Dictionary.com, etc. is great.The video games you get are super-boring. The only good one is chess, but the lack of a mouse and having to use small-ish keypad buttons make it slightly more tedious than it's worth. There is a silly pipe-connecting game, a bubble-popping/pattern game and some other one so uninspiring I can't even remember what it is. I'd like to download more, but they are $3.99 each, so FORGET that. (I checked on the mystery game and it's some golf game...not at all as EXCITING as it might sound).I'm not able to comment on the battery life with any certainty at this point. I charged it fully the first time yesterday and it lasted until this morning, after a day of heavy usage. This could be good, I guess, since keeping a charge days on end would result from only occasional usage, I presume.All in all, I am pleased. The unit is my first, but there are no glaring deficiencies, so I am generally pleased, if not without a real frame of reference. Plus, this thing actually made me some money after rebate, so I have no complaints all around.", "Date": "January 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Beware if you want to sync with your PIM", "Author": "\"b_decker\"", "ReviewID": "RXMDQN8JC0Y5V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a nice little phone with a good color screen but the IR port does not work with any device other than a computer running Windows XP or 2000.

I chose it b/c it was T-Mobile's smallest model and the sales person said that it has great reception. I do admit that the reception for this phone is very good. I've been in basements, elevators, and the middle of nowhere and still managed to find a bar or two. Now that doesn't mean you can find service everywhere. But I was impressed w/ how well it found reception. Unfortunately, that's about all the good I can say about it. On the downside talk-time doesn't last as long as stated in the description. I have all the power-saving features activated according to the manual to extend batter life and yet I'm still squeezing barely 3 hours out of it. Maybe I just have a bum battery but w/ lith. ion being the lastest and greatest it is not performing very well. Texting can also be a pain w/ the predictive T9 function. At least to me it's more frustating trying to text when it keeps guessing what you want to type and isn't even close to the correct word. I don't select the function, but it's still a pain to work around. The screen is very bright and colorful but like most it is virtually impossible to see outside even at an angle and shaded. I've had two glitches so far, the first is that there are times when dialing it just cycles through w/ no ring tone, almost like it's searching for a signal, even when there is one. The only way I've found to fix it is to shut the phone off and turn it back on. The second is a recent one, as of a few days ago, I have not been able to send a text msg. I can receive them fine, but to reply or send one I contiunally get the \"error\" msg. Haven't found a way to solve it. B/c of this, I'm headed back to T-Mobile to look for a new phone.

However, I must agree with many of the other reviewers concerning the ring tone issue and the lagging menus. Out of all the ringers they could not put one basic ringer that could be assigned thus I keep my phone on silent mode which is sometimes an annoyance when I am unable to notice the vibration. Another downside is that the ringers itself are not that loud this could be related to the phones size since it is does not hold a large speaker. The menus are another problem for when you turn on the phone sometimes it takes up to two mintues for the phonebook or the SMS service to initiate. My biggest issue is with the t-mobile service itself. In my house my service does not work at all but once i step outside i get service. t-mobile may have great service plans in terms of minutes, extras, and prices but their service is not as good as its cracked up to be. Also they fail to send me my bill in the mail and continue to send my text messages on my phone reminding me to pay my bill. I would liek to see what i am being billed for infine print because i dont want to pay any extra charges without knowing about them.I have addressed this issue but it continues to go on. Again this phone is good but it has is flaws, so if your looking for style but something simple you should have a look but if your looking for more features other than a color screen you may want to look at the motorola V300 on t-mobile. Also ask around about t-mobile in your area. Friends and families opinions may help with your overall decision of this carrier.

I've read other reviews where people are upset and irritated because this phone doesn't have the features they want, or it's so time consuming to get to the screen they need to get to, etc. I honestly don't have this problem.

I have had it a year now and I continue to hate it, and am finally about to get another one. The ONLY two good things about it are that it is tiny and it holds its charge for a long time.Otherwise:1.  The options for text messaging or adding addresses lock in Caps only--really annoying--cannot do lower case letters so YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE CONSTANLY YELLING OVER AIM OR TEXT MESSAGING.2.  Falls and instantly scratches--the chrome looks terrible the very first time you drop it.3.  the hinges and lights have broken off.  honestly, folks, i have only dropped it a half dozen times, i'm not clumsy and have never thrown it, and it's dinged and dented all over.4.  You can never hear the beep to tell you another caller is trying to get through.5.  The multi-toned ring tones are IMPOSSIBLE to hear if you are in ANY place where there is noise (store, airport, etc) because there is not just one particular tone to get your attention.6.  Individual keys on keypad are too smooth and close together so it is hard to feel your way to press certain ones.7.  People are always telling me they cannot hear me clearly, this is not about reception but the speaker quality of the outgoing speaker piece.8.  This thing PALES in comparison to its predecessor the S105 which I loved.9.  In order to delete messages telling you you have a voice mail message you have to press 6 buttons to get to delete--way too much effort for something done so regularly.There are other things which I cannot remember at the moment, but to sum it up--the visually attractive qualities are ruined in the first week the first time you drop it; the sound quality is poor; you cannot hear your call waiting beep; and your text messages are ALL CAPS--with so many options out there, save yourself the annoyance!!!!!!

But I've already experienced enough to be frustrated.Sound quality is extremely poor compared to my old (and much cheaper!) phone.  This phone adds a buzzing or humming sound.The display on the cover is so small that it can't show an entire number; the caller's number scrolls across, with a long space in between appearances.  So it's hard to tell what the incoming number is.There are no \"normal\" rings, only irritaing music that sounds like it was made on a '70's Cassio Keyboard for a slightly quirky porn film.  The closest to a standard ring is the T-Mobile advertisement jingle.  (Other reviewers seem to think that this is a plus; but why couldn't there be an option for those whose sense of dignity is offended by carrying a machine that blasts the Mexican hat dance?)The menu system is frustratingly byzantine, seemingly designed to be counter-intuitive.The casing is cheap and flimsy.Rather than create a simple, usable interface, the programmers have chosen to justify their existence by souping everything up; perhaps they hoped that no one would notice how repellent the display graphics are as long as the display is filled with twirling images.

I've waited anywhere from 5-20 seconds for the screen to light up, which may sound short, but when you are needing to use the phone, it's a real problem. However, I wanted to give it a fair chance so I kept using it, even though the screen still was not working day after day and it was getting worse. I began noticing that the more you do on the phone, the slower it gets - and I mean sssllloooo[...] But it wasn't until the phone turned itself off that I stopped using it. That's right - I just closed the phone and it turned itself off for no reason, even though I didn't touch anything. It was then that I bought my new Nokia 6010, the best phone. It is way better and more durable and I love it. Don't mess with this Samsung E105 though, believe me, you will regret it. Along with the annoying problems I listed, it also has crappy ringtones.

We had cell phone service from Sprint PCS on a family plan and wanted to keep our existing phone numbers. We checked all the instructions on amazon.com and with T-Mobile on how to purchase individual phones, switch to a family plan, and port our numbers over.  When we got the phones we were successful in porting our numbers over and were very happy with both phones.  Then we got two bills - one for our phone numbers from Sprint PCS, and one from phone numbers we didn't recognize and never heard of.  Apparently the phone numbers assigned to the phones from amazon.com were never cancelled when we ported the Sprint PCS phone numbers over.  Repeated calls to T-Mobile customer service were not helpful - they told us stock answers like disregarding the bill, or that the billing cycle hadn't caught up with the customer service computers, etc. etc. etc. At about the 6th phone call to the company, a customer service rep was able to cancel the account and credit it so we didn't owe them any money for these phantom phone numbers.  We were very excited that this was finally resolved and gave this rep's supervisor a glowing report.  Case closed... or so we thought. We received a final bill for this account that had all sorts of adjustments but still said we owed $41.06.  Two more phone calls to the company came up with nothing but assurances that this would be taken care of.  One rep even scheduled a follow-up call to tell me that it went through, but never actually called.  Today on the answering machine was the standard recording for code 100 (which means I didn't pay the bill).  One more call this evening (October 15, 2004, 3 months after we purchased the phones initially) with me masquerading as SuperBitch got me assurances that this would be rectified in 2 hours. Well, I'm not holding my breath.  We like the phones and have no problem with the account that we're supposed to be paying on. It's the account that never should have existed that's the issue.  If you're in a situation like we were, make absolutely sure that whatever phantom phone numbers that existed are cancelled as soon as you port your phone numbers over. Better yet, use a different phone service.", "Date": "October 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "t-mobile has the worst coverage", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1KQMQCQDJYPUF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I left Verizon which I now painfully regret.
