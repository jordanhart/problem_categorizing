I just accidentally dropped my E51 in water and needed an inexpensive phone I can use before I can get a free upgrade from AT&T.;This phone is slim and build quality is good for the price. As for the low call/speakerphone volume, you can actually increase it (and it gets really loud). I assigned the \"volume\" function to one of the keys (Settings > My Shortcuts) and now can adjust the volume (even while you talk). Reception is above average.What's not so good about this phone is its grainy low resolution low color depth screen. It reminds me of one of the first phones I had back in the early 2000s. And of course, its basic functionality and lack of many features. However, if you need a phone to make/receive calls, this little phone is right for you.UPDATE!!!! There is another thing about this phone that annoys me much - you'll get a lot of dust and other particles between the screen and screen cover. Considering the screen is already far from being perfect, this makes it just the worst phone screen ever.

It is slim and light, fits in any pocket (jacket or jeans), and the battery is enough for a week (if you don't talk all the time, naturally).However, I use it mainly to take calls and I don't use any functions apart from calling and txt messages. It allegedly has a radio and camera but I have never tried to use either and I don't think I ever will. You can browse the internet with it but although the screen is fairly big and bright I would not recommend it too seriously unless you need a weather forecast or currency exchange rates. It does have games as well but if you're choosing your mobile to play games, how 'bout getting a life?Very decent materials, after three months of using not a trace of wear and tear. Nokia software is a league of its own but then if you had one Nokia you move on to the next and you don't look at others. And you don't need anyone trying to convince you how good it is. I have always asked for the cheapest Nokia there was and I have never complained.This is a phone for adults - you won't impress anyone with it. If you think your sex appeal needs some accessorizing, you may not find this one your perfect choice. In other words - if you need a phone, it is the perfect choice.

I sometimes forget that it's even in my pocket.  The design is nice and stylish too.What I don't like about the phone: The phone is slow when navigating thru menus.  It also creates a long (1 second) tone whenever the first button is pushed when making a call or when already in a call.  I think this is due to the same reason that makes it slow to navigate.  It's like it gets hung up on a command for a short time.  It could use a faster processor or whatever it is that cell phones use.  It's more annoying than anything, and cuts out the audio when the 1 second tone is sounding.  i actually sent back the first one beacuse of this, but the replacement still did the same thing.The phone is simple and just does the basics.  The screen is color, but not as high resolution as some fancier phones.  But that's all I need right now so it works ok for me.

Buying an unlocked phone is a lot cheaper than upgrading from my service provider.The Nokia 2630 is really thin making it great for a pocket phone.  The best part is that it has no side buttons to accidentally push that hang-up on the caller when you reach in your pocket to get the phone.

This phone is not usable.I had several other Nokia phones. Most of them are reliable. That was the main reason I decided to get another one. However this 2630 surprised me. I can't hear anyone talking over phone. Volume is extremely low if speaker off. I had to turn speaker on and put the phone next to my ear to have any conversation. This is already after I turned volume to maximum. Bluetooth volume is OK but it drops call from time to time, about every 5-10 minutes in my case.Other than volume, the phone looks pretty sleek and camera resolution is not great but ok.

There is really nothing good to say about any aspect of this phone beyond its compact size.I bought this phone about a year ago after a lot of research. I pretty much looked at Nokia exclusively, because of great prior experiences with Nokia products. I did not want a smart phone for a number of reasons (battery life and large size being the two largest reasons). Unfortunately, this ended up being the worst phone I've ever owned, and it started on day one. First thing I noticed about this phone right out of the box was the half-second to second delay when pressing a button from the home screen. This got annoying fast, as it would pause with an extended beep on the first number when dialing or navigating an audio menu. That was the first sign that the processor and hardware could not handle the demands of the software or memory. It takes a good 30 seconds to a minute between when you hit send on a txt message to when the \"sending\" icon would disappear. It takes about 30 seconds to open the apps/games menus, and another 15 secs to 1\u00bd mins to open the app/game (depending on its size). It has a very hard time multi-tasking, even with simple tasks. If you open a new txt while another one is sending, the phone will freeze briefly a few times until the outgoing message has been sent (which will take twice as long as normal). The phone does not delete old txt messages, so as they pile up in your inbox/sent folders, the phone takes longer and longer to open those folders. At one point, I had 2500 txt messages in the folder and it took the phone about a minute to open or update the folder (which you have to do a lot to view messages). Another annoying aspect of having too many txt message in memory was when you turn on the phone. It will not let you use messaging (view or create new) until it was ready. It would say that text messaging is not ready yet. It would take anywhere between 30 mins to an hr and a half for the txt messages to become available each time you turn on the phone.So everything I've mentioned so far relates to the inadequate hardware and the clunky software. But theres SO much more wrong with this phone than just that. The call quality is terrible. Unless your in a completely quiet environment, it is difficult to understand each other. I get complaints all the time by people I'm on the phone with that the quality sucks. The speaker phone is even worse. The speaker is poor quality, and nobody can understand anything I say when on speaker phone. In fact, unless I'm speaking within 2 inches of the mic, nobody can even hear me. Calls get dropped every now and then, but that is likely due in large part to the provider (AT&T;) than the phone. Whats even more frustrating than a dropped call is a call that I never received. I've found that quite often, somebody will call my phone, it will ring on their side until my voicemail picks up, but I will never see the call. It just simply wont ring on my end. I will suddenly get a new voice message with no missed calls while stationary with full coverage. I don't know how often this happens, since I only know about it if the caller leaves a message or tells me that they called, but I've found that it happens at least a few times a week.But wait, it gets worse. So I've had it now for about a year, and over that time, I accumulated enough contacts, photos, games, and txt messages to exceed the 11MB of storage space that this phone has. The phone gave me no warning of the approaching limit, and whats worse, it had no precaution for preventing me from exceeding it. My presumption is that when I exceeded the memory (which I did), the phone began deleting system files that were required for the phone's OS. All of a sudden, my phone started acting on its own. It would activate the camera inside of my pocket and start taking pictures and videos (switching between modes at will) and saving them to my phone. While doing this, no buttons I pressed would do anything. When a call came in, I could see it pop up on the screen and who it was, but I couldn't answer it. The phone would work normally when I turn it on until the txt messages were finally ready (which I mentioned earlier). I don't know if this is a direct cause of exceeding the phone's memory, but this should not happen either way.As bad as all of this sounds, there are many many more issues that I have with this phone. These are just the major ones. I finally decided to ditch this phone (since I finally had no choice when it stopped working as a phone) and gave into buying a smartphone. I bought the HTC Aria. I chose it in part because I like small phones, and the Aria is the smallest smartphone that I've seen (very close to the size of the Nokia 2630). I've had it for a week now and it makes me wonder why I kept my Nokia so long. Its like day and night. I should have made the upgrade long ago.
