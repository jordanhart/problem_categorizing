When I received the phone it was in the original packaging from the company but when I turn on the phone there were text messages , stored contact numbers and a alarm that was already set from the previous owner. That was it for me I return the phone and got a refund because I don't like being lied to the phone was listed as \"New\" not \"Used\" if I wanted to buy a used phone I would have. I would never buy anything from this company again because I can't trust them this was misleading and cost me an extra $4.50 to return the phone.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Solstice", "Author": "Eilrahc Alleba \"Charlie\"", "ReviewID": "RYW16KJ98PRCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it for my wife and was so glad to have it. The service is good (awesome seller), as it arrived on time or was earlier than expected, and was packed really well. The phone itself functions perfectly for texting and talking, considering it's low price...Since it's a quad-band, I can use it outside the USA...I will buy from this seller again...I had it as advertised...Unbelievable find!

It\u2019s better, slicker, than a run-of-the-mill barebones cell phone.  While it can access the Internet, the browsing is quite cumbersome.  Also, unlike later \u201csmartphones,\u201d your access to the Internet is strictly through your cellular service (in my case Consumer Cellular); there is no Wi-Fi capability for charge-free access at home or any \u201chot spots\u201d on the road.But I did not purchase the phone with the expectation of surfing the web.  I do that with my laptop computer, which I carry with me when I travel.  Besides, even if I did need to look for lodging, locate restaurants, gas stations, etc. while between Point A and Point B\u2026well, my wife\u2019s true smart phone is perfectly capable of that (hers is a Samsung Galaxy Exhilarate, with Wi-Fi and all the bells\u2019n whistles).Essentially, I only need a cell phone as we are getting rid of our land line.  My wife has a smart phone, I have a dumb phone.  Primarily, I use my phone for, well \u201cphone calls (and the fewer the better).  While the A887 sports a virtual \u201cQwerty\u201d keypad (far less cumbersome than texting with a plain old cell phone numerical pad), I\u2019m not really into texting that much\u2026but I could.The 2 megapixel onboard camera (front-facing only) is decent.  My wife\u2019s 5 megapixel camera is somewhat better\u2014more than adequate for posting on Facebook.  But I\u2019m too much of a cynical old perfectionist to rely on a phone camera in lieu of a separate digital camera.  [Ironically, I was into the hi-tech age early.  I owned my first PC in 1988, at a time when friends and relatives scoffed at the notion of online communication.]I have yet to explore all of the bells and whistles\u2014such as setting ringtones, etc.\u2014but the speakerphone is crisp and clear, which is important to me; I simply hate holding a device up to my ear for more than about 120 seconds.Given that I do not live my life staring at a small screen while in the company of friends (believe it or not, I have a couple), or riding the rails, or should be on an actual vacation, this unobtrusive little gadget is the right choice for me (small brain, small phone).  It is slim and smaller all the way around than your standard iPhones and \u201cDroids\u201d that you see around today.  Takes up little space and is comfortable enough to carry around in my pants pocket (when I don\u2019t forget to carry it, that is).Bottom line:  For around 50 bucks, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better standard cell phone equivalent.  You can text, add photo attachments to your text and access the Internet, if you need to.  My wife and I have two separate lines and use our phones, sharing our minutes and data via Consumer Cellular (AT&T; backbone), for a paltry sum of 40 bucks per month.We are happy.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not and up to date for.....", "Author": "Angela Saunders", "ReviewID": "RR8DQFN1QMALJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was very out dated  was not a phone for this time.
