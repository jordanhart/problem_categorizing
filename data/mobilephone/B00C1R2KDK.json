Leroy", "ReviewID": "RFUFECHAH5SZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently scrapped my smartphone because of the outrageous monthly bill. I've got a tablet and a laptop, so what's the point? I purchased the T-Mobile Aspect and signed up for prepaid service, which is an excellent value. This phone is well-constructed and the keyboard has a great feel for sending text messages. I almost forgot what a REAL keyboard feels like after using a touchscreen for so long! The screen is large enough and looks nice, and the call quality is excellent. For the price, you can't do much better.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Scott Johnson", "ReviewID": "R8EI8RMNU7C22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am going in to my freshmen year in high school and so to go from a flip phoe to what looks like a blackberry phone is vary nice to fit in better. It comes with every thing in it like the chargers and battery and a SIM card that you can take to your local T-mobile store a  new plan. (you can also just use your last SIM card from you last phone and this phone just starts you on you existing plan) I also like that you really don't  know there's a head phone port. I also like that you can deactivate the the auto lock on the keyboard if you'd like, but all you have to to do to avoid pocket or butt dialing somebody is hit the lock button on the phone keyboard.  What I don't like is it the Bluetooth doesn't work with iPad and the it has a camera button you have to hold it for a long time to get into the camera application, but once your in the application that button works great.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good features, but lacking in performance.", "Author": "C.H.", "ReviewID": "R2CUZR2844P8VP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked up this phone a few weeks ago to replace my T-Mobile Sparq that suddenly stopped working. It's a slightly more feature-rich phone than the Sparq; however, I find myself liking it a lot less than the Sparq.The Good:-Nice, sturdy keyboard for texting.-Clear call quality & good signal.-Adequate battery life (I get 2-3 days of frequent texting/web use before the battery is drained).-The ability to check emails and Facebook, though the browser is slow.-The ability to toggle between screens (so you can check your messages or make a call without having to close out of your browser, for instance).The Bad:-The phone functions quite slowly overall. Waiting for the phone to start up, unlocking the keyboard, navigating the menu, waiting for a text to send--all slooowww.-The web browser is quite slow. My Sparq had Opera Mini already installed on it, and that got me to my emails and Facebook pretty quickly. I can't even download Opera Mini for this phone; it's not available for it.-Message alert tones don't work properly. When I receive a text, only the tail-end of the tone will sound off sometimes, and sometimes not even at all.If you don't do a lot of back & forth texting, you may not mind that the texts send slowly. Otherwise, trying to keep up a conversation via text can be tedious with this phone. I'm kind of torn. The phone has all the functions I could want and need, but the phone (at least mine) performs worse than a cheaper phone like the Sparq.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "HATE IT", "Author": "Newton Karl", "ReviewID": "R17I7BK8SBOA4O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I hated other phones but this one takes the cake. It is extremely UNUSER friendly. I a not sure where to begin. The nealry silent 'ping' of the timer that you cannot hear, the impossible task of trying to add a second number to a contact, the diffculty of pulling up the Speed Dial Screen. I am actively looking to replace it ASAP", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just threw $50 down the drain", "Author": "Felina Mincey \"fezina\"", "ReviewID": "RNWK00MX3QF9H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My MyTouch Slide ate it while I was out of town so I stopped into Best Buy and bought this phone to use on the long drive home. The back cover was very difficult to get off (broke off 2 nails trying to put the battery in) it will not do ANYTHING until it's fully charged and now I have had it for less than 24 hours and it is already freezing up, will let me see that I am getting an incoming call but won't let me answer it, will not unlock the keyboard no matter how much I \"Press 'unlock' then *insert lock icon here*\" It is absolutely worthless, I literally paid $50 to have a phone for a 3 hour drive during which I had one brief phone conversation and posted to Facebook once. I would return it to the store as suggested by the t-mobile rep I called this morning except the nearest Best Buy is a 3 hour/100 mile drive away from me. Awful, awful little phone!", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "BRING BACK THE NOKIA X2!!!!!!!", "Author": "nick", "ReviewID": "R24I3N77AKP48Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I broke my Nokia x2 go phone which looks like this aspect but sadly the aspect does not compare in anyway and its the same price. What a joke T mobile! Why would you trade a good company like Nokia for a stupid no name brand cheap crap Chinese made company like ZTE. This phone and its manufacturer are SO BAD that T mobile didn't even put the manufacturer on the phone itself. I had my Nokia x2 for several years and it was perfect. The only reason it broke was because I was angry. This phone doesn't even have a full battery out of the box. I plugged in the phone right when I opened it and let it charge for about 5 hours and I picked it up and the battery was the same as when I took it out of the box! You cannot change the text message settings to be inbox form. It is a slow piece of junk. With my Nokia x2 I had full bars in my house and everywhere else. This phone gets 3 bars at best. I've never even seen it with full bars.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.99", "Features": "2 MP Camera\nQWERTY Keyboard\nText and Picture Messaging Capable\nBluetooth\u00ae connectivity: Wirelessly connect your device to optional compatible hands-free accessories\n3G Capable: Quickly connect to the Internet via 3G anywhere within the T-Mobile USA 3G network.", "Name": "T-Mobile Aspect Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PEEjXNLqL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C1R2KDK"}}
