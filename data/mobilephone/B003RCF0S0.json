Bruce", "ReviewID": "RYWO2DDUNGCKV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After receiving the unlocked Blackberry I discovered that the Blackberry Messenger Services are not included. And AT&T; was no help in getting then installed, they say I would have to buy one of their locked Blackberry to get the services included. The seller, J&R;, did give me the phone number of RIM but they are on vacation for some days. J&R; sugguested that I download the services, but didn't give me specify direccions on specifically how to do this. I am a bit afraid of downloads as that is what put my previous Blackberry out of comission. I bought the Blackberry specially because of the Blackberry Messenger Services, how I don't have any and am having to use SMS.I bought an unlock one this time because I would like to use another service provider's SIM with the phone too. Of course with all the Blackberry Services.With the services it is a great cellular and I was very happy with my previous one until it crashed while updating it.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "TODO DENTRO DE LO NORMAL", "Author": "JUAN R.
