I use it as a PDA, I like the fact that you can download Word documents to it, since I have kids it is nice because I can carry school documents like supply lists and other important things that we use. The contacts are really good, you can put all their information, the calendar is awesome just everything in it is very useful. I was thinking about buying an MP3 but this phone is good as an MP3 too, the battery life is really good and I did not have to buy a separte MP3. The only thing that was not pleasing is that the Wi-fi connection for this phone is really weak, so if you are planning on using it with wi-fi you will get frustrated. I found that out after I got the phone. The good thing is that if you want to download something through App world you can use the usb cable and open the memory card in Windows explorer and download through there, it is actually easier than using the Blackberry programs at least for me, so is not that bad. I don't really use the CD that came with the phone which is the Blackberry Desktop when I actually got it for the first time it would not work at all, after doing research online, I downloaded a Desktop version from blackberry site, then the CD started working but I still don't use it. Besides that I think that everything else is really good. The camera is also pretty good. I bought the white model because the black one was pricier, but I am pleased with it, I actually like it more than the black model now. I use this phone with a prepaid carrier T-mobile and since it was open/unlocked phone there was no problem, and I have had no problems at all. Since this is my first smart phone I have to say that I am very pleased with it. I am also pleased with Amazon's service, I did read some bad reviews that they had given Amazon and the phone, but I have to say I am glad I did not pay attention to those. I actually went to[...] and read their reviews before I made my decision since they give the pros and cons of the phones. I have to say that I am glad I got this phone. Since I have also dealt with Amazon before I knew that if for any reason I would have to return something they are really good at working with customers, they have even helped me to deal with products that were ordered through one of the other market places, so I have to say that so far Amazon has made a good impression on us.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Received and item failed within a few hours", "Author": "Walleye Assassin \"WalleyeAssassin74\"", "ReviewID": "R2RZFGJMAOQOUJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item from FGS, with fulfillment by Amazon.

Disappointment.Amazon's return policy means I got my $200 back, but the delay was annoying. If I had to guess, I think that while the phone was an unlocked phone, it was not new.
