When I opened the sim tray it stroke me that there was an ATT nano Sim there. Back home, I  tried to activate the phone with my carrier from Argentina (Movistar) and the phone could not activate saying that my carrier's nanosim was imcompatible. So it seems like the iphone is actually locked (probably to ATT). We do not have oficial Apple Stores in my country so I'm stuck. Fortunatelly, I am travelling again to the USA in 15 days soI will book an appointment at San Francisco's Apple store to see if the can confirm that the iphone is locked and hoperfully  they can swap it for an unlocked unit.I have paid more than 700 dolars and I can't use this phone.

Hedges", "ReviewID": "RP3O8C1VUVE4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have previously owned an iPhone 4 and two Android smartphones, and this is my favorite cellphone yet. I generally like the interface updates, though there are annoyances to be found. First the good news. The iPhone 5 is thin and light, which I love. It's fast and Internet connectivity is generally quite good. The camera yields generally good photos, but mine has annoying shutter lag issues much like my iPhone 4 did; more distressing is that on mine the image that is presented onscreen is not the image actually captured. Depending on whether it is in a landscape or portrait format it cuts the top or the left side of the frame off. Imagine my extreme annoyance when I discovered that the majority of photos I took from the front row of a recent Joe Bonamassa concert lopped Joe's head off, but gave spectacular pictures of his shoes. (Joe's a snappy dresser, and they were very nice shoes.) This is such an annoyance I have thought of returning it for that alone, but I normally use a camera to take photographs, so I haven't yet. This doesn't seem to be a problem in video mode.Some improvements are not. The calendar is virtually impossible to sync with my AOL calendar (multiple trips to the Genius bar and reassurances that it's entirely compatible and they would fix it have ended up with nothing.) I'd just use a different calendar app, but I have a friend who is dedicated to the AOL calendar system, so this is a better solution for me for now (providing it ever works, anyway.) I also dislike the time zone functionality when entering items in my iPhone calendar. The phone clarity and signal strength aren't that great, honestly, and may be worse than my iPhone 4. I live with them, but am not a fan. Battery life is also not that good; I would much prefer a swappable battery, but Apple seems to think it knows better.Despite my relatively minor reservations (battery life and camera problems are my biggest concerns) I still like this phone. It's light, it's fast, it's powerful, and it's still a good choice. If I had to do it over again I'd get the 64GB version to have more onboard video memory, but careful allocation of TV programs lets 32GB work adequately for me. Having used this phone for a few months now I feel confident using it and recommend it to people who like the Apple IOS.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Damaged battery, wall charger and lightning cable", "Author": "Raul Arana", "ReviewID": "R29GFGAK6JRA8D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The battery drains in less than 4 hoursNeither the wall charger or the accompanying lightning cable worked, I had buy new ones", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Crap", "Author": "aronson mitchell", "ReviewID": "R1177M6HZ37VJK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's unlocked but it won't activate correctly on Verizon.

This phone has changed my life in many ways and has made everyday tasks much easier. Apple first started with making computers but since then they have reached out and made other products that have pushed technology and has made a huge difference in our society. They started making iPhones in 2007 and with every release since then they have made huge improvements. The iPhone 5 weighs only 3.95 ounces and is only .3 inches thick. This is one of the lightest phones out there. It looks so slim and attractive, and fits in your hands perfectly. This brings up the one and only problem that I think the iPhone can approve on, its durability. I find it somewhat fragile but there's a simple solution, a case. There is a huge variety of cases and accessories that can make your iPhone 100% safe. The iPhone has a 4-inch widescreen multi-touch retina display with 326 pixels per inch. This phone makes every picture, video and anything else you put on the display absolutely beautiful. It has an 8-megapixel camera that can shoot 1080p HD video. With all of its features it still can hold a charge, giving you up to 8 hours of talk time or up to 40 hours of playing your favorite music. The iPhone 5 comes in black or white and with three different sizes of memory, 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. Depending on how much data you want to store on your iPhone there is always a right size for your needs.  I myself have a 32GB iPhone 5 and I have found that to be plenty of space for all of my music, pictures and apps.There are so many features and apps that you can get for your iPhone 5 making this phone a hugely useful tool for your everyday life. The iPhone 5 is not just a phone but many other things. With this product you are constantly carrying a camera, shooting beautiful high quality pictures and videos. The iPhone 5 also has a new HDR and panoramic options, making it easy to capture the most wonderful and priceless events in your life. As a student I have used the camera to take pictures of notes or homework assignments, making it easy to remember what I need to do and study. Other useful apps are the compass, flashlight, and calculator. You can also take notes on your iPhone, making it great for students, businessmen and even mothers for when they have to write down a grocery list. You can even put events in the calendar such as birthdays, appointments or assignments that are due and it will remind you when they are. There are many games available for the iPhone even educational ones for young children all the way up to college students. The iPhone 5 has very fast LTE internet letting you surf the web and send emails in little to no time. Another amazing feature is the navigation system that is built in. No matter where you want to go the iPhone will give you turn by turn direction on how to get to your location. With all these features it is easy to forget that the iPhone 5 is also a phone. Letting you call, text and even FaceTime, bring you face to face with people miles away. This phone can really connect you to people who are close to you and even the ones you have just met. With apps like Facebook and Instagram you can connect and share your life with the people you love. This phone has something to offer for everyone whether you're a child, student, businessman or mother, the iPhone 5 has something to make your life easier.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a perfect tool and useful for my work", "Author": "Enrique Zadoff", "ReviewID": "R1ITXH6ZSOJD7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "although the battery doesn't last as I supposed it will last, the IP 5 is a nice pone and more.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery is killing me", "Author": "Dahc202", "ReviewID": "R2QMB4K4PJ912N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The battery power drastically reduced in less than 2 days of purchase from 8-10 hours down to 4-5 hours and I don't like that", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple Needs to Step-up !!!", "Author": "hrishi \"hrishi\"", "ReviewID": "R2JMI5NYWG7XCE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Review from India.My phone usage is high, further I read lots of news and surf the Internet. Iphone 5 was a dream having seen my cousins and friends use apple products.I was aware of the closed apple environment, no memory upgrade, no battery change and probably one of the most expensive phones in the market (apple premium).I faced the following issues that made me change my  mind.After a full charge the phone was 25%  at 2  pm and completely drained by 4 pm. This is after manually shutting off all apps,  navigation and wifi.I had to carry three chargers for my house, car, office and a fourth emergency battery pack in my bag just to make it last the day.I found it to  heat up when used for internet surfing even for 5 mts.When I went to the local Apple store they told me that the heating issue can be rectified if I use a case and since the battery depending on usage.When I did some reading I realised iphone has a 1,440mAh battery, while the. Galaxy S III has a beefier 2,100mAh. There is a battery drain issue that apple is planning to fix.This issues was not faced by my friends who have use S G 3 or SG4 or HTC One or other phones. My old BB bold give me full days worth of talk and surf with still lot off juice in the night.After spending 900 usd (@ Rs 56) I don't think I could be expected carry a charger or buy a case.

If like me you have owned and continue to own previous versions of iPhones, iPods and iPads, and have several chargers, Docks, car connectors and car chargers etc then this new design is really frustrating.The real reason that Apple changed the design is surely so that everybody has to go out and buy outrageously overpriced adaptors or new leads. I have read that Apple pays less than $0.6 for these leads, yet charges it's customers \u00a325.Apple have also put a microchip in their leads that the iPhone is set to recognise, without which they are rejected by the iPhone in order to prevent third party manufacturers from producing leads that work properly, hence all the terrible reviews for these 3rd party products.It's just another of Apple's underhand money making exercises at the customers considerable inconvenience and expense.It's taller than the iPhone 4s. Some may like this, but I don't. The 4s sits comfortably in your hand and my thumb can reach the top of the screen on the 4s without having to change the position in my hand. I have bigger than average hands too.It is faster than the 4s, only a little, but it is faster. But this is the only improvement in my eyes.Battery life is poor, another sacrifice made to the god of (pointless) thinness. It feels cheaper and flimsier than the 4s too.Maps are a mess. Google maps was so much better on the 4 and 4s.Instead of this ridiculous connector fiasco, why couldn't we have kept the old and perfectly good connector and had wireless charging too? The technology is there, and would be a great improvement over the current system.A more robust design would be nice so that they didn't have to live in cases, and a dust and moisture resistant design would be very welcome.iCloud is fantastic, and so I can't imagine changing phones to another manufacturer until someone else comes out with something at least as good as iCloud.But when they do, I'll be more than happy to switch allegiance, despite twenty years as a loyal Apple customer.Apple can only push their customers so far, and I'm becoming more and more fed up with the way Apple is treating it's customers with regard to their infuriating thinness campaign with their phones, iPads, MacBook Pros and iMacs, at the expense of functionality and in a blatant attempt to corner the market and limit customers buying choices in terms of leads, adaptors, connections, music purchasing, app purchasing etc, as are many many other people.Apple is a great brand and has produced many fantastic products, but the iPhone 5 is not the leap ahead from the 4s that customers had hoped for, and this coupled with frustration and expense incurred by the connector design and the thinness over battery life and durability make it for me a 2 star product.If you own the 4s I'd suggest hanging on to it and waiting until Autumn for the next hopefully much improved iPhone, or Samsung, or whoever the Apple slayer will be.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery life is too short", "Author": "Musu", "ReviewID": "R19T0I8ZQB81E8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Make sure to have extra charger if you plan to be away from home for a day...
