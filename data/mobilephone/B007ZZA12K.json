If you want to transfer photos, videos, notes and contacts to a PC you need to install Zune, not directly as do the other phones.I hope will be helpfulRegards David M.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great budget device", "Author": "Bailey Stein", "ReviewID": "RE13NFLVP8FS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The lumia 610 is great phone for first time smartphone owners or people who just want a small little backup device. It isn't very high-end, but it is some of Nokia's best works.The device itself is beautiful. It feels great in the hand and defiantly attracts attention. The camera on the device isn't the best, but it does well on nice, sunny, beach days.The Windows Phone OS is lacking apps and some features, however the device is great to have as a backup, noting that you can use it on any GSM network, as long as it's unlocked of course. I think of the device as affordable and you won't be seeing matched quality to the iPhone.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst mobile phone I've had.", "Author": "Jerzy_Modrak, Stockhom & Warsaw", "ReviewID": "R39J3RH0NLKKN1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I spent the whole day trying to figure out how to transfer the phone book from my old cellular, not a Nokia.
