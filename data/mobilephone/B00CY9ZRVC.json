He's a construction worker and tends to be a little more than ruff on electronics. There are a lot of weird little things about this phone. Screen sensitivity is spotty. It's either overly sensitive or not responsive and for whatever reason I can't find anything on how to calibrate the screen. There's also the issue of finding the ringer settings as I've yet to find them as well. Other than that this phone has been a blessing as it has survived being dropped more than once. It did not come with a manual which has made learning how to use this phone difficult as it does not have the standard settings of an android phone. It also came preloaded with a great deal of Chinese programs that I could not delete or understand what they were for as they were in Chinese. It did come with a Micro SD memory card which was nice and the forward and back cameras take great pictures. It was also nice that it came preloaded with a flashlight app on it. The only other downside to this phone was the loop where the belt clip attaches broke within the first week. This may not be a fault of the phone but a fault of my father's forgetfulness.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Discovery V5 Android 4.0 waterproof splash mobile phoneGSM Shockproof Phone..", "Author": "lasha amkoladze", "ReviewID": "R1RLGT5WTWCESO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Discovery V5 Android 4.0 waterproof splash mobile phone GSM Shockproof Phone.. it is good phone  and I gave 4 stars", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.00", "Features": "GSM", "Name": "Discovery V5 Android 4.0 waterproof splash mobile phoneGSM Shockproof Phone with 3.5 Inch Capacitive Screen (black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413EYJoCZ%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CY9ZRVC"}}
