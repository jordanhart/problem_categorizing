Buyer Beware of TOP UP Minutes With Virgin Mobile! (SPRINT!)", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Smart Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R2IBXG4K2IVX4Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I stand corrected.... I called Virgin Mobile a second time because I was so frustrated about not getting any of my $100. But when I called, instead of saying I was cancelling, I told them I accidentally TOPPED UP too much and meant only to ADD $20. The woman I spoke to this time, sent it \"upstairs\" and told me to call back in 72 hours for my answer. I didn't get a chance to call back -- and it's been almost 5 days, but I just saw that $80 was returned to my card.  So bottomline is yes, be careful about how much you Top Up at any one time.... And 2, they DID come around, so that was much appreciated..... My entire experience with them prior to this has been great, and I loved being able to have a cheap cell phone when I didn't want to commit to $60 or more per month. So I upgraded my rating of them from one star to three stars on this. For me alone, I might have gone to four stars, but based on many other reviews where customers did not get money back I will leave it at 3 stars.**************** MY ORIGINAL REVIEW ********************BEWARE! FIRST, Virgin Mobile USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint Corporation.  Branson no longer owns it... So this is a review of Sprint Corporation as well as Virgin Mobile.I was with Virgin Mobile for 6 years using Top Up Minutes....I recently paid $100 thinking I would continue to use it. Then I got a free smart phone from my company and wanted to get a REFUND of $93 from the Top Up.... They absolutely refused to do it saying some Garbage about how I paid for a Year of Service.  (Although if I used minutes, I would not have had a year of service....)So even after 6 years, they do not appreciate their customers. It is basically like a Contract if you do pay for the Minutes in advance. I had no idea that my circumstances would change... but they did.  They do not care. If you look at reviews on the internet, you'll find that they kept money from many other people who wanted a refund as well for various reasons.  I read the agreement years ago and do not remember seeing that they will keep your money.... Although it is now listed on their website that you will lose your money if you switch.The service was fine when I used it although I hardly used it.  My suggestion is that if you go with them, pay $10 or $20 at a time ONLY. OR go with a service who openly tells you that you are agreeing to a contract and you will lose money... Bottomline, if you use Top Up Minutes, pay a little at a time as you never know when your situation might change.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Strange", "Author": "Mary Elizabeth Szigeti", "ReviewID": "R1XBG4DE8ZWTXA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For this, they could have emailed this over. you get just a print out with the numbers on it.
