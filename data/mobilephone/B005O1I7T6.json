Call me \"low-tech\", but I'm just not a big fan of smart phones or touch screen interfaces. I like buttons on my phone that I can touch and feel. This is the first phone I've owned with a full keyboard, and that is a nice feature. One of the things that attracted me to the Samsung T404g was the extended life of a full battery charge. Granted, I'm a very light mobile phone user - usually under 30 minutes a day for voice - but a full charge on this phone will last me almost a full week! The phone feels tight and solid, and the sound quality is smooth and comfortable to the ear.Tracfone is a really great deal for me. The \"Triple Minutes\" plan that comes with this phone makes for a real value. Sure, the per-minute cost is always a bit high for \"pay as you go\". As a light user, though, I save a bundle over most of my friends who are on contract with major carriers. It's not for everyone, but pay as you go is a great fit for me, and I have been very happy with Tracfone service.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "A life saver!!", "Author": "Mr.Reese", "ReviewID": "R1M6UBS2TTSJ5E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The best thing about the phone is tripling of any minute card you add to it. It has a great battery life. Takes decent pictures and the video is decent as well. The qwerty keyboard saves time when texting. The music player is ok, the only problem with that is that you have to stay on the music player app to continue playing your music. To personalize the phone or get on facebook, you have sacrifice a good amount of minutes depending on how long you stay on the browser or facebook app. The minute consumption is ruthless! You may accidently access the browser for a few seconds and quickly exit but the phone still deducts a minute so dont accidently leave the facebook app running and fall asleep because you'll wake up with barely enough minutes to have a phone coversation with or no minutes at all, so be careful.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone, low cost, easy to use", "Author": "larsforresto", "ReviewID": "R3C7O0QCQ9A2KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone before christmas. triple time was THE selling point. my old pay as you go ran 3 times the cost. i purchased a 1 yr. service card with 400 minutes and received 200 holiday bonus mins for $99 [that equaled 1400 min.], plus supersized 400 minutes at checkout for $30 [1200 min] for 2600 minutes TOTAL. that comes in at 5.3 cents per minute. standard texts run .3 min [about 2 cents ea.]; longer texts run .6 min [about 4 cents ea.] and i avoid browsing at all costs. i'm sure there's a way to have your FB stuff cached so one doesn't have to wait for long loads. the person who complained about not being able to see the keyboard must have gotten a bad phone as mine lights up bright enough to see anywhere. the person who hits the \"back\" button and goes into BROWSING should understand you can also \"back\" with the C button or skip to the main screen with the end button. trying to figure out if i can disable the \"browse\" button somehow, as i usually forget to lock the keys before i put it in my pocket - so i'm pocket punching keys all the time - easy to start up the browser w/o knowing it. this phone has a solid feel, a reasonable set of features that are easy to figure out, the keyboard is great. so far, having fun with it and extremely pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "shopcellas are the best to purchase these phones!", "Author": "Spain!", "ReviewID": "R2KXM30GYVD9ZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I order this phone through Shopcellas and I was so impressed.  I emailed them because I wanted to know the exact day of delivery & within hours I got a response.  Just as they said I got the phone on the 3rd day since I paid $4.95 for a 3 day delivery.I ordered it on Wed afternoon and got it Saturday morning.  Once I got the phone I realized it was a bit loose and I emailed them again to ask about exchange procedures.  They said they would exchange within 30 day of delivery not after.  Without me responding back I got a new phone in my mail 2 to 3 days after their response.  I was able to return the other phone at no charge to me.I am impressed with this company because since I shop through Amazon so much - I have found other companies to be aloof when I emailed for any reason.  This specific company Shopcellas is prompt, secure, efficient and take the time to personally respond to all questions.  This I find very impressive.  I wished they sold more things... The phone is also great - so far so good.  The battery last for a long time WOW!  My only complaint is that is a bit heavy... this phone..  but other than that I love it.. love it.  It takes pretty good photos too..Oh yeah my other complaint is that I have lost minutes because sometimes I use the \"back\" button and if I press once too many times it goes into \"browser\".. there goes a minute each time.  I must ad that I only use this phone for calling, texting and photo taking.  For these uses I find this phone to be great.  I just wished the \"back\" button would be for just that....

Ordered through Amazon from Shopcelldeals and got them for 45 bucks a piece shipped. They set up easily, quickly and cleanly; no hassles... They work great; good coverage and reception, nice interface and great features for the price and for a prepaid tracfone. We love them.Only 1 niggle. They are supposed to take 16gb MicroSDHC cards, so I got one such Sandisk card for each of them. After installing the cards, both before and after using the phone based function to format them, they both show the same odd results on the card properties display on both Phones.That is the phones memory card properties on both phones shows around 15.5 gig capacity, but ~12.5 gig Used and ~3gig free before storing anything on the Cards.Looking at the cards on my card reader on the PC, they show perfect. Correct folders set up and ~16 gig total, 49k or so used and around 15.9gig or so available.Now that leads to the 1 con... The forum that Tracfone has as a lead-in to Support is absolutely the most ridiculous farce and comprises what I deem to be the ultimate disrespect to customers that I could ever imagine.

Because she had 1000+ minutes left on that phone, I wanted to make sure that the minutes could transfer to a new phone - whatever Tracfone serviced phone I choose that was compatible with my area.  When I went to the Tracfone site and learned that I could port her old Tracfone number to a new phone AND transfer her minutes, I started shopping.When comparing the two TRIPLE minute phones: this one and LG 800G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone) I liked the LG for the touchscreen and LG reliability (I have an LG Optimus V with Virgin Mobile no-contract service), but my daughter preferred having a keyboard.  The deciding factor for us was battery life.  The Samsung T404G has about 30% longer battery life than the LG 800G.Tracfone had the Samsung T404G Prepaid for fifty with a free accessory package, but they were unclear about what was in that free pack.  I came to Amazon to compare prices and found the same phone without the free accessories, plus Red Hard Case Cover for Samsung Gravity 2 T469 T404G and Samsung Data Cable, was less than fifty shipped, so I bought them.Activation of the phone meant calling Tracfone's 1800 number and waiting 15 minutes on hold after punching through two keypad menus.  You have to call on a line other than your old phone, as you'll have to do a bit of keypad work in the phone's settings to transfer your minutes and deactivate the SIM card on your old phone prior to activating your new phone.Once on with a Tracfone representative the process to port the old number to the new phone with the existing minutes and get the new phone activated took about 40 minutes - not including the time on hold with Tracfone. I made a test call from my home phone to the new phone and it went through as expected. My daughter began texting from her new Samsung T404G and immediately found the things she likes and dislikes about the phone.Likes:1. The look of it.2. The display is bright and when horizontally oriented, the screen is easily viewable for texting.3. The keyboard and the feel of the buttons.4. The size: bigger than her previous phone in thickness, length and width - comfortable.5. Slot for a microSD card up to 16GB - lots of music storage for MP3's6. Bluetooth hooked up to wireless stereo headset: LG Tone (HBS-700) Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange easily and sounded good.7. Slide-out keyboard is easy to use with good directions in included booklet.8. Came charged with 20 minutes received after activation.9. Menus are easy to navigate10.The alarm clock and calendar are great!11.Minutes left on service are clearly displayed, with days left of service also displayed.12.(2) days after activation you can make international calls to over 100 countries for the same price per minute as local calls! (Directions in included Service Guide.)13.Texting is easy and Internet connections are swift to connect and work well.Dislikes:1. Camera is only 2MP and just 'fair' by comparison to most phones.  Actually better than the flip Motorola though!2. The characters (letters) on the top of the Qwerty keyboard are tough to get to and would be impossible for large fingers.  She uses her fingernails and has small hands.3. Until she got used to using the phone she inadvertently touched the 'browser' button - starting Internet service - several times; losing minutes in the process.4. Occasionally receiving wrong numbers and having to lose minutes if they leave a voicemail message.Overall, this is a very good phone.  Easy to use, good quality hardware, nice features and great Tracfone service (often being able to send and receive calls where other companies fail).  The real selling points for this Tracfone Samsung T404G phone though are TRIPLE minutes (each phone card face value is tripled) and international calls costing the same as local ones. If the camera was a 3MP and all the keyboard keys were easy to access - it would be 5 out of 5 stars.This phone is a real bargain in a very competitive mobile phone market!UPDATE: 11/19/13My daughter continues to use this phone and didn't want to trade up to a touch screen as she loves the keyboard for texting on this phone so much.

It's got a nice camera with video, MP3 player, SD card slot, tools etc... really hard to believe it's just a Tracfone... The only cons are that there is no 3.5mm jack for headphones to plug into, so if you plan on using the mp3 player function, you need to buy an adapter in order to do that, But they are cheap from Amazon ($3-$4). The other con is that the menu highlighter is always PINK, and there is apparently no way to change the color. I have tried some of the different menu options for color schemes etc.. but none offer the option of changing the menu highlighter color. It seems to be something that was overlooked by Samsung. Other than that I love the phone and it's a terrific buy for the price (If you don't mind the menu color being pink, and hopefully I'll figure out a way to change it).

To provide some incite to readers regarding my choice, let me start by first stating that I was looking for a relatively inexpensive cell phone to use at work and on the road primarily as a phone, and secondarily to also provide basic access to data services for occasional texting and internet browsing.To begin, I feel I should point out certain shortcomings of this device as they undermine the overall value of this phone.:The primary number key pad is laid out for one touch browsing and messaging.This in and of itself causes the greatest problems. One of the two primary menu select keys doubles as the web browser activation key. The same button used to back out of various menu listings also opens an internet connection. What this means basically, is that you will always be 1-click away from being billed airtime. The keys also only have a 'so-so' responsiveness, so I find myself retapping keys quite often. I don't really text much, which is to say almost not at all, and easily find my keystrokes outpacing the display. Put together, these issues make it a near certainty that anyone using this model cell phone will open the web browser and be immediately charged airtime. To give you an idea of how often one is required to press the browse internet button, know that it is also the second button pressed to release the key lock. So, anytime you need to use the phone and it has been idle, or in your pocket, or in your purse. The button cannot be remapped to allow a less intrusive configuration. That alone may give you pause in choosing this product.:The phone has a slide out qwerty keyboard.The keyboard slides out with little resistance. So little in fact it reminds me how it feels to shuffle a deck of cards. I personally find this less appealing than a palpable click into place sensation, but for those that need to whip out the 'chat pad' with blazing speed and Teflon smoothness it may be an enjoyable 'feature'. The problem here is that sliding the keyboard out automatically and immediately unlocks the main numeric and menu keys. Yes, this does save you the trouble of having to do the little finger dance needed to unlock the face keys, but it does not relock them just as quickly as it unlocks them when sliding it closed again. What this means basically(see above), is that any shifting around in ones pocket or purse can unlock the phone leaving one vulnerable to accidental use and billed airtime. The keyboard cannot be locked....This phone seems like it was designed from the ground up to (1)make it difficult to quickly access any desirable advertised design feature that does not bill air time or provide Tracfone a revenue stream, and to (2)purposefully and unnecessarily burn through prepaid minutes to speed up the process of replenishing said prepaid minutes. Though these conditions are far from unique, I can only hope some enterprising attorney recognizes their class action value.There is more that I should add, but it's getting late, and if you have read this far, then you likely get the picture already. Since a reviewer cannot give a zero star rating it gets one star, which effectively means that people that don't know this will think the phone still has more merit than it does. In truth, the triple minutes are worth one star so it balances out, I guess, kinda, sorta.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "tracfone samsung T404", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R49AXVLY9WKHJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have only had the phone for a few days and it is the first phone that I have been able to access the Web.

I am a big tracfone fan and triple minuets for me is the way to go. I buy the 1500 minuet card from trafone at 200 dollars, which gives me 4500 minuets at 4.4 cents per minuet or 1.3 cents for a text.Most unlimited texting and calling plans float around 35 dollars a month which is 398 minuets of talking and 1346 texts, much more then I would use in a month. For me the triple minuets is a great deal.For the phone, it is not a good phone. For these reasons:1. The lock button is with with the star button. Which means that you must be in home page to lock the phone and it talks a couple second to hold it down.2. There are two soft key buttons and for the home page they are \"Menu\" and \"Browser\" this is unchangeable, which means that there is a high chance of butt activating the browser which uses minuets.

I used to have a motorola rokr slider (that I've since recycled) and used tmobile's to go prepaid service. This is my first experience w/ tracfone (a mexican company)... so far so good. For my low usage needs prepaid is the best option. I purchased this thru shop cell deals w/ the 1200 minutes(1yr). I was able to activate it & get my new local number with-in a few minutes using the tracfone's webpage. (For the first use it does say to charge it for 5 hrs) The user manual is only available online in pdf format. I'd recommend taking a few minutes and familiarize yourself w/ its features-- especially where the right soft keys aka \"browser\" buttons are located (on the front upper right and on right side of keyboard), be careful to avoid hitting those by accident. I haven't had issues w/ that yet personally, but have read others have. It sucks samsung didn't include a way to disable that feature in the settings since this is a prepaid phone and unintentional browser use could eat precious minutes.The good: For me the phone's low cost, slide out keyboard, and tracfone's low cost for talk & text when considering the \"triple minutes for life\" of the phone were the selling points. I didn't add a micro sd card b/c I don't plan on using it for pictures/video, internet, or music. I have a digital camera, computer, and AAC player that I prefer to use for those purposes. I happen to really like Samsung as a brand, but I dont work for them. Don't expect or compare it to what the latest & greatest smart phones do, but then again you won't have a 100$ monthly bill or 2 yr. contract either :)The bad: I had to deduct 1 star b/c of the following: it lacks a mini plug for headphones, doesn't include a usb transfer cable, a wired headset or coiled car charger, a user manual, a starter 512MB or 1GB sd card, relatively low camera resolution (2MP), and lacks the ability to shut off the browser feature. The micro sd card slot also isn't in a user friendly side slot, but rather in a hard to get to spot hidden inside the battery cover. The plastic back cover, small charging door piece, and wall charger feels really cheap and may break easily so use care.

Saga concluded.", "Author": "Michael Gmirkin", "ReviewID": "R3SUB7VGKDGQV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, this phone upgrade was messy on account of the fact I originally upgraded to the LG800 (touch screen, triple minutes) because it was the only triple-minutes phone Fred Meyer carried in store and I thought I could make it work. Interface was clunky and touch screen imprecise. Hated it... So, I decided to upgrade the upgrade to the Samsung T404G (which I would have bought in the first place had F.M. actually stocked it).Went to Tracfone's site, switched service to new phone. Didn't pay much attention to the minutes transfer or thought it meant something else. You see, I'd bought the LG800, put 1000 minutes on it (total cost ~$200; $40 [phone] + $160 [1000 minutes]) which tripled to 3000 minutes. Well, after the xfer, I only had 1100 minutes on my phone. Apparently the 2000 minutes are considered \"bonus minutes\" and don't transfer between phones. WTF?? Sent customer service an e-mail. They told me the 2000 minutes wouldn't trasfer from one phone to the next. I told them that was unacceptable, so they tried calling me (at my grandma's house?? apparently there was an old alternate number associated with the account). Finally I called their customer service on a landline (no sense wasting 30 airtime minutes just to get back my minutes that should never have been lost in the first place). About 20 minutes later, I had all my 3000 minutes back. Yay for that.So, the phone... I like this new phone. I liked my old Samsung T305G, so I was pretty sure I'd like this new phone as well. And I do. It functions pretty much the same as the old T305G. Except the 'back' button is sometimes co-opted for other functions, such as on the screen for entering phone number information or text messages. In those instances to back out of the screen you have to push Power/End rather than the usual 'back' button. But I can adapt. It's fine.Ohh, and for some reason the LG800 wouldn't access my voicemail either. That was weird. I'd hit the key for it and would just get a message \"could not complete your call as dialed.\" So I had a voicemail on it for several days I couldn't access. The Samsung T404G connected immediately with no issues and I picked up my message straight out of the gate.Honestly, the keypad really is a nice feature. I like it, even though the phone feels a little bulkier than the old T305G. Definitely easier for me than the old way of texting with the numeric keypad. But occasionally for certain inputs it still seems a little clunky. Took me a while to figure out how to input symbols like the ampersand, parens, etc. But, overall, I definitely like it more than the LG800 and about on par with the T305G I'm not sure if the battery life is QUITE as good? But it certainly seems to keep a decent charge for several days turned on in the pocket. But when the battery gets low it seems pretty insistent on \"battery low, please recharge.\" Don't know how much time was left before it would have shut off after receiving that message. It felt pretty urgent, but I didn't manage to completely drain it, so maybe there was more talk time left.All said, if you're looking for a triple minutes phone, I definitely recommend this one over the LG 800G. Though I have noticed the face is much more prone to picking up scratches and showing smudges/fingerprints than the old T305G. So, there's that. But overall, I still think this is the right phone for me for the moment. Minutes transfer issue aside. Once that was resolved, I've come to like this phone as the next iteration beyond the T305G.

So I've been tinkering, hopefully I can figure out how to stop that.There is also only one game on the phone, a nerdy thing to get irritated by I know but seriously, my crappy $15 phone I had before had a bunch of games.

Lord", "ReviewID": "RA0932VNKKV3R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had tracfones for a few years now and their price and customer service are much less offensive than the mainstream carriers we've had.  (We exhausted all of them on the ISP side, then cancelled their phone/TV services and defected to Tracfone abd TV antennas in response.  I'll buy a summer cottage when I retire with the money saved.)I have not used this phone yet, but trust the other reviews.  I will vouch for Tracfone service cost, and for Amazon undercutting Tracfones cellphone prices.  We have used 2 nokias, an LG flipphone, and a Samsung slider, and Samsung slider beat the tar out of LG for the same original price as the LG (LG flip disconnects alot, Samsung slider is a solid basic workhorse).  I settled on this phone after reading bad reviews about adjacent phones and seeing the tracfoen motorola actually get pulled between one day and the next.  Worst reviews I see here were bad reception which could be luck of the draw on geography, and bad customer service which could be luck of the draw on service rep (and irrelevant once you have the phone up and running).  I've seen Tracfone either slash prices, pull phones, or pile deals on phones when the bad reviews escalate- as opposed to arranging deletion of bad reviews- so kudos to them for their honesty.  (I've seen jcp and others delete negative reviews from week to week in the past.)Price: Tracfone site has this phone for 59.99 in my area, plus free shipping, plus a free accessory kit.  They're honest on reviews, but looks like they built 'free' stuff into the 59.99 there.Price: Amazon Shopcelldeals has this phone for 32.99 plus 4.95 1-3 day shipping plus no accessory kit.  So if you want and need an accessory kit and can't find one for less than 23 dollars (or even 13 dollars if you got the T404G for 49.99 deal), Tracfone is the way to go.  Otherwise, Amazon/Shopcelldeals is good to save you 20-some bucks you can spend on.. maybe airtime cards that get blown up with the triple minutes deal on this phone. :)  I hear Amazon beats Tracfone on price for airtime cards too, and overnights them to you for free.Amazon is great for us shoppers, but I understand why Target and other big box places got out of here if Amazon is undercutting retailers' own website prices. :)  (Amazon good for small fish who will never be found on google and such though.  Easier for small fish to get in here than to get onto a Walmart shelf too.)Glad Amazon and Google survived that .com bubble burst.I will say I look forward to a QWERTY keyboard.  The pushing buttons repeatedly is tiresome when trying to mapquest stuff or google search a thing on the old sliders.  I opted out of touch screen because people complained of poor calibration, tinyness of screen, glitches, and accidentally logging into the internet and burning minutes.  I have a 4 year old at home who can call me on the LG flipphone (we kept it, but he had to call back three times to finish asking his question today).  I'm content not to see what he does with touchscreen internet access. :)  I'm fine with him speed-dialing me at work, but fine with the subtle parental control of a qwerty keyboard for toddler-proof internet access.  I look forward to a 2MP camera and video recorder as well.  I forget whether this phone uses USB or SD cards, but fine either way so icing on the cake if they do.  I have a 300 dollar canon touch screen digital camera for real stuff like trips- this would be impromptu the kid did something cute pictures or videos, or someone hit our car (awesome for insurance claims), or police brutality incident or some other use like that. :)Go Tracfone for brand and check your zip code on their site to see which phones you can use in your zip code.  Go Amazon and shopcelldeals for minutes and phones you can use in your zip code. You might Google good promo codes for bonus minutes when activating airtime that make tracfone site worthwhile to buy airtime at.  Always get at least double or triple minute for life card/capability asap.  Use your work phone number to call tracfone and activate your new phone (or for any other customer service need- so you're not listening to elevator music and gnashing your teeth as minutes beep by while on hold on your tracfone- its only a nickel a minute or something, but terrible for morale listening to minutes beep away while on hold even if it is only a few and you have a few thousand to spare).", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "talutiiq", "ReviewID": "R23KWF9M34CUB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought this phone for the triple minutes bonus.

You cannot personalize the alarms, which bugs me a little.Pros: You can check your voice mail because it has a password by dialing the star key when you hear your voicemail. The messages are easy to send. There are tons of room for contacts. Bluetooth makes it easy to put the latest songs and pictures on your phone. It holds a lot of pictures and videos for a non-smart phone. The camera is pretty good and I like that I can video tape.

When i recieved this phone i looked forward to getting this thing in action. For the first few weeks, it served me pretty well, until i attempted to add an 800 minutes card, with double minutes for life. After attempting multiple times to put it on my phone, via my phone, and my pc, i called customer service. WEll! with my triple minutes for life bonus, i should have recieved a grand total of 2400 minutes. However, i did NOT recieve 2400 minutes, but only 1200. Yes i got half of what was supposed to recieved. So with that said and done, it managed to disable itself, turn on and off, and even waste 200 minutes when a failed to hang up my phone before the person on the other phone did. beware of that; what happens is, if you don't press the end call button after finishing your call, it will keep deducting minutes, until you remove the battery and place it back in.

Well guess what, this phone has got the cruddiest speakers ever! i tried getting a violin solo ringtone on my phone, and once i got it, the violin wasn't even recognizable.
