I love purple and have a case that also reflects this. Its not the typical black so it stands out. Small and slim, light weight and easy to use. Minimal apps on this unlike a branded phone, so it has more memory starting out, close to the 8 gb as expected. I expanded it to 64 so yay! I have played with this a few days and I am in love with android, so glad to be free of the fruit empire!", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Happy!!", "Author": "Alicia Jannette Fernandez", "ReviewID": "R3H6P7CKBWQHKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my new mini samguns s4 and am very excited.

I'm still waiting on my SIM card to come in (expecting it today) for me to get it started up with my number.  I'm not sure why but I was half expecting the color of it to be more of a hot pink but was pleasantly surprised to see that it is actually a Raspberry Pink color that I love so much!  Now if only I could find a dual layer dark turquoise/black or dark purple/black case to go with my new phone.Will add some updates to this once I get my SIM card and have time to play around with it a little bit and can compare reception of this phone with my husband's phone since we both have the same style phone right now.  I'm definitely looking forward to my signal coming from a different set of towers with this new phone!UPDATE:I got my SIM card in yesterday and was able to get everything set up.  I'm not 100% certain that I have the APN information set up correctly but going to keep playing around with it to see if I can get that fixed.As for the reception....WHY haven't I done this sooner?  I did a test call and with my other phone that works off of a different company's tower I would have to sit and wait for it to finally connect when I pressed the Send button.  Almost immediately after I hit the Send button for my test call my home phone started ringing!  Its going to take some getting adjusting going from a 4.8\" screen to a 4.3\" screen but the clarity and smoothness of this phone will definitely help to ease the transition!", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "RECEIVED WRONG DEVICE", "Author": "Mackylos", "ReviewID": "R2LM0HYRP901GI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered a S4 mini but received a Galaxy Grand 2 instead.

The only downside from buying an unlocked phone is no warranty and I noticed my phone getting super hot when it's charging and sometimes it freezes. This was only a couple weeks after purchasing it! It is kind of slow at times but it's only a dual processor. For the most part i don't mind it because I don't do a whole lot with my phone except texting mainly.
