So I looked around for one that would do what I need, as a multimedia producer and insurance agent, musician, etc. and filmmaker who is always on the go.  This was the perfect solution and proves what I have always said that you don't have to take out a loan and break the bank to have a GREAT smartphone!  There is nothing I can't do with it...you just have to see it to believe it...awesome sound, awesome HD video camera, sound recorder, and access to THOUSANDS of Androids apps on Google play.  And now I am an AP DEVELOPER TOO!  Great phone to learn on so I can develop our own aps!  I am thrilled!", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too many flaws", "Author": "Pando", "ReviewID": "R2YMD3V3RRCSZH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "On paper this phone has superb value.  When you use it you realize it has too many flaws.  Here is what I encountered:1) phone would scan for media on startup, and half the time, it will scan without end.  It just will not stop.2) powers off by itself3) difficulty getting on mobile network all the time4) poor battery life, I had to turn off data when not using it5) phone would lose at least 20% power on each restart.  why?6) lots of trouble updating apps.  \"Insufficient storage\" <- but this was not the caseI ran out of patience with this and downgraded my phone to an Alcatel, but at least it does not have any of these problems.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great features, capable with minor quirks", "Author": "odessafiles", "ReviewID": "R2FWI7IMXW08LG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my new Pantech Burst for 4 months. I did not buy it here; the Prime markup was a little steep at the time so I bought from an Amazon vendor, away from Amazon.The phone came unlocked, with Android ICS already installed. I'm using it in the USA, on H2O wireless, which is an ATT MVNO. I've also tried a T-mobile MVNO sim and was not prompted for an unlock code.Pluses: fast processor, 1gb of ram, nice launcher interface, priceAverage: call quality, displayCons: Battery life, ATT app clutter, app display issues.There are some great reviews out there already, example gsmarena and cnet. My experience is pretty consistent with these reviews. Battery life is a downside, but manageable with chargers unless you're a tourist on the move. One review criticizes call quality, my experience is it's okay. There is some interface quirkiness: example, downloaded app icons go dark (they're fine as shortcuts). ATT apps are there to clutter memory and get in the way of tethering (this can be worked around, however, without rooting the phone).I can't really address over the air data (ie 4g capability) as I'm a per-minute plan data miser and try to use wifi whenever possible. Wifi performance is excellent, including VOIP call capabilities (echo-free using android app groove ip).Overall, my experience is positive. This phone is priced reasonably if not cheap, given its capabilities. If you want something significantly better you will probably pay 50% more, at least. This phone is even cheaper as a refurb or used. If you can't spend a lot on a phone but want the full android experience, this is a good choice.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RJJFQ86HN42D0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, before purchasing this phone, I read many reviews on it and found a mixture of good and bad. Mostly positive though. having owned a Huawei Fusion prior to this phone, I must say, I am amazed as to the performance so far (hope I am not talking too quickly). I have owned this phone for a few days now. So far, no over-heating problems, battery life ok, graphics great, and the speed of the phone, excellent, including the other specs. Can't comment on the durability yet, having only had the phone for a few days now. So far, I am very impressed. The first thing that came to mind when I got the phone was, the people who commented negatively about this phone, were they talking about the same phone I got?????? To me, this phone can stack up to many of the \"name brand\" expensive phones on the market today. I did have to restart the phone after connecting it to the computer to sync some music and connect with desktop software, because the camera failed to load: But once I restarted, everything was back to normal. I do not consider this a problem, but just the reality of technology: i.e, software conflicts. Conclusion, Very happy with this phone so far.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the original Pantech Battery", "Author": "Jaime Echenique", "ReviewID": "R1XO7258NS3Q5X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This time the battery inlcuded with the phone is not the original one.

When I received the phone, it was NOT UNLOCKED. The company also decided to REMOVE the original battery and charger and repackaged it with CHEAP generic replacements.

So overall the build quality of the phone is good , no plastic squicky sound and so on.

Still is a decent phone with Android 2 on it.Just 4 months after buying it, the phone is completely dead.  A new battery did not fix it.  The only effect when plugging it into the charger is for the camera flash to briefly flicker like a strobe light.  We did not do anything unusual.

I wanted to get a better phone than my last one, but this one sucks even more. I did not get this phone from amazon. The camera on the phone is blurry no matter what attempts you take. The battery drains within an hour.The phone is also very touchy and takes FOREVER to connect to the internet. The phone has a mind of its own. Sometimes I'll just be texting and it just turns of no matter how much battery I have left. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!

I was worried about it being a bit of an older phone, but was more than pleasantly surprised after spending a few weeks with it. This phone comes with the Gingerbread Android operating system stock, but can be updated to Ice Cream Sandwich OS easily and for free on the Pantech website. The upgraded operating system turned a pleasing phone into a superb phone. I have had various higher priced smartphones in the past, and wouldn't give up my Pantech Burst to go back to any of them. This is the perfect phone for anyone looking for an affordable, well made, feature-rich smartphone in the Android market. I especially love the standard 16 GB internal memory. I actually like this phone so much that when the one I was given broke (my Husband dropped it from a large distance onto concrete at work), I immediately found another one to replace it. The thought of spending a ton of money on a newer phone never even crossed my mind. The only reason I gave a 4 star review instead of 5 is that the second Pantech Burst I bought can sometimes (though very rarely) act up in small ways while trying to use the browser and I have to restart it. I am not sure if this is a problem with the manufacturing of the phone, or if it is because I bought the phone used and therefore have no clue what may have happened to the phone in the past. My first Pantech Burst did not have this problem. Even with this small inconvenience I simply do not believe there is a better smartphone available in this price range.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$109.00", "Features": "Included: Phones / Battery / Battery Door / Wall charger / 30 Day Warranty\nNot Included: Memory Card / Sim Card/", "Name": "Pantech Burst P9070 Red AT&T Unlocked Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-PvYXXZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009STFEB4"}}
