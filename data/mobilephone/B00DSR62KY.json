Anyway, below is my review of the product.I'm sure you can find all the specs and un-boxing videos as well as picture quality reviews and so on all over the internet, so I won't waste your time typing about that.  Instead I'll talk about my personal user experience and you can relate to it or not.I took the GS4-Z (or \"Ph-amera\") for a spin when my wife decided to take us on a mini 5 day vacation.  I have to say, this thing is pretty useful.  It takes quality photos and at the same time, you can share the pictures with your personal network without having to upload it to a computer or swapping micro SD cards (Although swapping can preserve image quality).  If you share images on Whatsapp or other messenger, the quality of the photos will decrease due to their file size limitation.  Instead, I chose to send them through email, and they turned out very good.  The 10x's optical zoom is great, just be sure to keep your hand steady or place the gadget on a tripod.  NOTE:  Don't plan on standing this on it's side like a common compact camera to take timed shots, as the curves make it impossible to position it like so without some type of assistance.The camera is heavier and thicker than your average modern smartphone, so be prepared to have this brick swinging in your pocket should you decide to run.  I'd say it's just about as heavy as the Galaxy Note 2.  I wore the S4 Zoom around my neck with a metal camera lanyard (wrapped in clear rubber), and it worked out very nicely.  I hear people complain about the plastic body, but the weight gives it a \"quality\" feel.  Battery life is great when using it as a phone.  You will however notice a drain if the back facing camera is used a lot.  I'm planning to purchase a 2nd removable battery as a backup, so I'm not too worried.If you're planning on using this on a car dash/window mount as a GPS or small viewing screen, start planning on doing heavy modifications or forget it at all.  The lens on the phone (as thick as about 3 s4 minis) makes it really hard to fit on standard mounts.  Again, I just used my neck lanyard (If you don't mind the occasional swing) on the rear view mirror, and it was fine.  Just adjust it a bit shorter, or it'll crash into your window if you happen to slam on the brakes.This device is definitely for a target audience.  Currently the GS4 Zoom only comes in white, and although I enjoy the screen quality, many will not be pleased with the resolution provided.  If you like thin light phones, this is definitely not it.  There are many people that say this device is ugly, but I've handed this over to people to take our photo and they were intrigued!  I've heard comments like sleek, nice, different, and very useful to name a few.I'd recommend this camera to anyone on a budget,who no longer wants to carry a compact camera and a smartphone at the same time.  You could get the Nokia Lumia 1020 ($700-$1000 No contract/Unlocked price estimate as of 8/2013), but for $400, the GS4 Zoom is a great quality buy at about half the price of the Lumia 1020.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just What I needed", "Author": "paul", "ReviewID": "R2RYDFN3D5TPW7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read about this product and new it would be a must buy. The original price scared me off a little bit, as did a slew of bad reviews around the web. People said it was an abomination, the worst possible combination of two products.I completely disagree. Let me first say, I have been dreaming of a phone with a \"real\" camera forever. I have tried all the recent flagships which say they have a great camera. I have tried All versions of the Gaalxy series, the Xperia Z, the HTC One, the Lumia 920, and 1020, the Nokia 808 pureview, the LG Optimus G Pro, the Iphone 3GS, 4 and 4S. There are more, but those probably have the best smartphone cameras. The S4 Zoom is in another league however. The inclusion of a proper optical zoom lens is the greatest feature. Also the bigger sensor helps quite a bit in capturing greater detail. I have gotten the best shots I have ever shot from a smartphone.Sure, the camera tech makes it have a ridiculous hump and it is a little unwieldy. It's not unmanageable by any stretch though. Plus, the bottom of the phone functions as a great camera grip and the Zoom Ring lens works really well to compose slow zoom shots on the camcorder function.The kicker, though is Android. At least for me, that is very important. I feel like I have the best of all worlds. I can get great pictures, and still have all the apps I want on the phone. With the Lumia line and the Nokia 808 I was missing too many apps I use everyday.A word about battery life. I have found it very good. I can get through a day easily with fairly heavy use, pictures included. If I were out shooting an event where I took 200 pictures, I may need more juice, but then, this phone has a removeable battery! I can just buy a spare and bring it with me.Maybe future versions of this phone will be slimmer, or more \"phone-like\" but I really like the combination, and the little nuisances are really that, just little and don't get in the way of this being a great device.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Smartphone, Good Camera, So-so Video Camcorder", "Author": "HOBBES", "ReviewID": "R3G0WIYAGBDK61", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the S4 Zoom because I wanted a versatile all-in-one Smartphone/Digital Point and Shoot Optical Zoom Camera/Video Camcorder so that I wouldn't need to carry around multiple devices either for everyday use or for traveling.  I would rate the S4 Zoom differently depending on how I am using it.4.5 stars as a Smartphone.  The S4 Zoom has a smaller, lower resolution screen, lesser processor, and may be missing some of the non-essential software and interface tricks (such as hovering gestures) found on the regular Galaxy S4, but for the most part it does a great job making calls, running apps, giving GPS assisted directions, surfing the web, video and music playback and most every other function you might want your Smartphone/mini-computer to do.4.0 stars as a Camera for taking digital photographs. I also own a two year old Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10 with 16x optical (21x digital) zoom range, but which like the S4 zoom has a 16 megapixel CMOS sensor.  I consider the DMC-ZS10 to be very good for taking both photos and video.  While I knew I would be sacrificing some zoom range with the S4 zoom, which is only 10x optical zoom, in most other respects, both in image quality and functionality, I found the S4 Zoom to be nearly as good or in some case better than the DMC-ZS10 when taking photographs.  (Please note that my opinion on image quality is based on viewing the images on a computer or hd television screen, since I do not generally print photographs to paper anymore).2.0 stars as a Video Camcorder.  The S4 Zoom takes good quality video as long as you are not using the zoom function.  Once you start using the zoom the problems appear.  The most glaring problem is a lack of continuous auto focus while zooming.  (The lack of continous auto focus can also be a problem when using the burst function in the camera mode).  The S4 Zoom isn't the smoothest performer when zooming in and out, and it easily loses focus when doing so.  Whenever you stop zooming, the autofocus function pushes the lens in and out to refocus the image, but this results in very jerky video.  Another problem is a very noisy zoom mechanism which is picked up on the audio, even in the quiet zoom mode.  My DMC-ZS10 is a far superior performer in all of these respects when it comes to taking smooth focused video with minimal camera noise while using the zoom.  I do like the fact that the S4 zoom has a micro SD card slot for extra memory when shooting hd video.  An extra battery or two are essential if you plan to shoot a lot of photos or video during the day without recharging.3.5 stars is my Overall Rating, which I rounded up to 4 stars above because I like the overall functionality of the device (and Amazon does not allow you to give partial star ratings).  I very much like the idea of the marriage of a Smartphone with an optical zoom camera for those of us who would like the ability to take high quality photos and videos in a variety of situations including when it is not always possible to get closer to the action, without the inconvenience of having to carry around multiple devices.  To my knowledge the S4 Zoom is a first in this regard.  The poor video performance when using the zoom was a big disappointment to me, however, and I may still need to carry around my other camera when I want to record high quality video using the zoom.  Had I known about this weakness beforehand and I hadn't been in urgent need of replacing my old Smartphone, which had died, I might have held off until an upgraded version of this product came out.  My hope is that Samsung and other companies will not abandon the idea of such hybrid devices but will continue to develop products along these lines.  The technologies already exist on separte devices, the challenge is to combine them in one truly high quality all-in-one device.My wishlist for the next iteration of the S4 Zoom: (1) Fix the autofocus and noise problems when using the zoom during video capture.  (2) Add a manual zoom ring or lever around or near the shutter button, to allow for one handed operation of the zoom when shooting video or taking pictures.  (3)  Up the optical zoom range as much as possible, as long as you can keep the dimensions of the device within reason, i.e. something that can be carried around in a pants pocket.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera phone for me!", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "RQJM5KI1MCPWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone after losing several this year forced me to use a 2 year old smartphone which is too slow for today's apps (much like how a decade ago we used to buy a new computer due to increase in speed and software). I've only had it for 5 days but in that time I've found it a perfect fit. As you probably know, there are two sides to this phone- a mobile phone with 4.3 inch touchscreen on one side, and a 24-240mm zoom camera on the other side.Phone: - Works like most android phones and it was easy to get used to it even though my last 3 phones have been Sony's. In fact there are some good differences, such as wrapping the 5 main screens- when you reach the end of one side, you can keep flicking the same direction and it just goes the the other side. On Sony, you had to flick the reverse direction once you reached the end of one side. All apps work well, such as internet, whatsapp, games, searching camera albums, setting alarms (which is not under \"alarms\", but is a seperate tab under the icon \"clock\", and S calender.Camera: - When I show people the phone, their first reaction is that it's big and thick. The general public is not knowledgable about the more technical aspects of cameras so don't understand how powerful and useful this lens is. Although thick for a smartphone, this is not just a smartphone. It is a fully integrated highly featured compact camera with a very useful wide angle of 24mm (in 35mm aspect) which can zoom up to 240mm (in 35mm aspect). This is a far cry from the usual 28-105mm you'd normally see on most compact cameras, or even most zoom lenses for expensive DSLR's. Being attached to a smartphone, you get a 4.3 inch LCD screen to view things, which again is vastly larger than the 2.7-3 inch you see on 99% of today's digital camerasI find the added depth useful for a good solid grip so it's stable for photo taking.On the weekend I took about 390 photos and the results have been sharp, colourful and the zoom range has allowed me to capture a range of photos I wouldn't have otherwise with most cameras. For those who are a little more technically in the know, at 24mm there is distortion at the corners which is quite pronounced, and the f stops go from 3.1 at 24mm to 6.3 at 240mm. Because of the small sensor and the f stops, it is obviously not going to give you perfect noise free photos in the dark. But for the day, it is a superb amalgam of camera and phone. There are a large number of options to apply filters, to have manual settings for shutter speed and apeture, white balance, multiple frames per second and so on. You can choose to have the camera remember these options or reset to default each time you turn it on and off.  I usually leave it on auto, as it's the most convenient for me at this stage. With my other more sophisticated cameras, I usually change settings more often, and they are easier to change as the S4 zoom requires some digging into the menus.The camera is reasonably quick to turn on from time out compared to most compact cameras. What you do is turn the camera on, then press the on/off button on the side, which is also the standby button, Then when you swipe the log back in screen, it wil go straight to the camera and turn it back on. There is no button or icon on the unlock screen so this is the only way I've found.Obviously the photos you take can then be sent to Facebook, your online photo albums, shared with friends via social app like whatsapp etc without having to transfer photos from camera to computer to phone.Battery life is surprisingly good for a mobile phone. I was able to take about 200 photos with battery going to 55% charge. 40 of the photos were with flash. Another time I took about 170 photos and the battery went to 60%.I've found this to be a versatile setup for me so far. I'm going to Bangkok very soon and expect it will continue to be my all in one device for a while (until the next best gadget comes along ^_^ )I've become paranoid about losing my phone so I've attached a wrist strap to it. I even have a pouch which I attached to my shoulder strap of my backpack and always loop the wriststrap on first before taking it out- the strap dangles out for this reason. Yeah I know- too much detail! heheThanks for reading my wordy review about this fun and useful camera phone !Edit 30th November 2013=======================I's like to expand on both the phone and camera.**Phone:I've had no problems using the phone. Everything goes from screen to screen quickly. Internet pages upload quickly. There have been no freezing mentioned in other reviews. Calls are clear and loud. My dislikes are minor, like when you pull down from the top of the screen I'd like \"mobile data\" to be on the first 5 icons at the top rather than flicking to the next 5- be nice to be able to customise this- WiFi and Mobile data are the two buttons on this screen I use most. And for customisation- on main screens, the \"apps\" icon is always on the bottom left- again be nice to be able to change this.** Camera: The camera continues to perform well. When I said above that it was a fully featured and integrated camera, I didn't say how it was so. In terms of features- you can go to manual mode and you can change exposure, shutter speed and aperture. You can do multi burst, and apply filters, though if you use filters or multi burst, it will take 2-4 seconds to process the photos.Other uses I've found for the zoom lens are: superior ability to compose photos, superior portraits using longer zoom lengths and smoother bokeh (out of focus blurriness), I've been to conferences and used the zoom to get closer in to take photos of slides, and of course, better ability to take occasional candid photos of little kids who are always squirming around.The wider angle 24mm instead of 28-32mm usually seen on most mobile phones, makes it superb for selfies. You can see the whole of your upper half of your body, instead of just your face.One surprise is a very well made and sturdy rotating ring around the zoom lens. If you are using the phone and then turn this ring, a new screen will appear with a heap of options- shooting modes like macro, or viewing the gallery etc. I don't really use it but it's interesting and the quality of the ring is very impressive- not wobbly, smooth yet firm, no gaps.That's it for now. It continues to be an ideal phone for me, at this time.Edit 7th Feb 2014=================I'm still using the Zoom and overall I'm quite happy. I continue to use the Zoom as my primary camera for outings during the day and find the wide angle great for capturing more in the photo, while the zoom is very very useable for composing and getting closer to distant objects. Photos remain very sharp, colour is rich and true, and bokeh (out of focus blur) is unusually good for this type of camera (though a true prime lens of s dslr is still far far superior).An example of the life of the battery- it drops from 100% to 50% after I take 200 photos, use mobile data GPS and track my trail using one of the mapping apps over a 4 hour period.I've found the following not-so-goods.- The phone froze twice while taking a photo.- Viewing the photo albums is getting slower now I've got about 9GB of photos on my memory card and camera- Organising photos from the \"camera\" album into new albums is quirky. The process is relatively instinctive to anyone used to android- click new album, give it a name, the click the photos you want moved and it will put a tick in the corner of each photo selected, and you press done and can drag the all the selected photos into the new album. This part is fine. The problem is that the new album by default goes to the phone memory, regardless of whether memory card or phone os selected as the main memory of the photos of the camera. Thus while trying to organise my photos, I was stuck after 5 new albums because the phone memory got filled up. I also could not find a way to use the phone to move the new albums from phone memory to SD card. I had to hook it up to the computer and do it via windows explorer.- Wide angle at 24mm has disportion at the sides and corners. This doesn't worry me as I'm more interested in getting things into the photo rather than edge to edge sharpness that \"professionals\" care about.- There is dust inside the zoom lens.Overall it's still my go to camera phone combo for most of my outings and hikes and I like it.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great blend of camera and phone!

I got some nice pics in sharp focus with the macro mode.It doesn't have the right frequency band (1700) for TMobile's 4G LTE, but makes no difference. Most of the country only has 3G which is more than enough for regular use - email, maps, websites, etc. I figure by the time 4G LTE is available around the country in a few years, Samsung will have the next version of this out.Don't listen to the naysayers.

So compromises were made on each side.  But the compromises were sound in my opinion.I've had it a day.  I've put it through the paces.As an (I guess I must admit) \"aging\" technology fan I am able make a broader comparison of this device.Compared to my first mobile phone from 1996 which was a brick that cost a fortune this device is a relative peanut -- and a power-packed peanut, at that.To make another comparison, the form factor of this device is about the same as the Palm Treo I had about 10 years ago.  I was never really able to get the Treo to work well.This device I was able to get in full operation (using a micro SIM and StraightTalk service) in about an hour.  Then I spent another hour (or two or three) marveling at all of its features/functions and the really superb quality/capability of the camera.It is a very good smartphone with Android OS -- fully functional.  Easy to use.  Fast in operation.  It is to my observation no slower than my Samsung GT-N5100 Note -- which is very fast.  Compared to the Samsung SCH-738C that it replaced it is a racer.I'm a guy who was carrying a phone and a camera around.  So I'm glad to have the option of the two devices combined into one device.  I was sick and tired of taking bad smartphone photos and/or trying to find the best Android camera app (which I really never did find).The camera is -- well, it is a good point-and-shoot camera.  It takes better quality pictures than any smartphone I've used; it takes pictures that are as good as any of the mid-range point-and-shoot cameras that I own (but now have the option of not having to carry around with me).Summing up the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom:  It is chunky (again, think Palm Treo).  But it is a smartphone and camera -- powerful and fun.The battery life will need to be managed attentively; but you can charge this device like any mobile phone (I keep a charger in the car and in just about every room where the device goes).It will need a suitable case -- I'm looking for that item.

Husband ordered two Nexus 5 devices and we compared the camera/video recording features.  I prefer the way the Zoom handles and takes pictures over the Nexus 5.  The Xenon flash is phenomenal.  I have tweaked my phone a bit by removing some of the bloatware that comes with Samsung devices.  Hoping when the Zoom is launched stateside, more rom options will be available.I can take some good pictures with the device, but I wanted to add that Lumia is better at taking pics in low light settings (talking about auto mode).  The Zoom's \"night\" mode helps, but I tend to take pictures of fast moving beings (toddlers and babies) so I end up utilizing the flash and/or manual mode very often when the light isn't optimal.When using the video camera setting, the sound of the lens extending and retracting can be heard--it's not a big deal for me since my subjects are loud anyway, but for others this might be an issue.My son has dropped my phone several times and at quite the distance.

Yes the phone is a little bulkier, and, while the screen size is on par average with smart phones, there are many bigger models out there. So you just have to ask yourself, what's important to you?  Photos with friends and family are something that I love to have-so I was intrigued by the zoom.  Overall, its a phone that does all my galaxy S2 did and more.  functions are great and I actually like having the bulkier frame when Im using the phone, I just find it easier to handle. Of course that is the case with taking photos. Which brings me to my favorite part of the phone which is a familiar trigger button for the camera-which is located right where it should be...no more hunting around the touch screen for the button--and accidentally hitting the wrong one!  Pics are great-not dslr level of course, but far better then the standard camera phones I've used. The zoom lens is awesome. a final issue this phone has 3g hptsa speeds...not 4lte....this scared me at first, but on the t-mobile network, I see very little to no difference in actual load times. So I am overall very happy with the zoom.

The iPhone and the Nokia Lumia 1020 are the other two \"photographer's phones,\" but the Samsung is the only one with a full-size, optical-zoom lens.  It's a \"phamera,\" or a camera with a phone built in.  I'm predisposed to this thing since I already have a Galaxy Note, so I could pick it up and start using it without much of a learning curve.First of all, it's big, and by that I mean, it's thick.  Carrying one of these around is like carrying a point and shoot camera, and not a small one, either.  And with a protective case, it's going to be even thicker.  But it beats carrying both a phone and a camera if that's what you generally do.  If the size doesn't bother you, the specifications are on par with any other superzoom point-and-shoot, but it doesn't approach the functionality of even an older camera.  My Canon s90 is essentially obsolete, but what makes it useful is that it has real control rings that can be set to control aperture, shutter speed, white balance, zoom, or any two functions you tend to use frequently.  This is the difference between snapshots and photographs.  I learned to photograph with a film SLR, and it had actual, physical controls for f-stop and shutter speed, which is the definition of a real camera.  The Galaxy Zoom has one control ring around the lens, which is a great idea that Canon pioneered in point-and-shoot cameras, but the function is fixed - it can either select between shooting modes, which a real photographer has no interest in, or it's the zoom control.  The other controls are on the LCD as swipable rings - not the same thing.  I could get used to it, but there's nothing like the real feel of a manual control.  If the Galaxy Zoom had a second control ring and a zoom lever, like every other digital camera in the world, with the option to assign whatever function I wanted to these controls, it would have been perfect.  It's a better setup than having to root through a menu to make changes, but not much.  Also, no one needs more than 10 megapixels, at least, no one who isn't a professional, and a professional photographer wouldn't use the Galaxy Zoom as his main camera.  I would also gladly trade half the zoom for a faster lens, which is going to be far more useful.  You can always zoom with your feet - I used a 50mm f 2.0 prime lens for years and never had a sense that it was inadequate - but there's not much you can do to let more light into a slow lens.One advantage a cell phone has over a dedicated camera is the ability to take pictures without drawing too much attention to yourself.  The Galaxy Zoom misses this capability since a casual observer will conclude that it's a camera and not \"just a cell phone.\"  The toy-like white color probably helps in this regard.It's also only available in white from AT&T; - you have to buy the unlocked version to get it in real-camera black.  The Galaxy Zoom is a great attempt to appeal to a market no one would have thought existed, but for the time being, it's not quite at the point yet to justify carrying around a phone of this size just to have a decent camera.  However, cell phone cameras have gotten so darn good that they are actually starting to cut into sales of real cameras.  Most people don't need any more camera than this, anyway.  Once manufacturers like Canon and Nikon figure out that adding a cell phone to one of their own cameras will tap into a new market, that will lead to some great options.  Nikon is almost there with the s800c that runs Android.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera feature!", "Author": "Chang", "ReviewID": "R3O7FSH4CBVMJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing optical zoom camera feature with all lastes smartphone featurs!Handy in my pocket, stand itself with good angle to view photos!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does Not Work on TMOBILE need 1700 band", "Author": "Kevin D.
