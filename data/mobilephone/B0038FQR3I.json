The capacitive touch screen is perfect. Once you fool around with it for a few days, you can figure it out. It is business friendly and looks very good as well. You have documents to go to view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. It is Quad-band unlocked GSM phone which you can use all over the world.So, why did I give it only 3 stars?What they don't tell you is that it is unlocked for voice but not for data. In other words the only way that you can get BIS (Blackberry Internet service) on it, is to have a company like Verizon which operates on CDMA technology.  You can not get BIS for it in Europe or many parts of Asia. I am stationed in Kuwait in support of the US Military. My Kuwaiti sim card works in storm2 as far as voice and making calls are concerned but you can not get BIS for it.If you live in America or do not care to have BIS, go for it.

I must say that i received in record time to ordering it but that was prob the best thing. It was a gift to myself for Christmas, so i only started using it on that day. The phone freezes up and sticks quite often. causing me to feel like its was a refurbished phone i got instead of a new one. Having owned a brand new Storm 1 before and loving it i felt this was the way to go.. but with this phone from unlocked kings I have to constantly charge it because it loses power so quickly (another reason i think i was sold a refurbished phone). It also shuts of for itself at random times of the day, sometimes even when i'm on a call (and no not the BB auto shut down/turn on times). When this happens it takes forever to come back on... Sighat least i got my phone pretty quickly :/2 weeks after my last review: My functions are malfunctioning.

I looked at the options available and came to the conclusion that the Storm 2 was the best option. The phone is just great! the touchscreen works very smoothly and overall the applications are what I was expecting. The only issue was that I couldn't make the EDGE connection work with my carrier. The phone is fully unlocked for calls but you need to verify first if the data connection will work with your carrier. Out of the 4 carriers in my area, the phone only worked with 1 (All carriers are GSM/3G). Also, the phone didn't come with the 16GB microSD card. However, this was easily fixed by calling Amazon.

Hola!The phone is very nice, looks great and the DIFFERENCE on the shopping experience is made by the SELLER!. I picked CELL LOUNGE and they did good customer service, they answered every email I sent, and their staff is very nice, polite and helpfull.Back to the phone, is very ligth, the screen is very sensitive, and has a lot of memory, so you can add lots of things to personalize the phone. It IS PERFECTLY UNLOCKED and works great with GSM carriers. Also, see if you get a phone labeled CDMA, because it turns out that the phone is double tecnology, so it suports both tecnologies and more carriers (I just learnt that with this BB, I didn't knew that was even possible!

But it lasted only until I got the phone. Setting up the phone was not so straight forward. Not because of the UI or anything, but RIM's much touted implementation of touch screen. While every other touch screen implementation is a \"touch screen\", RIM's implementation is a combination of touch and click. So if you want to click a button, the touch will select the button and pressing again to click will trigger a real press on the button. While in theory this can save the user from unwanted clicks, the main issue with this is that the click doesn't work really well in every part of the screen. Especially when you have a button on top left corner, clicking that will take all the energy you have. I almost felt like I will break the screen. The clicks on the center of the screen as smooth enough so its not a big deal for most buttons. Except when you use keyboard. I really dont know how a company like RIM is allowing such a product to be released to the market when such a big usability issue exists.the next big problem with the phone is with the network service. While it supports data via Wifi and 2g/3g networks, I dont see an option to force the phone to use only the Wifi network for data. ( Or at least this is not so intuitive if such an option exist).Installing and using apps also was not so simple. I downloaded and installed Google Talk, and on trying to login, it keeps giving me a message that The service is not enabled for this phone. I am not sure what this means at all. For comparison, I have done this on an Andriod phone and that was pretty straight forward. No issues at all..In short, If you are a techie who wants some adventure ( really?? There are so many better ways to get the thrill than setting up and using a phone). Stay away from this.Or if you need enterprise email etc and have an IT department to help you setup this for you, then you may consider this. Or else never even think of it.
