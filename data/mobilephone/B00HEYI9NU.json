I've had it since the end of November (it's now January 9th) and it is still running well. the dual core processor is more than enough to run the OS and all the applications I've tried to run on it, It runs GTA san andreas smoothly if you turn the settings down some.Aesthetically it has a pretty nice design, the only thing that looks a little cheap is the speaker holes on the front. I think it would have looked really nice if the holes were flush with the plastic, they have this concave look to them that makes it look like their molding process is inferior (and it very well could be) but i'm nitpicking here. Overall it feels really solid, and looks nice. the only thing that really limits this phone is the RAM. it only has 512mb which means if you're running too many apps it will force close them. if they bumped up the price a little and used 1gb this would be an amazing phone.The quality of the screen is decent, don't see any ghosting and the brightness is more than enough, I usually have it on the low or medium setting (there's a widget included that has wifi/blutooth/sync/brightness buttons on it that I keep on the home screen.)It was fairly easy to root. I had to use one of those automatic rooters, it was deigned for Chinese phones I don't recall the name though.Pros- Cheap- Looks and feels nice in your hands- has enough processing power to run 3D games- speakers on the front sound pretty good for phone speakers, even with music. (as long as you don't turn the volume up enough to cause distortion)- comes with plastic case and screen protector in the box (good because there's no aftermarket cases!)- battery life is good, I often see it go down to 80% after a day of mild use. If you're on it using skype and doing a video call you could see the battery drain in a matter of a few hours (pretty normal TBH) but on standby this thing easily lasts 3-4 days with minimal usage.Cons- 512mb of ram (knew what I was getting when I bought it though)- some language errors in the rom, barely noticeable though.For the price point, you really cant go wrong with this device. if this thing lasts me at least a year I'll be ecstatic, if the quality of this device is indicative of blus' other devices, I would be happy to purchase another phone from them sometime soon.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Kandace", "ReviewID": "R3PUCN86D0Q2CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I broke my iphone 4 and needed a replacement phone that didn't cost $400-$600. Since I have AT&T; and no upgrade available for a while, I was on my own. I wanted 4G smartphone that I could still download all of the same apps as the iphone pretty much and then I found this one. For a little over $100 I am VERY happy with the capabilities of this phone. And it's an android so it has access to large variety of apps. It can also hold 2 sim cards at a time.When I ordered it I was sad that I could not find a phone case or screen protector for this phone since it isn't a very popular model, but boy was I glad when I opened up the box and realized a screen protector and case were already included, along with the headset and charger of course.So far the only thing I miss, is the way someone could text you a phone number and you could click on that number and save it directly into your contacts.

The other 20% it exhibits a strange problem: the screen will get very grainy and white with lines. The touch part of the screen still works and you can still access all the apps and they work. There seems no consistency at all in this behavior. I haven't contacted BLU yet because they would likely ask to have the phone sent to them, leaving my husband without his phone... due to this issue, I'm down-grading the phone to 3 stars from 4.I wish I'd bought him the Advance 4.0. It's been working fantastic AND gets data in our area. Bother.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought Advance 4.0 (A270a) ) for myself and the Dash Music (D272a) for my husband. These models are very similar to each other, and I'll compare them a bit in this review.First, this is a very nice looking phone. I think it looks more \"manly\" than the Advance, which is why I got it for my husband. We're use to low-end Go Phones, so this was a really nice upgrade. It feels a little more fragile than our old phones, but not cheap. It's certainly way more stylish than the Pantech CrossOver my husband had previously...Second, we use T-mobile and, yes, this phone works just fine with that carrier. All the settings were loaded automatically from the Sim card. Interestingly, this phone has fewer \"Data Bands\" than the Advance, so it tends to have spottier 4G/3G coverage than the Advance. Except in really large buildings, this phone gets great cellular and text reception. (If having data consistently is a big issue for you, I recommend getting the Advance.)Third, the camera is mediocre. My husband's old Pantech had a 3.0mp camera on it and it still took better pictures than the one on this phone! Focus is terrible and it just seems to have problems in any lighting that is not \"Outdoor-Sunny\". (The Advance's camera is just as bad too, even though it's got 5.0mp camera and a flash.)Forth, even though it has a 4GB ROM the actual usable space for apps is less than 2GB. This will be problematic for some people who install large apps that can't be moved to the SD card. But for people like my husband this isn't much of an issue. His prior phone had something like 256MB of space and he never complained about a lack of space. (Note: I use AppMgr to help me sort through programs that can be moved to the SD card. I save a lot of space on my ROM with it.)Also, this is a very very bare-bones Android 4.2 OS. It only has the very basic features (calls, text, calender, camera, and clock). This is great for people who don't like having extra programs forced on them, but inconvenient for people who like everything to \"just work\" out of box.Weirdly, Android 4.2 really limited it's ability to customize your ringtone assignments. This isn't BLU's fault, of course, but a poor design decision on Google's part. My husband was really disappointed though. He loved the high level of customized ringtone assignments you could do in Android 3.2 and really felt the lose when he \"upgraded\".Fifth, the screen is sharp and clear but has pretty bad viewing angles up and down. Right to left viewing angles are fine. And, as has been with phones in the past, direct sunlight makes your screen unviewable. The touch capacity is comparable to other entry-level phones in this price range. (Basically, get Swiftkey or some program similar to it to make up for the deficiencies in the touch screen.)Sixth, one thing this phone does right is the speakers: they are front facing. The Advance 4.0 has the main speaker on the lower back, where you'd usually hold it with your hand. Thankfully that design flaw in not present here! The speakers are also reasonably loud. Don't expect anything super high quality though, and if you're in a noisy environment you'll have problems, but for a cell phone under $100 the speakers are acceptable. As a bonus, BLU is nice enough to include a headset (earsbuds + mic).Seventh, Battery life seems reasonable? Part of the problem with cell phones is your battery life will be heavily determined by what you're doing with the phone. Battery life seems average. (Note: I found a replacement batter for the Advance in the BLU Amazon Storefront under Accessories. I'm pretty sure I saw one for the Music Dash as well...)Not knowing much about the BLU brand, I can't comment on longevity. However, if these phones last for more than a year I'll consider them a success and BLU will have a returning customer. :)", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "an android is an android", "Author": "JOHN", "ReviewID": "R1ICGSWXLIC5KZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit because of its size.  It fits in my hand much easier than my larger blu dash 5. So for long phone calls this phone has its advantages. At the price this phone was easier than using the 2nd SIM slot on the larger phone. Honestly I'm not a big fan of android, in fact I hate it, but  the phones with the computer interface options I loved are getting phased out.  With no better options I deal with this new (and annoying) android technology as the only logical way to still send and relieve text messages on my computer (It takes Gmail and an interface app to accomplish that through any net access ...it works and even works if I forget the phone at home and I'm on a computer at work, a somewhat scarey but useful operational  android APP/Gmail feature...)But as a basic android phone... no problems out of the box.  Pretty much this phone can do anything my much more expensive android phones can do. Its music speakers are (as expected) about as good as my friends I-Phone speakers, and that is not good for music quality but pretty good for my audio books and interviews/lectures. They do make for one loud ring volume. If you want to add audio files, or  run every APP you can get your hands on (or never delete your emails/text/photos) add the external memory.  Pictures are fine but keep in mind it has no flash (and thank God no front facing camera).Note...it was tricky getting the SD mem card to sit properly in its slot.  At first I thought it would not accept any SD card. I tried several. then I found its metal clip flips up before the card can go all the way in... poor design and no instructions but...once you know u know", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not Exact", "Author": "Reliable", "ReviewID": "R2P2TJFXPPPUQO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fine but not the color Blue everything else is exact all the features such as the music and other things just could't contact seller", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Go Blu!\"", "Author": "Lennytel", "ReviewID": "R1N993NZG9XGHO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has been a pleasure to have so far.

Like many other reviewers, I was stuck with a broken phone in the middle of my contract with AT&T; but still wanted a smartphone for the remaining period. My dream phone was the HTC One, but there was no way that was in my budget as a senior in my undergrad career. Front speakers just make the most sense. And these speakers are the best phone speakers I've had the opportunity to listen to. My iPad mini's speakers are just a tad better, but then again...it's not a phone. I've been happy with the pep of this phone. I use it mainly for Google Voice, calls, emails, light web browsing, and random apps. I've never felt frustrated with the speed. It's not sluggish, but it's also not the zippiest.There are some odd things about this phone that will take getting used to since coming over from the Samsung Galaxy world. Some of these things could be unique to my individual phone, so don't be quick to dismiss this phone when considering a new one.CONS:1. The touch buttons on the bottom of the screen (you know, the menu, home, and back buttons) never lit up from day one. Not a biggy. My thumb quickly memorized where they were. Is this just me?2. No navigational GPS. :( No fix for this one other than to buy a Garmin.3. About once a month the screen will behave all screwy and not listen to my thumb. For example, it will show my open apps, and when I try to swipe to close apps it disappears back to the home screen or a recent app. It sometimes does this without me even touching the screen. This problem is temporarily fixed by locking and unlocking the screen. Very temporary, though.4. Call volume is quiet even at full volume. I fix that by putting on speaker phone. Problem solved.5. The camera is absolutely AWFUL. My first smartphone in 2010 had a better camera. It has no LED to light a dark place. Don't even bother taking pictures at night. I've gotten around this problem by appreciating what's in front of me in the moment. So perhaps this phone has done me a huge favor...PROS:1. The phone has never locked up. I have never removed the battery to hard reset it.2. One charge has lasted me up to FOUR whole days of use. With average use I charge it after two full days. Impressive!3. WiFi range is excellent. It is always connected when I unlock the screen.4. This phone (actually this version of Android) has an auto turn on option. I turn off my phone at night to conserve power, not that I need to with the great battery life, and it turns itself on in the morning so my alarm goes off without worry.5. Solid construction. I have butter fingers, and it's surviving quite impressively without a case.6. The dual SIM feature is perfect. I'm on my last month with AT&T; and am giving H2O Wireless a try. I currently run both services at the same time to see how H2O compares. By the way, H2O uses AT&T;'s network, so coverage should be similar if not the same. We'll see.7. The screen is beautiful. Yeah, it's not a retina display, but I still stand by the Dash Music 4.0's screen brightness and image quality.8. NO BLOATWARE. It's pretty much the stock version of Android 4.2.2. Great for those who are OCD with organization. :)Overall, I would recommend this to a friend if they were in a pinch. If you DO have the funds to buy a Samsung or HTC, etc. they might have more of the features you want.

The sound quality is good, it's a good size, it was a good price.  All I wanted was a simple phone and nothing fancy.However, I have been plagued with Chinese spam apps since I got this thing.  They pop up constantly and install themselves even after I've uninstalled them.  I am certain this is not my doing, as the only thing I've put on this phone is the most popular Stopwatch app from google here and I read no reviews of anyone saying they got spammed as a result of this app.  I do not have a data plan and have the data settings as off.  I have used my home wifi on this phone only once to check my email, and discovered I don't like using the internet with a phone so didn't even open any messages, so I'm certain this didn't come from browsing on the internet either.I did some research and found out that there are lots of unlocked phones that end up pre-installed with spam apps.  I can not get rid of these things.  Chinese browsers, Chinese porn, Chinese dating apps.The phone (I'm assuming because of the apps) also seems to send \"phone home\" texts, and so I receive 15+ messages a day from +1121611611 saying \"Error Invalid Number.
