Almost decided to cancel order, but then a few days later received the phone with all that was mentioned in product description. Phone was dirty, it looked like someone stripped a couple of screws in battery compartment, probably to give the impression that the unit was refurbished, which is not possible to confirm unless you are a technician to open it up and view it apart. I had to disinfect it a couple of times with wipe, due to all the dirt on it an oily residue both inside and out. Unit is working OK, but battery is not lasting as long as expected. Not worth the trouble to send it back and wait for another phone, needed it for an emergency that came up when previous phone's screen suddenly stopped working. I'll update this later after a couple of months.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "not good people", "Author": "hartobip", "ReviewID": "R2GQ32GH6C45P6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the product was good and i thought the service was good but when i asked for my money back they said they would but never did.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a matter of luck I guess...", "Author": "Estebandido", "ReviewID": "R1RK948BDTAV1Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "These phones tend to work fine for people; not so well for others.The first one I had lasted very long.
