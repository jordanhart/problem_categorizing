The condition made it seemed not even used, it just has like 2 scratches on the screen and they are not even bad. The phone deal is better than I thought, 150 for an out of contract iphone, can't get better than that anywhere. Thank you again amazon!P.S. To answer the questions of the people wondering I'm sure, the phone is not unlocked and you must do it yourself. It is very easy so just look it up online.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Shocked, shocked I tell you!", "Author": "Mr James", "ReviewID": "R27TZEWBGOKTQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not be any happier with this purchase. I bought a used, good condition iphone 3 for about $100. I wasn't worried about the purchase as I knew if the phone was bad Amazon would take it back no questions asked, but it was perfect. It came in the original box with all the accessories, (earbuds, cords, charger, manual, sim tool etc) The cords and buds were brand new, still wrapped in plastic and the phone was as close to new as you can get. Not a scratch on it. I had to charge the battery overnight, as it was completely dead, but after that I ran through the set up process and everything is working perfectly. I synced my gmail, itunes, contacts, calendars, reminders etc and it all went flawlessly. I love this phone. My only problem is now that I know how great iphones are, and that I can get a good deal thru Amazon, I'm already thinking about upgraded to a 4 the generation, or maybe even the 5. Anyway, I'm very happy with this purchase, and if you're looking for a cheap no contract phone, you won't find a better deal.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the phone", "Author": "123", "ReviewID": "R6VP3WS80459I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is in very good condition.

Gadal", "ReviewID": "R2WAS3ZHHOUC4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never really liked cell phones until I got an iPhone.  To me, they were a painful necessity, that felt more like an electronic leash than a useful tool.This all changed when I got my iPhone 3G.  Here was a tool, that had functional access to the internet, and email.  In addition, there was every kind of app imaginable, from entertainment, weather, photography, social media, you name it.I found myself using my phone more and more, and not to make phone calls.  In fact, being able to use this thing as a phone is just a bonus.I've been extremely happy with my iPhone, and am writing this review on the 3G as sort of a thank you.  The iPhone has become an integral part of my life, just as owning a computer did.After owing this item for 3 happy years, it's time for me to upgrade.  I will miss my 3G, but am sure that the iPhone 4S will more than fill the void.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "THIS PHONE IS LOCKED", "Author": "vic", "ReviewID": "R14BEG6Z02X664", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "PLEASE , Don't buy this phone if U are looking for unlocked phone.

Although it did arrive before Christmas it was missing the power button.  I was upset because my daughter could not use this phone, it was described as new and the missing button made me believe otherwise.  Had to pay to have it shipped back for a replacement.  This time the phone quit charging and the where the speaker for you ear is located the mesh screen was pushed up into the phone.  We could never use the phone because it would not charge or turn on for me.  Could not get the phone to work so I paid out of pocket yet again to have it shipped back although I  was not aware until this company informed me that apple discontinued this model and it will not update on the apple website either. So why was it for sale to begin with? They are supposed to refund my purchase price but are now threatening me with a 50 % restocking fee and also accused me of tampering with the phone which I would  not waste my time doing something like that in the first place.  This was not the original agreement we came to in the first place so I am really not sure why I have to pay a penalty for faulty equipment.  I have never experienced such poor customer service through amazon before and I do not recommend spending your hard earned money here.  You may end up as disappointed as I have been with this company, I will never purchase anything through Tronixsquare ever again!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good", "Author": "menlla", "ReviewID": "R23UQRLM1ELPTN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "battery pop out a month after I bought this item. could not return because I already mailed it to my brother outside US", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "thank you", "Author": "breyanna", "ReviewID": "R33VPBMXKRLPHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you very much I really enjoy the phone and have a bless day and new year and joy yourself", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Iphone 3 product", "Author": "not a domestic goddess \"DLR\"", "ReviewID": "R21NUNQXB5IUDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered an iPhone 3 and it works great, my wife has iPhone 4s for work and #3 still has same great features even though an older version.
