{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My expectations were very high, and a bit misplaced", "Author": "Clicktician \"Paul\"", "ReviewID": "R1NURFJEXSK434", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Xperia X2 specs are impressive. Sony has crammed a lot into this little phone. I've used it for a little over a week.Pros:+ I like the form factor. But I appreciate business-like phones with no unnecessary do-dads. Smaller than my Nokia N900.+ The keyboard is wonderful. I buy a new phone every 6 months and most have keyboards. This one is the best. Numbers are not across the top qwerty row, but rather they are clustered in a phone key pad arrangement. You'll immediately get used to it and makes for a lot less stretching of your fingers. Enter key is very large for a phone.+ Headphone jack. Stereo speakers. Everything sounds great. Works with my Nokia, Jabra, and Plantronics stereo bluetooth headsets.+ Home screen has several \"panels\" which change the home screen completely. These changes can be based on an event like time of day. I like the SPB shell panel the best, but then I'm used to SPB and I like densely packed home screens.+ I installed Opera Mobile, Mocha VNC, WMWifi, and CorePlayer which are essentials for me. All work.+ Phone calls are quite clear even on speaker phone.Cons:- Have to remove the battery frequently because the phone locks up.- Came with a Euro wall adapter for the charger. No USA adapter.- Performance on AT&T; 3g network is poor. Internet services hang and often the phone has to be powered down to recover. All of the smartphones I've owned have significantly better internet performance on AT&T; 3g.- Media Player couldn't play any of my mobile video collection (divix, mp4, mpg1). It only recognized .wmv and was unable to play that without serious stutter and hang.- CorePlayer, of course, could play everything in my mobile video collection, but it strained to play anything but the mpg1 files (400x240 var bit rate). Dropped frames and video tearing were the most common problems on divix and mp4.- Email does not alert when the phone is in standby or locked. Only when you wake it, does it discover e-mails have arrived and then it plays the sound and updates the screen with the e-mail count. For me, it must alert on any message just like it does with an incoming call.Conclusion:Yesterday, I ordered an HTC HD2. The Xperia X2 is unusable for me. When the HD2 comes in, I'll give the Xperia away to a colleague who just makes calls, but goes through a lot of phones because his toddlers play with them and drool eventually kills the phones.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Much better after the software updates!", "Author": "H. Doshi", "ReviewID": "RCRU2CYN8OUXA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was one of the \"early adopters\" for the X2 when it was released...so my experience with the xperia x2 has been sort of love-hate.The phone itself is very beautiful and stylish and when it works, is a joy to use. However, in the initial weeks of its release, it was quite un-usable. It would \"lock up\" approximately 10-15 times every day necessitating either a \"soft reset\" or removal-reinsertion of the battery to boot it up again. Needless to say, the initial months with xperia x2 were quite a challenge. To top it off was sony ericssons customer service which had a bi-polar attitude towards the phone: all the issues that I pointed out to them were either \"known, existing bugs or beta versions that they were (supposedly) working on\" or \"one time thing correctable by a software re-installation\". Neither of this obviously solved the problem.However, after 2 software updates, the phone has become much more stable and does not lock up quite as much and is much more usable. It delivers everything you would expect from a smart-phone and more.So currently, this is what I can probably safely say for the phone:1. Pros:-Full keyboard, very user-friendly and keys have great tactile responsiveness. If you have massive fingers, you might find the keyboard slightly difficult - but not much.-Great camera, pretty much top of the line with 8.1 megs. Decent, crisp pictures. Like the touch-based focus. Decent flash.-Acceptable speakers for media - can work better though. I installed SRS wow (with a little bit of registry tweaking) and the speakers now rock!-Direct TV connectivity - though I rarely use this feature. Still for pictures and videos, I find this feature useful.-The famous SE panels - especially the tilewave panel is awesome. Can be a resource hog, but after the software updates, it has been running much more efficiently.-Windows 6.5.3 based, very customizable user interface.-Very good call quality (this can be network dependent though).-Decent battery life2) Cons:-Somewhat slow processor; I have used of the newer phones especially the snapdragon based ones and the difference is noticeable here. However, performance is still acceptable in my opinion.-Locking up: 2 SOFTWARE updates and this phone now works like a charm; however the initial months of utter frustration are still somewhat fresh memories..:-(-Touch screen not quite as responsive as you might see in an iphone or newer android phones - however I have found this to be acceptable and not a deal-breaker.- A year down the line and the software still needs some tweaking.And before you ask it, windows mobile 7 will never debut on the xperia x2.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "It 's suck !", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "RFEBTWRYNBK0I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone last 5 months ago. after about 4 months, the window is really slow , let me compare you with something .Have you ever compared using between computer pentium 4 and pentium 2 or 1 ? ya, like that . I don't know why ! I do not strongly recommend this window phone . When I call the sony customer service , they ask me to update the software , and I did . fortunately, the phone works again ,and it becomes really good and really fast , but now the window is super super slow again and I have to reinstall the software all over again. I don't know why!I search in the setting to wipe out the softwares which are wasting my phone memory, but no avail. Do I have to do like that every 1 or 2 months ? That is a really really mess for me . I am going to change this handset as soon as I got chance . :(", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "X2 Rocks !!!
