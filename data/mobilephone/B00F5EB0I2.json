I had honestly never heard of this phone until just about a week ago. I was searching, quite frankly, for a smaller phone than my Galaxy S3. The Galaxy is a decent phone and has received many accolades. However, I wanted something easier to travel with yet was hoping not to take a step backwards. I also wanted something that offered a qwerty keyboard. I kept going to the Photon Q. However, poor battery life and the inability to remove it kept me away. Enter the LG Mach.A 4 inch display made it the same size as the iPhone 5, which is what I wanted. I also wanted Android. I simply cannot limit myself to the Apple world. I read some reviews and found a great deal and dove in.First off, the display is beautiful! The specs don't do it justice. It's an 800 by 480 display, which sounds rather pedestrian. Until you realize it's an IPS display. Colors are vivid. Details are crisp. Lovely. Now, and here's the real surprise and what blew me away. This little guy is blazing fast! Equipped with a dual core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor running at 1.2 ghz and offering up a full 1 gig of RAM, this phone runs as smoothly as glass and, yes, far smoother than my Galaxy S3. This couldn't be possible right? Well, I assure you, this phone is faster than the S3. Running the same applications it's really no contest. Where the S3 will stutter running something like Facebook or even a texting app like Handcent, the Mach runs them silky smooth with zero lag. Now, I'm not a gamer so I cannot attest to its gaming performance although I'd be confident it will run most smoothly.The camera, while only 5MP, does a decent job and it shoots video at 1080p. The Galaxy wins here, as it probably should. Multimedia runs well and LG did a very solid job with the stock music player. It mates to my stereo bluetooth headset flawlessly and sounds excellent.Call quality is crisp and clear, if a bit bright or harsh. Frankly I prefer that over the Galaxy's somewhat muddy call quality. Reception has been solid and I am fortunate enough to live in an area that gets Sprint's 4G LTE. The phone runs Super fast on LTE and even surprisingly well on 3G.Simply put, if you're intrigued by the iPhone 5 because of its size and form factor but just can't break from the freedom of an Android OS, this is your phone. Hands down. It runs Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 and likely won't get updated unless you root it. I'm perfectly fine with ICS and it runs so darn smoothly I wouldn't want to change the OS.A pleasantly surprised 5 star recommendation and kudos to LG for packing so much punch into what has been slotted as a mid-line device. You've earned a customer!", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F5EB0I2"}}
