Low pricing - barely above 100 bucks.2. Functionality - it has almost everything other hi end smart phone has.3. Dual Sim - very few smartphones provide Dual Sim at this price point4. Form Factor - cigarette box size with fully rounded corners. I would have pick up Samsung if LG can't offer me any model with rounded corners.5. If You Don't Fussy - on its 3 mega camera and its screen resolution (compare to other hi end model like Samsung Note 2)", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$115.99", "Features": "LG Optimus L3 E405F Dual SIM 3G Wi-Fi, Android 2.3 Factory Unlocked", "Name": "LG Optimus L3 E405F Black Dual Sim, 3MP, 3G , WIFI Unlocked Mobile Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410pXCo6kdL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BAZV88W"}}
