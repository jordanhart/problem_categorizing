{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is the perfect Smart Phone for my husband!", "Author": "Cheryl Higer", "ReviewID": "R1Z0O23CU70FIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We wanted to upgrade my husband's phone to a smart phone so he would have features that would make his driving to work easier.  The purchase offer through Verizon made our decision easier.  The phone was easy to download programs to.....even my poor husband (who by no means is a techy).....could handle the process.  This is a smaller version of the standard S4 and fits nicely in the pocket.I would recommend this phone for those that want all their information at the touch of a finger.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "David Link", "ReviewID": "R2JWWTPR6WD52I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had a Samsung Droid Charge for the last couple of years, which gave excellent service, but was starting to show its age, I was anxious to try the S4. Out of the box, the phone is small and sleek, which I really like. With the Otter Box case, it is the same size as my old phone without a case.The new menu layout is much easier to navigate than the previous generation. The phone responds quickly, and connects fast. The screen colors and definition are vibrant and clear. Battery life is a definite improvement over previous models, and I don't feel like I have to keep charging it to get through a typical day.All in all, very happy with this phone, and highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "First smartphone beyond iPhones", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RJX4U6WDCDE89", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Android smartphone. Warning: this is only my second day owning so I can't say much about durability, etc.I've been interested in the Android phones for a bit (usually as a casual observer). The ever-increasing size of almost all non-Apple smartphones has been a bit of a turn-off, though. I was disappointed enough when I had to give up my slim little \"dumb phone\" for the larger iPhones, and I've been consistently surprised when a friend pulls out his/her new \"phablet\" to show it off -- I keep thinking of a skit about  huge smartphones a few years ago. The S4 Mini is extremely nice with respect to this -- it's fast and responsive but still a manages a reasonable size. I shoved it inside an Otterbox 'commuter' and it still fits in my pocket well.My version has 16G built-in storage (expandable via micro-sd), 1.5G of ram, and a nice 8mega-pixel camera on the back (1.9 on the front). Battery life is fine so far -- a charge lasts all day, perhaps 40% left by the end. I do tend to \"data ration\" -- I've survived on a 250MB/mo plan for years and years, so I largely keep my high-data activities restricted to internet connections when I'm at home or in a coffee shop (I don't stream music/video on the bus).Screen resolution is entirely reasonable for the size. If I'm on wifi at home I'll surf the web a bit, use youtube, etc, and this phone has been great for that. I like that the battery is removable, I like that apps tell me what they need to access when I install them, I like that I can very closely monitor my data usage (all unlike my old iphone).Haven't dropped it yet, so can't say much about durability. As noted above, I stuck it in an Otterbox commuter, and just ordered the Techpro ballistic glass screen protector. I like my phones to survive a lot. Aside from small accidents, I want my phone to survive if I'm in a car accident or wipe out skiiing or something similar -- worst possible time for a phone to break. (Whether I have reception is another question...)Two days in, I love this phone -- the size is great, the speed is great. Hopefully it gives me a some good years of service.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "s4 mini", "Author": "jeff", "ReviewID": "R2Y792K88XPHN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone small not as many features as the s4 but still a great phone I like it a lot", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect size and price!", "Author": "Kristen Bush", "ReviewID": "R3N8KRV0HM3X2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband's S4 is just too big for my hand so the mini was the perfect choice for me!
