I do not see alot of reviews on this phone, but there are a few with the same complaint I attributed to user error. I have been corrected. After reading more it appears the entire Ruby series of phones turns itself off on a steady basis. It is not due to a software update being needed. We will be returning this phone.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Complicated -- all I really need is a good phone.", "Author": "Richard Brooks", "ReviewID": "R3EMVQHGYTU7VO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought there would be more carryover from the Samsung Convoy.I miss the flashlight.The owner's manual is 190 pages.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good phone", "Author": "jack wolpa", "ReviewID": "R1MPPC62KCUDNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "so far I am enjoying this phone. It is heavier than any other flip phone that I have used. I do believe that it isa rugged phone.

We like the ruggedness of the phone.  My husband has big hands, and this phone is easy for him to use.  The only thing we do not like is the ringtone volume is not very loud.  Even with it adjusted to its highest level, it is sometimes hard to hear.  There are a limited number of ringtones available on this phone, but that is not a huge drawback.  Overall, this is a good, tough phone for a man who does not want a delicate phone.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung usually good", "Author": "Andrea", "ReviewID": "R28QWZBSLC9DOF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Did not meet my expectations......
