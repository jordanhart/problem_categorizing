Being a techie, curiosity always drives me to try new products. Even those with a pedigree such as this phone. But one must consider this.. most of those 'name' brand phones are built by the same companies offering these knock offs. This phone is a carbon copy of a SGS4,\\S3m however no case will fit it, as the volume button is slightly higher then the original. Other then that...I have had many, many cell phones. But this is probably the ONLY product that made me say ' Larry. This is awesome. 'It has worked great. and setting it up using a SIM card through straight talk was a breeze. It is unlocked. And functional.The call volume is either not so good, or that is my hearing loss that I gained while in the Navy.The phone works great. It wasnt until It got dropped from 4 inches above a wood floor, and shattered like a mirror, that I ever had a complaint.Parts. dont even bother. It is cheaper buying a new phone.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "POOR DISPLAY/RESOLUTION-WVGA & TOUCH SCREEN ISSUES", "Author": "Charles N.", "ReviewID": "R3RJXXHO836P9L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was disappointed to have the touch screen malfunction within the third day of my usage. the resolution is poor but its a WVGA type so I don't expect much. for a $127 phone one may expect something better in terms of durabilty.

I has great battery life, I don't charge it over the weekend and it still has a good charge on Monday. I use wifi mainly so it is very fast. It has lots of working memory, not so much in on phone storage but the SD card helps out. It came with a screen protector and a extra case back that has a flap that protects the screen when not in use. I did find that this flap covers the microphone if you just fold it back when you use the phone. It came with a hands free ear plugs and a home charger. I use it with Metro PCS and it started right up with their SIM card.There are no extras that you can purchase but it has button location and case size that is very close to the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active so if you want a silicone case cover it might work with some mods. Currently have not found a source for battery replacement. But should be able to get one of the battery only websites to get one.The \"manual\" for the phone is of no use. So you need to be willing to spend some time to learn the features and how to use it.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Deal!", "Author": "Dana", "ReviewID": "R1HEEZVW967SF3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This device didn't meet my expectations at all!
