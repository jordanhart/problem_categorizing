{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's the best that that Boost has put out Yet.", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R3HGY5SXJQSQI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this phone and was choosing between this and the HTC One SV 4LTE. Even though that this phone is considerably more than the HTC, I still went for it. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy Prevail (It was the first touch screen Android Smartphone that Boost offered in my market). So of course the difference is huge. But I am extremely satisfied with this phone. I mainly chose this one for the screen size (bigger) and it's 8mp(bigger) camera instead of the 5mp that HTC offers and the fact that the Samsung has twice the RAM (2gb vs 1gb)and twice the ROM (16gb vs 8gb) that the HTC offers and a higher dual core processor speed (1.5ghz vs 1.2ghz. Plus everybody that I know, and I mean everybody that I know (100% of them), that has a Samsung Galaxy sIII simply just loves their phone and I have not heard even one complaint of the 15 people or so that I know own one(on different cell providers).  However if Samsung had made this phone flash player capable I would have no quibbles. That fact is though, I have not needed it anyway. On the downside this phone does burn up some battery but then I've been playing video and using the battery like crazy since I've had it without one single freeze I might add or without having to download even an app. But the HTC offer's incredible battery life that at this stage I'd say it's a willing trade off for me. If you are pinching pennies this is probably not the phone for you. However if you want the best that Boost currently has to offer, then here it is.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish I had been able to actually use this great phone", "Author": "Avarie", "ReviewID": "R2VP66Y1QXLFM6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I rated this product low because of Boost, NOT because of Amazon.I ordered this phone from Amazon because of the $50 price difference from everywhere else I looked. I went to both Best Buy and RadioShack in order to see if they would be willing to match the price--but naturally, there wasn't a store that could beat Amazon. You will not find this phone anywhere else for the great price. You get a lot of phone for a low cost.Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with Boost. I was told by both their website and customer service (an actual person, not just a recording) that the area I live in would be able to get Boost service. However, I was provided the wrong information. When I tried to activate the phone, I found out that my house was a dead zone. Customer service didn't bother to tell me that is why the phone wasn't activating until AFTER I had paid for the first month of service, and now they are having me jump through hoops in order to get a refund for my money. It has been a couple of days now and Boost has been of no help, telling me they do not have enough information to give me a refund (even though I have provided them with all the information they have asked me for).I called Amazon customer service to explain the situation and once again, they did not fail to impress. The Amazon employee apologized for all the inconvenience, told me there would not be a problem returning the phone, and that I would be receiving my FULL refund as soon as the phone was received at Amazon.The customer service Amazon provides is impeccable. I feel bad that I had to return the phone as Boost's customer service has been extremely disappointing, but Amazon makes up for that poor service. Overall the phone itself is great, but make sure that Boost has you fully covered before purchasing any of their products.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Very Good Boost 4g LTE Phone", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2UR2P1ES5GI3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung SIII is a very good phone. It is one of two outstanding 4g LTE phones now available for Boost . Boost's LG F7 is a similar size with an equally large screen and the LG F7 matches the Samsung's quality.The higher price of the Samsung SIII may be justified for people who take lots of photos. The Samsung has a better camera than other Boost phones.Another advantage of the SIII over the LG F7 is that cases for the SIII are available everywhere. Amazon sells both the standard battery and extended life batteries. Many local \"Fix In An Hour\" shops carry replacement parts for the SIII.Lastly, the huge popularity of the SIII means that it will be easy to sell or trade when you buy yout next phone.Battery life is good if you disable \"locations\" and \"Google Now\" and turn OFF 3g data, wi-fi, gps and bluetooth until you need them.The Boost 3g network reaches 80% of American homes and its 4g LTE network reaches 30% of American homes. The coverage map at the Boost Mobile website enables you to zoom in and see the signal coverage for your neighborhood before you buy a Boost phone. Remember that many areas have ZERO Boost coverage.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "No ifs, ands, or buts. Best device for Boost Mobile to date.", "Author": "Zer0", "ReviewID": "R18C36DUGH0QQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background: I (very) recently upgraded to this from an HTC One SV on a warranty swap. I have only had it for three days as of this writing.As far as phone usage, I do a lot. Lots of different apps, games, streaming, reading documents, editing documents, texting... it'd probably be easier to count the things I don't do with a smartphone now.First Impressions...Holy *expletive*... No, seriously. There is a reason that the Galaxy S III stole the thunder and managed to be the flagship that stole the iPhone's dominance. Even in the presence of devices like the S 4, Note 2(and 3), the new HTC One, and even the iPhone 5/S/C, this thing is a standout device all around. The combination of ~2GB of RAM, 1.5GHz dual core and 16GB of internal storage gives this thing plenty of ammo to hang with the big boys even now. And even with all this, the factory battery managed to beat my initial expectations given its modest specs. The power saving features on Android 4.1.2 that it came with have also helped to eke out more hours from the battery, indicating some smart coding from the Android team and also on Samsung's release of the kernel for the phone.First, The positives:+ Good god, that screen. First and foremost compared to everything else I have personally used, I can definitely see the justification for the burgeoning category of \"phablet\" phones out there. The extra real estate really does help.+ As a side effect of the screen, I can now type pretty comfortably even in portrait mode, which is something I couldn't do with the One SV or even the S2 I used to have.+ Multi-Window. I really wish this was available earlier on for multi-core phones, since it makes too much sense to do so, but is now much more practical because of the generous display size. Very simply, it enables you to have two different apps running concurrently on the same screen, and allowing you to resize each on the fly. Gimmick for some (which you can turn on/off as you wish), but I like it a lot.+ Curiously, the fresh phone seems to be doing better getting a signal, and hopping on the 4G LTE here in Mesa and Phoenix. Not yet stable, but speed tests show lots of promise. :)+ Unlike a fair number of HTC phones out there, including the two I've used thus far, this phone does respect my desire to NOT have *expletive* auto-correct.With that said, there are some down sides that may or may not be relevant to some, but were things that I did notice for my personal experience with the phone thus far.- Enabling power save does periodically cause some noticeable and inconveniencing input lag, particularly when running some of the demanding games available. this is particularly troublesome for games that do require precise timing, like music games.- Odd as it is to say, but the HTC One SV I had to swap out of never did freeze up on an application bad enough to actually force the phone to restart. Perhaps some better ANR handling is in order.- Despite my disdain of AutoCorrect, I did appreciate that the OneSV's default keyboard did at least provide an MSWord-style spellcheck option. This I could live with. Thus far, I don't see a way to enable that functionality on the S 3; and if someone does know how *WITHOUT* re-enabling auto-correct, please say so.- A select few apps that have consistently worked well for me with prior phones, including the S 2 and the OneSV are not working on the S3. :(- Without a hard case to protect the phone, the rear camera's lens does kind of jut out conspicuously, and could get easily struck or scratched. I am looking forward to getting my extended battery soon to remedy that situation.- On the S2, one thing I did appreciate was a shortcut to the task manager that allowed me to selectively or simply \"kill all\" running apps. However, there is no easy way to access it on the S 3, much less make a shortcut to it that I have been able to do thus far.And, well... what's a \"good and bad\" without being able to have a section for the Ugly? So, here it is.~ Despite being a significant successor to the S2 in a lot of regards, the cameras (both front and rear facing) haven't been seemingly touched at all for any kind of improvement to either their sensors or pixel quality.~ Thus far, despite having what should be significantly more power in its specs than the OneSV, framerate in games like the Gameloft MLP game really does seem to suffer.~ As of yet, I have been unsuccessful in getting the phone to even finish a single run of 3DMark for Android. And this concerns me...**Update**My first one must have been defective. The replacement S3 has definitely performed much better, and more representative of a flagship phone. It still can't complete a run of 3DMark though... which at least from my searching seems to be an issue for everyone that doesn't have the \"international\" version of the Galaxy S3, regardless of kernel or any mods done.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Cell Phone I've Ever Owned - Fast 4G, But Get The 3-Day 7000mah Battery", "Author": "Jay Jackson", "ReviewID": "R3A0M2HJD5JH93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Boost customer for years. Generally, I find their service to be solid, so long as I don't need to call customer service. Good news is, I've rarely had the need to deal with them directly. I think customer satisfaction was a casualty of Shrinkage, but it's a fair trade for 40 bucks a month.I've never had an issue with Boost's coverage; no dropped calls, though data was occasionally sluggish. Now with this new Galaxy S3, my Boost experience is the best it's ever been. This phone is flat out amazing. Web and email load fast. Apps download quickly. Menus are snappy and responsive. The phone is just a pleasure to work with, all the way around. It's clear why this is Samsung's flagship smartphone. It's just that good.The camera is outstanding. There's virtually no delay after snapping a pic. Flicking through the galleries is equally a pleasure and silky smooth. The processor in this thing is clearly more than capable of handling the OS and multiple tasks seamlessly. I haven't seen a hiccup or glitch yet.The screen itself is outstanding. Outdoors, it does need to be brightened up a tad, but nothing unexpected. Everything is vibrant and crystal clear. Saturation is rich. Touch responsiveness is very accurate. Actually, the keyboard is very easy to work with. I seem to be  pecking away with better accuracy than any of my other phones, with fewer messed up words and garbledy-gook.The body is quite thin and a bit of an adjustment, at least for me. But I got a ZeroLemon 7000mAh Extended Battery that supposedly lasts for days, so that will add some thickness. But I don't mind. I prefer having a little more to hang onto, and would rather not be on perpetual battery watch. Well worth the trade off in my world.This phone has way more features and capabilities than I even understand. I've decided to leave the screen tips active for now so that I can be reminded of all this phone can do. But it's all very inviting and easy to learn; just a lot to take in all at once. But for sure I won't get bored with it anytime soon. This phone will keep me captivated for a while, and for sure I'll be learning new things it can do on a daily basis. But I look forward to that; it's the fun part of getting a great phone like this one.The Samsung Galaxy S3 isn't cheap, but is well worth the purchase price, in my opinion. This is easily the best phone I've ever owned. Very happy with it indeed and glad I decided to treat myself to such a great phone. It's a whole new experience to the clunkers I'm used to.

Initially, the phone worked great. I'm a Note II user and my fiance wanted a phone that worked similar but on Boost.After 3 months of use, the charging port failed. So we did what any consumer would and sent it to the manufacturer for repair. After ten days, Samsung returned the product but nothing was fixed. Samsung IT decided the charging port was lifted from the motherboard and the cost of repair exceeded the value of the phone. What was most disturbing is the device was in excellent condition, never dropped, always used the provided Samsung charger, never forced the micro USB in, or yanked it out. Samsung didn't care though. They didn't even bother to offer some sort of discount on a new phone, considering it was obvious the phone was well taken care of.A company that does not show regard for it's consumer doesn't deserve business.Summary:Beware, save your $300.00 and do not buy this phone.

It's a great improvement over my galaxy rush. Love the 4.8 screen. Would have preferred the galaxy s4 but boost does not offer it as of yet. Strange how boost offers the IPhone 5c and 5s, but not the galaxy s4 which has been out almost a year. Even cricket and virgin mobile offer the galaxy S4. Simply Baffling. Anyway, battery life is not bad but could be better. Ended up  buying a laza 4200 mah battery extender and now get a full day of charge with heavy usage. Cant say anything bad other than there is no wireless tethering on this phone, but it can be fixed by simply rooting it, which I might consider doing once and if the android kit kat update is ever offered for this phone.

Well, the day the phone arrived I went up to Radio Shack to see if I could get the phone turned on with the carrier that I had at the time, which was Boost Mobile. Upon further investigation I was told that it was a Virgin Mobile phone and then I was told that because I didn't buy the phone at Radio Shack I couldn't get it activated there. So, I decided to go to Best Buy and they were more than willing to help me. I really hadn't planned on making the switch, but I had to have this phone. So, I took the chance and switched to Virgin Mobile. I only had to pay for the plan and that was it. This is why I love non contract companies, switching over is easy and hassle free.

First, Samsung's \"touchwiz\" actually takes features away from android making it nearly as uncustomizable as an iphone.  Second, google play services pings the server thousands of times a day which makes the battery drain so fast you basically have to leave it plugged in nonstop (It wont even last a day on full charge).  Third, my rear facing camera developed dead pixels in it after less than 4 months of use so every time I take a picture I have 3 random blue dots on it.  Fourth, the samsung easy uploader program kies doesn't work well AND disables android easy uploader for mac so the first time I connected it to my mac I had to spend a few hours trying to figure this out and do the work around.
