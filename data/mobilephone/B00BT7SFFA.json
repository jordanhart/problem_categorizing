This phone is incredibly well made and very very fast and can easily be operated with one hand.The earphones do not fit my ears touch nor will they fit anybody else. But again the phone is superb", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "julie", "ReviewID": "R2NN2Y68LPUNE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very elegant looking phone.

It was delivered ahead of time & in expected order.In a nutshell, I highly recommend this buy.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Big", "Author": "John Profanchik", "ReviewID": "R1GXETSRI72UGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have never held a big white one in your hand, well ladies this is the phone for you.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BT7SFFA"}}
