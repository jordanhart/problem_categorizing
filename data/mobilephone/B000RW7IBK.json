Knott", "ReviewID": "R3RQDUZP9I10RQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this phone (T-Mobile DASH) for a year. Ever since upgrading to WM6, it has been miserable. The phone has to be restarted with battery and SIM taken out at least 4-5 times a day. If there are any third party apps, it gets worse. It won't start with the SD card in it so I have given up using it as a music player which I did from the beginning. All of these issues are documented on the various support boards including HTCs.I live and breathe by my phone and email capability and this one is no longer dependable. T-Mobile replaced it but the same issue is happening and they can't fix it. I love the form factor of this phone and what it could do - it just doesn't. I will be moving to another device in February as I have to have a phone that works all the time.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "GOOD CELL PHONE", "Author": "Ingrid Delgado \"Ingrid\"", "ReviewID": "R1UGTLLYRRTE7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not have much time with my phone, but my friends who know more than I do about cell phones, I say it's an excellent phone. has camera and the photos are clear and beautiful.

I'm not sure if this is common, but it the silver faceplate on mine came off rather easily. I've fixed it with superglue, but still a possible manufacturer problem.2. The Jogger Bar (a touch sensitive bar on the side of the phone) is nearly invisible to those who didn't know it existed in the first place. If you don't leave the phone locked when you pocket it then it will turn the volume up by itself, call people, answer the phone, etc. This feature can be turned off and that is what I did once I realized how.3. With the text messaging a slip of fingers can cause the type to turn in to Chinese lettering. This happened to me and I spent hours trying to figure out how to fix it the first day I got it. For those of you that have friends and family with this phone and this problem should choose to pop up, all you do is press alt then cap (both in the lower left corner of the keyboard). That changes it back to English or what ever language is set to the device.That's it for the problems, but there are some really nice features I enjoy.1. Texting is set up like chat where you can view previous messages to and from the same person. It really helps after you get in to conversations with 4 or 5 people at a time.2. The screen is very easy to see even outside during the day.3. The back is rubberized and it doesn't slide easily off of dashboards.These are just a few of the Pros and Cons of the HTC Dash.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Looks nice and windows is great BUT", "Author": "Katz", "ReviewID": "R39CWAKM18CR5H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone yesterday, i bought it here in amazon from this seller.It looks nice, the phone is clean and brand new. The first thing i check is the wifi and it is working great. The camera is only 1MP so its only good if there is light since there is no flash. Instruction included, battery and charger. I was tryin to find if i can put the memory card but i cant find where i can put it. If you will start workin on the phone, it is a little slow like 1 sec delay before it respond so i dunno if a memory card can help that problem.

I use it only for the basics: texting, phone calls & syncing to my Outlook calendar.  It freezes up a lot & shuts down on a fully charged battery at least once a day. I can't imagine using this for emails and the web.  There isn't a way to delete alarms,if you decide to change the time, it will go off every time you've ever programmed. I had to turn the alarm sound to silent, which means I can't use it at all anymore. It stopped reading my memory card for no reason for months and then one day recognized it again.

What more can I ask for?Other phones with slide keyboard (which have better \"looks\") won't do what this phone with the integrated keyboard does: the capability to type with just one hand.I'm really happy with this phone, won't change it until is dead, it has ALL the features I need from a phone, all of them.", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "great phone!", "Author": "J.Spence", "ReviewID": "RFQY872XGNIYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ive had it for a month and it works great didnt come with the case so now its all scratched up great battery life great music player great texting loud enough speakers didnt get to go on the internet much because wifi not as strong as a laptop....", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super smartphone!!", "Author": "Nestor A.

My company's policy for synching with Exchange server did not allow synching with Nokia/Symbian OS, so I needed to get another WindowsMobile phone.  I didn't want to spend much money, and decided on this one.  It is a good one.  Synchs very well with Exchange/Outlook with WindowsMobile 5.  Synching with other email services also OK.  Not as many apps for this as with iPhone or Android, but some decent ones.  Couple of things to consider on the negative side.  1) battery life not great.  I am a heavy user, and most days I have to charge during the day or it will shut off, 2) this model also known as \"T-Mobile Dash\"...the model that was sent to me from Unlockedcellphonekings was actually a T-Mobile model.  Not a huge deal, but because it was not technically \"unlocked\", I had to replace all the t-mobile settings with at&t;'s, which took quite a while as I had to search help blogs online to figure out all the correct settings.  I recommend this phone, but would also recommend that, if you order it and it get the T-Mobile branded model, send it back and tell them you want the generic HTC-branded one.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "defective", "Author": "Linda R Martin", "ReviewID": "R2FL7FPGW3XA9F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone is totally defective, no blue tooth, no video, camera pics are dark and out of focus, speaker not working well, sound is terrible to hear, and the program is out of date, do not purchase this item", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "sturdy", "Author": "sheri", "ReviewID": "REK3MMK9S26O5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its what i want & need..i'm just learning how to use it!!not to sure on how to make up for storage tho....i need one i can connect staight to my pc withoutmuch hassel..i like this one.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Keisha Vinales", "ReviewID": "R1YH0A5IUF3XAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was skeptical about ordering online but the phone works well.
