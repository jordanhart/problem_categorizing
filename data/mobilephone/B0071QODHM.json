{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great product for the simple phone users.", "Author": "Patrick Weathersby", "ReviewID": "R2VAR2EUJSIB01", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Now this phone might be outdated compared to the phones of today such as the Iphone or the Android, But In my opinion, You don't need your phone to do all of that, If it makes phone calls, and works efficiently, what is more to argue with? Back in 2007 and earlier, this was the phone to have.Perks- It uses windows mobile operating system, It offers the internet browser, Windows media player, Texting is simplified, offers a lot of programs and office tools such as GPS tracking, windows office, organizer tools like setting up appointments and dates on calendars, etc.Disadvantages- It sort of lags when you skip at track on windows media player, it requires a separate cord in order to plug headphones into , meaning you would have to buy it separately instead of coming with the phone or a headphone jack on the phone. It has wifi capability but yet can't connect to wireless routers?Overrall, this is a great phone to have if you want something nice to use casually and if you're on a budget. Its a solid 4 out of 5.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "No contract AT&T; cell phone ready to activate on AT&T; wireless\nExcellent Conditioned Pre-Owned Phone, You Will Be Very Satisfied\nUsed no contract AT&T; Cell Phone\nFull 30 day customer satisfaction warranty\nPlease contact us with any questions and we will reply ASAP", "Name": "Samsung BlackJack II SGH-i617 Red AT&T Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412cU8tD8sL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0071QODHM"}}
