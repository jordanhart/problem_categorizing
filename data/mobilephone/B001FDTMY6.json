{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One Giant Step Forward", "Author": "Scott  Pearson", "ReviewID": "R3CP571H2HGM36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had HTC, other windows operating smart phones. Got rid of them! All lasted less than a year. Bought two of these new from Sprint 2 years ago. I absolutely love it. I believe Jack Bower (24) used the exact same phone in season six! My wife and I direct connect all the time. Check this out. My company, who issues the Motorola Android on the Sprint network for a company phone, when they cannot get to me, they call my personal phone to get through! Phone is rugged, speaker phone is loud, and has a solid feel to it. Easy to operate and read. Battery is two years old and still will last me all day unless I activate my bluetooth. Then it's 8 hours standby, half hour talk time and it's goodbye.One bug is that sometimes when I get another incomming call, the phone just goes blank for 5 seconds, then comes back. It does not power down, it just goes dead and releases both callers. Ask Sprint about this and the told me I need a software update. However, researching this, the last revision software was in 2009 so it was total BS.Just yesterday I dropped this phone. No big deal because I have dropped it so many times before. I called my cell from the work cell and heard it ring. I traced my Sanyo underneath my truck totally submerged in a huge puddle of water!!(Can't make this stuff up). Yes, it rang underwater! However, the sad news is that shortly after, my screen went blank. Took out the battery and now it is sitting in a baggie full of rice (trick to obsorb water in electronics that got wet). Today, the phone still works, outgoing and incoming, but my screen is still blank. Another day in the baggie and if it doesn't come back, I get it repair or buy another one. I called Sprint today and they no longer offer this phone. If you want a no frills phone, just to make calls and direct connect, this is the one!", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Meg", "ReviewID": "RF3MG587M4HE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you.

When I found the lost phone, I went to the Sprint store to get service put back where it was. The service representative said that this phone is a Nextel phone, and that Sprint was shutting down that network of cell towers by June. He said that after that happens, this phone will not get service on the Sprint network.Update: Another Sprint store worker told someone else something different. See the comments.

The antenna is badly positioned, the side keys still let you pocket-dial (even with the lock on), and there is no directory access from the closed position.

I've had it for 2 years now, and I've only just begun having problems - and that has a lot to do with the abuse it has taken in stride. I managed to crack the front screen recently, but with an impact that probably would have shattered other phones. I've also found the battery life to be spectacular, provided you are in an area with good reception.Now, looking for a replacement, I am a little depressed that everything is either a smart phone or a piece of garbage (or both). There are a few \"rugged\" phones out there, but nothing that really catches my eye like this one did.
