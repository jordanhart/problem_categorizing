If this was my first smartphone I would most likely be satisfied. But I had an HTC rhyme and this is a definite downgrade. The biggest issues I've experienced are 1. There is no indicator light to flash after you've missed a call or text. 2. In the email program on the dashboard there is the capability to view existing folders however no way to move messages from your inbox to folders. You can get around this by opening your email in an internet browser. 3. The autocorrect is really weird and not as intuitive as newer models. That being said, if you're looking for a temporary phone as a replacement until your upgrade renewal period comes as I was, it does the job and I'd rather use this than my rhyme with a cracked screen.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small screen, Slow, But great replacement for the money", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Wichamando\"", "ReviewID": "R337IIKS3O0LIL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the kids broke my wife's Verizon phone. For the price, this was a great replacement.  Much SLOWER and smaller screen than her origional HTC Incredible 2.  BUT, if you have ever had to buy a phone while still under contract and tried to do it throught the carrier, you know it would have cost 3 times as much and often for a referbished one.  This was much cheaper and with less hassle than using insurance with their outragious deductable.  I was warned by Verizon that many phones you buy can not be added to a contract until after 6 months after being purched (to get you in prepaid minutes)  This was NOT the case with this phone.  Overall, it works fine, does all the pictures, facebook, maps, and internet expected of it.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for first time smart phone buyers", "Author": "thejmjohnson", "ReviewID": "R31TJPG1HRLER5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is not alot to this phone, but for the basic or new smart phone user thats enough.

You have to be very careful when you text with this or your replies go to anyone but who they are intended. Even if you remove the notification at top of screen.

Now I'm having to constantly clear application data ... most of my apps are on my SD card, but, it doesn't help as much as I was hoping.Also, this phone will choose random times to reboot itself ... and when shuts off, then, turns back on, it makes that start-up sound ... rather distracting, especially if it happens during a meeting!Anyway ... this phone isn't that great.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love my new phone", "Author": "liberty", "ReviewID": "R39DH087U9JA4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "looks brand new - easy to operate came quickly in the mail.
