Sprint finally delivers a WP8, I wasn't crazy about the color and the specifications make it a mid tier phone. However this phone has exceeded all expectations. Beats Audio is superb and front facing speakers are great. Phone is very smooth operating. I haven't had one issue. Have had it for only a few days but so far perfect for its price.

The windows phone 8 OS is lovely and this phone executes it well. I loved the zune, and this a great zunephone.The flaw is in the design. The beveled edge means that the headphone jack is not secure.

Got mine at Radio Shack for half of the cost at the Sprint Store.  It's an amazing phone period.  The Windows OS is so much better than Android.  The battery is far superior to my old Galaxy S2.  Every app that I've wanted has been available in the Microsoft App Store.  The color is awesome, but I know some people complain about it.  The overall phone experience is so much better, faster, and smoother than Android.  I haven't had one issue!  The apps never \"force close\", which happened daily on Android.  Spread the word about Windows Phone OS and this amazing phone.  Buy one, you won't be disappointed!", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast and fun", "Author": "Brian P.

Mcgill", "ReviewID": "R319B7BBM7YICT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is not a bad Win phone at all, but compaired to the Nokia Lumia line it does not hold a candle.I've owned 4 different windows phone models - The Lumia 900, the 920, the 1520 (my current main phone) and the HTC 8X and I would say this is my least favorite. It just does not have the solid feel as the Lumia's do, not to say it is a bad phone because it isn't. It just is a good bit lighter and cheaper feeling than those phones. So if you want a good compact smart phone and light weight and pocket entry smoothness is important to you - consider this one. Otherwise, get one of the better Lumia's", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC 8X", "Author": "Barbara", "ReviewID": "R8XWY399VTL1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.  this phone has opened up a whole new world of apps to me.

The purplish blue 8XT is absolutely stunning. This phone runs fast thanks to Windows Phone 8. Of course, some apps that you'll find on Android and iOS are still missing, but for my purposes the 8XT is doing great. This thing feels much pricier than it is, and with little benefits like the SD card slot, it's a killer value. Do note the low resolution on the phone - but if your eyesight, like mine, isn't great, you won't be able to notice!", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Q", "ReviewID": "R32WVCEZ4OU1LD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is great. Better than I thought based on the resolution. The back is VERY hard to remove and I thought I would break the front but I was able to open it a few times and inserted the SD card. Used an extra USB to sync with the computer.Only issue so far is my Google contacts will not sync the phone numbers on the People hub. I may have to input the data on my Hotmail account and that should resolve the issue. It just sucks I would have to duplicate my efforts.Used the alarm on it and it woke me up. Overall, a good phone but the OS definitely needs a bit more tweaking. I hope to find a very good streaming app that I sacrificed when I went from iPhone to Android to Windows. Songza is an EXCELLENT music streaming app!", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disapointing", "Author": "Austin N Dyer", "ReviewID": "R31XS0XDA7I5K7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For any other fellow Sprint customers who are WP lovers you know we've been waiting for this phone for a long time.  The phone seems wonderful and I want to love it but the issues I'm having are impossible to ignore.  Let me reiterate that I am a huge Windows Phone fan and I loved my HTC Arrive that I had before I upgraded, so for me to say this phone is disappointing is a big deal.  The first and most terrible issue is the light sensor that is supposed to turn the screen off when you hold the phone to your face to prevent you from accidental input when on the phone (all touch screen phones have this in case you don't know for some reason).  The sensor simply doesn't work in outdoor conditions where there is a lot of light.  This makes it extremely difficult and almost impossible to talk outside as my face is constantly mashing the end call button.  The other glaring issue is the speakers when streaming music or video.  They often crackle and sound like there is static even when you have a perfect 4g or wifi signal.  For a phone that markets itself as a music playing device (the phone has Beats Audio and Boom Sound front facing speakers) you can see how this would be extra disappointing.  Its also worth noting that I shattered my screen so I had to order a replacement device and I'm still encountering both of these issues so its not just a problem with my one particular model.  I've seen several professional review sites mention both of those issues as well so it appears that these are issues across all or many models.  Also for any non-windows phone faithful out there who don't know any better I feel its only fair to warn you that many popular apps are absent from the Windows Phone marketplace (It is expanding quite rapidly though).  Us windows phone fans have excepted this and suck it up but to someone used to the choices provided by the Apple (Yuck) or Android markets you may be very disappointed to find out that official versions of apps like SnapChat or Instagram are completely absent while many other big name apps are outdated and receive updates much later than their Android and Apple counterparts.  I want to love this phone so bad but I can't help but regret wasting my upgrade on a device that simply isn't finished.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Speak", "ReviewID": "R97EPM7FGOH5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are a windows phone fan, you'll enjoy this phone a great deal.  No it doesn't have the powerful spec sheet of some of the newer phones on the market, but what matters is how the phone uses what it has under the hood. The Windows phone OS is top notch and runs as smooth as any OS on the market...probably smoother than the others.  Sprint probably won't be adding any of the Nokia phones to it's stores, so the HTC 8xt is the best you're going to get for now.  A great phone, amazing OS experience, and a terrific value.  If you are looking for something outside the box, you can't go wrong with this phone.CONS:  The windows store still does not offer many of the best apps.  This is changing slowly, but for now the app offerings are limited.  Many of the big apps (i.e. instagram, etc) are on windows phone now but still need upgrades in order to compete with the functionality of the other platforms' apps.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super Phone!", "Author": "tyler evins", "ReviewID": "R1E0C8BN013N29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Truly an amazing phone for both organization and fun.

It's really great for texting and web surfing and YouTube stuff, but phone calls it's not so good. I've had it for months now, and at times it can be hard to understand other people and they sound like aliens. If you are very focused on the conversation you are having then you will get everything the person on the other line is saying, but it requires more acute attention.There were rare times where the phone would get stuck at zooming the home screen or the screen saver screen and I would have to restart the phone to get it back to normal view.The camera is ok, not hd quality.

W8 is an easy OS to work with.A couple of things that I did notice, no alarm clock, they have an app for that. Stay away from the SCOUT navigation that comes with it. Sprint wants $4.99 a month for that, go to the shop and get the free \"Drive Here\" app, it works fantastic.This phones lacks good ring tones and you can't add a song from your phone to contacts unless you go to a laptop/computer for that function.The biggest thing that upset me, you cannot buy a holster for this phone. I have been looking. No accessories for this specific HTC product. Stay away from vendors who say HTC 8x and try to say that the 8xt is the same, they are not. Volume buttons on these two devices are NOT in the same place.
