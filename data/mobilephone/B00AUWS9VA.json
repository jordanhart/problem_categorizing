{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOVE! Not perfect, but soooo much more intuitive than Android!", "Author": "Alaina T", "ReviewID": "R2V2VOJ5WUZXQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a ton of online research before trading in my three year relationship with my old Android phone (HTC Droid Incredible) for the HTC 8X. I went into the switch with an open mind and the acceptance that there would be some limitations to get use to. But I was just ready for something new!So I have had the phone for two months and so far I absolutely love it! All Windows Phones basically have the same user experience because Microsoft doesn't allow manufacturers or carriers to skin the OS.  So here, firstly, are my pros and cons specific to the 8X.PROSVery lightweight as compared to other top end Windows phones. Very thin profile.Fun colour options for casing. It's an eye catcher.Solid battery life. I can get a whole day with pretty heavy use.Solid camera with a great range of fun apps: filters, lomo, panorama, editing.Dedicated shutter button.Only fits halfway in my front pants pocket, but the rubberized coating on the back keeps it from slipping out.The default automated backlighting setting is surprisingly accurate. I haven't yet had to go in an manually change it once.CONSThose external buttons are too flush with the casing so they're hard to find just by feel.Tinny sounding speaker phoneAfter two months of daily use, the rubbery coating has started to wear away on the bottom corners. After a year will there be any coating left??Now, here is my review of the Windows Phone 8 experience, which is basically the same for all WP8 devices.I found the switch to the Windows Phone 8 OS was super easy. WP8 is incredibly intuitive. I was prepared to confront a steep learning curve but I found I acclimated far quicker than I had with my first android phone. All the most commonly used smartphone apps are integrated into the operating system and they talk to each other in a way that Android apps, created by myriad different developers, do not. TO use an SAT motif...WP8 is to Android as Facebook is to MySpace. Android, like MySpace, offers maybe too much freedom of customization for the average user, which can lead to a mess of cluttered home screens and buggy widgets and third-party apps that don't talk to each other. However WP8, like Facebook, gives you a clean, simplified interface, with limited customizations that everyone can use. This of course also contrasts with iPhone which offers no customization what-so-ever.I LOVE the live tiles! I can basically see what's going on with all of my various communication accounts in one glance: phone calls, SMS, Gmail, Yahoo mail, Whatsapp, Skype, Twitter, Facebook and Gchat. Kind of similar to the pull-down notification tray on Android...but so, so, so much better! First thing in the morning, I'd actually rather check all my accounts on my phone in just one look and a couple taps than boot up my laptop and open all the applications/web pages separately. Super intuitive!I LOVE the built in address book which links all of my contact accounts to consolidate the info for each person. From any single contact page I can call them, text them, email them at multiple addresses, message them on Facebook, mention them on twitter, see all our recent interactions, and see any of their recent status updates and photos. Without having to enter all that information manually into the phone. This is what I mean when I say the apps are well integrated!I LOVE the design aesthetic of the user interface, which carries over to all the different Microsoft apps. It's clean, minimalist and a little iconic. Whatever colour and background I set for the live tiles, is used within all the apps as well. Makes the user experience feel much more unified.I LOVE the Bing search built in features - local news, suggested activities based on recent searches, local deals based on recent searches, and movies based on your location. The movies feature in particular makes me happy. It aggregates everything you would want to know in one place - all current moves, locations and times near you (uses GPS), synopsis and info, user reviews, and ticket apps like fandango. This is a good example of what I mean when I say the UX is intuitive!I DON'T LOVE the Bing Maps app. It's a solid app, but after many years of using Google Maps, it just doesn't measure up. It really annoys me that it doesn't include public transportation directions, only walking and driving. I live in a major metropolitan city and public trans is a big deal. Also it doesn't do a great job of guessing what I'm searching for if it doesn't immediately recognize the address I enter. And NO turn by turn navigation! I'm sure Bing Maps will get there eventually, it's just not there yet, and if you rely on you phone for directions frequently this could be a problem.I DON'T LOVE the app drawer. It's one loooong column so you have to scroll forever to find what you're looking for. What's wrong with a grid like iOS and Android have? If it ain't wrong don't fix it.I DON'T LOVE the limited app market. I'd be very careful to check if all your favorite apps are available on WP8 before you make a switch! Microsoft has actually been pretty good about communicating upcoming app developments to their users. They announced a forthcoming Pandora app in December for launch in spring 2013 and we just got it...right on time! But, it's a bummer knowing that every time a hot new app is rumored, it probably won't be available for windows phones. At least not for a while. This is of course a growing-pains issue that will get better as WP becomes more popular which I really think it will!", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ditch your contract and get one of these", "Author": "Daniel Casentini", "ReviewID": "RM0S69FQDSKUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hunting for a new phone when I moved back to the US and couldn't believe what people are paying for their contracts. I got this phone unlocked and threw a TMobile pay-as-you-go SIM card for a $100 bucks., it works perfect for me.  I don't need to update Facebook every 5 minutes and there is enough free wifi around that I can get Internet pretty much anywhere anyway.  As far as the phone itself goes, I thought I was going to have trouble liking win8 after being in an iPhone the last 4 years, but I actually like it better than my old iPhone. There aren't as many apps out there yet, but there are a lot of good ones and I imagine more are being worked on and being released often.

Its thin and lightweight and unique looking. I love how you can personalize almost everything on the phone. It's super quick and doesn't freeze, but the market doesn't have much games and apps. I know that this is my fault but when I was getting out of my car the phone fell and shattered. It probably only fell less then two feet. Now I've had other phones and they've had a lot worst falls then 2 feet and the screen didnt shatter, getting a small scratch at the most. The design of the screen can use a lot of improvement. The screen slightly curves out and is made of pure glass. Glass bits were also falling out of the screen too. I don't know about you but I don't think that's suppose to happen.

It is worth every penny to upgrade. Just about every feature you wish you had on the Windows Phone 7 (any version) can be found on Windows Phone 8. I've been using Windows 7 phones for over 3 years, and the difference is noticeable and instant. If you're considering the switch, do it now.The HTC 8x is a great phone. My only complaint is like other people say -- the buttons are a little small, and blend in with the casing a little too much. Other than that... no problems or complaints at all!One quick note -- if you're upgrading from an older phone, you may have a larger SIM card than this phone requires. If that's the case, just go to any AT&T; store, and they'll get you set up with a new SIM card free of charge.

One of the big complaints about Windows 8 phones is that they don't have a proper or easy to use contacts list (the people hub is a bit confusing at first and not very efficient way to call your contacts), but that problem is easily fixed with a number of different contacts apps you can get for free at the windows app store.

I have not owned this thing for 6 months and it is developing a problem by shutting on and off continuously. This off and on process can last ENTIRE DAYS and the only thing I can do is wait for it to die.  This is occurring 6 MONTHS after I started using it.  As a consumer of 5 phones in the past, replacing them after TWO YEARS, I'd say this is a TERRIBLE PRODUCT.  In addition, they recently released an update to make my phone better (I guess), and so after I cleared out 1 gig of my files for the update (There's no expandable storage); it notifies me that \"It was unable to install the update\"  Doesn't sound too bad right?  WRONG! Since the 8X is Updatile Dysfunctioning, I can't use ANY APP! GENIUS! I am really disgusted at the quality this phone. I own a work iPhone and used to have an Android before I switched over.

The Nokia phone has become her own merits in the most desired by users of the platform, which makes the Lumia 920 so unique from the competition?For starters, its spectacular display PureMotion IPS technology, which ensures a much higher response rate than that of its rivals, plus a high brightness even under sunlight and an incredible touch sensitivity. Its density of pixels falls below the HTC 8X, but instead offers a slightly larger screen coming up to 4.5 inches. On the performance side, processor and RAM shared with rivals, and stays at an intermediate point on the capacity of the battery, below the Samsung ATIV S.But if there is another feature that is special about the Lumia 920 is its main camera. Beyond its 8.7 megapixel, the largest of the three phones compared, which has led to more comments PureView technology is used by Nokia that offers quality in the photographs as had never before seen on a mobile. His system allows high quality photos in low light conditions and image stabilizer, polemics aside, substance ensures improved video recording from the competition.The dimensions of Nokia smartphone loses out, being the thickest of the three little heavy and quite unlike most of its 6.53 oz. In return we have a more compact look great all the design \"unibody\" inaugurated with Nokia N9. Care adds details, such as wireless charging sold separately.HTC 8XThe headliner HTC is all a sample of expertise and stand out very well against its rivals, with several points in which the lead.The screen is not one of the sections which emerged victorious. The HTC 8X offers the smallest screen of the three devices with its 4.3 inches, but it does maintain a great resolution of 1280x720 which give it the highest density of pixels from the comparison. Its Super LCD technology maybe stay a little behind the rest but offers more than enough quality. In their guts have the same processor dual-core Snapdragon S4 of ATIV S and 1GB of RAM, although in this case with less battery of three in competition. Storage also remains somewhat behind, with 16GB internal and lack of microSD card slot.Paragraph photographic eye, because, without hogging all attention wing that has taken the Lumia 920 in this issue, the 8X offers an 8-megapixel camera more than satisfactory, equipped with technology similar to what HTC has offered in its latest Android devices . And to complete the multimedia section, nothing better than to take their work with Beats Audio for great sound provide the terminal. Not to mention LTE and NFC connectivity it shares with its other two rivals.Despite seeming to be left behind by its smaller battery, less internal storage and lack of microSD slot, the explanation is found faster when we take a look at its small size. The 8X is the smallest of the three high-end WP8, but still thicker than the ATIV S, leaving its weight in a mere 4.59 oz. To this we attach a very attractive design that has received very good reviews from those who have had their hands in appearance and comfort.SAMSUNG ATIV SProbably the most enigmatic of high-end phones with Windows Phone 8. Samsung is superior in several sections.The ATIV S boasts the largest screen size with 4.8 inches they leave behind its competitors. Also, this comes with HD Super AMOLED technology so successful that the company has made on other devices. Instead maintains the same resolution 1280x720, leaving a lower pixel density than its rivals, although still at very high levels. Again we have a dual-core processor at 1.5 GHz and the same 1 GB of RAM, although in this case is supported by a battery of 2300 mAh, significantly better than their opponents. As for storage, the Samsung is the most flexible, allowing internal choose a size 16 or 32 GB and appending its possible expansion with microSD cards.The camera is perhaps where worst comes stopped ATIV S compared to the other two competitors in the high range. While maintaining the type with its 8 megapixel, lack of promotion by Samsung of the same rule we can think of as technological added special in this case advertise their rivals. The rest of the features is on par with its rivals, including the maximum connectivity LTE and NFC.That if, as a work of engineering the Samsung smartphone stands out from the rest thanks to its spectacular screen size in the body content thinnest of the three, with just 0.34 in. thick. To that we can add their meager 4.76 oz, almost on par with the HTC 8X, and you have a real beast of a body very content. Surely its design is the least attractive of the three, but that can be a strength that will help convince users who prefer a more sober style on their phones.I hope to help you in your decision with this modest analysis.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "POS", "Author": "Kelly McFarland", "ReviewID": "R1NH3C6CWP55MT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband and I both have the HTC Windows 8x phones.

This being my second phone from them, I should have learned the first time around that a pretty design is hardly worth the infuriating software.To begin, my camera went green the SECOND day after it came out of the box. I took it to an ATT store (the provider) and they gave me lackluster feedback, claiming I was just being silly; after all, when it goes green you just have to restart your entire phone! Picture moment=gone.Thinking it may be a one time issue, I relied on the HTC warranty in case of future issues. Can you see how gullible I am? Of course, the issue happened again, and is currently happening more often.Not only that, but I am now having an issue simply trying to unlock the screen. When I type the password in, it opens to a black screen that states \"resuming...\" This screen appears for a good five minutes, rendering the phone completely useless. The only option to stop this is to take out the battery, which hasn't been an easy (or fun) thing to accomplish.Like I said before, I hoped to rely on HTC's warranty, at least some decent customer service. Mistake twenty three! They are awful. I could hardly get my point across without the lady insisting there was nothing they could do.Needless to say, I am completely frustrated. Look it up online and you'll see I'm not the only one with these issues, either.This isn't even touching on the fact that the interface isn't as nice after owning it for a while and just about any app you want is NOT going to be available.Fair warning: Skip the sparkles and glitzy design, they're all this phone has to offer. I promise you, I would gladly crush this thing to pieces and feed it to rabid monkeys if it weren't my most important form of communication. This phone has proven to be absolutely worthless to me and I will never in my life recommend or purchase another HTC phone.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone in Windows 8 Space", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R2R2WCBPKPIVPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HTC 8X is definitely a incredible design and ergonomic. Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. 4.3\" Super LCD 2, 720x1280 resolution, 342 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 2 is overlooked. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait processor, 16 GB internal flash, 1 GB RAM NO microSD slot! Battery is 1800 mAh Li-ion battery. Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery. Battery is also not removable. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__ 8 MP camera is awesome, and HD videos were fantastic. For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design. This is the reason for me giving a 4 star review.I have used in the past extensively HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. Apps are very smooth on 8X even compared to Nokia Lumia series. Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. I tried with Navigon which turned out to be great in giving voice directions.Engadget wrote after the release: \"Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS\" This is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is NOT an AT&T; Unlocked phone - is is a Verizon phone and incompatible with most AT&T; mobile services", "Author": "R Michael Parrotte", "ReviewID": "RPI1TDZC5T3XX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is NOT an AT&T; Unlocked phone as advertised by the seller it is a Verizon phone and incompatible with most AT&T; mobile services.It boots up with a Verizon logo and Verizon programs NOT with AT&T; services and logo.I wish there was a rating lower that 1 Star!!Email does not work on phonePhotos by Text does not workAT&T; Navigator and other AT&T; services do NOT work.Very expensive mistake", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "It was exactly as descibe and looks brand new", "Author": "angel", "ReviewID": "R222HDJJYD7SCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was exactly as descibe and looks brand new i love it and i will buy more from  ! ;)", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great build quality and good OS but lack of apps", "Author": "Cem Hamami", "ReviewID": "RUZU4UFCHC31M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is great in terms of build quality and material, it feels great in your hand.

There is also no official app for Facebook, so you have to use the one developed by Microsoft. Microsoft's Facebook app is \"OK\". You will also not find any official Google apps except Google search. The native mail app works good with Gmail though. Also, there is a YouTube app again developed by Microsoft which is almost the same as what you will find on m.youtube.com.

My 2nd Windows Phone (WP8). I can get 3 days between charges (yippee)!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2EYG3OV9A60LU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a week and so far so good. This was an upgrade from the entry level Nokia Lumia 520, which was a 3G windows phone. I was actually happy with that phone - specs comparable to the iPhone 4s, except with a different operating system. (I am already a Windows Phone 8 user, so I will not be reviewing the Windows Phone OS - please see my previous review of the Nokia Lumia 520 for my thoughts on WP8) Unfortunately, I had dropped my previous Nokia phone in water a few months back. I was able to bring it back by putting in a bag of rice, but it never quite worked right again - it would randomly shut down on its own about once per day. I've been looking for an upgrade for a few months - hoping for a Windows Phone with LTE.Finally I picked up this unlocked no-contract HTC 8X phone (refurb) for about $140. When popped in my AT&T; SIM card, I did initially have some trouble getting it to restore from my Windows Phone backup of my previous phone. It turns out that the problem was that I needed to update the phone first. I applied several over-the-air updates from the \"Phone Update\" option in the \"Settings\" menu. Once I did this, I was able to restore all of my contacts, settings and apps from my old phone. A few of the proprietary Nokia apps did not transfer over, but I was expecting that.According to the specs, this processor in this phone is about 1.5x faster than my previous phone, and also has LTE (for AT&T;). I found it to be about 2x as fast as my Nokia was (probably due to more memory as well). My Lumia 520 averaged about 3-5 megabit download speeds over 3G in my area, and now with LTE, I can get about 6-10 megabit, which is about double (I'm hoping AT&T; will add more capacity here soon and I can get even more download speed). The screen is brighter and higher res (720p). The cameras are better too (Lumia 520 had no flash and no front camera). In terms of size - the HTC 8X is just as wide as the Lumia 520, but about 3/4 inch taller. This was important to me because I like a phone that is pocketable and I thought all of the other Nokia options with LTE for AT&T; were too big (Lumia 920, 1020, 1520, etc.) .Anyways, after 1 week of use, I am really happy with the phone. My needs are pretty basic. I do a lot of SMS text messages, I surf the web for about 15-20 minutes every day to/from work on the bus. I take 5-6 pictures per week to post to FaceBook or send to someone via email. I may listen to up to 1 hour of music a day via pandora. This phone is perfect for what I need it to do - it is noticeably faster than my previous phone and the better display and cameras are a nice added bonus.There was one thing I didn't like about the phone and that was that the lock/on-off button on the top of the phone does not stick out enough and is hard for your finger to find by tactile feel alone (you kinda need to be looking at the button). However, there is a great soultiuon - I bought the Otter Box case for it (commuter series) and the case has a nicely protruding cover for the button and I can now find it without having to look at it (great for unlocking the phone while driving and/or in the dark)Battery - If I use these following settings, I can get about 80 hours between charging (over 3 days!). I generally leave the \"Battery Saver\" option on (from the settings menu). The other settings I changed to maximize battery life are, \"Always Restrict Background Data\" in the \"Cellular\" page in the settings menu. I also turn off wi-fi when except when I am at home.  Without the \"Battery Saver\" function, the phone says I have about 36 hours of battery left when fully charged.For the price, I am very happy with this phone. I paid $100 for my previous Nokia Lumia 520 in August 2013. I know this HTC 8x has been discontinued, and I had to buy a refurb, but I'm happy because I paid only $40 more for this than my old phone and it is a substantially better phone. It is everything I expected and I wasn't expecting it to have this kind of battery life, so seems like a win-win to me.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good looking and stylish windows phone", "Author": "kameshwaran kumaresan", "ReviewID": "RY5O9AO7LOJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is sleek and good looking.It is unlocked and can be used with any service provider.Only problem I have was Network sharing not working which is no big deal.Iong batter life as well.
