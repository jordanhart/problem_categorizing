Unfortunately, the phone lasted just a couple of months before a defective part made the phone unusable. Having passed its 30 day return period and being discontinued by the manufacturer...the phone is unusable junk.  Had I purchased through Amazon directly, I likely would have had better recourse.  I guess I can't really hold the seller accountable for a defective LG product, but still wish independent sellers had more flexible return policies.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Average", "Author": "Elijah Goforth", "ReviewID": "R2LPMTUN3FC014", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Better than my old phone, I can say that. Texting is easy on it, except for when I accidently type two of one letter. The seller didn't really meet my expectations, because music does not work correctly on it. It just spits out \"No Application.\" Took it to Verizon and they said it's too old for them to service. Not exactly happy, but not unhappy.
