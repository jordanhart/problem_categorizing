The 3G essentially works the same, but the processor is old and it can only be updated to iOS 4.2, which most apps, including Skype, are not supported.  The 3GS can update to iOS 6.1 which is what the iPHone5's come with.  Also make sure it is factory unlocked, if not, an update will relock it.  If it isn't unlocked, you can simply call AT&T; or take it to an AT&T; store, and they'll permanently unlock it for you, it's very fast and simple.  I'm a longtime BlackBerry user which I still prefer for work, but the 3GS is great for personal use and to store music.  I see why they are so poplular.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Factory Unlocked = freedom", "Author": "An Informed User", "ReviewID": "RBCY1EQNOE3BM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile.  I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone.  Within a few minutes, it got signal.  Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward.  Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular.  After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from.

I have a nose for when things don't smell right.  They looked at it for free.  The back cover was ghetto rigged on in a manner that the screen came out too easily, and that when a new mic was inserted, the home button would not work anymore.  607 Tech Solutions is the highest rated Tech Repair shop in Broome County, NY.

I gotta say, I'm very happy with this purchase. It wasn't hard to set up the sim's card into the device. It came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything. I love texting and calling my friends and family with it. I have experienced the white screen of death, but I restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since. I haven't really experience any serious heating problems and I've played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in. It does get rather warm in the hands, but it wasn't enough to be uncomfortable for me. The main reason why I got this phone was because I wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family. The phone I had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard. This does what I want and so much more. For $115, I got a really good deal and I'm happy to say that I'll be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me. Just to let those who have flip phones know, the iPhone 3GS can PREVENT data being used when you're not on that plan. The flip phone that I had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet. At least now, I don't have to worry about those slippages because I can only use data when i'm  using wi-fi.I don't really have any complaints for this phone because it's more then what I want in an phone, but as an Apple product, I have to say that the screen really takes a miss. I'm so spoiled by Retina Display on my iPod Touch 5g, that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution. When comparing watching videos or pictures, it's just ain't the same. It's good when I'm bored at college, but for casual use, it's not that great from today's standards.It's a little bulky, but I kind of like it that way. It gives it a feel to it and it doesn't slip out of my hands unlike the new iPod Touch.Seeing that I got the white screen of death on the second day scared me. I'm hoping that wasn't the reason why the seller sold it to me.Summery:Pros:Great for a phone and great for texting.Has great cellular connection.Satisfying battery life.Can handle playing games without taking too much heat.Can prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phone.Cons:Poor screen quality compared to today's standard for Apple products.Sort of bulky, but having some weight is a pro for me.White screen of death on the second day of using it.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone", "Author": "Don McGlone", "ReviewID": "R12A9GB6WI0DJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone meets all my requirements and more.Was easy to set up with my Carrier ( AT&T;)Lightning fast", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": ":(", "Author": "AleSya", "ReviewID": "RXHSDHSVG0EKA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, the camera appeared to be broken and the phone itself is kinda slow.

I live in Costa Rica and gave my parents the go ahead to order it....once they received it they had to ship it to me here....(4 weeks later my phone arrived ) It arrived in excellent condition , UNLOCKED FROM THE FACTORY READY TO GO. I made phone calls right alway...Later that  night I decided to log into the Apple APP store......OH NO ....it was what the reviews said, it was all in Chinese...after a few minutes I decided to try and log in with my Apple ID ....that's when it told me that that apple ID is for the UNITED STATES and not china ....But it told me it will rout me to the UNITED STATES Apple store automatically. Sure enough it routed me just fine and it all changed to English ....That was a week ago and the phone works perfect... MY ADVICE, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN APPLE ID OR WANT A NEW ONE.
