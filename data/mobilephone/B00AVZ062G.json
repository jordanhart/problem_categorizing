Otherwise its a basic nothing wow factor just a good sturdy phone that has good texting ability and the calls seem to be clear for the better part. Overall a very easy mobile to use nothing too techy but is fast can use apps and a has a good gps. Just take note the charger does not seem to last oddly so either have one laying about or order a new one they are cheap enough the phone works still in tip top condition just the charger died after three uses.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Replacement Phone", "Author": "Lobstha", "ReviewID": "R34GVAGBGDRSFV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the phone to replace daughters broken cell.

Does not keep charged for long and even when it does stay charged long enough. If I fully charge it and turn it off, when i turn it on it says that it is going dead. I got cut off from a very important phone call (a one time deal) because it just magically turned off on me. I am very very dissapointed. I hope they let me return it.
