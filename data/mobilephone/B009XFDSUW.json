Ordered it at 748pm on Friday and it got here a little under 12 hours later. I loved that part.** I do not know if it is a brand new device**1) Did not come in a Samsung Rugby AT&T; branded box. It came in a generic AT&T; box. The type a refurbished or replacement phone would come in. Generic labels like: Camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc. Nothing actually about the true specs of the phone. No user guide came with it either. A quick start up guide but no actual manuel. Not an issue for me but some my find it troublesome. it came with the AT&T; \"Texting can wait\" sticker on the screen but that means nothing2) I received it with a small scratch on the bottom left hand corner on the front facing side of the device. & it looks like a small piece of plastic on the back battery door lock screw came off, it does not affect the cover from staying on or the water proof seal.I understand since this is a unlocked GSM phone they would have to take it out and type in an unlock code to... unlock it but not sure why it didn't come in original boxing.& I don't know if it is actually unlocked. I emailed them and said it is. Straight Talk works on locked AT&T; phones so if someone was to stick a T-Mobile card in there, I would not know the outcome.How I feel about the phone its self after having it for a few days? I LOVE IT!I have owned a Samsung Fascinate, Palm Pixi, HP Veer, iPhone 4, & Samsung Galaxy 3 and this is my favorite of them all yet.**The fact that it is a rugged device makes me feel better about it. I don't plan on dropping it or leaving it in extreme temperatures but the fact that it can withstand that helps. I have had successes with Samsung devices, I still use my Samsung Fascinate 2.5 years later after its been dropped a few times and its still functional. If this device can withstand my kinda use plus has rugged abilities, I'm expecting a good solid 3 years out of this device.**I was with Verizon for a while but now I switched to Straight Talk ( I activated this device on it). All me previous devices were on Verizon and the only thing I miss is the coverage.*Pros*-Feels great in my hands not bulky at all not heavy-Built well, nice soft rubbery feeling on the sides. (does have plastic on the back)-I actually like the physical buttons more instead of the touch buttons-Comes with a built in flashlight shortcut (hold up volume key when phone screen is locked)-Does't feel cheap. I know they say this is a mid range android device but with  a 1400mhz processor its just as fast as the top of the line phones-*It's Really Water Proof* That was a big turn on to me and I had to test it out. While I was in the shower I splashed it, dunked it in maybe 5 inches of water, still good. I also browed Youtube videos, Play Store, Netflix and used Skype. It has a microphone on the back so people can actually hear me and not the sound of all the water.  I don't know how rugged it is or how it can withstand extreme temperatures. I'm not going to purposely drop it but if I do, I feel comfortable knowing its supposed to be able to hold up.-Front and rear cameras both are great for Skype and photos respectively*Cons*-Runs Android Gingerbread: This IS NOT a big problem for me, I do not care about the style changed between android 2.0 and 4.0 but I do really miss Google Now.- Touch screen does not work well while in water. I understand why it doesn't (all the warm water on the screen confusing it) but texting did prove difficult while in the shower.Other than that, there is nothing I dislike. As I said, this is my favorite device I've ever had and hope it will be around for a while.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, solid smart phone, a little underpowered by today's standards", "Author": "Cadnr", "ReviewID": "R1NGPPU6O5TP1O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice phone and good value for money. There are so many flimsy phones out there at the moment, it's nice to hold one in your hand that feels sturdy and isn't going to smash to pieces if you drop it.  I find it's the perfect size for a smartphone - not too big, but still big enough to have a decent screen, and surprisingly good-looking for a rugged phone.  The screen brightness is good and everything looks pretty much crystal clear. The responsiveness of the interface and touch-screen are good overall and I didn't have any problems typing on the keyboard when held horizontal.Downsides are that it only has a single-core processor and there's relatively little RAM (512 MB), so it starts to lag a little as soon as you have a few apps open.  Any complex webpages have to be loaded on-the-fly, so be prepared for some checkerboarding as you scroll around in the default browser, but it's nothing you won't be able to live with. Also, it's pretty annoying prying open the flap that covers the USB port every time you need to recharge.Unfortunately, I'm marking the product down two notches because the phone I received was clearly not new.  It came in an open AT&T; box, and although the screen was clean and new-looking, there was a significant amount of dust inside the back cover and there were chips and scratches on and around the flaps that cover the earphone jack and USB port. This is the third time I've received a 'new' phone I bought over the internet that turned out to be not exactly new, so apparently there's some unscrupulous antics going on somewhere!  Then again, you can't even buy these phones new and unlocked (as far as I can tell) - someone had to open it up and use it in order to unlock it, so the very phrase 'new' starts to become suspect. In the end, you just have to trust the seller to give you something that's at least a close enough approximation to new that you won't notice the difference...", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "As expected", "Author": "jomammah", "ReviewID": "R6JRHYI77YY2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a ruggedized smart phone. There were 2 choices, this and Motorola; and I really dislike Motorola's software.After 3 months, workng outside every day, the phone has been flawless. I realize it's not the latest software version, and I don't mind. I'm not a bleeding edge kind of guy. It phones when I need it to, it texts when I need it to, and it webs when I need it to.It started out needing a charge every day. As I got more familiar with it, I got that down to a charge every 3-5 days.My only complaint is a minor one... it does buzz or rattle a little bit when on speaker. Then again, an outside environment often is noisy, so I have to keep the volume up.04 June 2013 EDIT-----In case it helps anyone, I'm using the phone thru one of the smaller providers (which I'm very happy with. I just don't know if I'm allowed to identify them, here.) on ATT's network. The provider got me up and running with no trouble, and all has been fine.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Confirmed military tough - at least mine is", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R2O2Z2TJCM0PEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have one of the latest, greatest all singing and dancing Samsung cells.  But... I'm in the infantry and wanted to take my phone out in the field as I thought some of the Android apps could be pretty helpful.  However, I didn't want to take an expensive cellphone out in the boonies and kill it off within a matter of hours or days.  I saw this phone priced here at $149 and figured I wouldn't cry too much if I destroyed the phone.  Was a little concerned about the \"this phone ain't unlocked\" reviews, but figured I'd just return it if that was the case.After arrival, slipped in the SIM card.  Instant success, no messing around for provider access/calls.  Sinc'd it up with my existing cellphone - sidenote: the full Kies version worked with the phone until I upgraded the firmware to the latest version through Kies, then Kies apparently decided it was a Blackberry or Iphone or something like that and wouldn't work anymore.  However, I found that Kies Air still worked after the firmware upgrade, so it was all good and sinc'ing and administering the phone is still good to go.Then decided there was no time like the present to test the toughness on the phone, while the packaging was still on the table.  Filled the kitchen sink with water and threw the phone in there for about 20 minutes while I went outside and mowed the lawn.  Made a call to the phone when I got back in - somewhat amusing to see the screen come alive and hear it ringing at the bottom of the sink.  Waterproof?  Check.  Held it at shoulder level and dropped it on the floor a couple of times.  Disclaimer: I dropped it to land on an edge or the back, not where the screen would land on an object.  Phone still worked.  Rugged?  Check.Off it went to work with me.  It sat in my webbing out in the field, got banged by rifle magazines, my rifle, assorted thumps from being dropped on the ground, thrown in the carrier, etc.  Got wet in a couple of rainstorms.  Sand and mud and dirt a lot.  Covered in food after a foil package of food next to it in my pack ruptured.  And it still worked when I hauled it out to do something with it.  I'm not going to worry about whether it has buttercup status or not anymore...I did equip it with a Zagg screen saver however - those things are tough and trustworthy, I have been using them on GPS units for about five years now and they are incredible glass protectors.So my phone is unlocked, it does work as advertised as soon as I slipped my SIM card in there, and it is rugged.How does it perform?  I am not a Jedi Master power smartphone user needing maximum computing power and Niagara Falls levels of data volume input/output.  I rarely enable the data functionality because 4G data plans here are stupid expensive and usually out of range anyways.  But it does connect when enabled and do what it is supposed to do for my purposes.  I use a lot of Wi-Fi instead as Wi-Fi is much more available and Skype phone/video calls are much cheaper for me.  Seems to have reception/transmission as good as my superphone, so I'm happy with that.  Whether using the actual cellphone or Skype to make calls, sound quality in/out is good.Computing power.  I don't run around with a bunch of apps running, watching Netflix, whatever.  I don't have a game on it, and the most complex software I have running typically is DualSportMaps for it's offline mapping/tracking features.  Skype and Firefox often will be sitting there in the background at the same time.  None of these have been sufficient to give me any grief with the fact this doesn't have the latest and greatest computing power and Android operating system.  For a user like me, this version of the OS and the computing power is more than ample.I don't use the camera very often, as I much prefer a real camera to get the image quality I want, but have messed with it a bit out of curiosity.  It takes surprisingly good pictures, including fairly closeup pictures of coins, fishing flies, etc with pretty good detail.  My guess is most people would find the spur of the moment pics it would take on the beach, at the restaurant, the family pet, etc more than acceptable.Summary: for me, the phone I received was exactly as advertised, is as tough as advertised, and does everything I want it to do.  If I do destroy it eventually, I'll figure I got my money's worth by then.  In fact, I'm thinking of buying another and putting it away as a backup.  If you're a heavy data plan user, or need a lot of computing power, then maybe this phone will disappoint you.  For that, perhaps the successor Rugby Pro at about $250 more is more suitable with a dual core processor, more internal memory, etc.  Camera specs, video, screen specs, etc, everything else between the two is pretty much the same.But for a user like me, a phone this tough that can slip in a shirt pocket and do everything I ask of it is just about perfect.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT Rugged at all!!

I am not a computer geek so I don't need the absolute latest computer gimmicks. I want a cell phone that works easily, is GSM so I can use it in my travels around the world, has easy compatibility with my essential Skype and GoogleVoice, accesses the internet, and lets me check the occasional email, and has an adequate screen and letters so I don't have to pull out my reading glasses to use it, and of course has WiFi- which many waterproof phones don't have.The only negative for me is all the downloaded and non-removable ATT rubbish that I don't like with my T-Mobile use. But that is just an irritation.Sorry to be sexist but I love this man's phone. I can use it on the windsurfing beach with blowing sand and salt spray without worry. I went on the belt and suspenders principle and put a cheap case on the already sturdy exterior so it easily takes the bumps and bruises of travelling and use in less than ideal conditions. And it is fun to dunk it in the water glass when I am at a restaurant with people not familiar with this phone.i love it.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I wish I could love this phone... I really do....", "Author": "Tyler Oliva", "ReviewID": "ROQFZO7914MS0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this phone, however it's almost impossible for me. I'm not sure if I got a dud, but the phone is very slow and the battery life isn't what I expected.If you're looking at the specs for this phone, it seems just about unbeatable. The fact that its processor is clocked at a faster speed than the iPhone 5 and the 2 main cameras shoot at considerably high resolution are really appealing. However, take note of the small amount of RAM that will slow down the phone if you have more than 2 apps open at a time. Also, the processor is only single core, as opposed to dual core, which produces better performance and multitasks much better. The screen size is nice, it takes a while for your fingers to get used to typing when using it in portrait mode, but it comes with time. When you see the screen it appears to be smaller than 3.7 inches, probably because of the thick rubber surrounding it. There are a lot of issues that stop this phone from being what it really could be.The software I have is Android 2.3.6 with Samsung's Touchwiz 4.0 on top.The reason I got this phone was because I have a Pantech Crossover that broke and I needed a quick replacement. I must say I like the original Android much better than with the Touchwiz added on. I think that it slows down the phone (Or it may not, as I said I might've gotten a bad phone) because the screen, instead of fading off, goes completely off, then flashes my lock screen for a few seconds. The Pantech I had fades off and it's a lot more appealing. I've also tried and tried to use the resizable widgets, but on every widget I've tried it won't allow me to do so.Concerning music, I use iTunes music files on my SD card. My previous phones (Nokia E71x and Pantech Crossover) could both read the files, but for some reason this phone won't. Now, it may not be an issue for people who use MP3 files all the time, but the only songs my phone could put into a proper folder (like artist, album, and song) was the MP3 files. All of the iTunes files go in as \"unknown artist\", and I've tried changing the names on my phone, but nothing will properly sort them, they'll always be an unknown artist.I can confirm that yes, this phone is waterproof! and shock proof, too. I took a video dunking this phone in water and it came out alright, however the video freezes when underwater. I think this might be the Android system detecting the phone's in water (yes, it can do that) and is trying to stop the phone from doing anything. I dropped the phone on the floor plenty of times, even a concrete floor, and it was unscathed. That's the feature I really like about this phone.Now onto the camera. I like the camera on the phone, the front one is a little dark, but otherwise it's a good picture taker. The colors seem true to the real world and it has lots of settings, thanks to the Touchwiz. The front facing camera doesn't have a very wide viewing angle, so lots of times when taking pictures with my friends its hard to fit them all in the picture, and the image often comes up blurry. The video on the back camera is nice, the video is smooth and audio is acceptable for a smartphone. I haven't tried with the front but I'm assuming the quality wouldn't be too high.Now, onto battery life. ugh. When I first got the phone, the battery life fluctuated greatly, and for about a month it was great. I'd get 2 or 3 days on the battery and I was perfectly content with the phone. Then came the day when it dropped so much I had lost 80% within 10 hours. Then the day after it dropped 40% overnight. After that week of having to bring the charger to school the battery got okay again. It never went back to what it was before, but I was happy to get 2 days max out of it. Now, since about the start of November it's been draining super fast. One night it lost 70% charge right after charging it to 100%. The battery consumption app that comes preloaded says that either it's the display or the Android OS that is taking up about 50-60% of the battery usage. I'm not even sure if I want to try and get a new battery, I think it's the phone that's draining all of the power, rather than the batteryThis phone also takes a standard SIM card (thankfully) and can take up to 32 GB of microSD storage. Overall, I don't think this phone is capable of performing lots of tasks well, because of the limited RAM that it has and the single core processor. Software wise I liked the standard OS, I think Samsung's Touchwiz just slows down the phone a lot, sometimes taking about 10 seconds for widgets and apps to load on the home screen. That's also probably the reason why the Pantech, even though much cheaper and less powerful handled Android much better. I do really like the ruggedness of the phone, and the expandable storage. However the horrible battery life is enough to make me want to buy an entirely new phone. Luckily I bought this when it was only $140, not over $200. I got the phone in September and have tried to be open minded, but it's just impossible, maybe I'm just unlucky and got a dud as i said earlier, but even so there are too many issues for me to consider it again", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "says it can take a 6 foot drop", "Author": "kev", "ReviewID": "R3J2TEHC1A49PI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I dropped it off my bike 4 foot high on the street boom cracked the whole screen now the screen doesnt work and the manufacture will not give me a new one so 150 down the drain", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rugby smart phone", "Author": "J.
