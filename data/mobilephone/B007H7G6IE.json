Bergman", "ReviewID": "R2DPQZL8TCX7C9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm stealing this from another online reviewer, but I want to rub this phone against my face. Constantly. The One S is absolutely gorgeous -- thin, light and easy to hold. I have the T-Mobile version. And it's functional. I clock about 13mbps download speeds on T-Mobile's HSPA+ network, which is pretty dang good.Cons:- Pentile display, and I can tell. The display is truly gorgeous with popping colors and great viewing angles, but the pentile pixel arrangement means text can be fuzzy at times. It's disappointing in an otherwise perfect piece of hardware.- No Micro SD card and only 16GB internal memory. That's plenty for apps -- not so much for those who like to carry a lot of offline music or video content.Pros:- Fast as blazes. No lag, ever.- Gorgeous. Stunning. The design on this phone makes an iPhone 4S look like one of those car-phone bricks from the 80s- Good radio reception compared to my old HTC Sensation XE- HTC Sense 4.0 has morphed into something actually useful- Good camera. Not great camera, but good camera- Easy to root and customize, if you're into that.Anyway, I love this phone. It's refined, and proves what the Android platform can do. I just wish they had made room for a MicroSD slot and included a slightly better display, like the One X's.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really nice phone", "Author": "mustafa", "ReviewID": "RO8DFJSW5JKRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone is exactly the same as written in the information page of the product.

No MicroSD card, which I don't really need as I massively use cloud services.... Built-in battery, which is the only thing I would have changed in it. As any other smartphone, battery life is not that long...- A great screen, both light and colors are impressive.- Very good computing power - only the quad-core CPUs are considered better, and I'm not sure they really are.- The sense interface in very intuitive and nice to work with and get used to.- The price (at least where and when I bought it) was less then Galaxy S3 or S2, and it acts better then the S2 and as good  as the S3 (which battery life is much better, but costs almost 1.5 times the price of the HTC)- It's the most beautiful phone I saw!", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone... when it's working", "Author": "Guillaume", "ReviewID": "R9PD7A5HZXCNU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love the design of the phone and the performances are great.However the infamous \"home\" button defect has completely ruined my experience and caused the phone to be unusable for most of the time.

Unlike my HTC Amaze 4G, which I still think is a great phone, I like the sleek, thin and light design of the HTC One S. However, I recommend a glossy TPU case for better grip. The screen is bright that it's comfortable to use it even in direct sunlight. However, if you're new to amoled displays, you will notice the strange patterns when you look at textual content up close. Other than that, images and movies look awesome on this display. The battery life is excellent compared to my previous phone. This is with heavy messaging usage (email, gtalk, whatsapp), news reading, 30 min tethering, 1 hour phone use, 1 hour podcasting, and quick random things (calendar, web browsing, etc) every weekday with about 40% to spare by the time I go to bed. And it can last an entire weekend on a single charge. At first, I thought 16 GB wasn't enough for me, but it has been 3 months and I am yet to hit the halfway mark. It comes with free dropbox space so i can also store pics there instead of my phone. HTC Sense on this is better than the previous version. I love the carousel effect and the default background image. It is faster, lag-free, and stable. It has been 1,030 hours (42+ days) since my last phone reboot as of today. The camera is excellent and can take up to 4 shots in panoramic mode. That's just one of the modes the camera is capable of including rapid shots. It also has a bunch of cool features like flip over to activate speakerphone, ring louder when in your pocket, etc. What am I not happy about? This annoying trend of making the memory and battery non-removable. Yes, I don't need to replace them now but... Ugh! Anyway, overall, I am very happy with this phone and intend to use it for a long time.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "A.

No need to search in all the application, the Camera Mode is quite easy to access, thanks to the shortcut on the lock screen. You'll be very satisfied when you'll see the pictures taken with this 8Mpix and fast auto-focus camera. Even if you prefer to take a video of what is dealing in front of you, you'll have no problem to extract pictures thanks to the functionnalities offered by the phone (during the recording or the playing session).Are you fond of music ? Then, this is the phone you need. Thanks to the \"Beats Audio\" technology, the quality of sound is amazing. You'll have easy access to your favorites playlists, even if you prefer to listen to internet radio, podcast, aso... this smartphone can deal easily with all the audio source you want to feed it.Fan of gaming or video watching ? Thanks to the dual-core processor, you'll be able to enjoy all your favorite games (and with often heavy processor needs) with no slowing or lagging.All those things I said further are wonderful, a lot of pros things.. but is the smartphone a \"perfect\" one ?

It feels good, has a great screen, it's fast and smooth in operation...I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't that it has a crippling bug, known as the 'Home Screen Button Problem'.This bug appears, seemingly at random, in weak signal areas, when the phone is switching between signal types, and causes the home screen button to act like it's being pressed repeatedly. This kicks you back to the home screen from whatever app you're using, and disables the capacitive buttons until you manually lock then unlock the phone. The main annoyance for me is that it makes using satnav apps while driving a complete lottery - if you get out in the country with low signal coverage, you'll be stopping every few minutes to get the satnav back after this bug strikes.Many users have returned their phones for repair or replacement, but find the phones they get back begin to suffer the same problem after a few weeks.
