Verizon however has changed their policies on this and you can no longer activate a prepaid phone on a post paid plan. This is a profit maximizing scheme that verizon has developed to try and force post pad consumers into smartphones.I now have a useless phone that I cannot activate with verizon and to top it off amazon is forcing me to pay the shipping charges to return it because I was supposed to know that this policy had changed!Maybe a disclaimer on this and similar products would help other consumer not get ripped off.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!!", "Author": "Angela High", "ReviewID": "R2YA9VZFPECI2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I am, in no way, a phone expert. In fact I purchased this phone as an upgrade from a another phone that I've had for a few years. The main reason I chose this phone is because I have a family member that currently owns one and has had great luck with it. Even then I read both reviews that had been posted and consulted with them before purchasing the phone. I have only had the phone a matter of a few days but I am quite happy with it. One review I saw where they said the phone had dismal battery life. That is something I have not experienced with mine. I'm not one that's on the phone constantly but my battery hasn't went below 3 bars since it was initally charged after receipt. On the same review I saw where they said the backlight stays lit. Again, I have not experienced that with mine so that sounds like a defect in that particular phone. My backlight goes off a few seconds after I have last touched the phone. For me, the phone allows me to text the way I want to and yet is customizable at the same time. The camera is the same quality as most other cell phone cameras, not high megapixel but is still good at the same time. All in all, I am very pleased with this phone and am glad I made the decision to purchase it.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Kiara", "ReviewID": "RXOV9TB5PFS3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a good phone especially if your trying to avoid those data plan fee.

For some smallerTelcos, the profits they make selling phonesdwarfs their profits from voice/text consumption.Well, this is NOT a \"smart phone\" - its a \"semi-smart\" phone,esp since it doesn't let one download Android or Iphone apps.The pre-paid plan for it that Verizon has is THE selling point:pre-paid ($50/mo) for unlimited voice, text, and use of themini-web pages - although the latter is almost impossible,because of bugs in either Verizon's or Samsung's software.Enjoy the unlimited voice and texting, and reasonableinternational rates, if you arrange what provider/portalyou want to use for that. After shopping quite a bit, I stuck with Skype for international use.I was forced to go to Verizon from AT&T;, because AT&T;won't port their own numbers to different accounttypes in their own system. Well, I save $20+ a month by using Verizon's prepaid plan (and Verizon was gladto port my number.)", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "What i recieved was junk!", "Author": "LoveGoddess", "ReviewID": "R34N5227Z9NJHH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I owned this phone before I bought a new one my first was 3 years old and stoped charging and i got this and no one can hear me call out and no one can hear the ringer go off the speaker is broken so u cant hear anything and i am very dissapointed with this ..... i wish i never bought online it got here fast and it was great shipping but sent me a bad phone... and they wont replace it or send my money back poor customer service they dont help at all", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004GLIZS8"}}
