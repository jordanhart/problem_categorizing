{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Basic, but durable", "Author": "Manticyde \"Daniel McMahon\"", "ReviewID": "R3RUDI6LRU1TI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for another phone while it was being repaired by straight talk. I really couldn't beat the price of $39 on the straight talk website or at walmart. It's not nearly as fun for me as my smart phone but you get what you pay for. I will say that the battery life  on this is amazing, I haven't charged it in a few days and I use it constantly. As soon as my samsung is back I will switch back, but it does seem to have better cell service. It goes off the att network. I know because if you send a text to your email from one it says yournumber@txt.att.net. The internet on it sucks hard, but the regular texting and calling quality are pretty good for the price.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Free Phone from Straight Talk Website, refurbished...", "Author": "William C. Lukens \"The Mike O'Meara Show Push...", "ReviewID": "R66K5QACDIKKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera on my Samsung T528G died, and since Straight Talk won't send you a replacement until they get your brken phone, this is a great alternative.Straight Talk website has a refurbished Motorola W418G flip phone for $0.00 (Zero) dollars. I did have to buy a $30 service card, but it can be used to add on to my regular plan under the Reserve program.I was all fussy about Straight Talk's policy about not sending a replacement until they got my broken camera phone, but this a a simple fix. Free Shipping , Free Phone, $30 Service Card that I can use on my other phone, and the transition to the new phone was simple.You go to the website straighttalk.com, click on the \"Switch to a New Straight Talk Phone\" and put in your Serial Number. I was switched over in about 30 minutes, no fuss, no muss, and all my minutes and texts and Data switched to the new phone.When I get my other phone back, I just switch it back... I now have a backup phone that I can switch to at any time, and ny wife or daughter can use it too, if needed. Way Cool.I was with T Mobile 2 year contract for over 4 years. It was always irritating to be 'stuck' and on different dates after a few upgrades and service extensions. I will not be going back to a contract phone anytime in he future... And this is a GSM phone I can use overseas if I get the right SIM card.The only thing I don't like is that the phone is locked to Straight Talk. I'm sure someone has a jailbreak code for it, I just have not looked too hard..No Contract is the way to go for me.... Just remember, NO ONE cell phone service works for everyone... It all depends on your travelling habits, where you live, and what you need to do with your phone. Good Luck![...]", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not much more than a basic phone.", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R3EC3VFV0RGZA7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has good battery life, good voice quality, and relatively good service in the area I live.  It is indeed a very basic phone that can make phone calls and send/receive text messages. The camera is a complete joke as is the web browser.  If you add an SD card, it can also function as a USB drive and MP3 player.  The UI for the MP3 player is cumbersome, as playlists must be rebuild manually every time you add files.  Changing ringtones and ringer volume is bit harder than it should be. Another disappointment is that when headphones are plugged in, it assumes you are using a wired headset and it will disable the phone's built in microphone.  Bluetooth worked very well with my computer.Feature phones are not going to be around for much longer, so get one while you still can if you want the absolute cheapest plan available.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "No Frills", "Author": "Michael L. Laughlin", "ReviewID": "R1BW97KZSXGYLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a very basic model. This fact can be a plus for some people because it also makes the phone easy to use. I primarily use this phone to make calls and send the occasional text message and it does well at both tasks. The reception is good to excellent. It does not drop calls even when used in a moving car. The sound quality is good to excellent. It is easy to adjust the volume while you are are in a call and it can get loud enough to be used in noisy environments. I also have never had a caller have problems hearing me. The battery life is excellent. I can use it for several days without recharging it.The downside to this phone is also that it is a basic model. If you want to use a phone to take high quality pictures and surf the web, this phone is not for you. The camera is only a 2 mega-pixel and the Internet is slow.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "i love my phone", "Author": "F.

Straight Talk already had to replace it after a few weeks of use because it just stopped working no matter what I tried to do.  The main complaint I have is that you can not hear the other person very well - even with the volume turned up as high as it can go.  Best to pass on this phone and get one that actually works.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola W418G Cell Phone", "Author": "James E.

This phone arrived and it was broken.  You could make and receive calls however the screen inside did not work and you could not access anything on the phone.  I had to contact Straight Talk to get a new phone.  The phone arrived when promised and I was able to get the thing switched however was very disappointed as until the new phone arrived had to use a Trac phone that we had on hand and spent quite a bit in minutes to keep it going.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I hated it before I turned it on.", "Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "R3GESOQGWMSMNE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone sucks. I mean, I got it for free, but it's only day 2 and I already bought a different model because I just can't stand it.First, I hated it because it was ugly. That's a given though-- I mean, I've never had a nice phone anyway. But this one is REALLY ugly! Then, on DAY ONE, it started spazzing out on me. Screen flashing like it was possessed, turning on and off via it's own evil free will, and generally being awful. Also, it's terrible for texting. You know how you can usually just hit \"send\" for other phones? Nope. This one you have to go through forty-eleven steps and after you hit send an annoying \"cancel\" button pops up, meaning that if you close the phone or accidentally double click \"send\" you'll cancel your message and have to navigate the complicated menu AGAIN. Did I mention this phone is ugly? Yeah, I pretty much hate it.
