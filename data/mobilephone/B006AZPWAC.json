Spalding", "ReviewID": "R1VJEUAEJM3VBW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have to amend my review of the Amaze after owning it for 11 months. HTC's update to Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) has broken WiFi so that it fails to connect to corporate access points. They have had increasing complaints about Bluetooth connectivity with in-car systems. I've found that HTC's proprietary software makes \"Android beaming\" with a straight Android tablet largely futile.The worst problem: my Amaze locks up and reboots, or shuts itself off without reason, several times a month. This is unacceptable in a mobile device, particularly one based on the Linux kernel.Yes, it exhibits these problems even after a factory reset and not updating any applications.T-Mobile and HTC have made excuses for several months, and left customers with phones that only partly deliver on the marketing. Now I'm stuck with a crappy phone, proprietary HDMI adapter that I can't use with another phone, and several charge cables which are likewise specific to this phone.I will never buy another HTC device again. Never.** UPDATE **I eventually discovered one reason for the power problems: simply rubbing the screen (with the phone in \"sleep\") against cloth would cause the phone to turn off. A week or two after discovering this, I bought a Nexus 4 and put this in storage with the battery removed. When HTC/T-Mobile release an update I tried powering it back up ... the battery wouldn't charge at all, the phone wouldn't start. At all. T-Mobile sent a replacement (manufactured circa April, 2012), and this phone charged up the battery and started fine. With the fully charged battery back in the bad handset (the third one I'd received from T-Mobile, by the way), it would power up, but wouldn't charge at all (yes, with HTC chargers and cables, not third party accessories). I sent it back in disgust.The current replacement functions well enough. I've unlocked and rooted it and now use it as a backup. Battery life is still disappointing with a moderate quantity of apps running. But since this phone will connect to my HDTV, I can use it for gaming (my daughter loves it), Hangouts, music, video, reading.The 2013 One is by accounts a fantastic phone, and a few colleagues have bought it. Seems HTC finally figured out how to make a good phone again. But I'm pretty embittered by my experience with the Amaze ... and the Google Nexus 4 is a phenomenal phone in every way.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "WE LOVE OUR HTC AMAZE PHONES!!", "Author": "joo", "ReviewID": "R1ASGL7M2L7JCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 3-4 different BlackBerry models, my wife and I decided we wanted to get something that was a little more versatile. The Amaze had the latest 1.5 GHz Dual Core Processor with 1 GHz of RAM, an 8 mp camera and was T-Mobile's top of the line Android so we chose the best of the best! As it stated, it was an extremely fast phone with plenty of versatility but... What we didn't anticipate was the battery life that it takes to do all of those really cool things compared to our old, battery miser BlackBerries! Once we learned how to manage our battery life by turning off options we weren't using - and bought external battery chargers to keep with us so that we didn't have to just pretend like our phone could do this and that but never use them to make batteries last... WE LOVE THEM!! We tried LG G2x's before these and they were junk compared to HTC's technology and user friendly layout!!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Device - Hefty Price Tag", "Author": "Ron Lunsford", "ReviewID": "R395M3VCPK6GZP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When you consider buying a handset out of contract, the $400-700 price tag can be quite a shocker. HTC has really done an amazing job with the Amaze 4G, but it is already out-shined, out-classed and out-done by the recently announced HTC One series devices.That said, the Amaze features plenty of internal storage, a great camera, a beautiful display and is everything one could want in an Android powered smartphone. The exterior design is gorgeous and it operates on the fastest 3+G network in the country with T-Mobile. Unfortunately, the unlocking really doesn't do much good to those in the US as T-Mobile's 3G/4G network uses specific frequencies that AT&T; and other rivals cannot use. The only real carrier option besides T-Mo is SIMPLE Mobile and their $60 a month prepaid option. This is the sort of device that shines on the AWS frequencies though, so it's definitely worth a solid look if you need to replace an Android device out of contract on T-Mobile.In 2-4 months, the Amaze will be a freebie device on contract and quite a steal. The non-contract/unlocked version will still set you back $300-400 and be worth every penny. For now, T-Mobile offers a great prepaid device for $200 in the Samsung Exhibit II 4g [...] that will easily power you through the next year and doesn't set you back 4 or 5 Ben Franklins.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R2RLRIQ1MVYMQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this phone and it can be pretty overwhelming right out the box. I hadn't upgraded my phone for several years and I have never owned an Android OS phone. (until now of course)That said, I am very impressed with this phone. You may hear complaints about battery life and in call speaker volume. I can tell you that if you aren't paying attention to all the stuff you got running and are trying to max out this phone's capabilities all day long, yes, the battery goes very fast. I ordered an extra extended life battery off ebay for around 40 dollars and I plan on keeping the car charger close by.The in call speaker didn't seem abnormally bad to me. Besides, I doubt you're going to be actually talking on it that much anyway seeing as the features that are packed inside it. But, for those of us that do still like to talk, I didn't find the volume bad at all. I'm not smashing the phone aggressively inside my ear all the time just to hear or nothin'.A couple of gripes I do have are the charger and 3.5mm headphone terminals. It might just be the stock charger, but I find it really difficult to just get the connector into the terminal (pervert ;)). When I try it don't seem to fit and I don't want to jam it in and risk damaging the phone.The headphone jack is pretty rough going in. Then, once the headset is connected, if the jack moves much, you can lose some or all sound. It also crackles a bit when moved and this can be particularity annoying for those of us that are listening to tunes while active.Size is also going to be a concern for some people. Most of the pictures of the Amaze 4g do not do it justice. This is a sizable phone. A side-by-side comparison of my Amaze 4g and my buddies iPhone 4 yielded the Amaze 4g being thinner, but noticeably wider and taller. If you haven't seen this phone before you order it, the size of it will take you by surprise out of the box, at least it did for me.Alright, so on to the goods. The GUI (graphical user interface) is extremely fluid. Processing power is impressive. As long as you pay attention to task manager and manage running apps, plenty of memory. Settings galore. The 5 home screens are completely customizable allowing you to implant any number of apps and widgets. Live wallpapers are pretty sweet too.Complaints about the advertised 16gb of internal storage actually coming out to less than 10 are correct. I wasn't upset about it because that's just how internal storage works. The specifications about the internal storage capacity refer to the drive when its \"bare bones\", meaning nothing on it. Once HTC installs the operating system and Tmobile puts some crap ware on it about 10 is just what you get. Same deal with computer hard drives. If you need more, just grab an SD card or two, they are pretty affordable these days.About crap ware, there really isn't a whole lot on here. The usual malls, account stuff, useless anti-spyware program, and a couple other things but nothing that really bothers me.I would love to review the camera because I have seen a lot of hype about it but I haven't really used it much yet. Maybe I'll update later.To sum it all up, if a bigger phone isn't you, you can't handle the sucky battery life, a ton of settings get confusing or a rough fit for the charging and headphone jacks are really that much of a turnoff, might wanna look else where.But, if you are a bit of a geek, love messing with settings, get excited about little things such as an amazingly bright screen, animated wallpapers, 1gb of RAM, 1.5Ghz processor, almost unlimited apps, a top notch wi-fi card, a great on-screen keyboard, being able to easily detach the back plate from the rest of the phone by this handy little button on the bottom, then this phone is absolutely for you.Although I've been out of the mobile world for a bit, my tech experience is there. I've been in a Bachelor's program for IT for about 5 years (part time) and messing with computers and gadgets is just something I like to do in my free time. I also do a ton of research on phones before I buy. I highly recommend doing the same for phones such as this are a major investment. It usually takes me months to decide on a phone.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone...but  now gets 2 stars instead of 4", "Author": "LoPhat Joe", "ReviewID": "R2K32GVFDLPEEO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok, so the phone has a great screen, awesome camera, runs smoothly, functions great.....but the battery life is POOR. I am by no means a 'power user' and I have to charge the thing EVERY NIGHT!  I turned the screen brightness down, turn the WiFi off when I don't need it but the phone is still a power hog. It also comes with some 'bloatware' that is absolutely useless and uninstallable, that is unless you root the phone (which voids warranty)..  Oh yeah  and it also has  CarrierIQ installed..which for those of you who don't know.Is an application that logs and transmits to your provider  EVERYTHING you do.  All keystrokes, button presses  etc..Update, from the last,,  So the phone now just randomly shuts itself off and reboots for no apparent reason.  Everything is updated & current, which leads me to believe this is the source of the problems.

I'd give it 5 stars and for any typical end-user I'd highly recommend it, but as a nerd there's one problem not related to the phone itself that I'll touch on below.NOTE FOR NERDS:For whatever reason this phone was almost totally skipped over by the developer community, so if you are planning on rooting it and updating the OS you'll be in the weeds a bit.

This is This is the first smart phone I've had that actually has the internal hardware to run whatever I want smoothly and consistently. HTC is great at supporting their hardware and the free update to ICS has kept the phone sleek and modern. I also really like the feel of the phone, many smart phones focus so much on being super light they they end up feeling cheap and I'm worried I'll accidentally snap them like a twig. HTC actually uses metal in their design giving the phone a little more weight and a very distinct feel of quality, with modern design.In short-Excellent Speed-Consistent Software updates-Modern, durable design.-16Gb of memory built right in-4g speed-Micro SD support up to an additional 32gb.-Consphone only comes in white and black.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "strong, but huge learning curve, possible used..", "Author": "K.

You can try contacting them, there's no one to talk or complain about it and they simply won't reply your emails. I've never been able to update it to Ice Cream Sandwich - you can basically forget about it, and there are a bunch of very silly glitches that annoy me and just can't be fixed, such as getting a message every time you connect to a new antenna. When I'm travelling abroad this is the worst thing in the world. I gave it a three month trial. I've also bought one for my dad and he begged me to return it. I'm sick of it and I am returning them.
