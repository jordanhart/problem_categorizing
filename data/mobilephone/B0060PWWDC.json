I don't bring my pocket camera out anymore after I have this baby.  The battery life after I installed battery saver app it lasted longer and as expected with all smart phones.

I will run down the pros and cons for you guys:Pros:Nice camera.Camera flash!4G LTE. Super fast data speeds.Very large screen. Even though I am 6'4\", I wouldn't want the screen to be any larger because then I would need two hands to press buttons in the corners (lol).Cons:Currently there is no root for the recent ZVC update (which fixes some peoples random rebooting), and currently no ROMs, however this will change very VERY soon since a working CWM (clockwork mod) has been built for it.Without the ZVC update, you may get random reboots. I, however, have only had it happen twice in two months.My music playlists randomly disappear. May be fixed with cm7 or ICS custom ROMs when they appear within the first 2-3 weeks of 2012.Overall I really love this camera and when it's rooted and all the MetroPCS bloatware is removed and it's overclocked (it can run at 1.7 GHz stable isntead of the stock 1 GHz speed) it's extremely powerful and snappy. My battery lasts about 16 hours of medium usage before it needs to be charged again with the stock battery, but you can always buy the extended battery.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!!!", "Author": "Spike", "ReviewID": "R22887ESH11UGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 5 months, and I have not had a single issue with it. It has great screen, and it is fast. I would never exchange this phone for an iPhone; iPhone sucks compared to this phone. Not only the screen is bigger, but it is also sturdy. You can drop it as many times as you want, and the screen will be like new. I have dropped it so many times at the parking lot over the five months, and I just have some scratches on the case but not on the screen. You do not need a screen protector with this phone. Most of the Apple bots I see with their cool iPhone have broken screen. And unlike iPhone, it supports Flash, so you can easily browse all the Flash websites.I have used this phone for everything: Skype, 4G hotspot (root required), GPS navigation, alarm clock, browsing websites, watching videos, checking email, messaging, and making phone calls. It has performed flawlessly. Sometimes, I feel that I do not really need my laptop anymore.The only thing that I wish was better is the battery life. On a regular battery, it will last about 7-12 hours on a single charge (regular use without heavy browsing). However, I have solved this problem by buying an extended LG battery. Now, it lasts for about 30 hours on a single charge of regular usage, and for about 8 hours if I use it as a non-stop 4G hotspot. So, extended battery is a must, or you will be annoyed because you are running out of charge. Buy only brand-name LG extended battery from Verizon (on sale for $24.99 for from time to time) for LG Revolution (Verizon's version of LG Esteem) or from MetroPCS (never seen it on sale there). Do not buy cheap Chinese extended batteries!!! I have tried; they are junk and last only slightly longer than a regular LG battery. If you plan on buying an extended battery, do not waste your money on a case, for it will not fit.I see that some people have random reboot issues. I have not experienced a single random reboot. I bought my phone from MetroPCS online, and I unsubscribed my lines from MetroExtras ads long time ago (you have to email them to do it). I am not sure whether there is a defective batch out there, or it is a glitch due to MetroExtras ads.It is a great phone, especially with the extended battery.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Phone from Metro PCS", "Author": "B.

After reading a couple of them it seems like a lot of people are coming from or going to Verizon. Truth is this phone and service isn't as good as Verizons, but considering it's less the half the price you would pay at verizon, it's really good. I had a T-mobile mytouch 4G which I lost and got this phone as a replace ment. This phone kicks the mytouches a*s!! I paid like $500 for the mytouch because I wanted to put simple mobile service on it. Well, I guess it was the $40 dollar a month simple mobile service but my mytouch was super slow, youtube was a joke and too frustrating to even bother with. The camera and video worked pretty good, but this phones camera and video work just as good. Plus youtube using the $50 dollar a month plan with MetroPCS is FLAWLESS. In fact it works better then my home wifi connection, when i watch videos on my phone at home using my wifi connection it might stop and pause some, but still pretty good. It's nice and loud, picture resolution is super clear. The phone hasn't frozen on me yet but I did get a black screen of doom today :( I hope my cute phone doesn't make that a habit, but so far that's the only real complaint I have.So if your comparing this phone and service to Verizon then yeah, you're bound to be disappointed. I'm coming from T-mobile/simple mobile and I'm impressed :)Great phone at $50 dollars a month (plus $5 insurance since im a clutz). If you need an awesome phone for videos, music, photo's, calling, try this one. Anything more then that, get ready to shell out at LEAST $120 a month with verizon.

It has a HD camera, I can take the clear pictures and use the photo printer to print them. iPhone3's front-facing camera is not clear enough, but I heard iPhone4s has the more clear cameras. I think the cameras in this phone are good enough for me.This cell phone has the Android OS, I think it's better than Apple's OS. I can be free to use this phone. In the Android's market, I can use most apps, but in the Apple apps store, there are some apps I can't use. In another hand, some apps of Apple have the higher price than Android's, it is unfair. I like Android OS.I like this phone but it also has some shortcomings. For example, this phone has the big screen, it is nice when you watch video, but it also uses the power up easily, so I have to charge it everyday, even I have to take it when I go to school. When you choose a smart phone, I think battery is a very important part. Sometimes, it is easy to be hot after I play it, so I always open the back cover.Here is my openion, I like this phone, but when you choose your phone, please be careful, dan't choose a phone that you don't like it.5 stars!!!", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mixed Bag...nice phone, service?

Suos \"Heat\"", "ReviewID": "R3DWY76ZGF83O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got this phone to replace a lost phone, and decided to try the prepaid route after having been a contract-subscriber for the longest. In this review, I would actually rate the phone itself 4 stars, but the service (MetroPCS) 2 stars, hence the balance in the middle.I'll start with the good. The phone itself is pretty good, great features, build quality for a prepaid carrier. It is, as of this writing, the top-of-the-line Android for Metro (until the LG Connect actually ships). Great screen quality, and not a bad resolution for mid-tier Android. The phone is heavy, but not too overbearing, and Gingerbread OS works smoothly. 5MP shooter is pretty mediocre, but lots of settings for both stills and vids. 4G runs great (when there's service). Only couple drawbacks are the dinky micro-usb charge port door that you have to pry open every time in order to charge/sync your phone (and you'll be needing to do that often!)I believe after regular use, it will just fall off. But the main con of this device is the atrocious battery life! It is terrible! Believe the reviews! You'll need to hang onto your charger every where you go if you intend to make it through the workday. EX: I had it pulled off the plug at 12PM today at around 78% remaining, and at 4:40pm, it went down to 15%!! This just about 10 mins of calls, some data usage, no streaming or anything else. I had blue tooth on and wifi, but thats about it. At 5Pm, it went down to 6%!Now, onto to the service. It may vary from where you're located and travel to, but Metro has a reputation for good reason. The plans are cheap for a reason. When 4G works, I get about 4MB/ps down/up, which is pretty good, not LTE like they claim, but not bad. (better then my home wifi!) But if you don't, you get 1X service (aka 2G), or else \"No Data\" and you can use NO data-intensive services. Calls would go through, but not very clear. And you better be doing your work outdoors, because indoor reception kicks the bucket.Oh, and did I mention that I get NO incoming text messages? None. I can send, but not receive. Have been on the phone w/ cust serv, flashed the phone, reprogrammed it, shut down, reboot, etc....and still not working. Had to use google voice to route txt's to the phone. Unacceptable.

I bought the phone originally from an online dealer for about $350 Nov 2012 which could have influenced the quality. Metro Pcs was gracious enough to replace this phone 2x for me within a month of buying it even though I did not buy it through their official site, which is probably why I ended up struggling to make it work until yesterday (2/25/2014).So what's wrong with it? It's slooooowwwwww, slow to boot up (5 minutes, I'm not kidding), slow response on most every app, the battery life sucks big time (you will need to charge in the middle of the day--I ended up buying an extended battery which made the phone very heavy and clunky just to get battery life from 9-5 pm--and I am not a big time user, I listen to some tunes maybe check my email and send a couple of texts throughout the day), the phone becomes intermittently unresponsive--one day it works okay the next you can't even make a phone call or send a text much less listen to music or get on the internet. Granted I'm not sure how much that has to do with Metro or the phone but let's just say even while on my home cable high speed wireless network I was often not able to make this phone work. And I should note that I live in Oakland CA--hardly the boonies. I took this phone back to Metro repeatedly--had it rebooted and reactivated and updated several times and every time it would work great for a few days or weeks and then just start acting up again. Very disappointing first smart phone purchase, after spending so much money I didn't want to admit that this phone was a lemon--it is! Run form this hunk of junk like the plague!!! I seriously can't understand how LG is still in the cell phone business--it's not like you can say this was just one bad phone--I owned 3 separate versions and all of them failed--epically!So to finish my story, yesterday I tried to call my husband at home and couldn't get the phone to even dial--I decided I had had enough! I found a Moto G on Verizon's website on sale for $100 and they only charge $50 a month--just $10 more than Metro--my piece of mind is worth it. The Moto G is the hottest phone on the market now for the price since Google took them over. I'll post a review for that phone after a few weeks. Good bye LG and goodbye Metro.

If Verizon has the exact same that should tell you something on its own. The first thing you need to know this is bigger than IPhone 4s. It has a great processor it plays 720 .mkv movies for my daughter or anything you can throw at it. I've installed a 32gb card (for $32 not bad) so it's got plenty of space. The display is actually better than real life. I found myself staring at a picture which was looking better on the phone's display than on my 27\" monitor. Android 2.3 are better than good it's great.  I use to own windows phones and I remember all the tweaking I have to manage to be able to use GPS and various applications. Therefore I'm in love with the market and applications it's offered. All in all 4.5 stars because the minor flaws I found annoying.Problems so far I've discovered: when I use Bluetooth in my car switching between conversations just does not happening. I tried many times but it switches into the other line but then silence nothing happened. I've asked people on the other line they said like I've didn't answered. I must mention this could be my car's Bluetooth problem or maybe the two together that I don't know. The next thing is if you buying this phone or considering buying it than you better get a car charger and a couple of chargers everywhere you go. Because this phone is going to be on the charger all the time. I've got one in the kitchen one in the bedroom one next to my couch watching TV. During driving you guessed it is on the charger all the time. Normal usage 3-4hrs on a full charge literally by the minute. I've just received the 3000mAh OEM LG battery which is charging right now but I have to tell you it is a lot of compromise. First of all it's heavy second of all it's big. That being said I post a review on that after a few weeks of usage. I use Skype and it works fine although if I receive a phone call during Skype conversation switching back and there is no sound. Quick restart of Skype and it's all good.Final thoughts on this phone every phone comes with a compromise on some level. This one's biggest advantage is the display size and 4g.

I made 4 five minute phone calls and the battery died. Had to recharge the phone 3 times in 12 hours. Takes 3 hours to fully charge the battery--about as long as it takes to discharge it.Apparently, even when you're not using the phone, the Metro Apps keep running in the background, draining the battery life. I've shut several of them off, like the really annoying Metro Extras app that cannot be deleted from the phone. Once you shut this app off it shuts your phone off in a short period of time and resets itself into running mode. This along with the Astro file manager app --which can also not be deleted from the phone, eats up the RAM, slowing the amount of tasks that you can perform on the phone. Try streaming a video or playing Plants vs. Zombies, among other games. The Astro file manager has a task killer running in it. What that means is that you won't be able to play many games because the Astro shuts them down.Don't waste your money on this '4G' phone. It's not worth it. I had a 3G LG Optimus with Metro before and didn't have any issues with it. Thought if I spend a bit more and get a higher processor phone my experience would be better. Instead it's the opposite; I am really disappointed with Metro now. Thinking of switching. Oh and this phone also has periodic spasms of static in the foreground that can really annoy the hell out of anyone using it. And, it does not come according to the manufacturers' specs. Instead of getting 8 GB as advertized, Metro swindles you with a 2 GB phone. The RAM and ROM are a quarter of what they say it is. (Go into a METRoPCS store and check out their boards and then check your phone's specs on the phone itself.)When I complained to the seller in the store 2 weeks after I got the phone, the seller simply called customer service and I got stuck speaking to someone in India who lied to me about the specs and then told me to go to a Corporate Store if I want to complain.Too many annoyances with Metro PCS now. I don't recommend them.Update: 6/6/12  Ok, so I've stuck with this phone and a good thing I did; reading my initial review you'd think that I would've gotten rid of this thing (My original rating was 2 stars). Apparently LG has fixed the glitches cause my phone doesn't shut off anymore and there's no more static. I have also found several other useful features on this phone. The micro HDMI port has been of great use to me (since my girlfriend has no cable or internet at her place), I've been streaming Netflix nonstop on her big screen TV through my phone. Just have to hook up the charger and it works great. MetroPCS's 4G network allows me to stream video with virtually no lag down and the unlimited data plan is a plus.I still give this phone only 4 stars for the lack of battery life. A cell phone is a portable device and should be more energy efficient. I don't like to have to constantly worry about the battery dying. I have ordered an expansion battery and will see how well that will fare but the drawback from that is it'll also make the phone more bulky.Update: 7/2/12 Well, the expansion battery works; I now get an average of 8 hours per charge. I thought that I'd give this phone a 5 now but it has begun turning itself off again--and at the worst moments possible--while I'm talking to people! My gf is pissed at me cause she thinks I'm intentionally hanging up on her and LG and Metro will be held responsible if things go sour in my relationship! Owning this phone is like being on a roller coaster ride. I initially gave it a 2 star rating, then switched it to a 4 star...and now am going down to a 3 star. Seriously though, when the phone works it works pretty well but then it has its seizures and the experience becomes frustrating. Overall I'd recommend it to someone that wants a powerhouse device with many options... but buyer beware, I bought this phone for $250 and Metro has now spiked that price up to $379. Perhaps the one I got came from an inferior batch ( see the memory specs discrepancy above.)Also, service from Metro is not always reliable. When you are in a metropolitan city--hence METRO PCS--the signal is pretty good. Try going upstate though and the phone becomes useless. I got no signal in upstate NY. And because of so many people switching to Metro, the network is becoming overloaded, I guess, since Metro is now putting their 'unlimited' data plan with no slowdown at $70. I'm paying $60/month and was told that data download would not slow down after a specific number of gigs but now if you look at their plans they're saying that after 5 gigs of data the 'unlimited' plan no longer works in the $60 range- in other words if i start downloading a lot of things, after 5 gigs my download speed will decrease. This is still better then Verizon or AT&T; which slow you down after 2 or 3 gigs respectively.And a response to the comment posted under my review...I did look into 'rooting' the phone and the results are not always positive. I'm not much of a techie and don't want to turn the phone into a worthless brick (even though it still is sometimes) in case the rooting goes awry.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST WASTE OF MONEY IN MY LIFE", "Author": "D", "ReviewID": "R11KD6L3T7KT3F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.IT WILL NEVER WORK RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

The screen wouldn't light up when I hit the power button, swiping the screen was very delayed ... Even when I needed to swipe to answer an incoming call. I thought maybe it was the amount of apps I had on there because well ... I had a lot ... So I deleted over half of them and put  basic background on the phone and it didn't help one bit. I decided to completely restore the phone to factory settings. It helped for about a month, then the problems started all over again.At the 11 month mark, I couldn't get a signal unless I was using wifi. No texting, no internet usage ... Literally I could only call out or someone call me. My phone just would not get a signal. So a little before the year passed, I went to metro and they gave me an all new one because I have protection and still under warranty. With the new one, I kept it simple. I only put the apps on that I absolutely needed so my phone is pretty bare.Right now, I'm on month 7 with my 'new' phone and having a whole new set of problems. The screen wont light up, as it did before. I have to hit the power button several times and swipe just to the get the screen to light up. My phone won't get texts just because it wants to not receive them. It will change my sound settings because it just feels like it. It won't recognize my SD card and therefore the music won't play. The browser will shut itself off because it feels like it. The phone will completely restart itself just because it feels like it ... Even in the middle of a call on a full charge.And this is all coming from a person who has never dropped the phone or banged it around.

Wortham", "ReviewID": "R2IB2PVXSNERGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this phone. It is the best phone I've owned since I started buying cell phones about 13 years ago.LG is a great company for cell phones. I've owned Samsung and Motorola phones and LG is by far the best for user experience. In fact, I went from a Motorola (my second and last one) to an LG and was stunned at how much easier and more intuitive the phone was to use.Of the brands I've used over the years, LG has always been the one that seems to focus on the user experience more so than the others.Anyway, back to the Esteem.It has, or had until very recently, one of the biggest screen available. It uses Gorilla Glass which is a tough glass to help keep your screen from breaking. I doubt I'll ever get another phone without GG or something equivalent. I've seen lots of other phones with cracked screens.8G of memory. Man that is a lot of memory. There is a slot for an SD Card so you can expand if 8G becomes too small. When I got my phone the firmware version was ZVB. I just upgraded it to ZVD with LG's software.It's an Android so the sky's the limit on what is possible with the phone.It is easy to root if you of a mind to do that. If you do, you can get rid of that stupid 'MyExtras' app that Metro shackled us with. Once rooted the world opens up even further to using custom ROMs (basically it is a customized operating system for the phone) and highly customized kernels (basically the brains of the operating system). As far as I know, rooting voids your warranty.If you look at all the 1 star reviews they are all about the same thing - frequent and random reboots. My phone did that too I was very disappointed. I went to the corporate store where I'd bought the phone a week or two before and they took very good care of me. I had to wait a week or so for a new phone to come in but it was a no cost swap out.I don't know if all the bad phones have been purged from LG's inventory so make sure you ask about that and the return policy if you get a bad phone. You should see the reboot problem very quickly. If the 60 minute talk time applies then make sure you don't exceed it before you know your phone isn't defective. At this point I'd be pretty surprised if that is still an issue though.I can't remember off hand if I'd exceeded the 60 minute thing or not.Either way I'd like to thank the folks at the corporate store that sold me the phone and then got it taken care of later. This office was located on a different street with a different staff. That staff was sadly typical of the rampant crappy customer service that the entire country is plagued with. When the moved the store about a mile away to another location they put in an all new staff. And what a staff! Very friendly and helpful every time I've gone in. That is a stark contrast to the other location's staff.It is still an expensive phone but I'm sure the price will drop when the next premium phone is added to the inventory.There are a couple of apps that will make your experience that much better:WiFi File Explorer PRO - there is a free version too but I have never used it. This app is super simple to use and makes it so easy to add/delete files from your phone. I listen to a lot of podcasts so it is very handy.For the podcasts, I use Mort Music Player from the Android Play market. It is donationware but fully functional. It is a folder music player.I use another Play app called AlarmDroid for an alarm clock. Also free.I use Digital Clock by socialnmobile. I put the phone on the charger and use this clock as my nightstand clock. Love it.JuiceDefender - Battery Saver - Short of rooting the phone and installing a custom kernel  you'll need this app or one like it. Or always have your charger available. Or maybe both depending on your use of the phone.Get Google's Chrome browser and then get the extension 'Chrome To Phone'. Search for 'Chrome To Phone' on Google's Play market. Amazon has an app with exactly the same name but it apparently isn't from Google.I use Chrome To Phone all the time. I make a short list of stuff to get at the store then zap it to the phone's clipboard and paste it into a memo app. Very cool and a whole lot less tedious than trying to type directly into the phone. You could just email yourself stuff from your PC and get it on the phone that way too.Great phone. You'll love it.

It was my first ever smartphone and i though it was amazing at first but the honey moon did not last long. One of the main problems with this phone was the abysmal battery life. When i say bad, i mean BAD. Metro PCS advertises this phone as 4G phone but don't you dare turn the 4G one unless you are planning to recharge the phone at noon. Last week i was waiting in line and decided to stream Netflix for a bit while i waited. I watched for about 45 minutes and the phone was at 50%. That is not acceptable. You can try putting an extended battery but the phone is going to look super bulky and some of the cases for the extended battery make the phone look like an inflated balloon.Another thing that really bugged me about the phone is that there is not nearly enough RAM. If you have a couple of apps open the phone tends to lag and it sometimes reboots on its own when under a lot of stress. The phone becomes unresponsive at times when you are trying to hang up a call, it is very annoying.One thing i did like about the phone a lot is the build quality. This phone is very, very tough. I dropped mine at least 10 times and besides a few minor scratches on the corner it looked like new. The screen has gorilla glass and it never scratched. The screen is a smudge magnet. But then again most smartphones are.The camera and the display are the best thing going for this phone. The screen is big and bright and the colors are nice. They are not as pale as the Nexus 7 colors but not as saturated as the Galaxy S3. The camera takes decent pictures during day time.Overall, i just don't recommend this phone. It is costing $180 bucks at a Thanksgiving sale on Metro PCS but i really do not recommend it. The Samsung Galaxy S3 is discounted at $400. If you can spare the cash might as well go for it.
