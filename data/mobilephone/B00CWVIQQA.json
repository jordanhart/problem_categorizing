{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I LOVE THIS WATCH PHONE!!!", "Author": "Timothy P Alexander", "ReviewID": "R36AYDCCHN15MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the ultimate Dick Tracy Watch Phone.  A note of caution though.  You need to have at least a bit of tech know how to get this phone watch to its full potential.  It is not only a great phone, with a very loud and clear speaker, bluetooth, and messaging, it also has the capability to hold two SIM cards and connect to wifi.  It has a gmail ap and a  google Maps ap.  A really nice video and audio player.  Once again, it has a very loud and clear speaker.  Very surprising for a watch phone that size.  It comes with a camcorder, a camera with a time delayed shutter,and  a voice recorder.  It is also Java enabled.  It is loaded with some cool retro style video games. Tetris, breakout, and a really cool Super Mario game are ready to play. It has a very nice Fm radio with manual or digital scan. This Fm radio also has a pullout antenna that comes right out of the wristband.  The FM radio also has a feature that allows you to record a song on the radio, store it, and then listen to it whenever you want.  You can use the keyboard on the wristband and it also has scroll buttons on the side of the watch.  It has a very user friendly touch screen, but you will want to get a stylus for the small screen.  It has a handwriting feature that makes it easier to input the letters on the small screen.  The watch band is also totally adjustable to fit very snugly to your wrist. If you don't like the wallpaper it came with, it also gives you  a lot of other nice options to choose from.  It comes with 2 batteries, but you especially need to read the instructions on the batteries. You are not suppose to charge them until they have completely died.  Then you can fully charge them. If you follow the instructions both batteries are very strong and long lasting. If Dick Tracy was a real person, he would be wearing this watch. :)", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Customer Service for this product", "Author": "Mark Grant", "ReviewID": "R1O7QK290EBD8L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "03 DEC 13 - question to me was, does this watch need a seperate Smartphone to function.  The answer is, no, this is a stand alone cell phone / watch combo.  YOU provide the two SIM cards and the data storage chip and it works fine as a phone.  I really like that it is dual SIM Cards.  Blue tooth worked fine with Dr. Dre in-ear head set and fine with JawBone ERA.  I am using SIM cards for ROSHAN and ELISAT here in Afghanistan and I have made calls and received calls just fine on both.  I suspect using it in a country where coverage is more reliable would yield better service. My main gripes now that I've used it some are in order of importance to me: it is not water resistant, the battery pack is very fragile - my battery pack broke the third time I had the back off the watch and I was being careful.  So what I did was take it to a friend of mine who repairs gyro cameras here in Afghanistan and had him re-solder the wires to the battery; we used slightly thicker wires as well. I also have the TW18 Smartphone watch and it only has single SIM card capability.  Still it is more water resistant that the X8.  Calls and Bluetooth using the same two sets above are comparable to each other.  While I wish the TW18 was dual SIM capable I prefer it in looks and functionality.  The drawback is that you really need a small stylus for the TW18.  Which I made myself.  I filed down an old pad lock key to a point and dipped it in plasti-dip to rubber coat it so as not to scratch the face of the phone/watch, made another stylus from a plastic fork tine - yes the kind you get at a fast food joint, and made another fancier one out of a plastic knife - again yes, the kind you get at a fast food place.  I cut off the blade near the handle and made a little point with a emery board (for finger nail filing) and re-enforced the sides of the knife handle with wooden coffee stirrers cut to fit and glued on with a little bit of superglue and then dipped it in plasti-dip one end at a time allowing each end to dry separately. YOU do not need a capacitive stylus with the X8 or the TW18, something inexpenive will do.  A toothpick will do, a coffee stirrer, almost anything will work.  I only went to the trouble above to make mine so I'd have something to do after work hours to occupy me for a little while.27 NOV 13 - update - the standby time for this phone is NOT 50 hours.  Not even 24 hours; it's maybe 12 hours; plan on charging it daily.  Battery is poor quality and wires broke after the third time I took off the back.06 NOV 13 - 4 stars is mainly for the customer service.  The product is average of about a 3 to maybe a 4 stars. DigitalFamily Customer Service will work with you should you have any issues, be persistent - but they will work with you. Keep in mind they retail sell the product - they don't manufacture it.  Team, I received this cell phone watch on 28 OCT 13.  My assessment is that cell phone watches are still fairly new and they will get better in the future.  So a little over a hundred dollars gets you a usable but not perfect cell phone watch combination.  There are many different models on the market.  I bought this one because it has two sim card capability.  YOU probably can't get one right now that has all the features you want in one package.  I wanted two sim card capability, at least good water resistance, and a camera on the face of the device.  I got one of the three things I wanted in the device.  Keep this device out of the wet or damp weather it's not sealed - keep that in mind.After using it at Camp John Pratt in Afghanistan for the past 9 days I can say this about it.  Instruction manual is not that detailed so you'll have to figure out a few things on your own, like installing the sim cards.  Put them in face down - metal to metal contact and slide the holder tab forward and lock  the sim card in.  BlueTooth:  I am able to call out and receive calls using the Bluetooth feature with no problem.  As for the phone itself, I like the I can see the screen in sunlight, not great but well enough to use the cell/watch.  I have two sim cards and can receive and make calls on both, I can talk and hear fine using the built in mic and speaker but you'll still want to get a blue tooth device and make it work.  Get a basic blue tooth device if you don't already have one - not the latest on as it might not work on this cell/watch.My charger unit was faulty but DigitalFamily Customer Service did refund the cost of my having to buy a replacement charger unit.  Hopefully yours will work just fine. The charger is for 110V AC with 60Hz ONLY.  Be careful to note that for those of you who are in 220 V AC 50 Hz regions.Once again, be advised that the back is not sealed so take care and don't get the cell/watch wet.  If you wear long sleeves in wet/damp weather chances are it will be fine, but it does not like humid weather or fog so be careful and keep it covered.  In warm dry weather it should be fine.Get or make yourself a fine point stylus or get very used to the qwerty keyboard on the side of the watch.  It's needs to have a fine point so I made a stylus from a coffee stirring stick.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CWVIQQA"}}
