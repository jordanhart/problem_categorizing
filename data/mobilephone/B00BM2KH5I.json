{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S2 plus 9105", "Author": "Parag Gujarathi", "ReviewID": "R11PCX2GOA9BHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To start off, I was confused with which phone to buy! S2, S3, S4  all are in the market!! But I went by a strict budget that I had in mind $300 and believe me the phone is more than worth it.The only thing that you need to be very careful about is S2 and S2 plus. The S2 plus has number 9105 while S2 has the number 9100. S2 plus has a few minor enhancements as compared to S2 the major one being the OS Android 2.3 vs. Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean).One thing you need to keep in mind there hardly are any feature differences between S2 plus, S3 and S4 that i will be using and hence it tilted my decision in favour of S2 plus.NOTE : BEWARE S2 (with old OS) costs more and is sold on this same site. I was about to buy it, but then realized that Samsung has released S2 plus with the latest OS!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "buenisimoooo goooooood", "Author": "PAOLA", "ReviewID": "RAAP961C88BH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "exelente telefono , alta resolucion en fotos , e imagenes , no me equivoque en elegirlo a el el tama\u00f1oa adecuado , justo lo que buscaba y viene con la ultima vercion de android lo recomiendoexcellent phone, high resolution in photos, and images, no mistake in electing me to the the right Tamanoa, just what I was looking for and comes with the latest android vercion recommend", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BM2KH5I"}}
