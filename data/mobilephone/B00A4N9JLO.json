It was about 8:30 PM and getting dark. I was unable to find it. The next day I was not able to go into the river with goggles, to try and find it until about 4:30 PM. After searching a few minutes, with the help of my 17 year old daughter, Sophie, We found my phone. As I lifted it up out of the water it instantly started receiving Text Messages that I was sent during the day, and it was working perfectly! I could not believe it! It was in water that was only about 2 1/5 to 3 feet deep, but still pretty impressive. Try that with your  fancy IPHONE!!", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong item", "Author": "Jim A", "ReviewID": "R27QWPKNSZ9UZB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The cell phone itself is excellent. Very rugged & sound.  I would have no problem with the item itself if I had been sent the item I ordered. I have a big problem with the transaction. I ordered this item from Megadeal-a 3rd party seller. The item states no camera in two places. Where I work, I cannot have a camera phone. When the item arrived, it had a camera. I contacted Amazon who put me in contact with Megadeal. I was informed there was a 15% restocking fee and I would be responsible for paying the postage. After a number of e-mails, The transaction did not get any better.  I do not think this is acceptable.

And the G'z Suite of built-in auxillary features is also very useful. Good battery life, too.  Where it really falls down bad is on it's every day functionality in regards to the firm-ware. For example:1. I want to program the big red button on the side for one function: to mute the ringer when the phone is closed and in my pocket and ringing during a business meeting. One can program the big red button to do almost ANYTHING except that function!. To mute the ringer, one MUST open the phone and push the \"quiet\" button. Bad form for most instances when I need this feature.2. I want to block a few phone numbers, at least send them directly to voicemail, never want to answer them. Cannot block phone numbers on this telephone, not at any level.3. I NEVER want to use the voice recognition feature, nor do I want my phone to turn on in my pocket and start talking to me. NEVER. Can I disable or turn this function off so it does not work, even accidentally? Not that I can find. Default setting is \"on\".4. I NEVER want to use the PTT funtion, and I don't want it clogging up my numbers list, either. I will never use this function, think it should be removed from all telephones. They do allow me to turn this feature off, but the default is on, and all PTT entries that are already in there must be removed manually.5. The auto-focus on the camera has never worked right, not even once. Blurry pictures almost every time, unless in full daylight.6. I do not want the outer window to display the number or person I am currently talking to while I have the phone on my ear. Privacy issues abound.7. Often, when I push the camera on button, it loads up the web browser instead. Not always, just enough to be frustrating.8. A clock with a seconds display of somekind would be most helpful. I am a radio broadcast engneer, and being even a few seconds off can cause problems. 10 seonds doesn't seem like much, unless we are talking silence and dead air. And the clock should be visible even when I am talking on it. No, especially then!9. I want a setting where it both rings and vibrates. I am sometimes in an area when I cannot hear event he loudest ring. You must choose one or the other, cannot get both at the same time.You might think I am nit-picking, but the phone I had before this, an old Samsung that lasted me almost 5 years, operatered just the way I wanted it too, always got signal, had better battery life. The charging jack broke, or I would still be using it instead of this high-priced example of poor firmware writing skills.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Casio was just what I was looking for-", "Author": "R M Pettway", "ReviewID": "R3UKJ4VF5LYLUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a cell phone that was rugged to replace my Samsong that I purchased from Verizon over a year ago.
