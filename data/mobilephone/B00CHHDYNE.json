It's hard for me to tell the difference between the 720p screen on SP and the 1080p one on HTC One. Snapdragon S4 is enough cause I never play games on a cellphone. And $319 is a good deal - BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A USED PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't know if every phone sold from amazon is like this, but the seal on the box was broken - and the whole box was so shabby! I opened it and found the plastic bags for user guide and power cord were missing and there were dust on everything. The screen film has quite a few bubbles and was not in place at all. And there was a little scratch on the back. Xperia SP is a good phone at great price but I would rather pay an extra $55 to get a unused one from the Sony store.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best mid range phone!", "Author": "Besh", "ReviewID": "R2A01PG5A8TDVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone has some pretty cool features ( LED illumination colors that you can customize the way you want). Also, you can extend the memory with a micro SD card. Above all, the thing that I love about this phone is it's built quality, man I got to tell you it's solid!  The plastic of the phone is not cheap and cheesy as some of the other manafactures. Instead it is very well made, and the slides are covered by aluminum.Pros:1- A great bright 4.6 inch display panel that's razor sharp and reflects vivid colors with the Mobile Bravia engine from Sony which makes it epic for watching pictures and movies.2- The phone is upgraded to android 4.2 Jellybean! So enjoy a smooth experience.3- The built quality of this phone is superb! I mean it.4- Do you enjoy playing games? Then you will be glad to know that with this phone, Sony allows you to use a separate wireless  controller to use it as if you were playing games with your PlayStation! You can order it now, and all what's left is to access the PlayStation mobile app on the phone and enjoy.5- loud and clear speakers! This applies for both internal and external speakers.6-  A great 2400 battery capacity that will get you through the day even with heavy usage.Cons:1- The viewing angles aren't great, but after a while you get used to them. This only applies when looking to the screen from a far angle, however, looking at the screen directly is a pleasure.2- Most of the latest xperia phones are water resistant, however, sadly this phone isn't one of them.If you are looking for the best mid range smartphone tha trust me you won't go wrong with the SP, I am very delighted and pleased with the phone, it's easily one of the top phones I've owned so far, and yes I've owned plenty along the road from different brands.Hope this helps! Happy shopping :)", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Pa", "ReviewID": "R12RXP5VMG4F7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this phone. Interface is neat and it's got some great features. As a first time android user I am very satisfied. I have not had any issues with Wi-fi whatsoever. The range is great and it maintains a good connection. Camera is so so but more than enough for me. Hopefully future software updates will remove some of the graininess of the photos. Someone I know commented that the phone is a bit thick. The iphone is not exactly paper thin either. It feels great in your hand and is a pleasure to hold. It also gets a little warm which I imagine will be nice during the winter months. The dedicated camera key is an excellent addition. Everything so far is absolutely great with this phone. Screen, features, it's got it all. The speaker is actually not the best. But the radio does work very well. Battery life is awesome. Perfect phone for me. Light bar at the bottom is also a lot of fun. I doubt you will regret buying this phone.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE", "Author": "Rosa Gonzalez \"Jonathan\"", "ReviewID": "R16TIBCV5BDVHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hve had the phone for 3 days and I have to say great buy. I am usually the one to get the \"flagship phone\" with all the newest features, but this phone just called my name. For a mid-ranged phone, the SP does beyond a exceptional job. Its illumination bar makes it unique. Get Light Flow so you can customize it even more!!", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly SPlendid", "Author": "Joshua Ramirez Wharwood", "ReviewID": "R3VO81HNLYR6F1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After my XPERIA TX met its end in water, my first intention with this phone was to use this as a placeholder until something better came along. But truthfully, after a few weeks of using it, I can say im fully content with what it has to offer. I'm a big fan of Sony's aesthetic, and this is no exception, from the UI, to the physical design, to the quirky transparent antenna/notification LED, it all fits together nicely.Also, the innards may be last year's tech, but it doesn't seem to slow the phone down. Everything feels snappy and on point, so much so I haven't felt the urge to install any custom ROM or tweak anything. And the battery life is fantastic. You can go for about a day and a half while on HSPA+; 2 days if you use it moderately.My only complaints are the screen is terrible in sunlight, it comes with a lot of bloat out of the box, and the notification light is BRIGHT - so bright if I get a notification at night it can light up the ceiling with little effort, and there's no way to turn it off during sleeping hours. Otherwise I am enjoying it.All in all, if you want something that looks good, performs well, and straddles that line between midrange and high end, you can't go wrong with this phone. Will I hold onto it if something greater comes along? Maybe. But it'll have to be really convincing.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "pretty good", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R30QMQF6KD8GID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "phone works. battery is good. bottom glass has different color notifications for texts and stuff. camera is ok but a little grainy if you care about that stuff", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money", "Author": "SL", "ReviewID": "RPW71SZY1C50K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this phone as a gift to a friend who lives in South America. Works very well in a country where 4G is still a dream. The reason for the 5 star rate is the combination between price/size/features/quality. The only other phone below $350.00 would be the Nexus 4, a real bargain but no longer can be found at the Google's website. The Xperia Sp has everything an Android phone should have, decent camera,decent size, fast enough,Sony software suite and low price compared to the other major brands. I highly recommend this phone, being an Iphone 5 user myself.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for Unlocked phone users, light,durable, fast, and bit fragile.", "Author": "Shan Khan", "ReviewID": "R2AE1IWDMIHUNW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After careful reviewing the product I purchased this product from amazon. As a constant user for Sony Products, I've alwayed enjoyed the reliability and quality of their products as they will last along time. Sony Mobile website was about 50 dollars more and there wasn't much added warranty for buying directly from sony and paying 50 bucks more. So amazons price range was very reasonable. The only thing i didn't understand was that each color was priced differently but it's the same phone.About using this phone for a month, I have had a good experience, as a user. My last phone was highly outdated version of Xperia X10, so upgrading to this phone was a blast. The battery life on this phone is amazing with the option of Stamina Mode under power management settings. I go at least three to four days without charging using stamina mode and about 1 day and half without Stamina Mode. Most websites brag about the quad-core processors but this dual core processor on this phone is very fast and comparable to other smartphones running a quad-core.I haven't really looked into other added features that most smart phones have but it is okay for user who uses their smartphone for moderate use. The camera mode is okay but not great. My Xperia X10 came with a document mode which allowed to clarify the document before pressing the shutter button so the words/texts/images come out clear. On this phone, it's a hit or miss. Other than that, the low-light option and added special effects features enhances the camera qualities. I have no complaints, the camera takes good photos.The few things I didn't like about this phone was that the outer frame, battery cover,  and edging is very cheap.I would've expected a more durable casing from sony as my X10 had. The plastic on the battery cover is very cheap and easily be damaged if a person with alot of strenght try to repackage the case, he/she can break it. I had the Xperia TL for a breif while in summer and it was very tough-built as well. Also, I'm curious to see how long the battery ( since this is my first phone with a non-removeable battery)  will have longevity as most batteries wear-out after constant charging.Notice: this is my second phone replacement as Amazon was superb and fast about handling returns/exchanges. Since the original phone I bought, my phone's glass shattered as being placed on my kitchen counter. This is my 2nd SP.  The glass is very sensitive and can shatter so I would recommend you to buy a durable case and shield protector for the front glass before you buy the phone. Also, it might be the Jelly Bean version or just the built in features but I having trouble hiding my apps, saving my apps to my 32gb SD memory card, and deleting pre-loaded apps that eat up at least 2gb my internal memory space. I will try to contact Sony Mobile for additional support and hopefully I can get some help.Overall, the phone is good price for your money. I'm on a unlimited pre-paid data plan for a 40/bucks a month with unlimited 3g and it is quite fast for me on this phone. The phone loads pages fast, but is excellent for my apps such as wordfued and words with friends that eat a lot of data. I'm not a heavy browsing user but the unlimited 3g i get from my carrier is very reliable and fast for me that I can use it for everything internet related. The few other options I would like to try but haven't is the Playstation network connection, sony product mirroring (streaming phone contents to other sony devices) , NFC tags, and Sony Smart Dock.Pros:Reasonable Pricing for Unlocked PhoneGreat Display and ClarityFast ProcessorSony's Quality and ReliabilityCons:Cheap Casing and Framing, not equivalent to Sony Brand expectations.Shatterable GlassMost Sony fones are known for having a hot battery.Unsure about non-removeable battery.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing phone", "Author": "Thokozile N.", "ReviewID": "R12SGVUNSRH7JN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is amazing.....it met my expectations and more..beautiful exteria,soft touch screen and nyc coulores to suite evrybody's style. buy it..ul love it", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez", "ReviewID": "R2OG9WKEFYHBVK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good phone for mid-level, is an excellent mobile but sometimes the camera and wifi fail generally give four (4) stars", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT", "Author": "Rod", "ReviewID": "R33LTARU331HN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my brother he love it !!! im impressed for the build quality and the screen.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!", "Author": "Luis", "ReviewID": "R2GAWTFKX6MGTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had all kinds of unlocked cell phones but this one meets all criteria, It is not perfect but if you compare it to all other smart phones,this is a great product.
