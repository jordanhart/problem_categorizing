My dad's cell phone has a big crack in the screen so I figured I would upgrade him into something new. He's not a big gadget guy so there was no need for features like a camera or bluetooth or even a color screen for that matter.When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone \"speaks\" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing \"3\" sets the language to English and you're set.Once powered on you can choose to keep the phone in \"Voice Guidance\" mode. This is actually a really user-friendly feature. After you push the Menu button (located to the left of the navigation pad) you can navigate through menu items with the pad and the voice tells you what menu item you are on. This totally makes up for the B/W screen and lackluster icons.Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.Pros:- Great signal strength- Crystal clear calling- Solid battery life- Slim profile looks more sophisticated than it really is- Speakerphone (press Menu button twice when on a call)- Voice guidanceCons:- Spanish manual and default language- Low-res, monochrome LCD screen (See customer images)- No modern bells or whistles- Kinda plasticky feeling- Not for TextersFor the price (Sub-$40) this can't be beat. Just make sure you know what you are getting into before you buy it.Only 4-stars due to the whole Spanish manual/language thing.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Basic Features", "Author": "Ratlab", "ReviewID": "R5TO8I2PYC5J3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A common complaint relating to this phone is the lack of a graphical interface.  The e-paper display limits the phone to alphanumeric characters and a few symbols.  The 8 character display is at times inconvenient, particularly for sending text messages and navigating through the phone book.I find the voice features to more than compensate for its deficient display.  The speaker and microphone function superbly.  If volume ever becomes problematic, the speakerphone is quite loud.One of Motorola's marketing points is prolonged battery life (compared to other phones) because of e-paper's low power consumption.  I would subjectively rate battery life to be \"excellent.\"  The only trouble is the long charging time.  On an up note, the charging port is a cylindrical plug, which I have found in my experiences to be more durable than clip-type connectors, which tend to wear and fail over time.One small annoyance with the phone: from a dead boot (i.e. take the battery out/in and power on)...  The phone's clock seems to be completely internal.  Unlike other phones which retrieve time from the network, the phone always asks you to input the date and time (which is lengthier than one might like).  The phone has a voice-help feature, which audibly dictates menu functions (e.g. \"send a message\"  \"read a message\"  when the corresponding icons appear on screen).  This feature can be disabled, but also resets and resumes from a dead boot.  Therefore, one should silence the phone rather than turning it off.Overall, this phone functions hassle-free to make and receive voice calls.  Any other features like text messaging and alarm clock are slightly inconvenient to access.  Personally, 90% of my mobile phone activity is voice calls.  The lack of texting, camera, games, and the like are no bother to me.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Finally, a phone that doesn't rule your life", "Author": "A.

Once again, thanks to Amazon's unparalleled customer review knowledge base, I got the skinny and knew what I was in for.  I wanted a phone with a screen that was READABLE.  Due to limitations in technology (LCD) and biology (my need for reading glasses), the screen of my little Nokia is only visible when cupped in my hands in a darkened theater.  And even that low-budget phone has too much JUNK to wade through.  (I don't care to do Internet shopping by phone, thanks though)  The Motofone F3 does what a phone is supposed to do - it lets you TALK to people quickly and easily.  It's Electronic Ink screen is amazing - you REALLY CAN read it in broad daylight.  Why isn't any other phone using this technology?If you're interested, please do read the reviews.  These phones are not marketed in the USA it seems - I guess we are collectively just too hip and sophisticated for this quaint little thing.  Mine came \"unlocked\" as advertised - I just transplanted the SIM card from my old phone and I was ready to go.  You have to choose your preferred language, and if you want a manual for the dozen or less functions, you can download it easily from Motorola.Some of the negative reviews are gut-busters.  Did these folks even READ about the phone they were getting?  Maybe it was a gift, I don't know.  \"Box was opened!\"?  That's because they're pulling these from South America or India and unlocking them for you!  \"Has a crappy interface!\"?  It does look like Etch a Sketch, but hey, I don't care to have all my friends' avatars on my screen.  I can speed dial about 15 numbers.  And you CAN send and receive text, if'n you really have to, though I don't think I ever will.  (So counterintuitive... that's why God invented keyboards!)  \"Phone has no color screen! / no MP3 player! / no camera!\" etc...  Well, if that's what you want, you don't want this phone.  I told all my higher-tech friends that I just got two \"Third World Phones\" - and my wife and I love them.Note: apparently some folks did not get \"unlocked\" phones or had other technical problems.  I was lucky in that regard.  (May have been a different vender.)  Also make sure your phone plan uses compatible technology.  Amazon has a little chart at the top of the page to help you with this too.  Thanks Amazon, and Vibe Cellular, for letting me make an informed decision.

That is exactly what I got with the Motofone F3.  The phone I received was originally intended for use in Mexico and the box had been opened, but the phone was in new condition.  I inserted my AT&T; SIM card, powered the phone up and was greeted by a voice prompt instructing me to press 1 for English.  After setting the time and date the phone was ready to use.I was pleased that the Motofone F3 got better reception in my signal-challenged house than my old Samsung phone.  My phone is my watch, so I appreciate that the time is clearly visible on the electronic ink display.  A quick internet search will provide a list of configuration codes that can be used to modify phone settings.Motorola developed this phone for use in emerging markets, so the simple menu system is based on icons and optional voice prompts assist navigation.  I haven't disassembled the phone, but it feels like the internal electronics are shock-mounted.  The phone fits in my hand well and is solidly built.  I like its ease of use, good call quality, speakerphone and long battery life.  The one feature I do wish it had is mute.  This phone is capable of text messaging, but I don't consider it suitable for anything but occasional use.If you like camera phones, phones as fasion accessories or do a lot of texting this phone is not for you.

If you wanted a phone with a camera [that takes bad pictures], an MP3 player [with bad quality sound], a PDA [with crippled keyboard/software] or a GPS receiver [that takes forever to lock and eats batteries], then you should have known this isn't for you.  You would ignore anyone that would buy a minivan and then complain that it isn't a race car and you should also ignore anyone that buys this phone and then complains about what is missing.And almost everything IS missing.  It's a phone - a very good phone. An unpretentious device to make/receive calls and it does this better than probably 99% of the phones you can buy today.  It has great sound quality, a very large and easy to read display, and remarkable battery life.  If you need to send/receive text messages, it can do that, but the large display makes this a capability for occasional use only.For those of us accustomed to nested menus and linked feature lists, operating the phone  is almost too simple and most people trip themselves up in the beginning because they expect it be more complicated than it is.It will make a phone connection when other phones can't find the signal and it will hold on to the signal much better than any of the 'full featured' phones I've owned.  You can read it at night and in the noon day sun.  You can hear it in a car with the windows down.  You use it for a week without needing a recharger.(4 and a half hours of talk time and nearly two weeks of standby time).For what it is - you can't find a better value.  If you want a cell phone that will do everything but wipe your, uh, nose [but do it poorly], then you really shouldn't expect to get that from a phone that costs $33 outright without contract (and you know it...)The English Manual is available online and it is small because there isn't much to explain.To get it to ring (louder), simply push the UP button on the large, round rocker switch in the middle.

Very simple, straightforward, and elegant even. Yes, the screen is weird, and reading or composing text messages takes some learning, but for the money its hard to complain.Though this phone is not feature-packed, it covers the basics and does everything very intuitively.

I opened the back casing--you'll need a tiny torx screwdriver--and left it under a lamp for ~18 hours to dry it out, and it worked just fine afterward.  A pleasant surprise!**I did my research and knew what I was getting--a GSM phone designed for making calls and not for texting or anything else.  It's not clear to me whether I got lucky or whether Amazon has changed their sourcing, but I received a new, English-language, well-packaged box.The pluses, which I was expecting:  it's light, feels relatively sturdy, has easy-to-read screen, good audio and reception quality, and the default vibrate, then graduated ring loudness is very thoughtful.  At least with AT&T; in Atlanta, it also seems to auto-set the time and date when you power it on.  And popping my SIM from my old phone to this unlocked one without involving AT&T; whatsoever was very satisfying.The less good:  battery life is a bit less than I expected, reasonable or not (~5-7 days between charges with <5 minutes of talk per day); same optimistic reception bars (5 bars that magically go to 2 when a call drops) as most other phones; the phone book is pretty hard to navigate, especially when you have a lot of people (say, family) with the same first 7 characters in the phone book, or people with multiple numbers (no way to tag what's office and what's cell, for example).The annoying, because it could easily be different:  the default screen--in contrast with the image that Amazon uses--does not show the date, just the time.  There's no reason it couldn't, there's just nothing there, and no apparent setting to change that.  I didn't realize how often I checked the date using my phone until I couldn't do it.

The word phone is now synonymous with \"hand-held multimedia device\", and though the two are vastly separate, the respective qualities of one are usually judged on its abilities as the other.Let's get this out of the way first: if you send more SMS texts then you have phone conversations, if you want streaming video, satellite radio, web-browsing, an MP3 player, and a flashlight... this is not the phone for you. You're not looking for a phone, you're looking for a multimedia device. Adjust your search accordingly.If, however, you are looking for a well-engineered device that performs the functions of a phone (with some extra trappings) without the clog of nested menus and useless features, this is the device for you.Call quality and reception are excellent. I receive multiple bars where previously I had none. Voices are crisp, and there is no static on either side of the call. The speakerphone is loud, and the mic sensitive enough that callers can't tell when I switch to the speaker.This devices still retains the most useful of phone extras:-phone book-SMS texts-date/time-alarm-speakerphonePhone operation is rewritten from the ground up. There are no shortcut keys, because actions by default are not difficult to access. Every feature is available immediately. Dealing with texts is even simpler. The phone displays each text in the order received, and at the end of each message you have the option to delete it. No complex memory management requiring nested menus to navigate. There are dedicated speakerphone and phone book buttons, and even a voice-prompt for those learning the new display. The only requirement regarding the interface is that the user unlearn what they previously knew about operating a phone.I would highly recommend this phone to anybody seeking a low-cost, high-performance phone.

I have AT&T.; I transferred my contacts onto my SIM card on my old phone, put the SIM into the F3, and it worked instantly.

It does correctly alert you if you missed a call, though. I hope AT&T; adds official \"support\" for this phone in the future so that my voicemail icon will work properly.

Since I only rarely used the extra features (mp3, text messages, camera) on my old phone, I wanted something which was focused on just being a phone.  The Motorola MOTOFONE F3 is almost exactly what I wanted.  It's small (almost as thin as an iPod Touch), light, and the quality of voice calls has been very good so far.  The menu system is very different than other cell phones, primarily because of the eInk screen, which has only two lines for text, and a row of icons for the menu.  It can take a little getting used to, but since there are not very many functions, I don't find that to be too big of a deal.  I imagine that reading/writing text messages would be difficult, but that's not what this phone is for... it's just a phone, best used just for voice.  And for that, it works very well.UPDATE:  Since getting this phone, I have started talking on the phone more, and wanted to get a headset for this phone.  I couldn't find one.  The packaging/manual makes it sound like one is available, but I couldn't find out how to get one.  So I upgraded to a recent Samsung... which is good since I am texting more now, too, and using the camera on the Samsung... which is impossible with this phone.

Harry", "ReviewID": "RA1SB09FAWIAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It seems a lot of people have reviewed this phone and many have complained, basically it stems from not even doing a bit of basic research before buying this phone.There are 2 versions, a 1900/850mhz version that will work IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY with a GSM provider like T-Mobile and AT&, and a 1800/900mhz that will NOT work in the US, it is meant for use in countries that use those frequencies. If you are dumb enough to purchase the US version and expect it to work in France or whatever hell hole you visit, you deserve to lose the money.And to the other geniuses that complained about the manual...seriously, you needed a manual to operate this? anyone can operate this, it has voice prompts. and if the phone starts up in Spanish it gives you the option to change the language.The Motofone F3 is just a phone and text messenger. it uses an E-INK display, that you now are seeing in products like the Amazon Kindle and others, so the idiot who says \"it isn't color\" fails to notice the obvious.Great little phone. it makes phone calls and sends and receives text messages, and that's about it. it does have an alarm, and you can change the ringtone among 9 presets I believe. That's it. No camera, no organizer, no apps, no web, no touchscreen.battery life has been pretty decent, but what is awesome is the standby time. i rarely make calls and I get over a week on standby (in area with a strong signal). If you hold the phone by the bottom, the signal does not get lower.Only things i find wrong with the phone is that the keylock is useless, the keys for 911 are still active, so if you have it in a pants pocket and the volume isn't on off or vibrate you will hear the DTMF tones going off on every step. and you might accidently dial 911 in the process.The other thing is that i haven't found a car adapter yet for this thing.But everywhere I bring it people ask me about it and what it can do.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Unbelieveably good at being a phone!", "Author": "Steven M.

Maybe I missed something?- This one is what really nocked it down - sometimes when I go from an area of no service to one where I know I get service I need to restart the phone to pick up the signal, or else it takes an unreasonably long time.- There is no easy way to display the date.Instead of saying what this phone doesn't have, I will make a much shorter list and tell you what features it does have:- A very clear, easy to read in any light, monochrome screen.- Super basic text messaging.  No T9, no periods.- A very basic alarm clock.- A phone book that is stored on your sim card.- Dual antennas, which I'm sure helps with the AMAZING reception.- Exceptional battery life.- A very loud and very clear speaker phone.Also, it is very, very, very durable.If it's not in the above list, you should probably assume it does not have it.There is no email, no web browser, no camera, nothing.

It's in all the descriptions everywhere.  All I wanted was a rugged, easy-to-use, dependable phone.  Mine was the AmigoKit from Telcel.Pros:- Easy to read: large characters, no problems in sunlight or from far away.  I can see if I missed a call or if I have a message waiting from across the room.  No need to walk over, press a button to check.  I can use it as a desk clock since the display doesn't blank out.- Decent battery life (but see below)- no bells and whistles: i.e. no \"buy ringtone\" button to press by accident.  No longer do I get charged for accidentally surfing the web.- slim- loud- it speaks!  (eng, spa, por)Yet, after using it, I discovered that there are features I do miss that I haven't seen mentioned:Annoyances:- displays \"31410\" instead of AT-T- time is NOT set by network, must set manually, I lose a minute each week.- date is NOT displayed.  Date is also displayed dd/mm/yy which takes a while to get used to, if ever.- battery life only 6 days, not 300hrs (12 days).  I didn't expect 12, but I did hope for 7+.- I can't use the phonebook during a call.- I prefer that they made it so the numbers are raised (tactile).

It is slim, and ultra-pocketable, the number buttons are large, but not too large.It seems to me that this phone does not exaggerate bars, meaning one signal bar is enough to make a reasonably clear call, although one signal bar is a rare circumstance for this phone, as it gets excellent reception compared with my two older phones (LG 1130, and a Motorola V3 RAZR).  Also, the battery status indicator seems to accurately portray how much time is left before charging is required (I ran it on 1 out of 5 bars out of the box for about 30 hours before deciding I should charge up).The screen is one of the easiest to read.  Daylight does not make this phone harder to read; in fact, more daylight increases the screen's readability.  Call quality is excellent with the exception of speakerphone mode, which is a little on the quiet side.Although this phone has a great share of positive features, primarily its affordable price-tag, it is guaranteedly not for everyone.  The main problem I have experienced so far is that the phone has no means of deleting phonebook entries.  Other problems are that the screen lacks the ability and complexity to display text similar to printed-text, and looks more like the readout of a calculator, with pre-set icons to indicate menu selection.  Because of this, letters (such as names) on the phone are displayed with CERTAIN CoMbINATIoNS oF CAPITAL ANd LoWERCASE LETTERS, regardless of which letters should actually be capitalized.Another issue I've had with this phone is that its more advanced settings require the use of certain button combinations to access. i.e. turning off the keypad sounds requires you to press the following combination ***250*^ and these combinations are only available in the phone's manual.  The other major issue is that this phone has no network update for date and time, which means that you'll have to enter the date and time when you start up and from that point forward it slowly becomes inaccurate over the course of several months, until you decide to re-enter the date and time.Overall, for someone who is looking for a no-frills way of making calls on a GSM network, this is an excellent phone, but for those who are more used to things such as a traditional color screen, and the option to do things other than text messaging and calling, this is definitely something to steer clear of.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Plan C phone!", "Author": "S.

If you did, it wouldn't be nearly as good at what it does.2) Durability: This phone is tough.  Not many moving parts, no fancy operating system, solid integrated keys.3) Phone: It makes phone calls well.  The sound is good, the reception is good, the speakerphone is good.  Its alarm and clock functions are fine, its internal phonebook is weak but functional, and it can text in an emergency.4) Minimalism:  There is a certain sexy minimalism about a sleek black phone that doesn't do *anything* except make phone calls.Cons:1) Texting and phonebook are weak.  The phone's display is \"e-ink\", and is limited to 2 lines of 6 characters at a time. (It looks like you are reading a calculator).  If you don't mind scrolling through 12 letters at a time, it's possible to text, but it's not easy.  I wouldn't use this phone to send or receive texts except in an emergency.  Similarly, there is a basic phonebook, but once you store more than a few dozen numbers, it's hard to get much use out of it.2) Handsfree is limited.  The speakerphone is great.  Unfortunately, without bluetooth, you can't use wireless headsets, and even wireline headsets are hard to find because of the custom combination headphone/power jack.3) No other features.  No GPS.  No graphics.  No games.  No videos, MP3s, ringtone downloads, camera, or any of the other doodads we take for granted.Tips:1) Some people have complained that their phone won't activate touchtone menus.  My phone will activate touch-tone menus, but only in speakerphone mode.  When I'm not in speakerphone, menus won't recognize my tones.2) The documentation is minimal.  If you google, Motorola has a much better manual available for download, and there are also a number of unpublished programming codes.Update: According to exhaustive googling, the touch-tone problem can be fixed, temporarily, by pulling the battery for 10 seconds to reset the basic settings.  This has worked for me - from time to time, touch-tone stops working on automated menus.  Pulling the battery and resetting the phone gets it working again, at least for a while.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little phone, good call quality", "Author": "Primadona", "ReviewID": "RCBE4HU7WS5R9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm glad i didn't pay much attention to the reviews saying they got a locked phone. i ordered this from unlockedcellphonekings here on amazon monday night after my samsung died and the t-mobile guy at the mall was telling me to buy a new phone because i don't bet an upgrade till may. I wasn't expecting to get this till monday but it got here 2 days later.Anyway, it came with a little quick user guide that was in english and i charged it up that night and it was ready to use. So far my call quality is better than my old phone....wierd. i was expecting crappy call quality but what you know! it was easy to program (there are lots of program codes online for this fon including if you want your id blocked and what not). i inserted the sim wrong and it kept saying no sim with the blinking x so i called t-mobile and after the customer service took the mobile id number, She said the phone should be ready to use. Of course i realized the gold plated end of the sim goes in last, the clear part goes in the slot first. Battery life seems good for now. i dropped it in the gym and somewhere else and it still works great. the little user guide was helpful in terms of knowing how to send text messages, know how to find the last numbers dialed and what not.Once the sim is inserted right and the phone is turned on, you should have a voice telling you to press 3 for english.From what i know, phone numbers have to be saved to the sim since this phone doesn't have any memory. only one number can be saved per name. it started on vibrate but after toying with it, i managed to change the ringtone.For the $24.xx i paid total, this beats paying $6 per month for insurance on a phone. i miss the color display but i think i'm getting used to this. it doesn't have a camera but then again i never sent pix mssg, only received. so long as i can make calls and send text messages, i'm fine.Another thing that might turn ppl off with this phone is the way the letters show up on the screen when you text.If you ask me, this phone is a good buy.It's thin and it beats paying $80+ for the cheapest t-mobile phone.For the record, i have t-mobile service and i had no problems getting this phone to work.

I happened to have an extra \"family plan\" line on AT&T.; I have only had the phone for one day, but here are some observations and \"tips\": 1) came in a Moto box that looked opened but the phone appears new; 2) I needed to call AT&T; three times to get everything working right. First, I had to verify the SIM number and provide them the phone's IMEI number. They asked if this was an AT&T; phone, and I just said no, it's an unlocked international phone and they had no problems with that. Finally, voicemail did not work out of the box. Apparently, phones pull your VM number from the SIM. I manually input the seven digits to call VM but that did not work either (nor did \"123\"). So, I called AT&T; again and they tweaked it, so there was some kind of infrastructure change they needed to make. Also, you need to find your own manual online (very easy). This phone is made for developing countries and its interface is weird (I'm familiar with RIM and Win Mobile 6.1)--more pictures and just different.

I just won't...it'll sit there and vibrate but no ringing. Once again, missed a few calls due to this problem too.Overall, this is phone with a great concept; it's simple, E-Ink supposedly uses little battery power (thus you can actually remove the battery and the display will still show what was last on the screen), and it's really affordable.

For that purpose, it's an ok phone, but I'd never buy it just to have it.First I'll point out the good things. The call quality and volume are really good, and it looks pretty amazing, I'll give it that.  And I got lucky and both phone and manual are English. But really, that's about it.I think this phone's interface was probably made for the use of older generations or new cellphone users.  It has voice prompts and large numbers and words. The voice prompts are nice.  Without them you would probably never know what you were doing, because the menu is horrible. It is very limited, you can't do much at all, and there are no words, just a few little pictures that, without the voice or manual, you probably wouldn't know what they indicate. When there are words, say you are reading a text or in your phone book, they are so big they rarely even fit on the screen.  You have to pan over the right one word at a time. It's frustrating, to say the least. Sending texts is also a problem, for the same reason that the words are so big, and that the keys are not very responsive to fast clicks.  You have to type relatively slowly or you will end up mistyping.Over all it's ok if you need a cheap cell phone, don't understand or like the more complex ones, or need a quick replacement or backup like me.

First of all, the phone is pretty much as advertised. It is very basic, easy to use and physically small. It looks to be rugged and will most likely stand up to hard use. All the features (not many, I realize) are easily accessible. The sound quality and speaker phone are excellent. In summary, it's a no-nonsense phone for people who only want to make/receive calls and send/receive the occasional text message.Now the bad. In 2.5 months of use, the phone dropped many calls. Sometimes, the phone does not ring during incoming calls and the caller is sent straight to the voice mailbox. In those cases, due to a glitch with AT&T;, there is nothing displayed on the phone to signify that a call was missed or a voice mail is waiting for you. You have no clue unless you call your voice mail so you must do this quite regularly to check for missed voice mails. I realize this may be a glitch with AT&T; and may not apply to other carriers.Sometimes, calling the phone returns a message that service is temporarily unavailable in that area. I have no idea if this is the phone's fault but since the phone returns zero bars from time to time and drops calls, I have to assume the problems may be related.One may claim that some of these problems aren't the phone's fault. I can only respond that I have had a Nokia 6061 for years and under the same conditions, it has never dropped a call or exhibited any of these problems, so no matter what is causing the problems, the result is that the Motofone is not as useful or reliable as the Nokia.You may ask, with all these problems, why give it 2 stars?

But that has me spending $60, which is $200 less than I was spending.So what has this $200 per year savings resulted in? Well, a lot of sacrifices.For one, this phone is just about as advanced as an alarm clock. And looks like an alarm clock. no camera, no fancy ringtones, no games... just a basic digital display. It's thin and light weight, but they make toy phones filled with candy more sturdy feeling than this guy.So far, it's worked quite well, honestly. The limited display can't differentiate between capital and lower case letters, and it may take you a little bit to figure the whole thing out (spanish-only manual)... but if you are as tough on phones as i am, it might be a good choice.  I looked up extra durable phones before settling on this one, and realized thriftiness is my best option. considering i broke several, but also lost some, i would be especially cranky if i invested money in a phone that could withstand a 500 mph crash into cement, only to forget it in a bathroom stall.this phone is great or horrible, depending on what you're looking for. if you like novelty, it can make a great conversation starter. if you have standards, you might be disappointed. but if you have standards, you should want to spend more than $35", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Complaint..", "Author": "Fawaz Alsugair \"FAWAZ  ALSUGAIR\"", "ReviewID": "RWPMXQJSEWK71", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello,  Actually, I couldn't benefit from that device and I was not satisfied with your service.

At first, I had many problems with the F3 because the phone restricts most functions when you have an unsupported sim or no sim at all. Infact if you'd like to change the speaking from Spanish to English you need to use an activated T-mobile sim to even get to that setting screen. Originally I used a Tracfone sim because I have like $100 into my account and the sim card is %100 not compatable with the motofone :(The web is very little help when it comes to error codes or even telling you simple things like when you see a blinking X in the upper right corner your getting an error because of you having an invalid sim, you must have a valid sim to enter number codes or to get rid of the blinking X. Again the blinking X happens when you try to press number buttons without a valid sim\". Program codes are in the ENGLISH manual that can be found here:[...]If you get a \"NO SIM\" message with a \"3-070\" right below it then you have an invalid sim.I was on tech support today and was told there is physically no difference between an international motofone and one intended for the US, They all have Quad bands built right into them. Also tech support stated AT&T; and cingular might work with the phone too, but others like Tracfone or NET10 do not!There are many comments about the visibility in direct sunlight, but very little about dark nights. If you have moonlight or some kind of lit up sky you will be able to read the screen at night from arms distance without using the backlight. I do not know if the backlight can be switched off but it drains the battery noticeably and is always on.The alarm clock is very easy to use, in fact it and the clock is the only thing you fiddle around with when you don't have a sim card. The alarm is really kind of cool sounding and starts out very low with a short vibrate, and the volume progressively increases every 2 seconds or so.The phones battery does not seem to last more then a day if you fiddle around with it like every 5 mins or so.The phone is slimmer then its Tracfone look-alike and it is wider too.If you don't have T-mobile service you can order a sim kit on ebay for under $25.If you don't have T-mobile and have ordered the ebay sim kit and want to change the phone speaking to english while your waiting for your sim to come in the mail, all you have to do is borrow your friends T-mobile sim and install it into the motofone, you will then be asked which language you want to set, 1 or 2 or 3. 3 should be english. This setting is remembered even if you pull your buddies sim card out or remove the battery.Overall, its a damn good phone, I've had it a day now and dropped it already, the phone still works great. Remember to post your comments on whether or not AT$T works or others work on this. I %100 positively can tell you that Tmobile works on the international phone, and Tracfone or NET10 doesn't.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "NOT AS ADVERTISED: Locked to TIGO, interface in Spanish only, could not be reset or unlocked by Motorola or Amazon techs", "Author": "J.

The battery life is nice too.Calls are crystal clear and I get great reception.  The texting option is crap, but if you're a talker then it's not a big deal.

Make sure you buy from a reputable source.The phone has lots of quirky limitations, and you have to be creative to use an address book that can only display six text characters at a time, especially if you are using a SIM card from a more advanced phone.My only complaint is that I couldn't figure out a way to edit existing address book entries. The only thing you can do is delete an entry and create a new one, which is a pain if you want to edit lots of contacts.

Other GSM phones I've used lately have done that. You have to set it each time you turn it on. Also, the charger is unlike any other Motorola charger tip I've ever seen. I just assumed it was a mini-USB or the older style Motorola with the clip and push-button, but it's not. You'll always have to carry a charger  when you plan to be away longer than the battery should last. Finally, the headset jack is shared with the charger, and is therefore completely proprietary. That seems odd in 2008 in the age of Bluetooth and 2.5mm mini jack standards. But, then Motorola seems to be on a proprietary-everything bender the last few years.

Still gets 5 stars.", "Author": "TJ", "ReviewID": "R141IGYBCS1OSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A very basic phone that unfortunately lacks too many features that prove difficult to give up in 2012. It would be an ideal gift for a luddite grandparent, anyone with visual and/or hearing impairments, or anyone who has a difficult time getting a decent signal in their area. It's a superb telephone, but aside from being very good at making and receiving calls (the best I've used) there is little else the phone can do. No calculator, limited punctuation and character options for texting (no periods or capitals), no obvious way to view the current date (other than going into the menu to change it) and certainly no way to have the date displayed below the time contrary to what  you see in every Motorola marketing photo. If you happen to receive a text message containing a picture the phone would not be able to show you the picture simply due to the screen design, but it takes this a step further by somehow decimating the picture message so the message (and who sent it) isn't viewable on any other phone either. What's equally aggravating about this is that the Motofone can't erase those broken messages so the \"new message\" indicator is stuck on. You have to erase them by putting the SIM card (which stores the messages and contact info) into another cell phone and deleting them there.The e-paper display is truly awesome, perfectly readable in any light, and looking somewhat like a calculator display. The phone itself is incredibly lightweight compared to the modern monstrosities, I frequently had to stick my hand in my pocket to make sure I actually had it with me. It's not terribly big, although somewhat larger than I expected. It's probably just big enough that there's a reduced likelihood of losing it. It appears that it should be relatively spill proof. Reception has proven to be exceptional in my house, unlike 5 previous phones from 4 different carriers that could never get any signal whatsoever even outside my home. The phone almost always shows a full signal inside, which is amazing. The battery level indicator drops to about half after a 60 minute call, but I haven't used the phone enough to know if that actually did drain half of the battery. And it is a six year old battery that has presumably never been used since it was manufactured, so take that with a grain of salt. The sound quality is quite clear, and approaches deafening at the upper volumes, the same is true of the speaker phone. The phone can be set up to give voice prompts through the speaker for navigating the menu. The one odd thing about this is that the prompts only becomes audible on the second or third voice prompt, like it's gradually working itself up to full volume. A minor annoyance, and only if you need the prompts, and it seems to be a quirk that a number of other reviews have mentioned.The more I use it the more it's grown on me. It's just a matter of forgetting all the things I've come to expect of a modern cell phone and resigning myself to the fact that it's nothing more than a damn good portable telephone.My phone was purchased through Amazon from L&R; Express for $49.99 + $4.99 for shipping. It arrived very quick, and looked to be brand new with all the packaging factory sealed and the protective film still on the screen.

Carrier specific functions work too, example #999# to check prepaid balance. Comes with seven ringtones to choose from and speaker can get loud. D-pad on front doubles as volume rocker.I'm not a texter so the screen's missing ability to display # (pound sign), ' (apostrophe) and other characters correctly is not a problem for me.

First, all your contacts on your sim card don't transfer neatly into the phone, the names are all messed up with upper case and lower case making it hard to read.  The phone book is not very easy to use either.  Then I don't even know what all the random number that shows up, is it a date? time? code? I don't even know how to reset the date and time.  And the design and feel of the phone looks like a toy phone which we don't mind so much if it works.  We don't use the text message feature on there so it doesn't matter if it has it, but if you buy it because there's a text message feature I don't know you should because it's so primitive.  We also have a hard time figuring out the call history so if we missed a phone call we really missed it and wouldn't know who called us last.
