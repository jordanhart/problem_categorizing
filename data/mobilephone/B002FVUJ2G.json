{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Basic phone for voice and texts use", "Author": "Jojo M \"xPlus Labs\"", "ReviewID": "R3P9VT67KQ0QB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS: Sleek shape with smooth rounded corners, lightweigt (81.9g only). Matte back and side finish make exterior durable to scratches. LCD screen bright and easy to read. Navigation thru menu is easy - shortcut buttons and menu list can be customized. Alert sounds are solid, loud, non-irritating. Message alert repeat when text remains unread. Very long standby battery life. CONS: 4-direction navigation key is cramped, shiny front panel easily prone to scratch. No bluetooth although speakerphone function is enough for handsfree use. Price a bit expensive compared to more featured LG unit for nearly same cost. Overall, specs match up to expectations - just for basic calling and texting. A great gift for youngsters and adults who have not had a cellphone before, especially with the tight economy!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Socrates", "ReviewID": "R2G7TT4ANDHC47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this phone since May 2008, (it's now Jan 2011) - I love this phone, I don't need anything more than basic phone use, and email,  works just fine,no problem at all with AT&T; and refilling, I only pay 2\u00a2 for each call, I use it just to stay in touch, and to be rescued if I have a car problem.  It may not be available now from AT&T;, but there must be others.  It only cost me $15, and I am very happy with the phone and the service.  The charge lasts for a long time.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good PHONE", "Author": "E.

The phone has all the basic operations that I need (I'm 73 years old). The only problem that I have found with this phone is that there are several places that we have traveled to, where there is no network. Since I only use the phone occasionally this is not a problem for me but if you needed a phone in an emergency, in one of these areas, you would be out of luck.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap, reliable phone", "Author": "Juan A.", "ReviewID": "R1PUCJNG87YP4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to get this as a temporary phone for a month.

Bought it through Amazon because I had some credit on my Gift Card account.  Reception is horrible. Sound quality sucks. And it seems to cut off all calls after about 5 minutes. Voicemail notifications show up 2 days later.

I added about $60 for $85. Even with casual uses, in a month the balance was near zero. I have no idea why. I think AT&T; charged for missed calls because I wasn't dialing any 900 numbers on it. Also for some reason I couldn't refill even though I tried three different times. I was eventually directed to customer service whose office was closed. I don't blame anyone, but this company does a good job turning money away. I needed this phone number for one more month, but they really make it hard to do business with them. Phone wasn't so bad overall. Clunky and plasticky. Go with T-Mobile if you are going for prepaid phones. Really regret not going with them in the first place.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Samsung a137 Prepaid GoPhone (AT&T;)", "Name": "At&t Samsung Sgh-a137", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31skoTSQq1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002FVUJ2G"}}
