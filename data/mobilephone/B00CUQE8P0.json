I think that BLU will have great success. I have the Samsung Galaxy 3 and HTC One X  quad core so I know what the best rated phones will do! The Samsung galaxy 3 has terrible battery life and weak WIfI. The One X has great WIFI; great battery and it does not like to switch sim cards. So for me this inexpensive phone is better than the best most expensive phones. It has great battery life and good everything else. The only trump is the camera options are less on the Blu. So I give the BLU Vivo best of the three considering all especially price. I paid over $600 for the Htc one X and have a 2 year contract with the S3. I also am married to an Apple lover and see side by side reality with the GOD of smart phones the Iphone 5 and I have to snicker a little under my breath. I love this phone!

It also has screen capture and a wonderful camera/flash and works fast with wifi.  Nice screen and good vibration quality.  Lots of memory and doesn't scratch easily.  Vibrates when someone picks up to let you know.  Cons--shows you can do ringer IDs, but won't save, often hangs up when another person answers, doesn't work well with T-Mobile, headphones that come with the phone are the only ones that work--and mine were about 4 inches uneven.  Battery life is not what is advertised, it doesn't save numbers not in the contacts in the call log, it doesn't let you go online during a call.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent price and cost relationship", "Author": "Daniel Francelino", "ReviewID": "R12K20GJUCACHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price you pay, it's really excellent.
