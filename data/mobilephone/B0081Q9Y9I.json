Works well with AT&T.; I liked it at first but you have to push on the buttons hard to make them work. Also isn't very loud when it rings.

The biggest issue is that if you lock the phone, let the screen turn off, then turn the screen back on, it can take upwards of a minute for the touchscreen to start working so you can slide your finger across the screen to unlock it. 25% of the time, no amount of time would get the touchscreen to start working again--which required a battery pull. This phone is for my daughter, and the uncertainty of her being able to make a phone call immediately was an absolute deal-breaker.The antenna was also not very good, as it barely got 1-2 bars reception when other phones sitting next to it had almost/full bars. The phone speaker produced a very tinny sound.It is being returned.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$109.99", "Features": "This Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
