I purchased this phone from straight talk, and along with the $30 1000 minutes/1000 text plan the whole order costed $53.  Having used an iPhone 4 and Nokia Lumia 900 in the past, I love the fact that this ISNT touchscreen.  I like physical keys, and sometimes I just want to pull out my phone, dial a number and connect with someone rather than wade through menus to find the phones dialer.  I text/talk so this phone is perfect for me.  Not good for web-browsing but if you absolutely need to check something on the internet you can.  Quite honestly I want to get away from using my cell phone to surf the web.  I found myself wasting monumental amounts of time and becoming quite the cell-addicted zombie. The call quality is probably the best of any cell phone ive ever had.  Easy to text on.  I've read that everyones biggest complaint about the tracfone version of this phone is the \"back\" button activates the browser.  You can plainly see the button that activates the browser, the screen says \"browser\" for goodness sake.  The button underneath this one is the actual back-button.  My only real complaint is that when you \"lock\" the screen simply sliding out the keyboard bypasses the \"lock\" function.  I dont think that in my pocket it will open enough to engage but i'm worried that in my purse it will.  On a budget im on the $30 plan which is not unlimited, so that is a concern.  Would recommend this phone to someone who wants a calling/texting phone with physical keys that does both these things very well.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "angel2001 \"angel powell\"", "ReviewID": "R1UPSM9TI2VGDO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It arrived on time in good shape and almost perfect condition.
