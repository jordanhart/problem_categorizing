I cant even delete music files or edit them. play-list cannot be reordered.I realized I took for granted many of the features of my old phone after getting this one. But the good thing is that I dont depend much on my phone as I used to :)I think they have hurried product to the market. Basic features are fine to get 3 stars. but we expect a phone to do much more in the 21st century.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very durable.", "Author": "Miriah", "ReviewID": "RO1N63412KVZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am the third owner of this phone, and it still works great. It has been dropped, drowned, ran over, stepped on, left outside, and been through hell. Its still working great and hardley ever glitches. I really like how theres an option in the web menu to save pictures from the internet. The only complaints i have is the camera kind of sucks and the headphone jack doesnt fit normal headphones. Other than that, this is a great phone and would reccomend anybody to buy it. Small, sleek, stylish and affordable!", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVER!  Bought THREE!", "Author": "Gino Forever", "ReviewID": "R10PWALD73MLQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this telephone three years ago.  It went through everything: water spills, weather exposure, etc.  Recently my phone has seen it last days so I had to depart with it. I purchased NEW Metropcs Samsung phone; it dropped all calls every two minutes. I went to four different counties to find this telephone!  Walmart, Metropcs, etc.  Thank God I found it!  I purchased THREE just in case and will place them in storage. Will never depart with this rugged phone. This phone never drops calls, it is rugged, text messaging is limited but it is quick and clear. The keypad is AWESOME!!! The visuals are beautiful.  LG can create any other cellular phone nothing beats this telephone. I'm In Love!
