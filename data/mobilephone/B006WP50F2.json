However the keyboard always gave a tough time getting the \"a\" key pressed since it is so close to the edge of the display.  Most of the time, I would type \"s\" instead.  I tried running the \"calibrate screen\" in the setup with no noticeable improvement.  To make things worse, after ~15 month of use, the back button stopped working... actually rather the screen got completely off.  Pressing the back button is actually pressing the bottom of the screen.  So calibration is way off now.  Tried to re calibrate with no success.  Still way off.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Cell Tek", "ReviewID": "R38THMN2F1DIC7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great phone.
