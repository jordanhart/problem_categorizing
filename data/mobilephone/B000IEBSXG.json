Rinehart \"light bulb stealer\"", "ReviewID": "R1K79BKAG10SKN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Lets be straight; this tiny phone was bought for one reason, to replace my main phone of a 2-year plan that is beyond its one-year warranty.  Nevermind any of the reasons why the original phone is dead, at the end of the day, it would cost almost $150 to replace it thru my service provider, or anymore else for that matter.I needed a cheap unlocked phone to last the next 3 months for when I can have a free replacement if I re-sign my 2-yr contract.  This phone is it. It has some minor games, the keypad isn't too small, and the sound is crystal clear with an excellent speaker.That being said, I wouldn't buy this phone just to have. The menu is hard to understand, the keylock doesn't seem to work, saving phone numbers is tedious and limited.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent basic phone for the money", "Author": "ACCGTGGTGACA... \"rwk\"", "ReviewID": "RA8Q072YIX1OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Nokia 1600 to replace a fancy-pants Motorola V600 that went haywire when the hinge became loose (after 3 years). Moving parts always break first, so no more clamshell phones for me.The 1600 is no-frills, but it's really a gem. The phone's sound quality and screen are both excellent. I can also confirm the previous review regarding battery life: It seems to last forever and charges very quickly, too. (And it's so good to be free of that horrible Motorola charger connector.)Only one complaint: The UI isn't the finest I've seen. Too many menus I just don't care about and which I haven't found a way to disable or hide forever. (But then maybe I should read the manual. ;)The only feature I miss is Bluetooth for syncing, but that's not a complaint. I knew it was missing.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Reviews are right on the money", "Author": "But hey, what do I know?", "ReviewID": "RDIEIHICSOQGI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As most reviewers have noted, this is a basic phone with a lot going for it. It is cheap and unlocked. It's small and light. The battery life is excellent. You get at least one bar in most places and usually a lot more, so I'm saying it detects a signal very well. Most importantly, no dropped calls as of yet. That's a biggie for me. My motofone f3 dropped calls and that is why I replaced it with this Nokia.If you just want basic features to make/receive calls and text messages, you'll be very satisfied with the Nokia 1600. I took one star off because I'd like to see still better signal strength. I have an old Nokia 6061 which seems even better in that department.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good overall, some quirks", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "RDJO8I6WKU09J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a good, cheap, basic phone.  It works fine for text messaging and phone calls, which is about all I use my phone for anyway. It will keep a charge for 1-2 weeks if not used, and stays charged through even long phone calls.There are a few annoying quirks to this phone, though, and doing research on this phone before I bought it, I discovered others had a similar problems:1. If you reject the call, sometimes the phone will freeze and you'll need to turn it off and back on again.2. If you let the phone ring and don't answer a call, it will continue ringing indefinitely, even after the caller has hung up or left a voice mail message.  I've left my phone at home when I left for work, and got home in the afternoon with my phone still ringing from a 9:00am phone call.  If you try to answer it then, it freezes and/or makes the three-tone beep in your ear.3. The alarm clock doesn't work properly.  It likes to go off around 3:30am regardless of what time you set it for.  When it goes off at 3:30, you can check and it says the alarm is actually set for 6:30 (or whenever it was set for).  Sometimes it will go off at several different times during the night.*All of the above problems are intermittent, none of them happen every day.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased...Unlocked is The Way To Go", "Author": "N. T. Evans", "ReviewID": "RGMLYEFSVBEGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my wife last month (April 2008) and she has been very pleased so far.  We both have been using Nokias for years mainly because of their reliability, ruggedness & ease of use.  We also are out of our AT&T; contract so rather than be tied to another contract we decided to buy an unlocked phone.  Well, we got it and charged it up and slipped in her Cingular SIM Card (circa 2005)and it worked great.  She loves the compactness of the phone and the additional \"bells & whistles\" compared to her old Nokia bar phone from a few years ago.  Don't get me wrong this isn't another iPhone it is very basic but it is all she needs.  I too have an old Nokia bar phone and plan to order this same phone when I get a chance. Note: One nice surprise is Nokia includes a hands free ear piece in the box.  Also,all the old chargers from my previous phone still work with the 1600.", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "I Read A Lot", "ReviewID": "R34UUGYJAL9QBC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great sturdy little phone.

He assued me it was an unlocked phone and if ordered with the appropiate SIM card also being offered by Amazon it would work. Needless to say it didn't work at all in Europe or the Black Sea area and when I contacted Moble, the SIM card company, they told me the phone would only work in the US. This was very poor advice from the Amazon cell phone expert and fortunatly we didn't have a serious emergency where we needed to be reached or had to call out.

Franzen \"Jeremy Franzen\"", "ReviewID": "RJT6ZZDU5TIOQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Considering this was a few years newer than my previous Nokia 3125, I figured it would have the same qualaties at the very least, if not better.  Unfortunately my old phone turned out to be far superior to the 1600.  This phone is similar, and I couldn't find the 3125 for less than at least one hundred dollars more, so I went with the cheaper model.  Long story short... it shows.  A lot of the things on this phone are the same.  The fact that I cannot save a text message, cannot view any kind of picture sent to me by another phone, and most importantly cannot send a text message without it taking numerous tries in just about any environment makes this phone kind of a downer.  I'm sure there are a number of other things about this phone that annoy me, but those are my main complaints.  I have had numerous brands and styles of cell phones, and after going through a number of options, I liked Nokia 3125 the best.  It was simple, intuitive, and fit my needs.  Hoping I could get the same quality in this phone for slightly less money, I gave up a lot in the quality department.
