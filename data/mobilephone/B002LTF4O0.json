If your looking for other features.... Don't bother. Can't do picture mail, can't do video msging, can't do a lot of things. Well why the five star review? Because what it does, it does extremely well. I've had it on and used it daily for a week now and I'm only down to half battery.... Thats incredible. I took this phone to the beach .... And went swimming with it! No problem. Drunken fumbling.. No problem. This phone is great for day to day if all you need (or want) is a phone that just works.I called the company only once and they were very helpful, they are sending me ( for free) a piece I lost. Just can't beat that kind of service.Best featureIt can record phone calls! Very usefulPros:Battery life is better than almost anythingRugged and waterproofTheir warranty is the best in the business and they stand behind itConsSoftware is just bad... Some things you would think would be easy are either missing completely or just not usableScreen is not scratch proof..

We had a richochet at the range, .40 jhp, had the phone sitting on the bench...suddenly it was flying. We picked up the phone, it was still on. Tore it up, obviously, but it WAS STILL ON!! We now know what the guts of one of these phones look like. Sent it in and got a new one in about a week. They did call out of curiousity wanting to know what happened, the response was \"Oh, ok, new one's on the way.\" What?! Has this happened before?! I want another, and another, and another... And those of you who are just looking for a tough phone with a bunch of apps 'cause you dropped yours in the toilet go buy a Casio G'zOne, this isn't a smart phone, it doesn't have Android or whatever on it, it's a phone, for people who actually work hard for a living, not for some whiney, coffee drinking hipster sitting in an internet cafe' with delusions of grandeur. This company is the only one who designed a phone for a lone worker in REMOTE locations with a \"man down\" feature, that means the phone calls for help if you get incapacitated, it dials on it's own. Do you really think they care about your facebook account? It's a phone for actually communicating with someone, deal with it.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "XP3 is a tough phone w/ mediocre quality", "Author": "Wiser now", "ReviewID": "RFMJREKT1OWZ5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE:I have had the phone about two and a half years and it still looks like it did when I bought it.  The sound quality issues are still the same.  I don't use the internet functions on it because I just use this as a work phone now.  The internet still works and I still pay for it, just in case I need it.  Using the internet on this phone is not much fun anyhow.  It is a really durable phone though.  It looks brand new.One issue where it is not durable is the slot for the micro SD card.  The gate came loose and now it won't hold the SD card in place, so you can't use it.  I was able to tape it into place for a while, but now it won't work at all.If I were to spend this much on a phone again my wish list would include having a better sd card slot, better sound quality for the people on the other end, better internet access and a bigger screen.  The gaming part on this phone is weak too but I'm not real into that.  This is one tough phone though.Original review:The Sonim XP3 Quest is a solid phone.  It will probably stand up to some abuse.  I haven't tried to destroy mine like the people in the ads do, but it feels like a well built phone.  The sound on the calls isn't very good.  On my end there is buzzing and static.  I have T-Mobile service and have never had that before.  People on the other end are always asking me to repeat myself now and that is new.  They tell me they are having a hard time hearing me.This phone was fairly difficult to program to go to the internet.  It shouldn't be that hard.  I contacted customer support 4 times by e-mail.  I received a response to one e-mail.  The first was a question about using it as an unlocked phone and if it would work with T-Mobile in Colorado.  No response.  My second was about getting on the internet, as was my third.  Again, no responses.  My fourth e-mail (I don't give up easily) was a question about why the calender said it was full when I had only put in 20 appointments.  They did respond saying that was all the calender could schedule.  I was not amused.  I did eventually get the internet up and running, but it is difficult to navigate.  You also have to keep switching between numeric characters and alpha.  The phone doesn't do it for you.  The calender is not user friendly either.  To look at appointments (ones you did get to schedule) you have to open that date in order to be able to see what the appointment is.  The week starts with Monday and runs through Sunday instead of the Sunday through Saturday format, so you have to really look at the small print on the days to make sure you enter or look at the right date.  I have a hard time seeing the small characters on this phone too.  I wasn't at all impressed with their customer service department.I have tried to program assigned ringtones/images on this phone and still have been unable to do it.  I've always been able to do it on other phones no problem, and yeah, I even read all the directions on all the stuff I've tried with this phone.  It says it will do it, but I'm still trying to figure this one out.The phone comes with Amaze loaded on it for GPS navigation.  It works well.  It has Opera Mini for the internet browsing and I don't like it.  I haven't tried playing any games on it yet.  I'm not real big into gaming on a phone anyhow.  I don't like the text messaging set up.  You have to open the messages in order to read all of it, and some have to be sent as two separate messages to go through if they are a medium length message.I have tried using the earbuds and mike that came with the phone.  The people on the other end said they couldn't hear me.  I have a system in my truck that allows me to play the phone over the car speakers.  It doesn't work with this phone either.  The Mobile Phone PC Tools program that comes with the phone isn't much of a program either.  It took several tries before I could get the phone to even connect.  The program doesn't do much once you do get in.  I've seen a lot better ones.  Finding your Sandisk card in the My Files is an adventure too.  Once you finally locate it, it is easier to just drag and drop stuff you want loaded on it than it is to go through the PC Tools program.  You will need to format the card before you can use it. You can set the date format in the phone for whatever you are used to.  Only problem is that it doesn't set it that way for all the features on the phone.The camera on the phone is pretty good.  It has a flash on the phone too.  The flash works as a pretty decent flashlight too.  The screen is pretty hard and should be scratch resistant.  The colors, etc on the images displayed are fine.  Battery life is good.  It ran down after two days use without a charge, with the GPS on the whole time.If you don't mind a phone that isn't user friendly, don't plan to contact customer service, don't mind poor call audio, but want a pretty solid phone that will (probably) stand up to some abuse, then this might be the phone for you.  I work hard and play hard, so I need a phone like this.  It is the best ruggedized phone I have ever seen.  I'll give up some of the quality on other programs if the phone is indestructible.  The sound quality is tolerable on my end most of the time.  Hopefully future versions will work out some of the problems.  All in all, I do like the phone.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sonim XP3 Quest Black", "Author": "Mutt \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R3M7PUTNAIJ1XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had various \"tough\" phones from nextel and the lastest from Samsun (A657) all meet a timely dimise eventually.  Thats why i got this, the warranty.  And used it just the 2nd day I had it to more or less test the abuse and warranty.  Warranty is awesome, about a week turn around from destruction to replacement.The call quality is pretty good (AT&T;) the speaker gets a bit muffled if you dunk it then make a call but otherwise the ringer is LOUD!!! Vibrate is worthless.  Battery life is about 6 or 7 days for me (texting all day and constant flashlight useage).  I don't have the net so can't comment on it but for use as a phone and camera it works great.The software that comes with it is worthless, just plug it in and use it as a USB storage device to transfer your photos.  It also has no built in photo editing options.Hands down the most durable phone I have ever had and when the 3 years is up, i will trash it to get a new one, then when it dies out of warranty i will buy another!!!! I'll never buy a regular phone again.Did I mention it's water proof??  Ever get a call while you are in the shower?  Just take it with you now.  It's the easiest way to clean grit and grease off too i use my hand/nail brush to scrub it clean once a week while i'm in there.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Indestructophone", "Author": "Lewald", "ReviewID": "RKTGMP2EMPRA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll keep this short and sweet.

Baxter", "ReviewID": "R3ESOUOU7AEBDK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst customer service EVER.  Sub-standard product across the board.  Do not buy this phone; do not deal with this company.  Here is my story so far...:  I am a military operator and have dealt with one issue or other with this phone for 9 straight months.  I ordered this phone for an upcoming deployment.  I received the phone and the battery cover would not seat properly.  I notified Sonim and, after a series of trouble shooting inspections, they agreed to mail out a new cover.  I received the new cover and the cover will still not seat properly.  Sonim had me mail in the phone to their repair shop.  This method alone has caused more of a headache than nearly anything else.  It takes forever.  There is no replacement phone and no other plan; they have you send the phone in for days/weeks/ or, in my case, months due to the return shipment from Sonim \"getting lost\".  The phone finally gets to me and I find that, again, the cover will not seat properly.  In addition to this, I learned that the phone will not read an SD card.  No SD card would work: 8GB SanDisk, 16GB SanDisk, 32GB SanDisk.  I again contacted Sonim, this time I dealt with \"Lorenzo\" who was unprofessional, combative, and a complete waste of time.  Instead of addressing my issues; he chose to play investigator and challenge every prior issue I had (which I could prove via back and forth emails with Sonim over my whole deployment).  Instead of resourcing Sonim's own company records; he chose to solicit my emails from me and then cross-examine me on them.  As if I would randomly create a mile-long chain of emails with my secret accomplice that works for Sonim.  Idiot.  After dealing with that guy, I requested a full refund based on the pattern of defects, their frequency, and the substandard customer service.  My request was rejected due to the amount of time elapsed since I bought the phone.  I bought the phone in September of 2012 and I am writing this review on May 2013.  In all that time, I can count on two hands the number of times I have actually gotten to use this phone.  Nearly the entire past 9 months has been consumed with shipping the phone back and forth to the repair shop.  Tomorrow morning, I will put it in the mail again for the SD card defect and the battery cover defect.  This marks the FOURTH time I have had to deal with the battery cover defect alone.  By all reckoning, you could still consider the phone brand new.  You cannot trust the product in the field or on deployment.  You cannot trust the customer service methods and practices to consider your interests.  Do not buy this phone and do not deal with this company.  Having a 3 year warranty is no excuse for having your customers spend that 3 years mailing the phone back and forth to the repair shop.  Here is an excerpt from July 2012 that I found on a website yesterday regarding customers who have bought this phone: \"Many of you who sent their phones in for service ended up having them fail multiple times and had the inconvenience and possibly cost of having to send them someplace to get serviced again and again...\"  http://www.sonimquest.com/2012_07_01_archive.html", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rugged but flawed.", "Author": "Analog Nation \"analog nation\"", "ReviewID": "RFDEF5EPW7EM1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this phone 3 years.A couple of problems:Callers have trouble hearing YOU - especially if you are trying to use the speakerphone to talk to THEM. This is probably a result of making the phone submersible.  Ironically, to the caller on the other end, YOU sound garbled as if under water.The pincers that grip the wired head set fail.  You can't listen to the radio feature without them. In areas where weather news is important and the phone is a convenient (often only) device by which to receive it and blue tooth devices don't work or are impractical due to torrential rain, high winds, you need them.Next and most important in my opinion- CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A NIGHTMARE. Most of the time they don't even answer the phone.  You have to leave a message and when (if) they call you back, they are not very helpful and about as polite as road kill.When the aforementioned pincers failed, they replaced the phone but only after arguing my case like Clarence Darrow. C'mon' Sonim... iOS, Sony and Samsung electronics work no matter how many times you insert or remove the wired head set.
