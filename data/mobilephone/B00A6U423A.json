{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good bang for buck", "Author": "Bumqui", "ReviewID": "RZJLWY1B04A4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not the best phone out there, doesn't even have an option to turn of 4G, which drains the battery like crazy (tried downloading apps that toggle 4G, but the phone doesn't allow access for the app to do so). I've actually watched the battery fall by 2% in the course of writing a single text message when I was sitting in a room with no 4G reception, an hour later over 15% drained from just being in standby while searching for 4G that wasn't there. I definitely don't leave the house without the charger in my pocket anymore.Also, It doesn't want to sync my email automatically, not on \"push\" and not even on \"check every 5 minutes\", only syncs when told to manually.Lastly, WiFi tethering doesn't work. You can download and install FoxFi or other similar apps, but the only way to tether this phone is through a USB cable (or probably by paying Verizon extra $), which really sucks, but it's only a matter of convenience (besides, you've got that cable in your pocket to charge it throughout the day anyway). However, there is apparently a way to make it work if you want to root the phone. Might just do that.THAT BEING SAID, c'mon, for about $100 what the heck do you expect? This phone definitely performs better than expected for such a bargain price. I initially bought it just to hold me over for a couple of months, but now I'm thinking ,\"ya know, I might hold on to it till it breaks\". It's quite a good smartphone. My previous phone was the Droid 3, I'd say the Droid 3 (lasted me about a year) was maybe 15-20% faster (also, lacked 4G), but the LG blows the Droid out of the water with screen quality (both visually and touch sensitivity-wise).Bottom Line: If you're looking for a cheap replacement smartphone (that has 4G), I'd definitely recommend this one.Pros:CHEAP4GDecent displayDecent speedLegit smartphoneCons:Battery life (lasts me about 1/4-1/2 a day on average)Email won't sync automatically no matter what settings I tryWiFi tethering doesn't work (without rooting), only USB tetheringNo option to turn off 4G, not even if you download a 4G toggle app.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "What i expected", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3V001ENTEPXOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fairly good phone.

This phone doesn't even bother to light up or VIBRATE when I get a text message. Calls? Yes. Text? No. I've missed many messages just because my phone doesn't alert me.*Phone overheats way too easily and has poor battery life. Even with a battery saver my phone will only last a few hours if I'm barely using it. When I'm away from a charger for an extended period of time I have to be very resourceful with my phone usage so that I might actually have battery life in case of an emergency.*Keyboard application constantly freezes and quits. Makes texting/typing slow and a pain. Sometimes requiring me to restart my phone so that it'll work properly.*Video's are too large to send to anything. I've recorded a few videos to share.

It was a pretty good price, I paid somewhere around 200 dollars for it, so I kind of got my moneys worth. I honestly think that my Incredible 2 was a much nicer phone than this one. It has it's ups and downs.Pros;- The maps app this is amazing. It works pretty fast and finds locations that I am looking for relatively close to me. This app didn't work on my previous phone, so it was a nice update.- It has some really cute themes and ringtones. I am one of those people who likes to change up their phone a lot.- The battery life is pretty decent. I don't really use my phone a whole lot through the day. I mostly use it for texting and calling. I use my ipod if I have wifi, but if I am in an area where I don't get wifi then I use my phone more.- It is a really good size, not too small but not too big.Cons;- When I got my phone in the mail, the back cover didn't fit on it. If you try to snap it all the way on, the other snaps will pop open and won't let me put it on all the way. I never got around to contacting somebody about it so I just got a phone case to put over it so it wasn't bugging me.- There is no LED light on this phone. So if you get a text message or a miss a call, you don't get that nice feature of the light blinking to tell you.- The screen doesn't light up when you get a text message. I loved that about my old phone, because if my phone was on silent, I still saw that I got a message. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if this phone had the LED option but since it doesn't, I constantly check my phone to see if there is a message. (Unless I have my ringtone on)- The typing gets really weird at times and can be really slow. It's like the cursor jumps all over the place and starts typing in different areas. Obviously this gets extremely annoying. You have to type really slow or it will go ballistic.There is definitely a lot nicer phones out there then this one. I will not be getting another one of the LG Lucids. I can deal with phone but it is far from spectacular. I don't really recommend this phone to anybody. It might have been a better phone if I would have gotten it new from a Verizon store but definitely could be better.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "very good deal", "Author": "jolin", "ReviewID": "R2BDB3WZ6F0FY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone was just like new.
