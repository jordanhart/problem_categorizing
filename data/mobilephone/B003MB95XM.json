Install of both was as installs go and they worked the first time.  You could only detect the difference in quality from the original when looking at it from a deep angle - you could see the fluorescent glare from the back light.  This does not really affect the everyday function.  It will obviously be evident in video playback but should not be an issue if your viewing angle is not too acute.  One of the phones started dimming out after the install and I initially thought it was the screen until I swapped them and the problem recurred, implicating the phone itself.
