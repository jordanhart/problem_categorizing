Zero complaint!!Only down side is about the international plan: don't waste an extra $15 a month on it, it's a real pain in the *** to use since you have to call a particular toll free number to, then, dial the number of the person you wish to reach...

Now this phone seems great! Problem being is that after a week I still can not use it. Net 10 told me the SIM that came with it was no good. Then argued that I must have put an old SIM in the phone which I certainly did not. They will not compensate me for time, money, and effort lost. After being told my new SIM was in the mail they said the order was cancelled. I had to reorder a SIM. 3 times I asked for a supervisor only to be very rudely refused. I will never use Net 10 again after this. There are other cool phones out there and if I were you before spending over 200.00 on a phone that you will have to take forever to even use, I would shop for a different phone and service plan all together.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "yes!", "Author": "Maria", "ReviewID": "R3BIJY84S93R0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone is fast and zippy. i like that i get 4g speeds in my area since its a metropolitan area. the os is beautiful and slick. my only problem with it is that it doesn't have too many apps but i mean its a great phone!! i totally recommend it to everyone!!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "self explainatory lol", "Author": "Dulce Muniikiita", "ReviewID": "RD57EN4IZY5EA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its a Net10 phone comes packaged. it is new thats pretty much it. what you see advirtised is what your getting.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone.", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R1H1NG0SSC9QH8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a little disappointed it will not upgrade to Windows 8.1 I put a 32MB SD card in mine and it sits mostly empty because I can't save my email to it.

I mainly spent the extra money on this phone just to have a phone with a wifi hotspot which is what they advertised it had but I found out they disabled that function on this phone so I spent extra cash for nothing.
