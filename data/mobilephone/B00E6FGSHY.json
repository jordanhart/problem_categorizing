I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

I got my phone this morning as a little bday gift to myself.  Haven't played with it too much with everything else going on but it's got a gorgeous screen.  It's so big and colors are sharp.  And I've finally got 4G to use my unlimited internet with, yay!  Just downloaded a bunch of my old apps on it and there was no lag with the phone or the internet.  Totally forgot I was using 4G and not wifi.  Oh for you girls, I've got medium size hands and I've been handling it one-handed.Pros:1) fast2) big screen3) easy to customize home screen - icons will shift themselves if you want to put one in a spot that is currently occupied4) can see battery percentage in top right corner5) drop down menu chock full of stuff - you can access the settings or get to different functions like driving mode easily6) camera has a gazillion options - the pic with sound is pretty cool and so is the one adding you into the picture one7) micro sd card slot and removable battery8) connected to my wireless printer with no troubleOnly 3 cons so far:1) power button is on the other side from the volume button so I have to make sure I dont have my index finger on the vol before I squeeze and push the power button.2) very thin and flimsy feeling - definitely getting a case for it3) air gestures seems gimmicky, can't get mine to workFor reference, I was using the motorola atrix prior to today.  Will update as I get to know it better.UPDATE 5/5/13:Still getting use to the new phone.  Thanks to someone's tip about the sensor being in the top left corner I've got one feature of the air gestures to work.  I really like the new side tab that works sorta like the pull down tab except it's loaded with apps.  It makes it easier to switch inbetween apps instead of going back to the homescreen or holding the home button for last used apps.  You can edit the apps that show up too.  Battery life is better than expected.  I figure with the bigger screen, a charge wont last as long as my old phone but it's about the same.  I can get 2 days light-moderate use (checking email, using gps and setting my alarm) on one charge with 25% left over so I'm not pushing it. Takes about 1.5hr to charge it up.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone currently on the market", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "REBVOE50JNV6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone yesterday, and I have been playing with it nonstop for the past 24 hours. First off, I'd like to say that yes, I have fallen in love with this phone since I opened it up.Visual Review:It looks similar to the GS3 and Note, but what would you expect from a Galaxy? It's very nice, because the bezel is so small, so its one of the easiest phones to hold that has a 5 inch screen. I would recommend getting a case and spare batteries however. It feels very slick and I often worry about dropping it. Also, the spare batteries would take advantage of the removable cover. I love that option; seeing as how I am very techy, I am always on my phone. The display is hands down the best phone display you will ever see. You cannot see any pixels no matter how close you look...Seriously...And the colors are outstanding... I compared the phone display with my girlfriend's iPhone 5 and it wasn't comparable.Feature Review:I have found so many neat features on this phone. One of my absolute favorite features is the IR Blaster. NO MORE REMOTES! I can just change the channels with my phone, and its amazingly easy to set up and program to new TV's. It also shows the schedules of what shows are playing on, say, Charter TV, which is awesome. Secondly, Air-view is not just a gimmick. Now people can use the phone with gloves on and it will work flawlessly. Although yes, there are some unnecessary features that need to be ignored, that more or less show off the hardware, such as the air swipe to change between photos... But whatever, its still a hell of an invention, right? Also, the camera is awesome as well. It is fast, and has many sweet and ACTUALLY USEFUL features...not just the stupid visual effects that nobody uses. Last night I could barely see my girlfriend and I put the phone on night mode and took a picture, and I could easily see her in the picture. It was like an actual night-vision camera, but with proper colors. Its also very detailed. I also like the dual camera picture mode.Pros-Fastest performing phone statistically on the market-Sleek-Great camera-Awesome Software and Hardware-Amazing Display-Lots of tech under the hood that most phones dont have.Cons-Slippery-Doesn't have the waterproofing that the xPeria Z has-Only comes in black or white-I guess I wish it had a heavier, more premium back to it.Overall, I would highly advocate anyone purchasing this phone. I was worried at first but once I got it I realized I made the best decision. Blows other phones out of the water.If you own an Iphone, and actually want to give android a serious shot, this phone will make you happy you made that decision.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone, but a couple problems", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "RXW92CWHFU7SY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is beautiful, well-made, fast, sturdy, with a gorgeous screen. But, as has been widely reported, there's not a whole lot of space on it.  Many of Samsung's features are useful, but much of them are solutions looking for a problem (the smart scrolling, when it works, is not very compelling.) There's also a LOT of redundant apps. For virtually every great Google app, there is an inferior Samsung app - Chrome and Internet; Play Music and Music Player; Play Store and Samsung Hub. It's kind of insulting - it assumes the end user is unable to figure out how to find their own favorite apps.There are also issues with bloat. There are numerous very, very poorly made AT&T; apps that vary in usefulness (like messaging, which is useful, and AT&T; Navigation, which is not free and far less useful than Google Maps, which is.) Most of these apps don't look as though they've been modified much since Froyo, and they don't look great on this phone's resolution. Happily, though none of these apps can be removed completely, they can be disabled so the OS pretends they do not exist.The last problem is one of the weirdest and most frustrating though it's somewhat minor. The AT&T; version of this phone had disabled autocorrection in the keyboard. It makes no sense. The keyboard app used the amazing SwiftKey as a back end, but it will not actually use it to correct typos automatically. I've held this phone up next to a Sprint counterpart, and the option is available. Complaining to AT&T; does nothing - they have confirmed it's there, but will not say if an update will correct it. The bottom line is it is defective by design.So, the bottom line is this is a beautiful, useful phone with amazing hardware that is hobbled by it's questionable software.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hairline crack in screen killed phone on day 14 of being owned", "Author": "Dale_in_OC", "ReviewID": "R21X7QZDYB81VP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone for 14 days when the crack appeared in the screen. I had babied this thing and it was not subjected to any external pressure, drops, hot sun - nothing. One minute it was working the next minute I had a black screen of death. No way to revive the screen. After this happened I noticed a hairline crack had developed sandwiched between the layers of glass. I checked online I found this was a wide spread problem with the S3 that Samsung never owned up to, and now is being reported by hundreds of S4 owners - some on their first day of ownership.Samsung defiantly declares that all hairline cracks stem from owner abuse of the phone and states that the screen is not covered under the warranty. Replacing the screen will cost you $178 and three weeks of time.Interestingly, in July 2013 Samsung announced an Accidental Damage Handling (ADH)Warranty that provides free replacement of the screen up to twice in the first year of phone ownership. Two simple qualifications for coverage:(1)Your phone must be registered with Samsung within the 1st 30 days of ownership to be eligible for this incremental warranty.(2)You must live in one of 16 specified countries in Africa.The ADH is NOT available to residents of the US.Sweet.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Currently the Android phone to beat", "Author": "Genryu", "ReviewID": "R7E72607H7AJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While I initially purchased the HTC One, my dad decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I'd say he made the better choice between the two of us. I ended up returning my HTC One not only because of the problems I had with it, but also in part because the SGS4 just offered a more complete package that I knew could last me at least a year or longer. I've detailed below some pros and cons after using the device for a few weeks.Pros- Bright screen with great viewing angles: While I can't sign off on the color reproduction, the brightness is definitely great along with the viewing angles. I don't really share videos with others often, but for those that do it's a great aspect of the screen to have. For the color-sticklers like me you're still getting a oled screen so colors are going to look over-saturated and have a certain pop to them that isn't true to life. But I'll admit it does have a certain visual appeal to it, and my friends that aren't that particular really enjoy it.- MicroSD cart slot and removable battery: The inclusion of the microSD card slot for me is a nice plus, since I can just load on a bunch of movies and tv shows to watch on the go (can't do that over the cellular network because of data caps). The removable battery means that you can swap it out if you want in the middle of the day, but I've never been one to buy multiple batteries personally. The nice part for me is that you can buy higher capacity after-market batteries, have the option of just buying a new battery when it starts to degrade over time, and do easy force resets by just taking out the battery. And for you secret agents out there, pulling out the battery is the only way to make sure the phone isn't being used to track you, turning it off isn't enough.- Great camera quality: Let me start off by saying that I think for overall mixed shooting environments from bright light to moderate light the SGS4 is the Android phone to beat currently. When you're talking about strictly low-light performance it is going to be 2nd place to the HTC One in the Android realm. I tend to shoot more during the day or in the evenings during sunset time. I'd imagine that most people tend to take pictures in a variety of lighting environments and for that the SGS4 is the better overall camera in my opinion. The higher resolution is nice to work with too if you like to crop images on your computer after taking them.- Solid software/device support: The SGS4 at present is the only one that's made the extra mile to build in extensive bluetooth support. In fact its the only bluetooth device I can use my fitbit flex with, because other Android phones haven't gone the extra mile in this area. If wireless accessories and the like are your kind of thing, I'd say Samsung is the way to go if you want to ensure support. Not even Google's Nexus line can boast this fact.Cons- Plastic design: There's no other way to put it, this phone just doesn't feel like a high-end device in my hand. Especially since I got to hold the HTC One in one hand and this one in the other it becomes all the more apparent that Samsung used cheaper materials to build this phone. On the plus side the plastic feels durable and likely to hold up well to drops and moderate abuse. Can't say that about the HTC One. Also the plastic design means that the battery isn't sealed in like the HTC One.- Still about average battery life: The battery life is just about getting me through my day, but I'm still packing an external charger and the charging cable with me. I just end up having to use them less often than I did with my HTC One when I had that. So yes while it's a bit better than the HTC One in my opinion, it's not exactly going to set any records. It's about what you're probably used to seeing with a smartphone these days and nothing more. I wish they'd integrate some giant batteries like Motorola does with their MAXX line of devices, but until then this is the best you can get. You can buy increased capacity batteries after-market to help alleviate the battery issue, though I can't comment on their quality or performance. My usage consists of streaming pandora to and from work, regularly accessing gmail throughout the day, watching a tv-show during lunch sometimes, about 1-2 hrs of phone calls, and regularly texting.- Useless Samsung software: Nearly all of the implementations that Samsung built in like S-voice and others feel either gimmicky and useless or intrusive with the native Android interface. There is just a overall cartoonish look to the UI and feels like an overall departure from the clean UI design of stock android and even the relatively-close-to-stock look of the HTC One. I'm not a fan, and I feel it makes the software look more childish with the brighter colors and more playful font choices. It simply doesn't look very professional. I do like the quick-access menu to settings from the control-bar pull-down but that's about it.- Software support: Samsung has a history of pretty much making their present flagship devices very old news when they launch their next device. They've been making some effort to provide faster Android updates, but as time goes on I can't vouch for what kind of software support they'll provide you. I'm a believer that if you buy a phone, it should be supported as is without you having to root or do any other work on your own. It's unreasonable to expect the average consumer to root their phones, and they shouldn't have to. Now that Android version 4.3 got announced we can see how long they'll take for an update.Overall, I'd say the SGS4 definitely fulfills the solid camera performance criterion, does well-enough on the display quality, and offers about average battery life with options to improve it without having to buy a bulky add-on case. While I have some reservations with the build-quality, it does feel like it'll handle some drops. Since this is my dad's phone I'm giving it back to him after using it for a few weeks. The question of whether I'll buy one for myself....probably not right now. But mostly because I've resolved to wait for the next Nexus phone whenever that's released. I have a Galaxy Nexus right now which works fine, so I'm in no rush to upgrade. But if I had to buy an Android phone today it would be the SGS4 - simple as that.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The good, the bad and the touch wiz", "Author": "masa1607", "ReviewID": "ROII7G3A0C2QV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say I'm a long time android user and have used it almost since it's infancy with its first real usable version on the OS froyo. I know my way around android fairly well wouldn't call myself a pro maybe intermediate. I have owned many of the ATT versions of the galaxy phones except for the gs3 so yes I'm a big fan! That being said I almost didn't buy the Gs4, almost broke my streak and went with the HTC one. But at the end of the day while I loved the all metal construction not being able to replace the battery and a four mega pixel camera were deal breakers! I'm sorry to say mega pixels matter with or with out more light. The only reason I ever wanted the HTC one was because of it beautiful metal construction. I always here Samsung phones are no good because they made of all plastic come on you've heard it to, I guess it was starting to get to me. Then I realized that most every piece of electronics I can remember since I was a child has been made with you guessed it plastic! And while the sgs4 is made of plastic it is every bit just as quality as the HTC one, in some ways more as plastic is more flexible then aluminum. I guess I also chose the galaxy s 4 because I have owned the galaxy s 2 for years and loved it! It fell from my hands so many times a can't remember, hitting our hard wood floor many times. It was a solid all around good working phone, so choosing the galaxy s 4 was less of a stretch for me. I have owned my Galaxy s 4 for about a week now and can safely pass on to your what I love and what I don't like so much, let's start with the pros! This phone is a beauty to look at its got nice curves fits nice in the hand, the chromed Bezal along the edge takes away from the plasticy look of the device and adds a touch of elegance to it. I personally chose the white version, when you look close it has almost a carbon fiber look to it, in my opinion it looks nicer then the HTC one but not quite as nice as the iPhone 5. Moving on to the camera my absolutely favorite feature, and the included camera app that is one of the included features in touch wiz that is actually cool! This thing has a 13mp camera on the back,and is close to on par to most standard digital cameras you can buy today. Thank you Samsung for this, I have been waiting for the chance to ditch my digital camera for years. Think about it we always have our phones with us and I would bet 9 out of 10 people have taken more pictures with there phone then they ever have with a camera! Problem is have you ever gotten prints developed from pictures from your phone? Yeah they are usually bad even at 8mp like the gs2 or even iPhone 5. Not so with the galaxy s 4 the pictures are crisp clear and just all around awesome! The touch wiz camera app is awesome too, it has a feature called (best picture) it takes 8 consecutive photos and allows you to choose the best one. This an amazing feature for any one with kids, if your like me and your phone seems to take the shot at the wrong time and you miss the moment! This takes 8 pictures in the time it takes to blink it's amazing! My next love of this phone, yes that big bright screen that has more pixels then most tvs you can buy. But there isn't much to say it's amazing, it's so clear you will see that thing that's growing out of the face of your favorite actor that you just can't see on other screens. And my last thing on my list of loves, the included IR port I'm not gonna lie being able to controlle my Roku box TV and DVD player all from my phone is a major convenience, coming out of this over bloated over gagitized phone. OK, OK I love this phone wouldn't trade it but it's not with out its quarks. Hear is my list of things I don't like. First off I love that big bright screen but that means carrying a big phone, you need to take this into acount I personally find at times it's a little harder to hold on too then I'm used to with my Galaxy s 2. I also hated the fact that the home button wakes the phone as every time you move with your phone in your pocket your phone turns on killing the battery. If you root your phone this can be pretty easily fixed by following some detailed instructions so over all not a big issue. My next problem is battery life, once again big beautifully screens take Alot of juice so if your sitting down playing a game don't expect hours and hours of life. I installed an app called green power it extends your battery life by turning non necessary features off when your screen turns off. Also turning off all of the dumb touch wiz features you will use once off will get you further by miles! With light use expect a day and a half, moderate surfing the web making calls, texting and such you will make it through the day. With heavy use you will get about two hours, three if you shutt off all uneccisary services. But every one needs to remember this is par for the course for these new phones, if you want better battery the iPhone is the champ! My next problem is touch wiz ATT absolutely bloated this phone with junk no one uses, Samsung loaded it with features that let's be honest guys are cool but don't make sense in every day life. I like touch wiz in its self it has some nice feature like swiping left/right to call or text in the address book, honestly its the little things that make life easier are the cool things. You will end up turning all the other stuff off sooner or later trust me. My last big problem with this phone is memory, Samsung claims that the OS takes up 6gb leaving you a tinny 8gb for your apps and pictures! It is true that it does have a micro SD card slot. But going from 16 down to 8 is a stretch! I personally recommend rooting and putting a customer recovery and rom on your phone to fix this, if your interested in this go to [...] for detailed instructions. By doing so you can put a custom rom or custom user made android operating system on your phone. Many remove all the junk apps from ATT and some support apps to SD, allowing you to put your big game files on your micro SD card this is something not natively supported by Android since gingerbread, and in my opinion a major over sight by Google, as phones are not coming with more memory and games are getting bigger. (it should be noted that rooting/roming your phone probably will break your warranty, it's all reverseable though). Also just as an FYI I put the Google play edition rom on my phone that has no ATT junk has no touch wiz gimmicks and is much smaller in general and still only had about 10gb leaving some space for the OS there is still 4 or 5 gigs missing that's not cool, and over all my absolute most hated thing about this phone. Oh and just as one more side note, Android no longer supports flash. This has nothing to do with Samsung, Adobe decided not to support android any more and can't be found in any android device since jelly bean. So don't bash Samsung for lack of flash.To sum it all up, great phone with a huge processor although I can't really see a speed difference from my old phone its still cool, big bright beautifully screen with not so great battery, awesome camera and camera app, touch wiz is to bloated up but you can fix this, amazing design, but Samsung is being a little shady when they represent this phone as 16gb, but once again you can fix that! So if these are things you have been looking for in your new phone and if you can over look its easy to ignore little quarks then this is the phone for you, if not get an iPhone because in my opinion the GS4 and the iPhone 5 are the top dogs. My wife has the iPhone it's a great phone (it's not a war it's a preference and both have there ups and downs).

When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware from AT&T;(I don't know about other carriers but I assume it's the same) and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware. I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life. Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left. Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.-----------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome. My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands. I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges. I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5. I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone. Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone. My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp. The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching. I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year. I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands. It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame.

I've used one from time to time and have helped several family members learn to use them and occasionally do minor trouble shooting for them, and they're really solid devices overall.One of the best things in Samsung's favor is that they take keeping their devices updated pretty seriously. The Galaxy S4 is in the process of being updated to Android 4.4, where some manufacturers seem content to toss an Android device onto the market and then pretend that they have no idea that updates are a thing that should be happening. This will be a less severe issue down the line, because Google is restructuring the operating system a bit to make it easier for them to handle updates themselves rather than leaving a lot of it to the hardware companies, but it's still nice to get something from a company who's serious about their obligation to provide a good experience even after they have your cash in hand.Other than that, this has a lot of nice features. The screen is good enough for just about anyone. It handles opening and running apps at a nice pace. There's a simplified interface that hides a lot of the apps and noise, which can be good for people who find smart phones a tiny bit overwhelming at times. You can use it with a Miracast tv/receiver to mirror the screen on a tv to show off things like photos and videos without asking people to crowd around a tiny screen. The camera is excellent for both photos and videos.The screen is just a bit large for people who put a very high priority on portability and using a phone one-handed. On the other hand, this size is just big enough to be reasonably comfortable for people who struggled with the teensy tiny touch keyboards on the earlier generations of smart phones. Whether you like the way Samsung makes Android look is a matter of personal taste. I like the Google Nexus devices just a little better, but Samsung's approach is a very long way from the worst that you can find on the market.On the whole, while this isn't my personal device of choice, I've been really pleased with them. I tend to be the person providing tech support for my family members, so I've used them many times and I've had the happy experience of not being stuck putting in a ton of time trying to get them to work as they should.

I have no major issues with the S4 and would recommend this device to anyone who asked.The switch to Android from S3 was not difficult.  Android has oodles of options, features and customizations which is why I finally decided to make the leap.  The build quality is not the same as my Nokia's, but to be fair trying to best Nokia in build quality is like trying to break the Reality Distortion Field of a diehard Apple fan.  That said, I have nothing bad to say about the build compared to other manufacturers devices.  The device does not feel like it's going to break or crumble when I hold it without the Otter Box Commuter case I purchased to protect it.Android, what a beast.

I may do some research to see if PS is justified with that said, but it lasts a 9-hour work day which is all you really need.

The panorama, sound & shot and eraser modes also work exceptionally well.  You do need to know beforehand if you need to be in eraser mode for it to work, it's sort of a gimmick that merely takes multiple pictures and allows you to stitch them together, doesn't actually 'erase' moving objects but combines pictures that don't have the selected objects.  So aside from knowing you *need* to be in that mode, it does what it says it does.What's left to say?  Great device, happy with the unit.  100% disappointed with the typical BS from our mobile carriers here in the United States, but that's not Samsung's fault!If you buy this device, you won't have a regret unless you go to great length to make one up! :)", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Phone", "Author": "luisARomero", "ReviewID": "R1OKOPVZ8OYDA6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Over heat, camera is not working, unable to see photos, get frozen, get black screen, unable to use factory reset, and it is a brand new phone.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad product", "Author": "b0nn19", "ReviewID": "R3Q6Y8JYEX7XJZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought my Samsung galaxy S4 on 05/2013.

Brand new woo hoo! Got it two weeks ago or so.I was outside and the battery drained to zero (which i've never let it do before). I went home and plugged it into the charger. Doesn't charge. No led or anything. just blank.Now the phone doesn't turn on. I went to ATT DSC (Device service center), and they said it was a battery issue. I tried somebody else's s4 battery that had a 75% charge. I got a grey battery icon with a stuck circle on it. Then it black screens. Phone refuses to turn on. So it's not a battery issue and technician is a moron.When I put in a battery, sometimes the LED flash on the camera will stay lit for a few seconds, but no matter what i do or what combination of buttons (power + volume up, etc etc) the phone will not turn on. Sometimes when I plug in the phone for a few hours, the phone gets incredibly hot but still won't turn on.Tried the samsung charger and cable with half a dozen outlets and computer usbs..And the phone is completely stock. No ROMS, no nothing. Never dropped it, never submersed in water either. I've always taken great care of my phones.I went from an iphone 5 to this. I was so ecstatic - like an upgrade in most ways! I've had iPhones for 3 years now, but wanted to try android. Guess the Apple powers that be have punished me for my treachery... Never had a single hardware related problem with them, but two weeks of getting this new phone? DEAD.Now I've gotta wait for my replacement REFURBISHED phone to come in the mail. Nothing like paying for a new phone and getting a refurbished one two weeks later that may crap out again because it's shoddily repaired by some AT&T; gnome. Thank goodness I paid like 7 dollars for it initially through my haggling skills.I'm sure people here will call me a liar. They'll point to the fact that I have few reviews. (I have multiple forum accounts with a thousand posts). Tell me that I'm hiding some kind of physical/water damage. Maybe they'll say that I bricked it from flashing a ROM, or that i'm some kind of apple lover. I am not. I'm just letting you know that my particular experience with this phone is that it's durability and quality control blows. TWO WEEKS.I've lost all the data and apps/customization i had.

It has a removable battery and expandable storage for a mini micro SD card. The five inch super amoled screen is quite lovely. It's lightweight and the size of the device is very manageable even with the Trident Aegis case I'm using with it. Call quality is certainly better than on my iphone 5s. What's the problem then? Well, it's actually a pretty big one for me. In fact, it's a deal breaker! This phone constantly lags and even freezes at times. Sometimes, it requires restarting the device. I have to constantly go in to settings to clear out the ram. The Touch Wiz UI simply overwhelms the internals despite the 2 Gigs of ram. (Prior to this device, I owned a Galaxy Note 2 which worked much more seamlessly despite being a prior generation device.) I wish I had purchased the Note 3 instead. I suspect it can much better handle the Touchwiz user interface due to its 3 gigs of ram. Also, I miss have the larger phablet sized screen. So, I can not recommend the S4 despite liking so much about the phone. However, these lagging/freezing issues could possibly be alleviated somewhat when the kit kat update becomes available. But, that's probably more wishful thinking than anything else! Oh, there's one feature that truly annoys me which is S voice. I went into settings and deactivated it altogether. It seems redundant when Google voice is so superior. If you can manage with a costlier and larger device, you may want to consider the Note 3. I base that on my experience with the Note 2 and the positive things that I've discovered about the similar S4. I also own an Iphone 5s which I do like a great deal. However, the 4 inch screen is simply too small for my comfort. My wife also has an Iphone and is quite delighted with hers. But, once again, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is a no go for me because of the lagging and freezing issues caused by Touchwiz! -Charlie", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this Phone", "Author": "missusparsons \"Shon\"", "ReviewID": "R17CGZIXDXDIHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great screen, brilliant color.

I purchased this phone while switching cellular providers and I needed an affordable alternative - this phone was on sale for free with a two year commitment. Are you reading my review to figure out if you should be buying an Android based phone or iPhone? This is the wrong review to read! I'll simply say\u00a0Apple makes great products that are simple to use and generally very reliable products. If you demand quality products that are as simple to use as a calculator or rotary phone - the iPhone is your choice.As a consumer who largely purchases Apple products - I am very satisfied with the Galaxy S4. Every Samsung product I have purchased has been extremely reliable and long lasting. I even tried the Nexus 5 prior purchasing this phone because it was cheap enough to purchase and not be bound to contracts. That's when I realized I wasn't happy with the LG manufactured Nexus 5, but was impressed with how evolved the Android operating system has become over the years.I choose to purchase the Samsung Galaxy S4 on sale for the cost of a two year commitment ($325 termination, discounted $10 less per month of service) and return the Nexus 5 that I purchased cash for $349.99. AT&T;'s network has been the most reliable for me in my area - and being that it is a \"GSM\" network (a type of technology used in Europe, mostly) - I can browse the internet and speak on the phone at the same time. The only other major carrier in my area that allows this is T-Mobile. I rarely (if ever) have had dropped calls or service issues with AT&T; in the past and I regret having recently left them as a customer for another carrier's enticing offers. They have outstanding customer service, their billing department will work with you should you need extended grace periods or payment arrangements should a crisis or emergency fall into your life. I have no complaints about AT&T;'s customer service or network.I am rambling about AT&T; because you, are, after all, reading about an AT&T; Galaxy S4!Ok - after leaving a premium Apple product, these are the things that earned the Galaxy S4 five stars -1. A stunningly gorgeous display that looks like a paper color photograph.2. A large display that is more comfortable to read web pages and news.Things I like when comparing to my iPhone 5S -3. Snappy electronics that make the phone feel even faster and more responsive than my iPhone 5S.4. Lots of cool technology like a \"built in\" universal remote for TVs and home electronics.5. A camera (I'm a photographer) that I find to be amazing.6. I can replace the battery and add memory.7. It works with generic and universal charging cables I can buy at discount stores or online.And in General ....8. Not a single glitch or error with the supplied hardware and software!!!!!!!!!!!!My view points regarding what other review sites say about similar phones:CHEAP PLASTIC BACKEveryone complains about the plastic back not feeling like premium aluminum like HTC and Apple products. The advantage is that you can easily replace the back panel, add memory and replace your battery - or carry a spare. My phone is in a case anyway and when I owned an $850 iPhone, all of it's pretty style was hidden just like the S4 is.DOES NOT FEEL AS COMFORTABLE \"IN-HAND\" COMPARED TO NEXUS-5 AND HTCI really don't see a problem here. This is a subject talked about just to sell a review - if a review site or blog makes great points, it adds to their credibility and increases the odds that they gain your future readership. Bottom line is - I think this phone feels fine, and the OtterBox communter series case makes it feel even more comfortable in my hands.SOFTWARE INSTALLED BY SAMSUNG AND A&T;People will complain that this software, called bloatware, eats up memory and ruins the interface of Google's android operating system. This is true - I'm not sure why AT&T; offers their \"for a charge\" GPS navigation when you can use Google Maps for free. What they fail to tell you is that you can disable this software, compensate for lost memory with adding a memory card - or - if you're feeling daring, you can \"root\" your phone (assume administrative control) and delete the software you don't need. Some of the software is actually very useful - like the remote control program, and the software that tracks your health. Some of it is a waste, but, it may be easier for certain people to use than third party applications.COMPLICATED ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEMYes, Apple wins hands down if you want a simple interface that works and software that is simple to use. There are certain features on this phone are really cool but have to be turned off if you want a normal battery life - for example, \"Google NOW and location history\" which is a brilliant attempt at giving you updates that are relevant to you (weather, amount of time to go to work, etc...) provided in real time. If you're not technically oriented, it may be difficult to figure these things out.So, that's my opinion on this phone - I think it's excellent. I am also learning to love Google's services - such as contacts and calendar. They are real easy to edit, update and organize online. From palm pilots to blackberries to windows mobile, then to iPhones - I must have had over a decade of calendars and contacts that have accumulated over time. It took me about four hours on a weekend morning to import everything into a Google account, replace nicknames with full names, erase old contacts and categorize everything into groups - such as - family, work, friends, etc.This is not a phone you will be disappointed with. I place it in the same category as the iPhone. I place them both ahead of the Nexus 5, and I have no opinion about the HTC ONE because I have never used one.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung galaxy s4", "Author": "myint swe", "ReviewID": "R2HYKVABSJF2S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "high speed processor and amazing functions.i want to recommend everyone.samsung galaxy s4 is better than everything else, great.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Douglas \"College English professor who loves ...", "ReviewID": "R1BJXI6PD5AFGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got mine at an AT&T; outlet for $1!

So I'm bringing that review here in hopes that it will have a chance for people to read.  Sorry...it's not an Amazon confirmed purchased, but I did bought it through AT&T; when I finally upgraded from my 16GB iPhone 3G...so here goes!\"Features 5 out of 5Performance 3 out of 5Design 3 out of 5Value 2 out of 5I was very excited to finally upgrade from my AT&T; iPhone 3G 16GB White to the Samsung GS4 16GB White device. I was so excited to be receiving this device that seem to do everything but cook!  It took a few hours to adjust from iOS to the Android but that was seamless. And it took a bit of an adjustment to the size difference...both in the weight & width. I was very impressed with the gimmicks this phones had to offer. I quite liked the swipe feature while texting or emailing & the fact that the device learns your individual style of writing very quickly. I liked the fact that I could add unknown words to its dictionary so that the next time, it would bring that word up more quicker. I found the smart scroll easier to adjust (once I read-up online that's it's the hand tilting that makes it move & not your eyes). The eye come up & changes color from blue to green once it detects that you are looking or reading the screen. Your hand tilting is what makes the screen go up or down. That took a few hours to adjust but I think I've mastered that feature! I also liked the air gestures including scrolling & preview as well. That one can master those features almost immediately. I was a bit disappointed in there being no flash video capabilities, but I've lived with that (or shall I say...without that) for so long that that's a non issue for me. Loved the 13MP Rear Facing & 2MP Front Facing Cameras & all the various functionalities! I especially loved the feature of taking pics & the photographer can now be included in the fun at the same time! In fact, I liked most of what Samsung/AT&T; had to offer in this model except for the phone hard-drive/memory storage & the phone resetting itself...both of which are deal breakers!That's right, my SGS4 factory reset itself two nights ago! No warning, nothing I did; I was listening to a radio app & it just shutdown! I thought the app crashed & simply went to restart it & had discover that the phone shutdown. When I powered it on again, that's when I discovered that it had done a factory reset!  Luckily, I had my contacts, pics & videos backed-up by AT&T; Locker app; however, I lost all text message conversations, music, & time....yes time I had spent setting-up the device...personalizing it for me & my use only for that to have happen. I'm not sure the cause behind the phone doing a self factory reset but I can't risk this happening again.Then there's the fact that this product has been (& still is taunted as being 16GB...now AT&T; is offering the 32GB but the 64GB still isn't for sale as of yet for unknown reasons). Anyhoo, I had the unpleasant discovery that 6.38, nearly a third of my 16GB of storage/memory, have been devoted to propriety apps between Samsung & AT&T;! This leaves me with only 9.62GB of storage/memory for the my use & NOT 16GB or even 14GB. I downloaded some apps, taken a few pics/videos, received a few text messages & emails, had a 144 songs (roughly 4.28MB) transferred to the phone (which are now gone & I've hadn't the time to retransfer again as of yet) & I now only have 4.87GB left! I've only had the device since 4/26/2013! When I queried AT&T; agents about this, I was told to simply go out & buy ADDITIONAL storage/memory (up to 64GB). Aye...so I consider going out to buy ADDITIONAL storage/memory at ADDITIONAL cost to me but discovered that the additional storage/memory would be good for pics/videos, document files, & music ONLY. Get this...I WILL NOT be able to download, install, or back-up apps on the ADDITIONAL storage/memory & worst yet, I WILL NOT be able to uninstall some of those proprietary apps that I DO NOT USE without rooting or jail breaking the device! If one does, one can kiss their warranty goodbye which really would suck.So sadly, I must return this to AT&T; for an exchange of another smart phone minus the gimmicks this device offer...probably the iPhone 5 as Apple seem to be the only ones who can put-out products that a) work the way they stated & b) give the customer the proper storage/memory to work with & c) are stable/reliable. I just don't like being forced to upgrade my device when the contract is up.  I held onto my iPhone as long as I could until Apple stopped updating the iOS & now stopped updating all apps.  I've had my iPhone 3G since April' 2009...it came with 16GB (of which only 1.54GB were devoted to proprietary apps shared between AT&T; & Apple) which left me with 14.46GB to consume in any manner that I wanted. Four years later, I still have 6.14GB left (1.27GB more than what I currently have left on my SGS4) after downloading 232 apps, one movie, three books bought through the iBooks, 96 songs, & 156 pics/videos. And it never once did a hard reset without me doing it.And no, I would not recommend this device to anyone until Samsung/AT&T; correct the misrepresentation of their product's storage/memory capacity.Pros: Inexpensive, Durable, Lightweight, air gestures smart scroll & swipe keyboards, 13mp rear facing camera & featuresCons: Did not meet expectations, storage capacity misrepresentation\"", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yet another enchanting product from Samsung", "Author": "Mahavir", "ReviewID": "R1CVI1T500HBP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been following the reviews from a lot of sites including phonearena.com, gsmarena.com, cnet.com and watched a lot many videos about Samsung Galaxy 4 (SG4) before I purchased this device.

This is really nice for reading.I also liked the features on Touch Wiz SW. Some may complain about the SW/features being all over, but it is highly customizable.So, you can turn off the things you do not like or care.A lot of nifty tools have been baked in, so I ended up uninstalling a lot of apps I used to use. This is a good thing.I used to try out custom ROMs all the time, but I do not see the need for it with GS4. Again, feature rich and highly customizable.There are people complaining about the material being plastic and say aluminum is more premium material.I disagree. I saw HTC One at the at&t; store and its edges were already chipped. Aluminum is actually fairly soft metal.With its plastic back cover, I can replace it at $10 if I need to.Overall build quality is solid and I cannot understand some people saying it is like toys because of the use of plastic.Connecting with my old bluetooth device and control of apps like DoggCatcher for podcast works flawlessly.(I had issues with the same set up when using the HTC One X due to poor SW on it)Overall, my experience with GS4 has been very stable, consistent, and solid.I have not had the GS3, so I am not sure how much improvement they have made from it.But if anyone is coming from older gen android devices, you will really enjoy using this phone.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S3.5 Might be More Appropriate", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R250ZXNQSPF77", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll start off giving a bit of background on my smartphone usage.  I've pretty much been a Droid user for my whole life.  I'm definitely a power user and I greatly enjoyed having a keyboard.  I could type long text messages or emails with ease, and I never really had that much interest in switching to a non-keyboard phone.  Unfortunately, that decision was taken out of my hands somewhat.  I have the Droid 4 which I greatly enjoy, but it has it's own problems.  After having it for about a year it got a pretty nasty crack on it.  I played around with some friends GS3's and was very impressed with them.  However the rumors about the GS 4 coming out had already started so I decided to hold off.  I'm glad that I did, but a lot of my review will be based off of not having the GS3 and making such a drastic switch.  As I put in the title, it seems to be minor improvements upon a design they've found worked as opposed to the drastic changes previously seen.  Without further ado...The Looks:There isn't much positive to be said about the aesthetics of the Galaxy S4 body to be honest.  It looks and feels like a cheap toy.  It feels... clammy might be the best way to describe it.  It really isn't the best feel when you're holding it, and compared to the HTC One it's disappointing.  It doesn't seem like it had that much effort put into changing it.  It does feel sturdy though, despite being a very thin phone.  I was able to get a good grip on it though which is important to me since I'm rather small.  Overall I would give the looks a 2.5/5The Hardware:Huge upgrade over.. well anything but a computer.  This really is just a small computer, and it runs flawlessly.  The screen is massive and great.  Easily the best one that I've seen on a phone.  The 5\" screen could be a little bit big for some people I think, but for most of the younger generation will be ok with it though.  The battery is incredible as well.  My Droid 4 would die around 4 or so after a normal days use (streaming music, internet, tons of emails, etc).  This will last me all day, including going out at night which is a massive incentive to me.  The camera is great on it as well, much better than any other Android phone.  It is still slightly edged out by the iPhone though.  Overall though I would give it a 5/5 on hardwareThe Software:I'll start with the obvious, it's actually running the latest version of Jelly Bean, and should keep up better than other phones do (minus Nexus 4.)  This is a huge bonus, because Android's because fault is that the OS is so fragmented.  Now, Samsung has put a ton of their own software on top of Jelly Bean.  The best description would be that it's overwhelming probably.  There are a lot of Samsung apps that really will just never be used.  So I'm not even going to bother going over the party trick type apps.  Instead I'll talk about a few that really caught my attention.S Health:  Helpful now, will be awesome in the future.  The premise is that it's a basically a fitbit built into your phone.  It helps you track calories, steps walked, workouts, etc.  It works great now, but I don't think that it will get better with accessories.WatchON:  Basically it acts as a universal TV remote and a Netflix browser.  It's great, and I don't even watch very much TV.  I suspect that this will become the standard soon, but until then this is the best version you can get.Air View/Gesture:  A great idea, but not great in practice.  It's glitchy currently and doesn't always work (or does work in ways that you don't want it to.)Camera Software:  There's actually a lot of really great features that come with the camera.  The most novel of them is the ability to take a picture from the front and back cameras at the same time.  I can see this actually becoming standard in the future as well.Overall I think that the software is good, but not perfect.  Overall I would still rather just have stock jelly bean.  Samsung adds some good features, but it also adds a lot of stuff that I really don't need and can't get rid of.Final Impressions:It's a good phone, there's no doubt about that. It's not a great phone though.  The screen is amazing, the body isn't.  The software is good, the hardware is out of this world.  It all comes down to personal preference between this and the HTC One I think.  Personally I'm fine just putting a case on my GS 4, but I've always been more interested in battery and hardware.  I can completely understand picking a slight downgrade on those areas though in return for a great body like the HTC One has.4/5", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will NEVER EVER buy another Samsung product!!!!", "Author": "BonnieDurham", "ReviewID": "R2PYVSPE6EST6S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My Samsung Galaxy S4 was the best phone I've ever had, . . for 9 months. My son and wife have iPhones and I often showed them features of the Galaxy that were not available on the iPhone. However, after 9 months, the phone would no longer charge when powered on. It would charge when powered off though. The phone comes with a \"1 year warranty\" so I called and opened a repair ticket with them.When I sent the phone in, I was very confident Samsung would repair or replace the phone for several reasons:- I hadn't done anything to harm the phone (never dropped it or got it wet)- It'd been in an Otterbox Defender case since day 1 which protected the phone very well- Samsung's customer service HAD been INCREDIBLE in the past. I bought a Samsung refrigerator in 2009 with 2 ice makers - 1 of which was defective after just a few weeks. About 2 weeks after I'd initially reported the problem to Samsung, they called me to ask if I was happy with the repair and customer service I'd received. I told them the service tech was still waiting on parts to come in. They told me I'd been waiting too long and said they would just REPLACE the refrigerator!! I couldn't believe it. I thought this is the kind of company I won't hesitate to buy products from and told many people about the incredible customer service I'd received.However, it seems a lot has changed in the past few years. I came home this evening and there was a message from Samsung stating that I needed to pay for the repair of my phone because \"it was out of warranty, due to condition\".I called Samsung, and the first person I spoke to told me that a technician had examined the phone. The technician reported that there was water damage to the LCD screen. I told the person I'd never gotten the phone wet. Now I know the majority of you reading this are thinking I got the phone wet. Honestly, I NEVER got the phone wet! The person told me, all they could do was go by what the technician said and that if I wanted the phone repaired, it would cost me approx $160. I insisted I'd never gotten the phone wet. In fact, I told the person, before sending the phone to Samsung, while researching what might be wrong with the phone, I found that there are stickers placed on the battery and on the phone to indicate if the phone had ever been wet. I told the person, I had examined the stickers before shipping the phone to Samsung and both stickers indicated the phone had never been wet. However, all she offered to do was accept my payment or return the phone to me without being repaired. After seeing I was not making any headway with this person, I asked to speak to her supervisor.The supervisor, Jamie, was absolutely no help at all. I'm not sure how Jamie could even call himself a customer service rep, let alone a supervisor. After listening to my complaint he gave me the same 2 options the first person gave me (as if they were from a script) - he \"told\" me he \"understood\" my complaint but it was quite obvious he didn't care at all. He gave me 2 options:- pay to have the phone repaired- ship it back to meI insisted I had not damaged the phone and had never gotten it wet and refused to pay to have it repaired. I told him I have a $1300 television and $2000 refrigerator with Samsung's name on them, and many other Samsung products in my house, but if Samsung is no longer willing to stand behind their products, I will not be purchasing them anymore. Again, like a broken record, Jamie told me he \"understood\" and repeated my 2 options.At this point I told him that, \"he didn't understand!\", and that if he did, at a minimum, he would have offered to contact the technician to re-evaluate the phone. I told Jamie I would not be paying to have the phone repaired, and to do whatever he wanted to do and hung up.A short time later, I received an e-mail from Samsung stating: \"We regret to inform you that your service order has been Cancelled by Agent.Cancelled Reason: Customer Request (by agent) \"i contacted Verizon and asked if they could help in any way. They referred me to the \"Voice of the Customer\" link on Samsung's website.

But this one uses the same pop-up keyboard that it has while texting or anything else... the way it's designed to pop up into focus let's me see my homescreen wallpaper through my lock-screen wallpaper -_-' ... OH well, I can live with that I guess.The keyboard sucks... I would of have thought that having a bigger screen meant the keys would be scaled up... (for crying out loud, the keyboad is full screen on the S2, right?) You might think thats ok? Try unlocking your phone during rush hour traffic on a 5-lane highway doing 75... you may just get a new perspective here...I got an Otterbox Defender case for the S4. Disappointed that the new cases aren't as thick for the S4 as they are for my S2, but that's otterbox, not me. HOWEVER -> I set the option to turn off the screen when Im taking a call... standard factory feature, right? So why the crap does the screen not come back ON when I pull the phone from my face?? I was setting up visual voicemail, called my voicemail, logged into it, and then the screen does not come back on when I want to delete the messages...\"Ok, wtf\"  as it keeps looping through the 3 or so recordings it has stored. NONE of the hard/soft buttons on the phone will get the screen to come back on (usually hitting power or the middle hard key bring the screen back up during regular calls)...As I begin to pull the Defender case off to pull the battery out, the screen comes back on and starts to function AS IT SHOULD OF HAVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING when I pull the front half of the defender off the face of the phone...You've got to be kidding me if the light/proximity sensor is so insensitive now that the case (which doesn't cover any of the light sensors, fyi) keeps the phone from noticing that I pull it from my face...This whole thing is the reason I almost want to throw my phone into a padded wall half the time.... However, I am beginning do doubt it will survive that like my S2 always did, based on how it's doing so far...I highly suggest buying this for the spec, and then waiting until the software either upgrades, or rolling back to an older OS version...", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "I tried to like this phone....", "Author": "D.

The second browser on my Mac is Firefox - I'll blame that for now.Second, I stand by my statements on speed.  Tonight, I attempted to manually dial my work voice-mail.  The phone display could not keep up with my dialing.  We're not talking fractions of a second here, but 1 or 2 full seconds.  Playing Candy Crush over bluetooth in my car is interesting (don't ask why) - the sound effects are about 2 seconds late.  Maybe I will disable battery saving mode tomorrow and see if it's more responsive, and at what cost to battery life.Third, FYI you *can* hide the keyboard in the text message app. (and probably email) by hitting the physical back key on the phone.Lastly, I wanted to point out one other thing for Android newbies.  There are actually two email clients included.  The default client - the one shown when you first turn the phone on - does not have swipe to delete as I mentioned below, but the second one, GMail, does.  However, you will also find that only the default client displays a \"badge\" (iPhone users know this as the count of new emails attached to the icon).  So, you must choose between knowing why your phone just alerted you (other than opening the notification window), and having the swipe-to-delete feature, but you don't get to have both unless you find something else.  This is both the curse and the power of a more open system such as Android.  You get to pick the features you like, but you may not find them all in the same product.===============I upgraded from an iPhone 4s to the Galaxy S4. Here are my thoughts on Android Jellybean and the Samsung Galaxy S4 after a marathon weekend from the perspective of a long-time iPhone user.- S-voice is nearly useless.  It cannot tell the difference between \"Don\" and \"Dawn\", and never seems to get street name correct, returning (almost) phonetically equivalent sentences.  I will really miss Siri, especially in the car.- The display is dim.  You do get used to it, and the colors are nice (I set it to cinema to get rid of cartoonish look), but when you pick up your old iPhone again it is shocking how much brighter it is- There's a lot more screen, but not a lot more useful screen.  YouTube videos and web browsing aside, I'm not seeing as much benefit as I thought I would with this huge screen.  There are a few things that contribute to this impression:o For text messages and emails, there is an extra row of keys across the top of the keyboard for numbers, and yet another extra row of word suggestions.  I love having the number keys there, but they do take space.o The font is larger.  This is somewhat adjustable, but the adjustment doesn't seem to be universal, and there isn't a lot of granularity in the size selection (x-large, large, normal, small, x-small I think).  Extra small isn't really very small.o To see a Text Message conversation, I haven't figured out how to hide the keyboard.o The widgets are large (more below).- Widgets and applications: I actually really like widgets, and using them to build a different screen for different activities (my workout page has a run tracker plus MP3 player, and my home page has the weather and my calendar).  However, I was surprised to find out that most useful widgets are rather large, and you can only fit two or three to a screen, and then only if there are no application shortcuts.o Email - There is no swipe-to-delete.  It feels like a step backwards; and again, the keyboard dominates the screen.o Text Messages - as I mentioned, it's hard to see a whole conversation.  I will have to talk to longtime Samsung owners at work about this one.o Phone - very large buttons - nice, I guess.  It works fine.o Web browser - the initial view of active windows that came up on the default browser (FireFox [EDIT: Chrome] is also included) had buttons that were too small to press reliably.  Let me remind you, this is a 5\" screen, and exactly the type of thing I was trying to remedy with this phone.o The Motortrend app.  This application is completely unusable on this device.  I read articles using this app. a lot on the iPhone when I'm in a waiting room or otherwise bored, but on the SG4, you cannot read any of the articles - the text is microscopic.  There is an accessibility setting on the phone that provides magnification.  This was OK, but you have to continuously slide the now too-large text back and forth to read.  Not worth the trouble.  I think this is the \"fragmentation\" issue people mention when discussing Android.  The application was probably created for the least common denominator, which means it assumes a much lower pixel density, and the font was sized appropriately for that.- Usability - You have to get used to using a menu key and the physical back button instead of looking for back/delete buttons on the screen.  The menu key is context-sensitive, meaning the options vary by application.  Sometimes there is a delete key, and sometimes you hope there is a delete option on the menu.And then there is the over-scroll bounce patent workaround.  Occasionally lists just abruptly stop, but usually there is a blue glow to indicate you're at the end of something.  This can be slightly frustrating, because when the list is shorter than the screen you're not sure if it is lagging trying to scroll, or it's just a short list.  There is no blue glow in this case, but on an iPhone it would bounce, showing the linen pattern underneath.- Synchronization - This is a very weak area, and may ultimately prove to be the deal breaker for me.  Apparently Samsung has a robust version of something called \"Kies\" for Windows, which performs iTunes-like functionality for moving data between computer and phone, and can even work wirelessly.  The Mac version is the red-headed stepchild, and apparently it has a ton of issues with Mountain Lion, which I don't have yet.  I really don't appreciate a situation where my phone might prevent me from upgrading my computer OS, but there would be no other way to update the phone firmware.  And you can forget about all your iTunes playlists.- Performance - I'm sorry, but I don't know what the 4-core 1.9Ghz processor with 2GB RAM is up to.  Just for fun I installed a slide-to-unlock theme.  The slider couldn't keep up with my finger, and the moving highlight stuttered.  Scrolling through lists is still laggy, and every button press, though fairly responsive, has an almost imperceptible delay.  Everything responds 1/10th of a second later than you expect.  I'm not sure whether I can get used to this.- Battery - I took my iPhone 4s off charger on Sat at around 11 PM.  I kept my SG4 plugged in until 8AM this morning.  Both were fully charged when they were disconnected.  I've answered a couple of MMS messages that included pictures on the iPhone, and played with settings to try to stop routing everything through iMessage.  It's 4PM now and it has 86% charge.  I wrote two text messages on the Galaxy, played a portion of one song, and deleted an email.  It is currently at 76% charge.  So, though this is unscientific, the iPhone has been running for 17 hours (mostly standby) and has a lot more juice than the Samsung has after 8 hours (also mostly standby).  Yes, I have the Samsung on power saving mode but with a slight bump in display brightness (still much dimmer than iPhone).  The Samsung has BT and cellular enabled (no NFC or Wifi); the iPhone has Wifi and BT enabled.- Camerao I was really worried about low-light performance of the camera in the Galaxy based on comparisons between it and the HTC One (and iPhone 5).  It turns out you need simply select the night mode and it works acceptably well to my eye.That's about it for now.  I haven't decided whether to keep this beast or not.  The alternatives would be an iPhone 5, with what I still consider to be a too small screen, and the HTC One, which has a bright (LCD) screen but suffers from all of the other problems, though I read in several reviews it was less laggy, but also has an older OS version and is built by a company with a record of not providing much in the way of updates.

Last night I used it, put it in my pocket, drove home and when I got home it had that small chip in the screen. I didn't drop it, run in to anything, or did anything that would have made this crack. I took it back to At&T; store where they told me there was nothing they could do because it was accidental damage and Samsung told me the same. I had my iPhone for 4 years and never had a scratch but this didn't last 4 days despite being really careful with it. Now its a very small 1/8 inch by 1/2 inch chip that doesn't extend into the screen and doesn't effect the function and with the case its hard to see so it's not really bothering me too much but if this is a sign of its durability its going to be a long 2 years.ProsI love it!

You have to see it to really appreciate it.  It's extremely light in the hand.  Performance wise, it is fast, but in some situations it can get kind of laggy.

I am not an advocate of paying any service provider for data plans. If you reside in NYC like myself there are so many WIFI hot spots that you do not require 4 G or whatever speed these phones provide while not online. So you sign a contract with a provider for the mighty Samsung Galaxy and what do you get, a camera and video that is slightly better to that of the I phone 5, yet inferior to the Nokia Lumia 928 windows 8 phone. You do not have apps that are truly compatible with Microsoft office. You do have a sleek design, and the \"cool\" phone. Now do you need any of these phones? Not to sound like a conspirator, but with these phones, it just allows big brother to track you with built in GPS devices etc, and make \"data mining easier\" If you do not know what data mining is Google it.Most people I see are using this phone for music and gaming and perhaps some streaming when home, (video without WiFi is just not practical). The solution to the social disease, well with this phone (for Droid fans) this website offers something a lot more practical The Kindle Fire HD.

You can purchase one for a one time fee, and pay nothing month to month, and save yourself a ton of cash with a regular phone no matter who your provider is!
