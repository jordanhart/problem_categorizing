This is an unlocked AT&T; phone and all the settings are configured for this carrier.  In order to get it to work with another service provider you will need to figure out how to change your settings (not as intuitive as other phones, and the user documentation doesn't match the phone).  You will also need to download and install new 'service books' that match the provider you wish to use - which you will have to find online somewhere as most providers don't have service books for a device they don't support.OK - supposing you got past that headache, now you are ready to use your phone.  This is the pleasant part.  The phone feels nice, it's certainly attractive, the screen is large and lovely and the keyboard is excellent.  The battery life is on par with other smartphones I've used (unimpressive, but hey it's a mini-computer doing stuff in the background all the time).  Call quality is good as is reception.  The device synched up to my motorola headset and my car bluetooth without a hiccup.1 week later the phone is dead.  Went to sleep with a full battery and woke up to a phone that wouldn't boot with a red x on the screen.  No amount of hard resetting or removing the battery and sim card will get it to respond.  According to the blackberry support forums I'm supposed to re-install the OS, but the phone will not respond enough for me to do so.  The only thing I haven't done thus far is try a new battery, and at this point I'm so frustrated (by first having to figure out its unintuitive data settings and now this) that I think I might get more satisfaction from watching it drop from my 10th floor balcony.I'm afraid the negative aspects of owning this phone have far outweighed the relatively positive user experience I had for the brief time that it was working.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleased in the Bahamas", "Author": "Bennycake", "ReviewID": "RX3A13JMNSSUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It came as advertised, it is very user friendly.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R28AVGG3V38HIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Blackberries may no longer be the top 'smart phones' because they don't do everything well but for what I consider their 'core' features - email and phone, in that order - they are still up there at the top. And the Torch is the current top Blackberry at the time I'm writing this. As a 'business phone', it combines the best features of 'traditional' blackberries with the best a highly graphical, 'touch' interface can provide. For a 'phone and entertainment' device, there may be better alternatives.My review is not going to discuss the Torch long list of features and capabilities. They are all listed on Amazon's product page and in 100 different sites, including RIM's own. I will only talk about why I currently prefer the Torch vs. anything else as a 'business' phone even now when my employer would allow me to use other brands if I wanted to.THE TORCH ADVANTAGE- Physical keyboard - The most visible Torch feature is the sliding keyboard. This allows for a larger display when compared to, let's say, the Bold, without resulting into a larger phone. The illuminated keyboard seems to be the exact same size of a Bold's, only it becomes available when needed. This is not the only phone with a sliding keyboard but this is probably the best engineered one. Sliding the keyboard in and out is quick, near-effortless and it quickly becomes second nature.- Touch screen - Not the first Blackberry with the feature but this seems to be the best on a BB so far. Yes, it's not as good as iPhone's but, for what I'm using it, it's just right. There is an on-screen keyboard which adapts itself to portrait/landscape but that's the least advantage the touch screen offers. The new Blackberry OS allows me to 'touch' just about anything on the screen and trigger... something. Gestures are also supported including 'pinch-zoom' in and out. And, related...- Buttons - Maybe this should have been at the top of the list. This Blackberry does not force me to do everything by touching the screen. Just about everything can be done by either pushing/clicking a button and controlling the cursor with the little trackpad or by interacting directly with the screen (tap virtual buttons) or a combination. Most of the time it's 'a combination' for me and it's always the way I feel most comfortable about doing things. I appreciate the ability to use physical buttons when I want it.- Email integration - This is a 'soft' feature. The Torch can integrate several email accounts, including the 'enterprise' email into one 'consolidated' mailbox while still giving me the ability to view them separately if I chose to do so.- Wi-Fi - The Wi-Fi ability saves money. My employer encouraged me to pick a plan that charges by the call. Unless it's a VoIP. Therefore, while at home or in the office, the Torch makes calls the Wi-Fi way at no cost to my employer.THE LETDOWNS[Some of the comments below may or may not apply, depending of the carrier. Mine is AT&T.;]- The App Store - Not so good, not too many selections and a lot of 'premium' apps doing things that lots of free apps or significantly less expensive apps would do in an Android or Apple environment.-  Paid GPS and other services - AT&T; would like us to 'subscribe' to the GPS service. GPS does not need 3G or any connection to the phone company to do what GPS does. My in-car GPS takes me from here to there, updates its maps (for free) whenever I connect it to my laptop and it gives me real-time traffic updates. And I don't pay one dime in subscriptions. GPS should be free.- Many More 'premium' Services - I understand that phone companies want to make as much money as they possibly can but competition is tough and I found no incentive to take advance of paid 'radio' or similar offers.- The Battery - Without watching movies, just a little bit of Web browsing and regular phone and mail, the Torch would need daily recharges. It would go for 2-3 days with phone and email (no browsing) only. A longer battery life would have been nice.MY RATING (4.5 stars)I will round this up to 5 stars because I am really happy with my Torch. There are some real issues when it comes to 'apps' and services other than phone and mail but, from my point of view, they don't matter to me much. Yes, the battery is a concern and at time I worried about running out of juice in a place where a recharge was no possible, but all the other 'weak' features I don't miss because I don't use. The Torch is my 'business' phone and just about everything that impacts my business it's done well.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery assault", "Author": "I.

Dowling", "ReviewID": "R3S9XICY4QWP2G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I enjoy cell phones.  Not just for their basic function, but for how far they have come as a tool in our lives and the convenience, efficiency, and even the luxury they can bring.  This is especially so when you have found a phone that fits your wants and needs congruently.  For me, that phone is the Blackberry Torch 9800 (which I have in red which obviously is a simple aesthetic choice).  While is doesn't have all the toys and bells and whistles that say, the iPhone 4G S has . . .It fits beautifully with what I need from my phone.  There is something to be said for phone being more cell phone than you need.  Personally, I see the iPhone as more of a toy than a tool. I am also not a fan of being restricted to a touch screen which has some serious drawbacks of its own, regardless of the model, not the least of which is reduced battery life, overheating, and typing accuracy.  The BB Torch has the option of using either the physical keyboard or the touchscreen, and even better than can be used together harmoniously to complete tasks, play games, do up your schedule, sync contacts, etc.  I have owned mine for a little over two weeks now, and thus far, it is the best phone I have owned.  I have had a cell phone non-stop since I was 21.  I am 36 now.  I am familiar with the early days of cell phones being used to make and receive calls . . .PERIOD.  How far we have come!  The torch has some girth and weight to it (without being to heavy), which is a feature I enjoy.  The keyboard slides out easily, and feels sturdy.  I have worked with some which feel like they are going to fall off any day now.  I like the predominantly stainless steel constuction and not plastic (which I hate) so the device does not feel like a toy or no better than a flimsy prepaid handset, as I find many of them indistinguishable from their contract phone counterparts.RIM has designed a sleek, sexy phone for people who have busy lives and need a strong tool to keep things organized and enjoy some bells and whistles at the same time.  The phone has an MP3 player built-in and expandable memory up to 32GB with a microSD card ( a major darback of the IPhone in my mind).  The battery life is remarkably robust for a phone with such a large, crisp screen.  As many of you know, the screen typically draws the most power of any element of a cell phone.  I have noted this to be a common complaint on this phone, however, I would argue the Iphones' continues to be one of the worse offenders on the market still, despite any tweaks Apple has made.  iPhones are also grotesquely overpriced.  I much prefer purchasing a separate iPod touch.  I am not a fan of combining the devices.  You can also enjoy all the fun apps on your iPod or iPad, should opt for the more expensive toy.  What can I say?  I like to keep my tools separate from my toys.You will enjoy all of BB's high quality software and operating system.  Any early issues have been easily and deftly resolved by software updates.  My girlfriend spect 15 minutes playing with my Torch (no dirty jokes please! ;)  and she had to get one, so I bought her one as well and she loves it, and she does not consider herself a highly tech-savvy individual.  She is learning its operating system and its quirks quickly.  I suspect in the future I am going to be a Blackberry man for life as I use its business features for work, banking, and conducting my family's financial business.  This is just a terrific phone.  For features I strongly recommend purchasing at least the $30 data package from AT&T;, even if you don't think you will use this or you haven't in the past.  Made this easy, I promise, you will use it for your Facebook, Twitter, Amazon accounts, and on and on.  I even have an app for the Kindle so I can download books to my media card and read them on my lunchbreak.  Love it.  I recommend strongly getting a screen protector (which are easily affordable on amazon), and some kind of snap case and pouch to keep it protected and easily accessible.  Media cards are a must.  A 4GB Sandisk is included, but as you accumulate media, you are going to want a larger one, once again, easily affordable on this site.You can get the BB Torch directly from AT&T; for $49.99 brand new or free as a refurbished, which simply means the previous owner had it for 30 days or less and may not have liked it or found it difficult to operate and returned it.  I new casing is put on it and the innards are scoured for any issues and addressed and the phone is returned to factory specs so you don't end up with anyone's pornographic pics of their girlfriend (a very underrated courtesy in my experience).  Grab one and don't look back.  It's a superior phone and the price is right.
