{"Reviews": [{"Title": "In a League of Its Own...", "Author": "LCQ", "ReviewID": "R3U2SCRUCG8H7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't review much unless I get a product that really stands out. The 920 is that product.I own the Red 920 and actually owned a Windows Phone prior to the Lumia 920; it was the HTC Arrive on Sprint, which was WP7. Now even though that was a fairly decent phone, HTC makes cheap products so it ended up breaking in multiple areas because it was made out plastic and poorly shaped aluminum.However, the 920's unibody framework is sturdy. You can tell how well built it is when you hold it. There is not a single area that feels like it's going to break or bend or give any form of trouble. The edges are smooth and its curves make it a beautiful phone to look at.The Windows 8 Operating system is the best on the market. Anyone can say what they want but, when it gets down to it, this OS is fast, functional, efficient, and effective. Even though the App's market could use some growing, many of the apps that you would need or want on an iPhone and/or Android device, comes native to the Windows Phone Operating system. Thus, all other apps are pretty much geared to entertainment--which is, at least in my humble opinion, what a phone should do.Now to be fair, there are a few aspects that do need attention but they aren't deal breakers by far. For example, although the phone comes with Microsoft Office Suite, it only has Microsoft Word and Excel within the suite. OneNote, which is my most used and favorite app by far, is its own separate app instead of being included in the suite. Now this is a minor annoyance to me because in WP7 everything was in ONE suite/hub. Either way, its more of me being picky than anything else.The battery life is Insanely good. I can go up to 17 hours straight without needing to charge and that's with fairly heavy usage. If anyone has owned a smartphone before, you know that that's an admirable feat. My last phone barely did 10 to 12 hours. My Palm Pre+ barely got 7 hours. My wife's HTC Thunderbolt is constantly dying multiple times a day. The only other phone that'll match it is the iPhone in regards to battery life that is.Now, if you are planning on getting Windows 8 for your computer or are going to purchase a computer with windows 8 on it, then this is most definitely the phone to have (or any windows phone for that matter). It syncs up like nothing I've ever seen before. Between Windows 8 and skydrive, moving files around couldn't be any easier. I was lucky enough to get the 25gb skydrive that MS was handing out with WP7 so it's even better for me. Nonetheless, anything over 5gbs is good enough for documents and pictures. I say this because I literally have hundreds of pictures and documents (including work documents) and I'm not even close to hitting 5gb in storage. So believe me when I say its plenty enough storage.The best feature of the phone is definitely the Camera. Nokia went out of their way to create a beast of a camera. It literally takes the best pictures I've ever seen any phone take. Nearly every picture looks professional even when you're hardly trying. The low light pictures are bar none the best on the market as well. Couple that with the exclusive Nokia apps in the App Store and you'll feel like a photographer no matter how little skill you actually have. Add the fact that it's a floating lens which reduces shaking and blurring, and you can take incredible pictures that rival stand alone cameras. The ONLY con I've seen in regards to the camera is that while taking Low-Light pics, you have to be really, really still. It's the only time that movement will ruin the picture. This is because the Lens \"aperture\" has to stay open longer when in dark environments; thus, any movement will cause a blurring/streaking effect. Other than that, you'll notice more pros than cons.Rather than babbling on I'll say this...Go to any store that has the 920, play with it for a bit. It'll seem a bit alien at first but as you use it, the more it'll grow on you. After giving it a whirl, use any other phone i.e. Android and/or iPhone and you'll see the difference. If you want to have a phone that gets you what you want and how you want it as fast as possible then Windows phone is the one to have and the Lumia 920 is definitely a great choice. If the 920 isn't your gig and you'd want something more mid-range, then the 820 series are pretty awesome as well. Windows has really put thought and effort into this platform and they're leaving their competitors in the dust. Nokia is the premier manufacturer as well so the two together is like a peanut butter and jelly haha. Seriously, try one, hold it, use it...but make sure you use it as you would in real life and you'll see the difference.if you read all of this, then thanks! I hope it helped and I hope you enjoy whichever phone you choose!", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Smooth UI, powerful and fun phone", "Author": "Eric K.

The Live Tiles are functional and provide tons of \"at a glance information\" (ESPN scores, new message notifications, etc). In addition the low light performance of the camera is the best of any cell phone I've used. The Nokia apps are actually fun/useful, so far I've played with Nokia Maps with turn by turn voice navigation and a fun app called Cinemagraph that allows you to create slick animated gifs right on the phone.In the apps store, I've found many of the apps I've used on my prior android phone: Endmondo, mmyfitnessplan, Yelp, Amazon,Kindle, BigOven, BankOfAmerica,KeyRing,Flashlight,Linkedin, oneNote, and Tweetcaster to name a few..Plus I have Office Apps and native integration with Office365/SharePoint sites..Every day I discover something new about this phone. For example, there is a native capability to take screenshots on the phone, before I needed an app for that. Overall I am pleased.The main downside of the phone (to me), is that I miss my SWYPE keyboard I had on my Samsung Infuse.

The picture camera is alright, but I still haven't really given it a good run around. The improvements made are beautiful and functional. This really does feel like the future.To put it succinctly: my cousin who is an Apple aficionado saw the phone and what it could do and just said, \"Wow...Apple feels like they're behind.\"", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Lumia Experience is Like no Other.", "Author": "Scrambles", "ReviewID": "R2ZXZL1VVD2TOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first start by saying, I've used all the different major phone OS' (Android, IOS)for extended periods of time as a heavy user and now Windows 8 Phone.This phone is AMAZING, 5/5! but it may not be for everyone. But it's pretty dang close to it.Each person has their own preference on the OS/Brand(s). Android with overlays such as TouchWiz, Sense, Mytouch, and the Pure Un-adultered Nexus/Google experience. Than there's Apple's IOS with it's \"mac-like\" experience. Lastly there's Windows Phone, Microsoft's long push into the Smartphone market that functions similarly to Windows 8 on desktop.Windows Phone 8 OS:Strength #1: Seamless Syncing with Skydrive for ANY content between your W8 Devices.Strength #2: Smooth, Smooth Smooth! I've never used an OS so quick, fluid, and seamless. 920's screen also is the first phone with 60FPS(frames per second, how fast the screen refreshes when scrolling or moving between different apps) for the screen. No Screen blurring or smudging..EVER.Strength #3: Business. Office, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, etc.Strength #4: All apps are streamlined with the OS. You won't see an app that doesn't Feel like WP. (My major critisism of android; it's Too diverse in it's apps, in quality, design, and functionality. I'm personally sick of my apps on android not working how they should, and having to sort through tons of others that MIGHT work accordingly.)Strength #5: Windows has great support for updates and fixes. I've yet to see ANYONE complain about their windows phone becoming slower or having issues because of this, yet I hear it day in and day out with android. Android reqs far too much memory to run all their background apps and the excessive new features they add with every update and make you feel like you require a quad-core phone. Ridiculous. My Android phones ALWAYS get worse with an update. (Reminds me of OLD windows; works fine? Don't fix it. Main reason why this is a problem for android: Samsung, htc, motorola; all of them like to throw their own OS Theme ontop of android bogging it down and making it harder to near impossible for them to keep up with the updates coming out; aka: the interface and the design suffers and so does the end user; if you want android please buy a nexus; don't deal with the BS of the manufacturer's.)There are more strengths but I think I covered the major ones. Now here's the one two weakness' of Windows phone that may or may not set you on your way.Weakness #1: APPs. Just like advertised there are not as many apps as more hardened OS out there.*However all the major essentials are there; news apps, maps, gps, trailers, office, Internet Explorer 10 which can run the Desktop Versions VERY Seamlessly. (Auto screen calibration for size, WP type interface, etc.) THE main reason for this is because it hasn't garnered as much attention as the other OS till now. Some Business' are flat out ignoring the users to build an actual app for it. W8 is a huge push for microsoft since with the actual new W8 OS for desktop and with everything coming into fruition with cloud services everything will be synced together and it'll be a true ecosystem. Microsoft has the biggest lead with this over any other Company. Mainly because of Xbox. Xbox is Microsoft's key to success for a \"W8/Xbox Home.\" with W8 Desktop, W8 Phone, W8 Surface/Tablets, and W8 XBOX. [WORK(office), COMMUTE(skydrive), PEOPLE(skype,facebook,email, etc. All goes into my Text messaging folder and I can reply to all of them in one interface easily. I'm in love with that. It's a big deal., ENTERTAINMENT (xboxlive, youtube, xboxmusic/xboxmovies,netflix etc. it's all there.] Microsoft Has You Covered. I didn't have high hopes for Windows 7 or anything before w8, but I've always seen the potential and they're in a major shift in how they do their business and I'm sure if they proceed the same way as they're doing , w8 and all their devices will be a major success. It just takes some adoption. Cause face it; if you want a true Seamless ecosystem. Microsoft is the only company who can truely deliver that to you in the next couple years. *Weakness #2: It's not nearly as customizable as android. No live wallpapers, (Live tiles instead with actual information however which is very practical rather than just static icons which was actually one major reason why I made the \"Switch\".) You can change the colors to suit your mood or style/preference/whatever, that's all I really care about. And if someone picks up your WP and sees the screen they can tell in a sense who you are. You have Office, Facebook, and ... whatever else on your main live tiles. Ok so you can than assume that person is yadaydyada. Same as you would an android in a sense if you see their live wallpapers and widgets and main apps. Like any other phone it's in a sense an extension of yourself and this and can be felt with windows phone as well as any of the other OS out there. (w7 didn't garner my interest until than, having 4 smaller apps is the same as android or ios , 4 apps per row, perfect for an actual phone for thumb reach, etc. Bigger ones for widgets, or whatever else, it works, just as how i'd want a phone to work. *5/5*.Now with the main specs:CAM: 8.7MEGAPIXELS WITH OIS - FLOATING LENS IMAGE STABILIZATION (There's no camera better, even the upcoming sony model with 13mp couldn't beat this beaut) This is the main differentiator for the 920.Processor: 1.5GHZ Dualcore - Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8960. [For android users: If you need more than a dual core to run a phone smoothly/efficiently for multi-tasking, I'm sorry your battery life will suffer as WP has no hickups as many of my previous android \"High-ends\", and I've yet to have any of my apps freeze or crash on me] It just works.Ram: 1GB [1gb is more than anyone would ever need for a phone; I so far have run 6 apps running simultaneously with that with no lag or issues and little battery drain when doing so]\"HardDrive\": The Lumia 920 sports a 32gb of onboard memory space for music, songs, apps, etc. About 2gb will be used up from the OS itself it seems. 32gb is A lot. 99% of users will never need more than that.Bluetooth: 3.0 (Although I heard a firmware update could update it to 4.0, but not too sure on that)NFC: Yes. (Near Field Communication) All of the newer high end models should and will be taking advantage of this relatively new technology. (Japan's been using it for years for Everything. Card payments, forms of ID, checking into locations, sharing content easily, etc. etc. etc. U.S. is just an emerging market so give it a couple years to take off)Wireless Charging: YES! This is a feature you may not see as majorly important but once you get used to it the convenience is amazing. I've adapted one of nokias plates to a car mount, and I use bluetooth to stream music while using the Nokia Drive GPS. The Wireless plates or QI Certified so any other wirelessly certified charging device from now into the future should be compatible with it. The pads/stands needed etc. won't just go to waste once you upgrade your phone in 2 years. Sweet! *Oh only downside with wireless charging is it that it doesn't allow for Hard-Wiring into a computer or other device. So you'll still want to use a micro-usb for transfering a lot of content to and from your phone if you choose not to use sky-drive. [Future versions of plates Should be able to get this built in; however many apps for streaming content are and will be more widely available to different devices making hard-wiring a near-dead feature besides having One for your main Desktop or PC.*DLNA: Yes. (Like stated above, this is for streaming content directly to other devices like photos, videos to a smart tv compatible with dlna or a computer)Music: Equalized by nokia built in, and it's ITUNES compatible. You download a WP program when hooking up your phone to your CPU, it downloads it for free where it'll pull all or any of the selected itunes media into the WP program. It's extremely easy, quick, and painless!Screen: 4.5' inchesResolution: 768 x 1280 - 332 ppi (yours eyes can't perceive past 300, so it's a \"Retina\")Type: IPS LCD - PUREBLACK technology. The blacks are true blacks, not grayed out like similiar LCD screens like HTC. I could be deceived into thinking its one of samsungs Super Amoled Screens but that it doesn't distort the colors. (blue-tones added ontop of all images for Samoled but not lcd)Outside: ok YUP, best phone I've ever used outside. Can see it easily even on the lowest settings, no glares or issues. Awesome!Dmg: Scratch Resistant, gorilla glass 2. However it can still be scratched! It's still glass. Get a screen protector or a Lipped-Case (makes it so the screen doesn't lay flat on surfaces). I received a tiny tiny scratch that I have no idea how it got there 3 days after use but if angled right you could see it but not at all during use. But I'm a perfectionist so this kind've surprised me. But I just put a Armor Shield screen on it cause the InvisiShield brand feels too \"Clingy\" to your fingers unlike armor which feels like almost like the screen itself and with it on the scratch isn't noticeable whatsoever, armor shield appears to have the same durability and resilience if not better than the invisi-Shield brand.BATTERY!: Standby time is ... like any other phone i've used; and microsoft is apparently getting started on working on making a Sleep Mode for their W8phones. When screen is off ONLY the major apps like text, calls, will go through and whatever else youd want to customize. As of right now it still will give you email updates, calls, texts, news updates if youd like etc.  2 days of Standby Time with some calls and texts here or there.Battery Heavy User: I work with phones and I'm constantly showing them off various OS and phones to consumers including my own 920 for WP8. Apps, movies, games, etc. I get about 10-12 hours of heavy useage. My htc rezound with an extended battery would give me 2-4HR with a new battery and if lucky.And... For people concerned about the Confined Chassis. It's not Impossible to remote to exchange a battery down the road. There's 2 screws you take out so you can peel off the back and than you have to just remove a few of the connectors that pop right off with the right tools. (Find youtube videos on it; a basic battery replacement should be fairly easy)Anyways.... I hope you enjoy your Lumia 920. or any other WP that you decide to get. (Their speeds and performance will be nearly identical; the only differences will be Camera, Screen size and resolutions, battery mah, weight, colors, etc.) Oh.... I can actually teach my technology Illiterate family how to operate a WP easily without having to show them, they love it as well. And we all stay in even better contact than before due to all the integrations between skype,facebook, messaging, etc. into one messaging inbox. ^_^", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Traded in my iPhone 4 for the Lumia 920", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R3VB45XHRKC2LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my red Lumia 920 after it being backordered for a few days. I upgraded from my iPhone 4 which I had for around 2 years and could barely hold a charge.  I'm very impressed by the phone so far.  I was initially concerned that there weren't going to be enough apps in the Windows Phone ecosystem but I found that all the major apps that can be found on iOS are on this platform.  When I told my fianc\u00e9 that I was swapping out my iPhone for a Lumia 920, she thought I was nuts.  She actually tried to stop me because we use iMessage all the time and was afraid that we would have to use text messages after switching to the Lumia.  Well, I can't use iMessage on my Lumia but instead there's a great cross platform texting program called \"Whatsapp\" that's far superior to iMessage.  Although my fianc\u00e9 was skeptical that \"whatsapp\" was going to be any good, she now loves it and says it's better than any other messaging service she's ever used.  I also showed my fianc\u00e9 how I personalized my phone and is very interested in buying a Windows Phone now.  Perhaps a HTC Windows Phone 8x instead as she finds the Lumia 920 a little too big for her hands.  Funny thing is that she's told me that I have to always have a tile of her that's the biggest size possible.  I told her if she makes me mad I'll reduce her tile size to the smallest one.  hahaThe best part of owning this phone is how random strangers keep on approaching me and commenting on my stylish new phone.  They ask me how I like it and always let me know it looks awesome.  I love the fact that Windows Phones look nothing like other smart phones on the market and I can customize it with cool tiles like my fianc\u00e9's contact tile.If you're coming to the Lumia 920 from the iPhone, there are some things that run a little different that you will need to get used to.  These are small things like using the back button but you'll get used to it instantly.In Windows Phone, you can have unified email inboxes but it wasn't easily apparent that you could do this.Also, if you link your phone to Facebook, make sure you filter out your facebook contacts or less you'll have hundreds of facebook friends on your phone contact list who you will probably never call.  Just filter them out and you should be good to go.Bottom line:  I love my Lumia 920 and I have no regrets leaving my iPhone.  If you were hesitating like me about ditching iOS, let me reassure you, there's nothing to worry about - your experience with this phone will be superb. You'll love the great new features and apps on the phone (especially Nokia Maps and Drive).  I highly recommend this phone for anyone who is looking for change in their smartphone.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Phone", "Author": "gibby", "ReviewID": "R217MMUKWXG3IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got  the red phone and man this has to be the best phone I have owned.I had the 900 but this is extremely fast and fluid.the only downside I would have would be weight but I really don't notice that muchits awesome.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Nokia Lumia 920", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "RZ7JSC0OD9AXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Black Nokia Lumia 900 to the Red Lumia 920.  I knew that the limitations of the camera, resolution display, HD video on my Lumia 900 were due to WP7.5.  Those limitations are gone with WP8 and Nokia beautifully takes advantage of the new OS.  The pictures and video are cystal clear, with natural colors and lighting. The larger 4.5 screen makes it easier for reading and surfing the internet. The screen is so clear with sharp display of words and pictures, the smooth gorilla glass top is virtually smudge resistant.  This is a feature I truly appreciate compare to other phones I have used including the Lumia 900. The solid build quality of the Lumia 920 makes it unbreakable when falling from your hand on to a cement sidewalk, some of you may have seen the you tube video of the Nokia Lumia used to hammer a nail into a piece of wood, this is truly a durable phone. Critics will say the Lumia 920 is heavy, but fail to elaborate as to why Lumia 920 is heavy and the benefits.  Well, it is heavier than other phones and here are the benefits, includes a larger battery that last 3 hours longer than other phones, solidly built so that you do not need to buy an armored cover to protect fragile phones, no need to carry an extra battery or charger.  Other phones come in only Black or Grey, because they are covered by their owners to protect their fragile phones, this renders the benefits of lightness and thinness of other phones over Lumia 920 to meaningless.  The beautifully designed red Lumia does not need to be covered and I am so grateful, because I get a lot of remarks on the color and questions as to who makes my phone.  The Lumia 920 will certainly attract attention.  There are so many wonderful feature on the Nokia Lumia 920 with WP8 that I could write a small book.  I recommend you get your hands on a Nokia Lumia 920 to see for yourself what a great phone this is.  You can then come to Amazon.com and order it.  I use my phone constantly to check my many email accounts, real time Stock/Option quotes, surfing web, sports updates, social media, playing chess, texting, Excel and Word, weather reports, transit directions, turn by turn voice navigation, my camera and video recorder, exercise app, etc, yes I also make phone calls.  My wife had an Iphone and wanted to buy a Nikon camera, I show her that by getting a Nokia Lumia 920 she did not need to buy a camera.  After showing her the pictures and videos on my Lumia 920 she agreed to get a cyan Lumia 920.

Man its out of this world. I had a Samsung Android before this and an Iphone 3GS before that. I actually wanted to buy a Samsung Note 2 but...I have to say that my previous phones were not bad and I didn't have any major problems with them but they are dwarfed in comparison to this beast. The feel of this phone is different-it feels like a luxury item. Its heavier than Iphone and other android phones but I believe the weight is optimal for a phone of this class- if it were any lighter, it would not feel as good. The colors, edges, the back curve and contour of the screen are all amazing. The buttons on side could not be built any better. The tiny holes for the speakers are nicely done. In short, I am a big fan of the design and look it has. If I ever get time, I want to write a long article describing the amazing design..It works really well. The core OS and UI is cool. I themed the phone with dark back ground and red colors for the screen and it looks cool. It was like matching the interior of a car to its outside color. The tiles are good. I am not a big fan of live tiles but some people may like it. The screen responsiveness and resolution is awesome. It works with gloves! UI is very simple and easy to learn-took me few minutes to get used to it. The camera is really good. The wireless charging works seamlessly. (Didn't try NFC with speaker as dont have one).I did have low battery economy initially but after decreasing the screen brightness, turning off location service and turning off back-ground apps, It lasts whole day (my day is 14 hours) without a recharge.ATT does not give you the headphones with this buy but i learned that the international version had headphones in the box..The ecosystem (apps) is not as bad as I initially thought. I was able to find all the apps that I wanted (depending upon my android use) except one medical app which doctors use a lot (but was able to find a replacement). [...] was helpful to find the apps that I had difficulty searching in the market store. Having said that, I believe that the app store does need and will get a good boost in coming months.Nokia has done great work with some of its core apps. I greatly liked the Nokia music (can be used off-line and is ad free), Drive for navigation (again, can be used off-line), photoBeamer (its cool and seems to be a start of a new way of sharing data, please try it), Data-transfer, CityLens.To Summarize:Pros: Design/built/Colors, screen responsiveness/resolution , camera, Nokia city-lens, nokia drive, nokia music, wireless charging, smooth UICons: No headphones if you get this from ATT, Not as many apps (in comparison to other IOS and android markets)I think this phone is a new milestone in the evolution of smart-phones.

The wireless charging is amazing and works just like my electric toothbrush, just sit it on a pad (of course mine is the only one still backordered).  The blue phone arrived last, red was second to arrive while white came in pretty quick but that's what my wife wanted after seeing the iPhone in white.  I don't know why these are unavailable on Amazon although I have heard many stores are also sold out in one color or another.  As for AT&T;, I was willing to leave and go try Verizon but couldn't pass up on the deal due to my company's discounts on service PLUS I wanted this phone.  My nephew also recently gave up his Iphone after many years to go buy a Lumia 920.  He was able to move his music collection (from ITunes) with the app for his Mac.  He considered Galaxy or Nexus as well and absolutely loves this phone.How heavy?  At first I thought it was heavy when I was trying it out in the store but now I am used to it.  No one in the family complaining but know that it's heavier than most smartphones.  If you have trouble carrying another 30 grams or so, perhaps look into doing some pushups :).How sturdy?  I also bought a case for my wife but she doesn't use it, the phone seems sturdy enough.What about the OS?  As for the Windows Phone OS, I haven't noticed any showstoppers.  The interface is refreshing, fast and fluid.  You have to keep the phone to realize how much easier it is to integrate with Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. I haven't explored a new feature called rooms or groups but it seems interesting for a family to stay in sync with shared contacts, calendar, notes etc. almost like an electronic bulletin board.  My wife is not technical so will have to see how useful this feature is or if she uses it.  Will update the review on this one.  As for apps, they keep coming every day and I don't feel like it's limited or what the brouhaha is.  The only one I hear about is instagram but I hear its coming.Critical feature that sold me on this versus alternatives?  Nokia Maps.  I also considered HTC 8x but felt Nokia had more apps I wanted and I expect better support.  One of the best phones I have ever owned was a Nokia and this seems solid.  I would consider the 8x if the weight really bothers you but again, we are all used to it already.Quick review of AT&T; stores if I may:  AT&T; help and knowledge of these products at the store is a hit or miss.  When asked what is the difference between 920 and 820, I got, one's bigger than the other.  Daaah!!!  How about wireless charging built in, the awesome camera (btw pics and video on this are great and much better than my old phone and rival my canon Point and shoot), xbox integration (some of it is gimmicky but man I use it as a remote more than I thought), Nokia music.What I would have liked to see more of:  FM radio but I can live without it.  Nothing else comes to mind for now.  If you go with an open mind with no preconceived notions (hard to do if you are a fanboy or fangirl), you'll be pleasantly surprised.To add, 12/1/2012: I wondered if the phone locks do you just wait it for it to die or is there a reset?I found out at the AT&T; store (sorry if I said bad things about you before) you can press volume and power and hold for 5-10 seconds and the device resets (like ctl alt del).I now need to find a clip so I can attach it to my dash somehow for music and gps.

I like all the features I have tried so far, with the included Microsoft Phone 8 feature set, as well as some of the Nokia value added features such as Nokia Drive Turn by Turn navigation (Included for free!!), and the other features mentioned in the other reviews, etc. I really like the fact that you can pick what states GPS data you want to keep on the phone, so easy if you are navigating in a place that has no data signal, you can keep getting accurate directions, and its easy to add or delete other geographic areas when needed, or you can just add a whole country.  In previous phones I had to pay extra for voice turn by turn, but its included with the Nokia 920.For me the large screen, and size are perfect, and the \"weight\" mentioned by some reviews is no issue for me, but suggest that anybody contemplating purchase should try it.  The touch screen seems fast and responsive too.I was able to reinstall all of my Windows 7x applications with no issue and just by using my same Windows live ID, all of my setting seem to migrate with no issues encountered.The only real negative that I can think of, is that my Microsoft Zune PC software (and my collection of MP3s purchased over the years) is not as easily managed from my PC to this phone, because my desktop PC Zune software does not sync directly with the phone nor my playlists from within Zune desktop software (or I have not yet figured it out), but rather I have to use a different Microsoft Application within my main PC to Copy the music folders\\mp3s to the phone.  I actually transferred the files over to the Nokia 920 very quickly, but it is not yet a smooth way to manage multiple music tastes within a family as was the direct syncing that Zune provided..........I am sure Microsoft will improve this, but it is the only negative I have seen so far....", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most Innovative phone yet", "Author": "Sen", "ReviewID": "R3L7QV0TRG0UUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an iPhone user for the longest time and even after the release of multiple Samsung product releases, I was unimpressed.

Some folks say it is too heavy, but I think it is just right.2) The Windows Phone 8 OS is fantastic. It allows for the most personalized home screen experience, much more than the IPhone or Android, which both seem cold in comparison.3) Kids corner is great for folks with kids. It allows you to have a 'kids' section that allows them to play games, listen to music, whatever you decide to allow. As a parent of yound kids, this will be fantastic for long car rides. They can't get into any of your mail clients or send texts.4) The camera is the best out there for smartphones, with an 8.7 megapixel Carl Zeis lens, with Pure View technology. Couple that with Optical Image Stabilisation and a 4.5 inch gorilla glass screen, the pictures and video are amazingly clear, especially in low light conditions. My kids play sports and it takes amazing action shots.5) Dolby sound lets me listen to music in style.6) Windows Phone 8 has plenty of apps, inclusing 46 of the top 50 best selling apps today on Android and IOS.7) Too many others to mention:)I just love this phone!

The feel in your hand, the smooth interaction with the OS, all of these things make this phone and this platform the best on the market right now.The apps are coming. I've been developing apps for the iOS platform for years now. And I think developers see a gold rush and an untapped market with Windows Mobile now that they have some legitimate hardware in play.

Rambow \"blue sky leader\"", "ReviewID": "RTTDQUXR5M1WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "-- I have owned this phone for 1 month, and it has met all my expectations and more.  We actually purchased two at the same time, and have been very pleased with both.  Back in the 90's we had Nokia phones, but the last two sets were Motorolla, now it was time to give Nokia another chance, especially with Windows 8.-- So far, we have only had one glitch, and not the phone's fault.  We let the phone go too low on the battery, and my wife started hitting the various buttons to get it to come back on, not realizing there was no battery power.  I called ATT for assistance, and the tech was very helpful, but following the instructions, could not reset the phone.  We were instructed to take it to the ATT store.  We did, the store tech, said, oops, the phone support person gave you the instructions for a different phone, after a quick re-charge, he hit the three side buttons at once for 5 seconds, and the phone was back to life.  All was good.-- I did learn, that some settings need to be set from ATT, where they make connection directly to the phone and make changes.  I personally don't like that process, but that is the world we live in, not the fault of the phone.-- One app that already paid off, was the 'find your phone'.  My wife went to an appointment using her phone as a navigator on the way home.  All fine and good, but hours later, she could not find her phone.  My usual procedure was to call her phone, and listen for the ring.  But this time, no ringing was heard.  So we called up the app on my computer, and it showed the location in our driveway. Sure enough, opened the car door and heard ringing, finally located the phone under the car seat.-- We have found the Nokia apps to be excellent, mapping and navigation is especially good.  Phone calls have been crisp and clear.  I tend to use mine for long business calls, hours sometimes, on speaker phone, and no problems.-- And speaking of those long calls, having the wireless re-charging pad has been great, just set the phone on the pad when power gets low, and I just continue my call.-- I have had many tell me, \"don't get a windows phone\", but then when questioned, they admit to never have seen one.  And when they see the Nokia, I hear a lot, of \"it is so fast\", \"image is great\", etc.  Turns out, it is very easy to customize the windows tiles, and get the apps and functions right up front that you use most of the time.-- And the camera, at 8mp, is better than the actual digital camera I have carried for years.  The image is great, even in low light.  I have tried several apps, one taking 5 shots in quick succession is great to get one good portrait. And the panorama app, really easy to use.  Still more to try out.-- The usual apps to find restaurants, mapping, internet, email, are all excellent.  Much more to try.  We travel all the time, and being able to hit the find icon, type in the name of the place we are looking for, and getting directions practically instantly, is great.  And the turn-by-turn voice instructions are easy to understand, and timely, as you hear the name of the street, just before you get there, not as you are supposed to be turning, like I have seen on other devices.-- I know the number of apps available for Win8 are far behind the others, but more are being released every day, and so far, I have found plenty to try out.  My wife found Angry Birds right away, did the 99 cent download, and was happy to have something to do when waiting for me.-- And yes, you do have office apps available, I haven't done much with them yet, but they are there.  Plus the usb hook-up to computers is easy and fast.  There are dozens of help emails and such from Microsoft and ATT to help you get the most out of your phone, I haven't read too many yet, but do read the start-up guide, and you will be able to figure out most on your own.-- In my opinion, Nokia is back, with a great phone.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is an awesome beast of a phone", "Author": "dwayne haynes", "ReviewID": "R3BZDMK2X13CFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:  This phone is just awesome.

Until recently, it was my only experience with a smartphone. I wanted something more reliable, less app force-closes, better build quality. I was fine with the smaller app market. All I do with my phone is browse the web ,(mostly p**n), listen to music, driving navigation, and read books. You don't need millions of apps to accomplish that.When the Lumia 920 came out, I knew it would be my next phone.It had everything I wanted, there was great videos on youtube of people TORTURING this thing and it coming out relatively unscathed. Great!When my existing contract went out, I grabbed one. The Lumia 920 lived up to all my expecations. I loved the feel of it in my hand. I loved the gorgeous screen and silky animations, the rock solid stability of apps and the long battery life while not sacrificing 4g.Today I dropped my phone from 2 feet off a desk. It slipped from my hand. The smooth texture of the yellow phone probably didn't help in this matter. I'm aware that black and cyan are a textured finish, but I wanted yellow, dangit.The screen was absolutely DESTROYED. This phone is less than a month old.I am also disappointed in other aspects of of the build quality in this phone.I'm in the military, and not always in the cleanest environments. I keep the phone carefully in my pocket with no other objects and never lay it on its screen. Nevertheless, it had picked up several scratches on the screen visible by angling it in good light. Of course I can't see them anymore, since there are so many cracks and fissures on the screen. I am not always in a spotless environment, and by resting the phone on desks or tables with small amounts of dirt, the plastic casing has manged to pick up pock mark holes all over. I have two larger areas with deeper scratches, from what, I don't know.The Lumia 920 was an absolute joy for me to use. I am now deeply disappointed in the build quality and will not be replacing it with another. In a bitter kind of way, I half believe that Nokia initially released a higher quality Lumia 920, and it was eventually ramped down to the fragile blossom of a phone that I am now stuck with.tl;drIf there are any people out there considering this phone, please just take this away from my misfortune. The build quality is NOT BETTER than any other average smartphone out there. Don't consider this as a point in the Lumia 920s favor when shopping for your next phone that you want to keep for 2 years.

After upgrading to windows 8 on the PC this phone is a perfect transition between the two.-Size and feel: After having this for a few days and then picking up my old iPhone, it feels puny compared to the 920. The screen size is noticeably bigger and seems sturdier even though it's the same Gorilla Glass. Overall it's about as big as I'd like a phone to be, any larger and it would be in the realm of the Samsung Note.-Camera: What's there to not say about the camera, it's fantastic. It's amazing to me that the camera in the phone is almost as good as my SLR, and a heck of a lot easier to carry around! Low light shooting is awesome and with the different Nokia apps there's a ton of editing and shooting styles you can do. There are great apps, like panorama and photosynth that allows you to take 360 degree photos. Facial recognition and focus all work quite well. The ability to send to your Skydrive or multiple other social networks is super easy to do.-Apps: Imagine a tiny desktop in your hand, this phone runs apps just like a full fledged computer.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet Phone", "Author": "James Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3EWNI73VWFU5U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone came in great condition, exactly as described, and shipped fast.

The phone is solid and while it's heavier than other similar smartphones - they weight has not been an issue and I don't notice it in day to day use.Most of the issue with the phone seems to be around the Windows Phone 8 operating system. Bluetooth is somewhat problematic in that if you're paired listening to music or podcasts and receive an incoming SMS the phone announces it and then often drops the connection. When you try to restart the song the connection is completely silent unless you switch to another song then back.I find the call quality to be good. Some have noted that the ear volume is not very high. I've not been in a noisy environment where I can test it fully but so far no problems.Camera seems very good. I would not buy this phone solely for the camera though as it's not significantly better than most other top smartphones like iPhone 5 or Samsung.Battery life seems a little short and I've read quite a few reports that are all over the place ranging from \"I only get a few hours of battery \" to \"I have 20% battery left at midnight when I go to bed\". I'm not sure what to make of this but perhaps some is due to whether people are connecting email that is constantly polling versus setting accounts to retrieve mail hourly or every two hours. Other battery issues could be due to apps that are running amok.Overall I'm pleased with this phone.

A friend in Sacramento bought his Lumia 920 the same week I did, and I live in Seattle.  Both of us have noticed the sound quality of the calls is extremely poor, and our calls are being constantly dropped.  This was not a problem at all with our previous phones, an iphone and Samsung focus, respectively. I have heard people complain about the lack of apps, but as my husband says, \"how many versions of angry birds do you need?\"If you liked your windows 7 phone, as I did, you will like the windows 8 phone.  It is the same OS, but with improvements.  But, I'd like to have more control over organizing my information, like creating albums from my pictures on my phone, for example.If your primary use of your smart phone is to text, e-mail, search, keep track of your calendar and play games, you will probably like this phone.  If you actually use it to make calls, you might find it aggravating. I did use the Skype app, and the sound quality from the video call was considerably better, with very little delay, and the video from it was clear.  That being the case, I don't know why the Lumia 920's call quality was so poor.  It could be Lumia or it could be the OS.  I'm almost hoping it's the OS, because then at least there might be a patch at some point.Whether I'd recommend the Lumia 920 depends entirely on how a person intends to use it.  Phone calls, no.

I wanted to have a mini keyboard to use this to type some notes, as it has Office and OneNote.  Both Nokia and AT&T; hide this little known fact that all keyboards are not supported with Bluetooth, as Microsoft deemed it not important I suppose.  I talked with folks at Microsoft Store, and they told me that users are just suppose to browse or touch up documents, not really create new content on the phone.There are numerous other problems (I'm sure cited by other users), and the many applications one would expect to be commonplace, either don't exist or have really flawed implementations, such as having a lot of UX design flaws and huge missing functionality.  The list is so huge, I could write a book.  One that stood out is using e-mail:  You have to configure a new  application per email (yahoo, gmail, etc.) and so it isn't integrated into one app.  Additionally, you can ONLY have one application per type of account, so if you had two Yahoo accounts (one for spam, one for friends, etc.) then you can only choose one of them.  Thus the Yahoo email app only works with one Yahoo account.So while other systems allow you to browse all your e-mail through a single application, Microsoft forces you to use a single application per e-mail account, and only one of the same account.  Essentially, Microsoft violates the path of least surprise (using what we know to work well), has poor implementation with major gaps that lack functionality, and poor user interface and experience to boot across the board, especially in e-mail.Combine this the fact that you cannot use bluetooth keyboards (or other HID devices like joysticks) despite advertising bluetooth is support (and how they all sort of hide the fact from users), this leaves a very distasteful experience...", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Nokia Lumia 920, Red 32GB (AT&T;)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00A2V7LHC"}}
