Reliable seller and much sooner than scheduled delivery.", "Author": "LS", "ReviewID": "R3R81YTY58YVNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this smartphone to replace my other 4\" smartphone OPPOX903, which is better than iPhones that my wife, son, and daughter all use. I use it also to replace my ASUS laptop and cell phone. This N7300 is big enough for my older than 70 years eyes.  My vision is not as good as before, especially I had many eye surgeries. I also have an iPAD but it is awkward to carry around when you are out for a trip. 5.7\" is very nice to watch TV as well as other online stuff.The dual SIM card slot is very convenient for me to use it also in another country. And of course it is unlocked. Sorry, all those companies that sell you a smartphone packaged and charge you an arm and a leg, and pretending of generous deal. 5.7\" screen is very nice, I wish to have a 6\" one, but it cost twice as much.I had it for a week now. So far so good. I have recommended it to my friends.The camera is not so good. It is way out of focus. But I use a Nikon D800E camera. Nothing beats it for quality and capability. I bought the camera and this \"inercom(TM) Unlocked N7300 - 5.7 Inch huge HD Screen (1280*720 pixels)\" both from Amazon.com as I always do.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Jose Pereda Diaz", "ReviewID": "RIYOFN2X0VFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ulefone n9002 is excelent is 100% equal to samsung note 3, i purchase original acesories from samsung and fit on the ulefone its great.The cons was the batery is 2600 mah, so i upgrade to 4200 mah bat, whit this batery i use all day whout recharge the phone.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cool Product", "Author": "Loyd R. Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R1WNX84YNKX38U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone / tablet is more than expected.  I was a little skeptical about purchasing a phone from anyone other than a dealer or electronics store.  The phone is very user friendly - not that complicated to set up and had it going in about 30 minutes with all my contacts and stored media from my old iPhone.  Takes a little getting use to.  Like a lot of the features - miss a few from the iPhone but overall very happy.  The screen makes it easy to read email or search the web.  Seller was able to get it to my door in about 15 days - even with Christmas shipment.  Batter last pretty well - depends on how much data you try to push or download.  have had absolutely no problems with the product.

Camera glitch- This is not a permanent glitch it comes on and off but  is really annoying if you have to take a picture at a certain time- You open the camera app and there are horizontal bars blocking the picture showing through the camera when you take the picture the picture comes out with those same bars.- Usually a restart of the phone would solve the problem......2. Mic Stops Working- after a week the mic suddenly stops working..- No damage to the phone, not even a drop or a tumble, mic stops working...- Really bad thing if your planning to use this device as a phone- Although their is another way... if you are a frequent music listener... your headphones would do the trick... if your headphones have a mic.- i have tried everything, repair, old methods.. nothing would work..- ill update if i fix the problem...3. Fake S-Pen-Now this was kind of a disappointment all the S-Pen is is a plastic stylus and a magnet on the inside to trigger air command.- the fake button on the pen does not work ( it is a design)- Real S-Pen doesn't work either on it....- Scratches Screen protector pretty badly After a weeks use..... since its a hard plastic stick.....  ( in my case i used it only twice in the week)In conclusion.... i suggest you save the money up for an actual Note 3 instead of Buying this.... (which i am planning to do, refurbished, last price i saw $220)But if you want to stay on the cheap side like i wanted to... go ahead.....i suffered the consequences..", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "N9002", "Author": "A Welschmeyer", "ReviewID": "R2AN3WZM2QRVNZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just recieved my phone today Came with phone a back and a s view case earphones screen protector already on it one battery and i believe that is it.
