Before getting the LG CU400, I had a Sony/Ericsson 500A.  I loved that phone but S/E's Customer Service stunk!  (Because of a SyncManager database error, they said I had to reinsall the O/S to fix the problem!  Yea, right!!!)  The LG CU400 has a progressive ringtone.  Right now, you can't change that.  From what I understand per LG, Cingular made this an LG-requirement of their phones.  It's annoying when I hear someone else's phone do that, especially when no one answers the phone!  It doesn't have a quick-lock feature (that I can find.)  The Contacts are laid out in a wierd way (to me.)  Name1/H, Name1/W, Name1/M, and so on.  (H=Home, W=Work, M=Mobile, and so on.)  I don't know if that's because the data was on the SIM and isn't 'loaded' into the phone, itself, yet, or what.  I do like the location of the speaker button - a one-touch feature.  When the phone is closed, pressing any button on the side will display the date/time.  It's not in color - No biggie.  It's a PTT (Push-To-Talk) phone.  (I didn't buy that capability ...)  When you dial a phone number, the numbers are pretty big.  It has an external antenna.  My last phone had an internal antenna.  I didn't buy insurance in case I drop it and it breaks, or something.  It's possible that can happen.  It's not a Razor but it's thin.  The internal display is very clear!  I let the fully-charged phone run out the battery and, twice, it's lasted only 4 days with very minimal use.  Your call history is a couple of buttons down the menu-path, no biggie.  The speaker gets fuzzy at about 4 out of 7 bars.  You can't accidentally take pictures of inside your pocket or handbag.  I don't use the download capabilities of the phone for anything.  I don't IM.  I just use the phone as a phone.  So, I'm not going to comment on those features.  The 'door' that needs to be opened for charging is very flimsy!  I can see it breaking off very easily.  You'll want to 'turn' it 90 degrees UP to get it out of the way of the charger-cable.  There's no holster, yet, because it's so new.  There is a data-cable that can be used from another phone, so I'm told.  Be sure to ask about the peripheral hardware BEFORE you buy in case you need to have it right away.  All the peripherals may not be available yet.In sum, it's not a bad phone.  The ascending ring, the external antenna, and the fuzzy speaker, so far, hold me from giving this phone a Rating of 4.  It's above average but I don't think it deserves a 4.  I'll try the phone for a while and then try the Samsung C417.  It's all about tradeoffs.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Phone with a lot of well-rounded features", "Author": "ska alex", "ReviewID": "R35RRL1UBY4VA7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this phone as a christmas gift, and, aside from the battery issue my first one had, this is an absolutely terrific and easy to use phone.  the keypad is the best i have seen on any phone, and the size of the screen is perfect.  I had my previous phone, a samsung x4217 or whatever it was, for well over 4 years, and i had just about had it with that phone, so pretty much anything was an upgrade.  All i wanted from my new phone was a screen on the outside to show the time, and a camera that i could quickly pull out and snap a quick pic of something, and this has both.  this phone also has a video camera, which is a great extra feature.  the outside screen doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles, it just shows the time and whatever symbols you have at the top of the interior screen.  this phone has great sound quality, and the speaker phone works like a champ.  the ringer is nice and loud, and being able to use the bluetooth to send sound files to my phone, instead of downloading tones from cingular for an arm and a leg, is another great bonus.  We also signed up for the multimedia package, which nets you unlimited internet and Cingular Video access.  Cingular Video is great for espn mobile and cnn quickies, along with funny shorts from shows like letterman, family guy, and the brak show.at the end of the day this is just a phone, and it does everything that a phone should do, ie. not drop calls and it has great sound quality.  it doesn't do any particular added bonus that great, but it does all of them well, and that's how it should be.  if you are looking for an inexpensive phone with a lot of well-rounded features, this is by far the one to get.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone for the money!", "Author": "Crash Override \"Technical Consultant\"", "ReviewID": "R2XBR2GA2SR03I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my wife's ailing RAZR. It has Cingular 3G high speed data, Push-to-talk, and a good feature set. The size is just slightly thicker than the slim RAZR phone form factor. My wife seems to actually like the slightly bigger size because it is easier to grasp and use. The menus are decent and the sound quality seems above average. The battery is also quite good thus far. It also sports bluetooth and a nice speakerphone, which means loud ringers and a good, strong vibrate alert. All in all-this phone seems to be a winner for the price. If you want PTT in a slick package from Cingular, look at this capable phone, the V365 or Blackberry Pearl!", "Date": "December 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"OpinionatedLady\"", "ReviewID": "R6CY2H986YQ2T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought 5 of these for our family two months ago.  We were previously Nokia and Motorola users.  We made the transition fairly easily.  Pluses:  big keypad, big, bright display, decent sound quality EXCEPT for the speakerphone, nice camera with video.  Minuses:  iffy batteries (one phone had to have the battery replaced within two weeks), poor quality speakerphone, annoying placement of PTT button, too much emphasis on web access functions for those of us who don't like using a phone for our internet connections.  Bottom line: if you're looking for a good, cheap phone that does all of the basic things well and has a nice set of extra features to play with, this is the one for you!", "Date": "February 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Good Basic Phone, With 2 Problems", "Author": "Buddy S", "ReviewID": "R1G8TZQAKPQL5U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned the LG CU400 for about one month.  Both the call quality and the reception are  very good.  Battery life is acceptable, although I should note that I use the phone only for calls - - no internet, no Push to Talk and no Bluetooth.  The speaker phone is on the tinny side but acceptable - - about what one would expect for a phone of this size.I have, however, encountered two problems:1.  While the battery life is acceptable, I encountered a problem with the battery strength indicator.  The battery strength indicator on every cell phone I previously owned showed that the battery strength gradually declined as I used the phone, thereby giving reasonable advance notice when the battery needed recharging.  This is not the case with the indicator in the CU400.  The first CU400 I owned showed that the battery was fully charged (3 bars) until a relatively short time before it turned itself off because the battery was too low.  Specifically, on one occasion when I timed it, the indicator went from 3 bars to 2 bars five or six days after a charge.  After only 10 additional hours on standby with no calls at all, the phone turned off because of a low battery.Thinking the indicator was defective, I returned the phone to the AT&T; store and received a new replacement.  The indicator on the replacement phone operates slightly, but not significantly, better.  The first phone had Cingular markings and the second had AT&T; markings, so I doubt that the two phones came from the same manufacturing batch.  It seems that this is an inherent problem with the phone.  If you buy one of these, I definitely recommend immediately charging the battery when the indicator goes from 3 to 2 bars and buying a car charger, if you spend any appreciable amount of time in a car.  The car charger does not come with the phone.2.  When the phone is powered on or off, it makes an annoyingly loud and harsh noise.  My wife nearly jumped out her skin the first time I turned the phone off while standing next to her.  The noise cannot be changed to another tone, but it can be turned off by putting the phone on vibrate or by turning the ringer volume all the way down.  Of course, if I were to do either of these and forget to turn the volume back up after the phone is turned on again, I will not hear the phone ring.  I complained to AT&T;, which advised that the phone makes this noise because it is a \"3G\" phone and that the noise is supposed to replicate the sound of a \"jet.\"  All I can say is that I have been around airports for quite a while and the noise sounds nothing like a \"jet\" to me.  The closest thing I can compare the sound to is the noise a vacuum toilet on a cruise ship makes when the toilet is flushed.  It is really hard to imagine that a major US corporation would put such an intrusive sound in its cell phone and not give the user any option to replace the sound with another.In summary, the CU400 is a very good basic phone, provided you don't mind listening to the sound of a toilet flushing when you turn it on and off and you also don't mind either frequently charging or running the risk that the battery will unexpectedly run out of juice", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "not good", "Author": "Simona", "ReviewID": "R3RCP5ZMQFJLK7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not good, stopped working after 2 weeks, next time buy new or refurbished stuff.

It finally died. Couldn't blame it though. Bought a coulpe of other phones (with other plans), but always had my original as a backup. I like flips. Anyway, it finally died as I said. Found this replacement on Amazon. Brand new. Outstanding! Even got it early. Charged it. Inserted sim card. Right from the get go started messing up. Losing calls(in and out). Losing messages like crazy. And this comes at a very small point in time when I have to be in touch with an elderly family member, otherwise it wouldn't be so important.

The stupid PTT button on the side is in the way.4. Ringtones installed on the phone - where did they find that awful stuff?I had a Nextel and switched to Cingular when my children moved out of state so it wouldn't cost them to call me from their Cingular phones.  Needless to say, we don't talk much because my phone doesn't work unless I'm standing in the middle of an empty field or parking lot. I am planning on going back to Nextel.

I like the look of the phone and its size. It fits nicely in my hand and in the pouch of my purse. The sound quality is good and the range is pretty good, too. I rarely find myself in a place where there's no service.What I don't like:The PTT button is placed where my thumb goes when I flip the phone open, and so I almost always hit it, which means I have to cancel the request almost every time I use the phone. The battery status indicator is difficult to read, and is pretty much worthless to me.This particular phone has two major issues that bug me a lot. It loses connection to the tower, and messages often arrive a week or so late. I went back to the store after a week of this, and was told I needed to bring in the box that the phone came in. By the time I found the box, the trial period was over, so I'm just living with these problems, but I would not buy another one because of it.My recommendation:If you buy this phone, keep the box. You might need it if a replacement becomes necessary.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "A bad choice.", "Author": "S.

But one thing has jumped out at me as a major problem: the phone makes a very loud, annoying sound every time you turn it on and off.  I searched the menus and the manual for some way to turn the sound off, or at least down, and found nothing.  Finally I emailed the manufacturer, and they told me the sound cannot be disabled or turned down.  That's just idiotic and shows a real lack of respect for customers who want to be able to control their phone's volume.  The alternative is to leave it in silent mode all the time, but then (obviously) I can't hear it ring.Otherwise, the speaker seems to work well, and so far I haven't managed to accidentally push the Push To Talk button (which on my last phone was placed in a way that you couldn't help but push it every time you picked up the phone). However, the screen is kind of small and makes it pretty hard to see the number of bars you're getting.  This phone seems to get fewer bars than my last phone, although I don't really hear a difference in the sound quality.  It also seems to take a longer time to charge -- plus, the charger is not Energy Star rated, so it's using more electricity than it needs to.Overall, I'm not happy with this phone, and I wish I made a different choice.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bluetooth won't connect", "Author": "Teddy Silverman", "ReviewID": "R461FO1WEUHEV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a great phone that actually works in my office building and in my server room ( I am in the IT department).
