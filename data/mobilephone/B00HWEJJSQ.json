I didn't upgrade early since the S5 is not significantly different than the S4. I will wait for the S6. I'm debating whether I will join Verizon Edge. Did anyone join it? What are your thoughts?The battery still is pretty good. I've had no lockups or issues with my phone except when I dropped it one too many times and cracked it. Luckily I had the Geek Squad full warranty ($9.98 per month) since I bought my phone from Best Buy and they replaced it at no charge. I'm allowed unlimited replacements which is fantastic. I tried to get a S5 as my replacement but they didn't succumb to my personal charm and cuteness :)Verizon Wireless released Android 4.4.2 Kit Kat yesterday. You can now move all your apps to your SD card.*10/14/13 Still loving my Galaxy S4. My wife wanted to stay with Apple so I got her the 5S. Eh, S4 is better in my opinion :) Still not looking back. Sorry Apple, sorry iPhoners :) *Mirroring the Pepsi/Coke 80's commercial, my daughter looked at the 5S and my phone; played with her app on both phones, then put my wife's phone down and continued with my phone. Since then, she has eyes for my phone only.**October News*Verizon updated Android to 4.3I've had an iPhone since 2009. When I watched the Apple conference to see the iPhone 5, I really wasn't impressed. a few years ago when I picked up my 4S and after the return date, I saw the GS3. I was very impressed with it however, I was hesitant with Android since my wife had a Droid Incredible 2 which died a little after a year when she got it. Talking with some people who have the GS3, they said that they loved it, it's easy to use, and Android has gotten better over the course of time. At that time, the Android market in my opinion seemed like a disaster. Apple did a nice job streamlining everything (app market, itunes etc). Every so often when I had to go to the Verizon store, I would be attracted to the GS3 floor model. Since my upgrade date was coming soon, I thought that it's time for Apple and I to go our separate ways, be just friends. \"We were on a break!!!\"So to cut this short before I get hate mail for typing a long a$$ boring review; here goes:I've been with Verizon Wireless since 2005. I also have Verizon FIOS (TV, Phone, Internet). Having FIOS is great since I don't use any minutes when calling home or when my wife calls me 5 times in a day on some occasions. The record amount of phone calls is held by her, yepp you guessed it, her mom hehe :) tell my wife and I'll deny it!I was slightly hesitant to switching to a GS4 as I've read some reviews from Apple owners and claimed that the phone felt weird and they dropped the phone several times. \"It's slippery,\" is what I heard. Well, I can say that's certainly not the case when I picked it up. Actually, it feels quite nice. People complain about the plastic (poly-carbonate casing) being a finger magnet but that's why they make cases for phones. Also, what phone has a anti-fingerprint casing? Eh, I don't care. The white casing really doesn't show many fingerprints and I have a silicon casing around it so, problem solved! The funny thing is that the casing I have on it, doesn't even have fingerprints on it, so there you go!The screen is a thing of beauty! I know the iPhone 4S is older but the 5\" AMOLED screen is gorgeous. I love the edge to edge screen. It seems the lock screen was changed. I remember the GS3 had what looked like a pond and if you tapped it to unlock your phone, it would show ripples. Sadly, it's not on the GS4. If anyone knows if it is available, please chime in.I'm really really shocked at how light and thin this phone is. I would have thought that if I put this phone in my back jeans pocket, it would pull my pants down which would cause a national emergency. Nope! Contrary to popular belief, this phone is still small enough to fit in all jeans pockets and I didn't have a wardrobe malfunction. Those of you that were thinking and going to if if I did...PERV! ;-)The battery is pretty good. I usually wouldn't be able to last a little more than a half day with my 4S. I love the fact that the battery is replaceable as the back cover does come off. My iPhones always seem to have battery issues after a little over a year of use. Well, this time, I can just buy a new battery! YAY! Under the back cover, you can replace the battery and add storage since that's where the micro sd card slot is located as well. Right now I have a 32GB micro SD card installed in my phone. You can only place photos, videos, and music on the card. No apps which is a shame. *Note* my battery was almost dead so at 9:05, I plugged it into my desktop computer and as of 11:30pm it's saying Charging 69%. Wow that battery is huge. It took my iPhone a little over an hour to be fully charged!Many will probably call me dumb but I must say that this phone is FAST. Going to screen to screen, opening apps, camera, and the web browser (chrome comes preinstalled); most of the time, the phone is too fast for my fingers and brain. I literally have to move (and think) quicker just to be on the same page as my phone. It seems like it's laughing at me as I can't keep up with it. Kind of like a welcome to a Quad cored phone.Coming from iOS, yes, I have a lot to learn and many tout that Android is more customization, I must say that I feel free. I'm not knocking iOS. It's a great OS. I'm really loving 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean). <----- As of 4/28/14, it's Kit Kat 4.4.2. The Play Store is easy to use and navigate. Funny though, there is a tab for APPS and a separate tab for Verizon in the Play Store. APPS can now go on the SD card.Many people knock the plastic cover on the back. I happen to not mind it; I actually prefer it. Any dents or cracks allow me to simply replace the back cover. The plastic back cover is not slippery at all. I held the HTC One which I have to admit; looks gorgeous but felt very slippery. Each to their own though.The power button is located on the right side of the phone. I thought I would have trouble realizing that, thinking I still have my iPhone. Nope. It does require a little more pressure when you press down on it to turn on/off the phone. I actually like that since if my finger hits the power button accidentally, it doesn't shut the phone off or put it to sleep. The home button is on the bottom and at first I thought it was the speaker (don't laugh, I never owned a Galaxy phone before this one). It's a return home button. To the left of it, if your hand touches that spot, will illuminate a menu on the screen, and to the right, is the back button.I've been with Verizon Wireless for 10 years and they are fantastic. I was able to use my upgrade from my other line which my wife uses.  I have to admit, their customer service reps are very nice and helpful. Just be careful on the FB-VW page; they are not very helpful and give out wrong info. Not all of them but most- so be warned. If you have a question about VW' feel free to ask. Verizon Wireless was charging $250 for this phone. To reach $199 you had to complete a mail-in-rebate form. I couldn't buy this phone on Amazon (wish I could of) since I had the upgrade using my other line. I bought it at BB and they automatically applied the mail-in-rebate which was fantastic. I even had a 5% rewards certificate which the accepted. They couldn't take my 4S since I didn't buy it their but Verizon Wireless gladly took it and gave me a gift card ($177). Not bad with some minor cracks.The speaker is on the back of the phone. I was listening to my music that I had on Amazon (Amazon App comes pre-loaded) and when I put the phone down to listen to it while I was in my \"office,\" I couldn't hear anything and when I lifted the phone; there was my music. Eh, slight negative but I can live with it. The sound is not bad. Heck, I didn't buy this phone to play music all the time. It can be loud when at max volume. I had a better listening experience with the iPhone because simply; the iPhone and iPod are twins. I was kind of disappointed with how my music sounded but still doesn't hurt my experience with the S4.All in all, I love this phone. While, yes, it's not perfect since it can't tie my shoes; again, I'm loving it! I loved the iPhone but personally, it was getting kind of stale. This phone has opened me up to a whole new world. I'm new to Android but am looking forward to see how well it progressed and taking advantage of it, Samsung's TouchWiz, and the phone itself. Google Play is sooooo much better than what it was during Jelly Bean.By the way, on the back of the phone, there is a small Verizon emblem and on the lock screen it says \"Verizon Wireless.\" If anyone cares lol. I like it. When people see it, they're like...oooooh Verizon Wireless :)One person asked me if that was the S4 in my hand and I said yes. He said, \"nice to see that you're not drinking the Apple kool-aid.\" :)A co-worker saw my S4 and said, \"you'll be back!\"If you can, buy the wireless \"Nokia DT-900 Wireless Charging Plate - Retail Packaging - Black charger\" but remember you have to buy the wireless backplate cover for the S4. For those who traded in their phone to get the S4, make sure you tell Verizon to put it on a gift card. If you have one-bill pay (you have Verizon Wireless, FIOS TV and Internet) you CANNOT use this gift card to pay your ONE-BILL or VW bill. So what you can do is buy a SD card, the Nokia QI charger, and a backplate that supports wireless charging. I got $177 for my 4S and buying these extras still gives me $80 left on my gift card. Just an idea I'm throwing out. (No I don't own stock in Nokia, Verizon, or Samsung...or an employee of any of these)====================================================================================================================================================================================================Yes, I did look at the HTC One. The aluminum body is nice and the picture quality is nice but I'm not a fan of blink feed and you can't remove the battery or add a SD card (yes, Im well aware that the HTC One's size is 32GB and 64GB). The new HTC One does have removable storage.No, I DO NOT work for Samsung.No, Apple DID NOT try to buy me to be silentNO, I DO NOT work for GoogleNO, I AM NOT a troll (but I do like to feed them!!!!)===============================================================================Update on Battery Charging:My phone was fully charged a little past midnight. WOW!Turned on my phone at 12pm; we ran errands, we went to a party, I used Foursquare, facebook, email, and texting- as of 11:06pm my battery is at 89%. By this time with my iPhone 4S, I would be about an hour from needing a charge.I've had the phone for several months and I'm still loving it. With light usage I went 2 days without charging. With Slightly more usage, I got a little more than 1 1/2 days. Not bad.* Playing games heavily hits the battery about the same as the iPhone 4S but light playing allows me to have a good amount of charge still left for at least 30-36 hrs. Very light usage; the battery will last about 2-3 days (including just being idle).* Playing games for a few minutes and you'll notice that the back of the phone gets warm. It doesn't bother me as this phone is like a mini computer :)*Playing a game of Uno (the free APP) : For a few minutes, the battery will discharge a lot. If you are playing for 10minutes or more the battery will not last the night.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S4 Thorough Review", "Author": "Zain", "ReviewID": "R3JT2VCQVS10N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I picked up my Galaxy S4, I had the Galaxy Note II. I put my Note II up for sale online before my S4 was supposed to arrive, and it sold around two weeks before the S4 was supposed to be released, so for the two weeks before my S4 arrived, I had been living with a Droid X. Keep this in mind during my review, as my findings may have been slightly tainted by the fact that the S4 is such a massive upgrade from the Droid X, which I can hardly consider to be a \"modern phone\" anymore. Anyway, I'd like to go through the S4's hardware (screen, construction, camera, internals) then its software and any miscellaneous things I hadn't mentioned so far.ScreenThe Galaxy S4's screen is unbelievably high quality. It is a 4.99\" 1920 x 1080 panel, and colors are extremely sharp and vivid. Text looks fantastic, and because the resolution is so high, I haven't had a problem decreasing the font size to fit more information on my display. The display is 441 pixels per inch; in comparison, the S3's is 308 ppi, a 43% increase! The screen is a massive improvement from the S3 or the Note II. Super AMOLED HD panels like this one make colors really pop, which isn't a problem for me, but some people prefer to have a more realistic/neutral panel on their phones. There is a display setting that you can adjust to make the screen more neutral though, which should help alleviate any issues people have with the S4's standard setup.Physical Construction/Phone ExteriorThe Galaxy S3 was said by Samsung to be inspired by nature, so they made it with very curved sides like a pebble. With the S4, this mantra is refined a little bit. There is a metallic band that circles the phone's sides, and the swooping curves of the S3's back are straightened out a little. The result looks significantly more sophisticated and \"grown up\" than the S3. The back of the phone has a \"Hyperglaze\" finish with a light pattern printed on it, which is interesting but not distractingly so. The pattern is not very easy to see unless you hold the phone close to you or at an angle from a light source. I chose the white S4 because I think white may hide scratches and scuffs better than black, but both colors are enticing.  One thing I am happy about is that this phone doesn't have Verizon's garish logo plastered right onto the home button like it was on the Note II. Make no mistake though, Verizon's version of the S4 still has a jumbo Verizon logo as well 4G LTE one on the phone's back. I would definitely get a replacement back without these ugly logos if I didn't use a case.The volume, power, and home buttons are all substantially upgraded from Samsung's previous phones. They have a nice satisfying click, they don't wobble, and they are easy to feel without looking. I especially like the fact that the S4's home button is in the middle of the bottom bezel, instead of at the bottom like it was in the S3. Speaking of bezels, this phone has practically none. This phone feels like all screen basically, which explains how Samsung got a 4.99\" screen into a body that is actually slightly smaller than the S3's body (which had a 4.8\" screen), making it the smallest ~5\" 1080p phone in the world! Even though the S4 is larger than an iPhone, it feels much more compact due to the great use of space and tiny bezels.A few more things: the S4 feels very light, but the metallic band around the phone makes it feel sturdy. Also, the screen is covered in Gorilla Glass 3 - although you probably can't scratch it with your keys, I still wouldn't recommend dropping it a lot. I bought a soft touch plastic case on Amazon from Elago for my S4 and I really like it, as it keeps the phone more protected while not making it look like an ugly brick. I still love how the power button is on the side of the S4 (unlike phones like the HTC One or the iPhone 5), as it feels like a much more natural position for turning the phone on and off when in your hand.InternalsThe Galaxy S4 has a quad core Snapdragon 600 processor and 2 GB ram, and in my time so far, I still haven't seen any of the occasional lag I felt when I tried a S4 out at AT&T; (maybe this is what took Verizon an extra month in releasing the S4). The international version of the phone has 8 cores - a low powered quad core processor for idling and a high powered quad core processor for doing more intensive tasks. I'm a little disappointed that the U.S. didn't get that processor, but the Snapdragon 600 is no slouch. Regardless, I have gotten fantastic LTE service everywhere I've visited with the S4 so far.The S4 comes with a 13 MP camera (although its set to take 9.6 MP photos by default). This camera is definitely an upgrade from anything else on the market. Not only does it capture a huge amount of detail in photos, but the software has so many useful features too. There are plenty of different modes to take pictures with, but the ones I've really played with and enjoyed are Drama Shot and Animated Photo Mode. Drama Shot basically takes a series of pictures and then stitches them together, which is useful when the subject is moving. I took a picture of my brother doing a flying kick on the lawn and it looks fantastic. The Animated Photo Mode is great, too - essentially, the S4 takes a series of shots and plays them sequentially in one image, like a gif. You can then choose which parts of the photo to animate and which to keep still. It may sound confusing, but it's actually relatively intuitive and fun when you try it out. I have seen comparisons between the S4 and the HTC One criticizing the S4's low light performance, so I tested it out for myself. On Auto mode, with the auto night detection off, the S4's photos in low light look poor. However, in Night mode, the photos improve immensely. Overall, the One's low light quality is better than the S4's, but the S4's camera is much better in all other situations. Of course, the \"better camera\" depends on each person's use for it, but unless you take most of your pictures in the dark, it probably makes sense to go for the S4's camera, which captures quite a bit more detail at all other times and is still decent in the dark. As a side note, the front facing camera is 2 MP, which is a slight upgrade from the 1.9 MP camera in the S3.Like the S3 and the Note II, the S4 comes with a removable battery (2600 mAh) and a Micro SD card slot. I immediately put in my 64 GB card I got on Amazon and now I have plenty of space to store my photos, videos, and music. I haven't yet purchased a spare battery, but it is nice to know I have the option to do so if I want.The S4 comes with approximately 1 million sensors - to name a few, an accelerometer, a temperature gauge, a barometer, two proximity sensors, an RGB notification light, two mics, and even more. One of my favorite things about Android is the notification light; you can instantly tell when your phone has an unread message or other notification. I haven't had a problem with any of the phone calls I've made with my S4, so clearly the noise canceling second mic is doing its job.SoftwareI think that Android has always had more features than iOS but that iOS has always had more polish to it. After Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean, I no longer find this to be true. Jelly Bean looks fantastic, and it is also very feature-rich. iOS on the other hand has stagnated. I owned the original iPhone and the iPhone 4, and other than the increased resolution (and the ability to add home screen backgrounds), the software on both phones looks practically identical. iOS, although once groundbreaking, now looks positively gaudy, with many of its apps containing over-the-top skeumorphic design - Game Center and Podcasts come to mind as particularly egregious examples. Android now offers a nice, clean interface that has finally caught up to iOS in terms of visual flair.Jelly Bean isn't the massive overhaul that Ice Cream Sandwich was, but it definitely has some nice new features that I enjoy using. By long pressing on the home button and clicking on the Google icon, you can get to Google Now. Here, Google combines information that it already knows about you into sets of \"cards\" that appear throughout the day at (hopefully) the most helpful time. For instance, when I bought a case and screen protector, there was a card that told me that my package had shipped with UPS two day shipping, and it gave me the option to track it or viewa the confirmation email from Amazon. Google Now also tells you the local weather for the next three days, traffic home from work and other frequently visited places, and sports scores for your favorite teams. In addition, by saying \"Google\" or pressing the speech button while in Google Now, you can use Google's enhanced voice actions. Here, Google uses its algorithms to answer questions about people and places. You can ask it math questions, set alarms, send texts, call people, and do a ton of other things. Somehow, Google has done something to make these voice searches incredibly quick and accurate, often much more so than Apple's voice assistant Siri. If you want to see a funny video of the two compared, search on YouTube for \"Google Search vs. Siri App Judgment\" and skip to 3:31 in the video, it really shows how well Google's voice recognition algorithm works. Another feature introduced in Jelly Bean is expandable/actionable notifications. When I get a text message, I can drag down with one or two fingers on the notification to expand it to see the entire message. This also works with emails and many other types of notifications, as long as the developer has enabled it.The Galaxy S4 runs Jellybean, aka Android 4.2.2., which is currently the most up to date Android version. It has a layer designed by Samsung that overlays Jellybean called Touchwiz, which has its pros and cons. In my opinion, pure, unmodified Jellybean looks significantly better than Touchwiz, but Touchwiz adds some pretty fantastic features that aren't present in stock Jellybean. It would be impossible to mention all the features present on this phone, but I will try to go over the most significant ones.Multi Window: by holding the back button for a few seconds, multi window opens (or closes), allowing you to select and open two different apps simultaneously. One thing I really like doing is watching a video on YouTube while browsing on Chrome or sending a text.Smart Stay/Rotation/Pause/Scroll: Smart Stay keeps the screen on while you're looking at it, which is useful if you do a lot of reading. Smart Rotation stops the screen from rotating along with the phone if it senses your face rotating along too (like if you're laying down in bed). Smart Pause pauses a video if you look away. Smart Scroll scrolls up and down by either tilting your head or tilting the phone up and down. Of course, these features don't work if the front facing camera can't see your face, so that limits their applicability in some situations.Gestures: there are a huge number of gestures built into the phone. You can wave up or down to scroll in the browser, you can wave to answer a call or change songs, you can swipe your palm across the screen to take a screenshot, and you can put the phone up to your ear to start a call while in the messaging app.Air View: this lets you preview messages, images, and other things in many of the built in apps by hovering your finger over them. It used to only work with the S Pen on the Note II, but now it can sense your finger, too.Lock screen applications: I like these because they let you jump to an app right from the lock screen.Swipe to call/text: In the dialer or contacts apps, you can swipe in one direction on a contact to call them and in the other to text them. This seems so simple, but it is extremely convenient.Final WordsAlthough the Galaxy S4 doesn't deviate too far from the S3's look, it has been completely redesigned internally and has also received a whole set of new software features. It will probably take me several weeks to evaluate the S4's battery life, but I will try to update this review with any further comments I may have. I have only had my S4 for a few days, but these are my impressions so far. If you have any questions, feel free to comment and ask me. The S4 is a fantastic phone and I have no qualms recommending it to anyone.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blows the competition out of the water!", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R2GDJDRKI0MNUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome. The phone comes with a ton of bloatware and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware. I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life. Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left. Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.----------------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome. My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands. I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges. I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5. I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone. Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone. My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp. The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching. I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me. The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year. I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands. It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S4 will be the best phone of 2013, mark my words!", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Learn Something New Everyday", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "RQV8AENCPJBRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When smart phones first came out, I was an Apple fan. It took me until the 3GS to realize that I was never going to be satisfied with a Apple's cookie cutter user interface. It has made smart phones accessible to those who aren't inquisitive about technology. If, however, you are like me, you quickly realized that Android provided the best balance of reliability and customization.Having said that, the biggest drawback to Android is that you are reliant on the manufacturer to push over-the-air updates when a new version is released. That's the only drawback I see. With Apple, everyone is on the same page as long as your device can handle the new features.With that caveat, let me begin to heap praise upon the Galaxy S4. It is my third Android device. It blows me away. The only criticism I have is its learning curve. I've had it since it came out and still find myself learning something new everyday. In a way, though, that keeps the device fresh and exciting. If you're new to Android and need a more slow introduction to the S4's features, it even has a basic mode.Once in the advanced mode, you unlock a host of features that make clear that this device was designed for you, the user. The device is not one that tells you what you need (my basic beef with the iPhone). It, instead, gives you intuitive features that you would like to use. For example, yesterday, on a hike, I realized that I could take a photo of a natural stream and then produce a GIF that kept certain areas still while animating the water. While this may seem a trivial point, it illustrates how this device is designed for internet 2.0 users who want to publish content. You can read about all these features elsewhere, and they are numerous. It's fun to constantly discover a new use that inspires creativity.Despite its powerful set of features, you'll find the battery life very satisfying. With Blluetooth and WIFI enabled, I was able to use the device for 37 hours before its charge depleted.For professionals, I have to say this is the best device I've uncovered. Rather than unlock the phone and then switch off the volume, I can hold down the power button and quickly switch between volume levels. This is handy in meetings or in presentations where you realize you've left the volume on. Rather than stare at my screen as I input my password, I can take care of discretely. The screen size helps, too, in combination with productivity suites like \"Documents to Go\" (not exclusive to the device) to view and collaborate on documents while travelling. Other devices with smaller screens make this somewhat laborious. Samsung seems to have hit the sweet spot between no being too small and not being a near tablet (Note devices).Some will criticize the S4 for containing bloatware from Samsung. I just overlook it. One can customize the home screens so that needing to access the full list of installed apps isn't necessary. I will say, though, that I love \"Watch On.\" With the on-board RF blaster, you can control TVs, Blu Ray players, Bose stereos, receivers, just about anything as long as you in line-of-site with the device. The app even acts like a universal remote, providing a combo of uses (like activating your receiver, Blu Ray device, and TV all at once). In this way, it almost replaces more expensive devices like Logitech's Harmony Remotes, except that it doesn't include the RF receivers.In short, if you need a phone, get this one. It's good for publishing; it's good for work/productivity; and it's good for being lazy around the house. Oh, yeah! It also makes phone calls.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!!", "Author": "TMA", "ReviewID": "R9O71Y1UUGLP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The last few phones that I have had were from Motorola  and I was a bit skeptical about changing.

I'm a former iPhone 3gs/4/4s user and I know just how good android had coming along the years.Extremely beautiful screen, extremely light and crazy thin, very easy to put in any pocket.Awesome camera, as good as the iPhone 5, even better, because with iPhone you have to manually click on screen to focus, and no face detection on iPhone.Super fast 4 core processor, and never ending ram space.  You can keep as many apps open as you like, without ever feeling slowing down like the iPhone when you had like just 10-15 apps open in the background.The gimmicks (eye scrolling, air gestures, s-beam) are fun, but I turned those off immediately after I got my phone, this will also save you more battery and ram space.Battery life is simply AMAZING.  You simply can't run this beast down in just one day.  I get average 1.5-2 full days of use depending on usage.

I suggest you try the Nova Launcher as well.Verizon's Network is no doubt #1, as I have used all 3 major carriers, 4G is blazing fast, and 3G is also very fast.***Also as a side note note, even though Amazon price is cheaper than Verizon official site, if you read though Amazon's contract terms, you'll notice you must keep your Verizon line of service active for at least 6 month to avoid from being charged a $400 dollar termination fee from Amazon, besides the usual ETL that Verizon is gonna charge you.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone poorly made", "Author": "Brandon Whetzel", "ReviewID": "R2V8WD7RG43TW7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Phone operates great and is lightning fast but poorly made.

I've been using the Razr HD and normally i would be fine with it but Motorola's software is just slower than the competition, it just felt like I was running on a much less spec'd phone. So I decided to bite the bullet and just upgrade to a GS4 after reading up on it a bunch. So lets get on with it and see what I thought.Design: This is where people give ALOT of hate. It's not the best but honestly as far as plastic phones go It's not bad. It does have a premium look to it, the plastic on the black one atleast has a nice kind of diamond etched looking design which looked good and hided fingerprints a bit. I would have preferred a more matte finish but its not the worst. Honestly the plastic is good for durability though, these phones you can drop and drop without making any scuffs or scratches. The design is more flat and less curved so even though it is thinner than the S3 at first glance it kind of eludes to be the other way around. Button placement is decent I wish the power button was a bit lower and that it has a camera button, also would be nice to have a micro hdmi out but they aren't deal breakers. The button layout is decent, I kind of wish they had a multitask button but it works well. The one suggestion I have for Samsung is they should have made an optical pad out of the home button (ala the OG Droid Inc) . I went through Verizon and held the DNA and the Lumia 928 and the GS4 just felt alot better in hand.Performance: Some of the reviews claimed slowdown and I'm happy to see that I haven't really seen any slowdown. The phone responds really well to touch and apps open swiftly, games run like a charm, nothing to complain here its much better than my Razr. I even have my CPU power save checked and i don't notice any slowdown.Software: More like software overload, this thing is packed. I've been using smartphones since before the Htc G1 (first android phone) and I'm well versed in everything android and this phone sort of overwhelmed me with features. Features like smart stay, smart pause, smart scroll, air gesture, palm motion, air view, smart motion. I would recommend googling them for full explanations. I use smart stay which stops the screen from turning off when it detects me looking at it,and airview which allows me to hover my finger over something to get info. The homescreen is well done, samsungs is pretty useful and speedy, I get quick settings in the dropdown menu and the stock messaging, calander, browser work well though the Nature theme is looking dated. I fell in love with multi window when I tried it though, running 2 apps side by side works seamlessly and quick. It is alot like the snap windows in windows 8.Sidenote: one annoyance on the Verizon version only is they have a constant, irremovable wifi notification that does a great job at being really annoying, this is a carry over from the same thing that everyone hated on the GS3 apparently verizon didn't care.Storage: 16gb is enough, in reality you only get like 10 for apps, I have like 50 apps installed and still have over half left though.Camera: The camera is great, like I said earlier I wish It had a physical button but eh no big deal. Lots of cool features, 1080p recording with the ability to snap photos during recording is great. There is a night mode, voice option, continuous shooting mode which are great. Photos don't snap extremely fast but they are quick enough and I can set my volume keys as a shutter button. One feature I love is you can take slow motion video at 1/2 1/4 and 1/8th speed and at a resolution of 800x450 which believe it or not isn't bad at all for slow motion video. Picture and video quality is decent enough for a camera phone nothing bad.Screen: looks brilliant, honestly at first look I can't really tell the advantage of 1080p screens on this tiny of a device but comparing with other another device it does look better. Samsung AMOLED's are always great, and have really true blacks.Signal: Signal seems decent, it was showing slightly lower than my razr a couple of times but most time i looked at them in different places they were the same, so it's not top of the class.Battery: I need to test this more to know. It looks like I will easily get daily usage. I have high hopes for the 2600 mah battery though I was extremely happy they went with a decently larger battery. UPDATE: So far today I've had it off the charger mostly at home for 11 1/2 hours, it is sitting at 64% with low-moderate usage 1 hr 22 min of screen time, decent bit of texting, ebay, facebook, app store, camera usage. So not bad at allConclusion: Bells and Whistles if you want them this has it. While Samsung hasn't done game changing on the looks department, the GS4 definitely took some engineering. Taking the old GS3 keeping almost identical dimensions (actually smaller) which giving a battery, screen size/quality, spec bump is really a great feat and shows how fast changing this field is.Not to mention all the crazy software additions on this they really put alot of work in. On Verizon now you can probably get the DNA decently cheaper however with the GS4 you get a better speced phone, better feeling phone, better battery life and all the software tid bits with it.

In a lot of ways, the phones are very similar. Quad-core beast CPUs, 2 gigs of memory, and beautiful 1080 displays. The differences lie in software, camera, build, and screen size/speakers.Software - This is a toss up between which type of Android \"skin\" you prefer. I flash custom roms, or at the very least custom launchers, so I choose the S4 because of the air gesture features, IR blaster, and camera software. I use NOVA Launcher Prime and it lets me change the phone however I want, and root helped remove the bloat on either phones.Camera - Lots have been discussed on the differences here. HTC uses an Ultra pixel sensor to allow for greater low light quality, and they do win here. The S4 beats it in overall quality and pixel count, allowing for amazingly clear pictures in good light settings. This will come down to how you take pictures. If you're a party animal and social butterfly, the HTC low light will be good for bars, clubs, and restaurants. If you are more into using the camera as a replacement for more expensive rigs (understanding the limits) then the S4 will be your best bet. For me, I'm a mix, and I like the built in capabilities of the S4 camera and pixel count for cropping.Build - HTC One wins, hands down. All aluminum body is gorgeous, feels cool and good against the skin, and it feels solid. The S4 uses a plastic body. The phone doesn't feel flimsy, but it does feel plasticy and this will bother some coming from the aluminum builds of HTC or Apple. I have one major caveat... cases. I put all of my gear in cases, especially phones, and so the lighter weight of the S4, mixed with a solid case, means I keep weight down, and didn't make a decision on build materials when in fact it wouldn't matter to me when I shove my phone in an Otterbox case. Also, build materials does not necessarily equal build quality.Screen/Speakers - The HTC One has higher pixel density, as it is a 1080 display shoved in a 4.7 inch screen, versus the same resolution on a 5 inch display in the S4. Either way, this is way beyond \"retina\" and will look absolutely phenomenal. The colors on the S4 are more vibrant and saturated, the HTC a little more real to life and muted, with great blacks and contrast. This is all personal preference. I like my phones to pop a bit, since I have my monitor at home set to very real and contrasty settings for photography and video editing and gaming, so a nice bright, colorful phone is a nice change of pace. Again, this is personal preference.  Speakers... HTC wins. No contest. The speakers are huge and front facing. While Beats audio is a huge scam and all it really means is that you have a bass-heavy equilizer setting, in this case the speakers on their own make up for it. I use a DSP pack on my S4 to allow for granular customization of my sound profiles on the S4, and I have zero desire for anything Beats, but I do wish I had a nice big front-facing speaker.So it comes down to preferences, as both phones are solid. I went with a white S4, and I absolutely love it.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible experience from Amazon and Verizon", "Author": "Kimberly DeBarge", "ReviewID": "R2MGMW2PCSVAOD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Three days after receiving my brand-new phone, with brand-new two year contract strings attached, the microphone for in-call voice pickup stopped working.

When I called Amazon, I got right through and told customer service what had happened.  She told me that I had two choices for a replacement phone; 1. Send the phone back (after I receive the return label) and they will send me a replacement phone when the receive the bad one; or 2. Charge me for a new phone ($710.98) to arrive tomorrow and they will refund the price of the phone when they receive the bad one.  I chose option 2 as I didn't want to wait.  When I checked my orders on Amazon and they were going to ship a Black phone instead of a white one.  Back on the phone...talked to another rep and he straightened it all out.  I just received an email from the first customer service rep confirming my shipment and return label. FYI,you will have to contact Amazon if you have any problems with the phone within the first 30 days, after that you have to deal with Samsung or your carrier.So far Amazon customer service has been great!I will update after we receive our replacement phone.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Dreamy!", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R29ZERZMKEP4DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got our new phones for a penny (New Customer with Verizon through Amazon), and they are simply amazing.I can't say much more than they are the best phones on the planet.(Until the S5 comes out.

One of the biggest corporations of today, Samsung was founded in 1938, but it wasn't until the 1990's that Samsung started manufacturing electronics. Since then Samsung Industry has become known all over the world for its computers, monitors, televisions, and especially their latest adaption of  its mobile device the Samsung Galaxy S4.The S4 is one of Samsung's most successful  products out there. The S4 has three predecessor's and even a tablet adaptation.The first Samsung Galaxy first came out back in 2010 which was originally called the Galaxy S, following after was the S2 in 2011 and S3 in 2012. Then finally the best of its brothers in 2013 the Samsung S4 was released. Now its time for the specs and features, the Samsung Galaxy S4 has greatly advanced in this area compared to its previous versions and have set the bar for other smartphone of its generation. The S4 weighs only 120 grams and has a 5 inch screen with full High Definition  with 441 ppi! The S4 is 136.6 mm tall, 69 mm in length, and 7.9mm  wide.  The Galaxy S4 can contain up to 2 Gigabytes of RAM . The S4 full High Definition screen  is made of AMOLED, this improves the phones response time and helps the phone use less power. Thus the features, first the Galaxy S4's camera and video features. This beast has two cameras a back camera that is 13  mega pixels with zero shutter lag and a front camera that is 2 mega pixels  also with zero shutter lag and both cameras able to record in full 1080pi High Definition. The S4 has many camera features that only it has. For those camera lovers this is where I completely win you over, camera features included with the Galaxy S4 are Drama where you take multiple pictures and merge them into one, Sound & Shot which allows you to add background sound to a picture for a couple seconds, Rich Tone when pictures are merged in various exposures that create soft and rich color, Night mode makes pictures taken in the low light, brighter and clearer, sports makes photos taken at hide speed clearer, and my favorite camera feature called Eraser which takes five consecutive pictures and erases moving object's saving the best one. Now what sets the Samsung Galaxy S4 above the rest, its smart gestures and personal features . These features are what got me loving this phone. The first  feature is called group play that allows you to share games,music, pictures, and videos to fellow Galaxy users. Next is the Samsung adapt, it adjusts the phones sound, screen brightness on its own depending on your environment. Another feature only Samsung has is called S Health which keeps track of your calorie intake and optional exercises according to your lifestyle and environment around you. Smart gestures are unique features that allow users to scroll down or turn the page by simply waving your hand across the screen down or up and left to right. With smart gestures it makes touching your phone obsolete because you are now able to on the Samsung Galaxy S4 scroll up or down a page with just your eyes and pause or continue videos by looking away or back at the screen. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is by far the best phone I've ever had. In the past I have owned the droid Razer and IPhone 4s, both those phones are nowhere close to competing with the Samsung Galaxy S4. The S4's enhanced specs, super smooth look, and unique and cool features. Its 5 inch screen puts other phones to shame and the S4 being made of plastic makes it one of the most durable phones out there. I use my phone 24/7 and the battery life lasts longer than any other phone I've had. I've had the phone for about 5 months now and have had zero issues with it.

(You will still need to kill tasks/clear memory though. Damn me and my multitasking ways!)-Easily print and share stuff any which way you might need.

I replaced my older S3 with the S4 and was instantly impressed.  Every feature of the phone seems to be well thought out and designed.  Button placement is perfect and phone seems very well constructed.  I do have a few minor issues, but they are all with the Verizon UI.  Verizon has changed some things from the stock UI that may be annoying.  When I saw the S4 in a store the home screens wrapped around, but this is not the case on my device.

I really wanted the HTC One, but it still wasn't available for Verizon and I did not want to switch carriers.However, after living with it for more than a month now, I'm glad I got this phone.The Pros:(1) I'm not a heavy user, and I have found that I can go for three days without having to charge the phone. My last phone, a Droid X, had to be charged every night.(2) The screen is very good, and I like both the screen size as well as the high resolution.  It's even fairly readable in daylight.(3) Lots of people write negative things about Samsung's custom UI over \"pure\" Android, but I don't really notice this.  I have a Google Nexus 7 tablet which has a \"pure\" Android interface, and this phone, and I don't notice much of a difference in the UI at all. Sure, the phone's default configuration has lots of Samsung widgets taking up lots of space on several pages when you first power up the phone, but it's easy to get rid of them and replace them with apps and widgets that you actually use.  After that, there really isn't much difference between \"pure\" Android and the S4's user experience.  Given this experience, I'm glad I chose the S4 over the HTC One because the One's default home screen cannot be replaced (which is something that I would've never used).(4) The S4's storage can be increased: I bought a 64GB SDXC memory card at the same time I bought the phone. I now have nearly 80GB of storage for the phone, and I won't ever have to worry about running out of storage space.(5) The call quality is good.  And the speaker is loud enough that I no longer have to turn up the volume all the way to max in order to hear the other party.Cons:  I can't really think of any.  A lot of people say negative things about the \"cheap looking\" plastic casing, but that's part of the reason why this phone is so light.  My last phone was a Droid X, and that phone weighed more than the S4 even though it had a significantly smaller screen.  I'd rather have a lighter, plastic phone than a heavier, aluminum-casing phone.Overall, I'm very happy with the S4.

It was a difficult transition from an iPhone to an android based phone because I was not used to having so many choices about customization.  This is a good thing though and one of the reasons I decided not to get another iPhone.The good:- The S4 is very fast.  I think it's amazing to be able to use 2 apps at the same time on the same screen.  My iPhone 4 was slowing down and could barely handle the Facebook app.- Visually appealing.  There's a lot of eye candy here however, if that's not your thing, you could easily tone it down.-  Size.  You'll find this in both the good and bad category.  The size does make it easier to complete work on the phone and see web pages that aren't optimized for mobile use.-  Great camera.  The camera really does a great job and comes with lots of helpful editing tools.  It can even take front and back photos at the same time.-  Battery life is impressive for such a large phone with a lot of activity on the screen.-  Bells and whistles.  This will also be on both lists.  The phone has tons of little, interesting things it can do, however it feels a lot like you're in beta testing mode.  Some of them are pretty buggy.  However, nothing that most people would actually rely on is buggy so the phone still functions really solidly.-  Easy mode feature.  There is a setting you can turn on that will make the phone easier for a new smart phone user or someone not very tech savvy to use.  I haven't tried it, but I think it's nice that it is there.-  The biggest for me is freedom.  I felt bossed around by my iPhone.  It annoyed me that there were things it just wouldn't let me do and apps that I couldn't uninstall.  The iPhone worked great and honestly is a much better overall device, but after 2 years of being annoyed by iTunes and being told what to do by Apple, I had enough.  This phone does come with a bunch of pre-installed apps but you can deactivate them.  This phone does require you to have a gmail account which didn't thrill me but it isn't too restrictive.The bad:-  I would prefer to use this without a case because of how big it already is but I am very sure I would break it quickly.  It's great that the phone is super light, given its impressive size, but a few extra ounces wouldn't hurt.  It feels a little flimsy without a case but maybe it's stronger than I think.  I'm not that interested in finding out though so I'll leave the case on at least for awhile.-  So that leads us into size again.  Unless you have large hands, this is going to be a little too big for most women.  Men would have an easier time.  I am getting used to it and it will be fine but I do miss the smaller iPhone that fit in my hand like a glove and that I could operate one handed very easily.  It is difficult for me to do anything 1 handed with this phone. I have heard there is a smaller version coming out but it is not as powerful.-  Bells and whistles.  The phone promises a lot of very interesting advanced features and some of them work great.  Some of them have never worked for me.  It's only been 2 days so maybe it is operator error but I kind of think it isn't.  A good example is the feature that allows you to wave your hand over the phone to answer in speaker mode.  This has never worked for me once.  I also haven't ever needed it so I guess it's fine that it doesn't work but I will keep trying.-  Google.  You have to have a gmail account to use the phone.  It doesn't need to be your primary e-mail account but it has to be on there.  Google features heavily on the phone.  Gmail isn't my primary e-mail account but I did already have one so I registered it.  This would have been fine but the gmail account was old and it transferred a ton of old contacts and pictures from an ancient Picassa account into the phone.  I did get the contacts out but even after deleting all the pics from Picassa, it was still somehow sending them to my phone.  I ended up just making a new gmail address.-  I do miss having the e-mail preview show up on the lock screen so I can get a quick glance without having to unlock the phone.  You can put a widget on the screen that will preview your e-mail account and that works fine for me, but I miss the iPhone style notifications.I think I do have more bad items than good but the bad items are mostly just little things and the good items are very important such as the speed and freedom to customize.  If I had to choose the biggest negative, it would be the size.  I'll get used to it though.  The iPhone actually felt really large at first as well.I am most curious as to how this is going to be functioning in a year or even 2.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Verison insurance did not transfer", "Author": "MAT", "ReviewID": "RE7MT4W1WYH9J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased an S4 on amazon even though I was cautioned to not.

I do not have that this \"dongle\" so I should not be forced to have the software for it running on my phone.  Also Verizon has a ton of paid services that turned on themselves, but thankfully Verizon gave us a credit and I was able to disable them.  (I wanted them to be deleted but they said \"too bad so sad you are stuck with them.\") If it were not for the bloatware I would give this phone 3 1/2 stars, but because of the bloatware I give it one.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "the phone lasted me 4 days and somehow it managed to shatter in my pocket, in", "Author": "Evan", "ReviewID": "RBTOTDSMUVJ8K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the phone lasted me 4 days and somehow it managed to shatter in my pocket, in an otterbox case, while i was sitting down.the phone does not do well in the heat love everything about the phione except the fragile aspect.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Phone ever", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1546QI0BUK041", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not want to give up my Galaxy Nexis because I love it, that was until I got the Galaxy s4.

I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusI have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

It's trying to teach them how to use a smart phone in general that is tough, but it seems this phone can get a bit overwhelming for some. I know when I transitioned from my Incredible 2, I was trying to adjust to everything. Once you do though, the phone is great. I can't complain about much. Battery life is decent and the battery is replaceable, which is nice. Screen is bright and colorful. I know you can get these phones pretty cheap now because the S5 is out, but this phone is definitely worth getting for its now low price and features/capabilities.

She originally wanted the Note 3, but at the price that device is going for, I convinced her that she didn't need that much screen.  Her previous phone was the LG Intuition, which was an OK android phone, but it really had some strange software issues after one of the firmware upgrades that nobody knew how to fix.  The GS4 is a far more capable device, and it has more neat little features than she or I will ever know what to do with.Samsungs AMOLED screens continue to push the competition to keep up with their striking visual fidelity, and the resolution is still above or on par with anything else out there right now.  The GS4's processor makes that old phone look like a slug by comparison, and even though this device is aging and on the verge of being replaced, it still holds its own against the rest of Verizon's Android lineup.My wife particularly likes the fact that there are so many ways to interact with the phone even though some of the features may seem gimmicky.  Still, it's enough to keep her happy until she is eligible for another upgrade.  She mostly plays games, does her social networking and browses the web, so she isn't a power user.  It says a lot though that I haven't seen her open her laptop once since the phone came and we activated it.  The GS4 does everything she needs and more.We have only owned the phone for a few days at this point, so I have nothing to add to the negatives column, but I will say that Samsung has come a long way with their phones since I worked in the cell phone industry a few years ago.  There was a time when I would never have recommended a Samsung phone to anyone, but they seem to have gotten their act together in a big way with their Android lineup.

I have switched from iPhone to Android and back a number of times because I'm on the fence between the flexibility of Android and the functionality of iPhone.Android gives you access to the little things, like setting vibration to \"off\" for alarms while keeping it on for incoming calls. Very little thing, I know, but I don't want my phone buzzing at me at 6 in the morning; just a gentle ring will wake me up fine. However, iPhone has always handled media much better, provides visual voicemail right in the dialer app, and is just more simple to use overall. I hadn't found an Android phone that could do these things competitively enough with iPhone... until now.This phone nearly matches iPhone in music and video functionality, and the simplicity is as close to iOS as you can get on an Android device. And yes, although I said \"nearly matches,\" because iPhone is still the king of media, having access to download and move files in memory, set preferences the way I like throughout the device, and all those other little things that iPhone users will know what I'm talking about,\"iPhone is the greatest, but if it could only to this...,\" well the Galaxy S4 can.

Yes the it's not as user friendly as apple with only 5-6 functional setting icons but once you group apps and setting you don't use and need  the rest is just as easy to use. #1 big plus for me is the size of the screen - I LOVE IT!!!!! I love watching movies on it, playing games, online shopping :)I also love the fact that I can apply different themes, icons, fonts and make any other system changes without \"jail breaking\" my phone or being stuck with what it came with. So personal customization is another big plus. You can always buy a new battery and replace it if needed, it's not built in. Camera taken clean pictures and has different modes allowing you to take cool pictures and videos. Also when you download other apps (non google) they don't crash your phone system or freeze it.

S3 was impossible to put a screen protector on before it would start peeling. Using tech armor clear HD on my S4 currently which looks and feels good. no peeling.- battery life about the same, but I go for the extended battery. any company should be about the same but i've had Onite for 1+ yrs now and that is solid. realize though extended battery will at least double the weight and make the back thicker. it does last easily 24hrs even with heavy usage. NFC remains in the battery and remains kinda useless.- S4 rim is flatter compared to the tapered rim of the S3. i find the S4 easier to hold. I would get a rim case or bumper case at least though as it is super easy to drop both phones.- S4 reception seems slightly better in fact in my area which gets poor verizon reception (yeah i know, they actually have areas of bad reception)- camera is sharp and fast. about the same for both.- S4 has 4.2.2 while S3 has 4.1.2 android. I find the 4.2.2 a slightly better OS but both are solid. noticeable differences are that 4.2.2 shows all connectivity on the top bar (wifi and 4g together), the samsung keyboard has numbers at the top line so you don't have to change keyboard template or hold down keys to enter numbers. (note both are getting upgraded to 4.3 in Oct it sounds like. very cool.)- voice and audio about the same for both. people seem to hear me just fine and i hear them just fine.- note the S4 gets really hot against the ear, more than the S3. this is kinda annoying but i use bluetooth headsets a lot.- both are snappy and responsive.-----In the end, since both are getting Android 4.3 soon, either is fine to have and an awesome phone, but the S4 having a flat screen to allow screen protectors is pretty huge for me as i put my phone thru a lot of abuse.

I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS EVERY TIME I LOOK AT MY PHONE!  I could not get rid of it so I was on the phone with Samsung for over 40 minutes before they were finally able to get rid of it from my screen.  That does not include the time I spent trying to fix it on my own, searching Android forums and Google, so this issue probably wasted about 90 minutes of my life that I cannot get back.UPDATE:Okay, that problem was finally solved and I figured out how to solve it for the future.  The Music app automatically places a widget on the Lock screen each time you use it.  To remove it I have found that you can clear the cache for that app and then it goes away.  As it turns out it's actually not a bad feature when listening to music as it allows you to control the music without unlocking the phone, but I wish Samsung would make it clear how to remove it if you don't want to see it.  Still, 90 minutes of time lost does not make me happy, but it's not as bad an idea as I originally thought.However, using the SD card is not as simple as I think it should be.  I spent another hour in a live chat with Samsung trying to find my music to move my music to the SD card.  16GB is not enough for my apps and my music and photos etc, so the SD card slot was a selling point for me.  During the online chat with a Samsung rep, we finally figured out where the photo files are stored and moved them to the SD card, but we could not find my music files.  I know they're on the native memory because you can see it in the settings when you look at the storage usage, but when we tried to find them we could not, even after going through just about every folder on the phone.  During that conversation the rep also told me there is no setting to make the phone automatically store music and photos files etc. on the SD card, \"it's a limitation of the device,\" she said.  In my opinion that's a big failure on Samsung's part.  Moving data files and telling the system where to store them should be an easy task, IMO!  I realize that apps are best left on the native memory, and some simply won't allow you to put them anywhere else, which is why the SD Card slot was one of the selling points for me.  However, if I can't make use of it, it's pointless, and it amounts to false advertising IMO.So, even though I finally figured out Music widget issue, the memory card issue is enough for me to leave my rating at 2 stars.  The rep's final suggestion was to take the device to Verizon and see if they could figure it out.  Driving all over town, and wasting time on the phone and in live chat sessions for something as basic as using an SD card is not my idea of a well designed device.  So, unless you have the time and the patience to spend on issues like this, I don't recommend this device.  On the other hand, it does have alot of very nice features that I realyl like.  So, if and when Samsung gets these issues sorted out, and trains their support staff to help people quickly, I might upgrade the rating.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware pressure cracks!", "Author": "Sue Selbie", "ReviewID": "R3LTF2T1359JQ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great phone but breaks really easily - just check out the hundreds, probably thousands of unhappy users around the globe who have had their screens go black for no apparent reason - no drops, bangs mishandling, and been told it is not covered by warranty as it is caused by a pressure crack and the replacement cost is all yours.

I opened the package and was please at first. It looked almost exactly like the full sized S3 in a much smaller shell but once I started comparing it to my wife's phone which is the S3 I found that looks were about all it had in common. Instead of the 8mp camera that my wife's phone has it only has a 5 mp camera. Many of the features that it was advertised as having it simply didn't have. (burst, multi-tasking video and apps at same time etc.) I called Verizon they said that there records don't show that those features are supposed to be on the phone but they gave me Samsung's phone number. When I called them they stated that those features belong on the phone and they didn't know why they weren't.I wouldn't mind those things that much because well frankly \"there's an app for that\" but the problem I have that the hardware just isn't that strong. It lags a bit and the front facing camera is horrible. I think my daughters nintendo ds has a better front facing camera. When compared to it's competitors it's features just don't measure up. The Droid mini has an 8mp camera and the Iphone 5c does too. all it all it was rather disappointing. I think I'm going back to Motorolla to get the android mini.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO MORE APPLE MASS BRAINWASHING MARKETING !", "Author": "MD", "ReviewID": "R1CO3ZAWUB7EEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung S4 and all the recent Android phones are GREAT.

The phone is beautiful and feels great in the hand.  Andriod runs great and Samsung's touch wiz works well.  However, if you purchase this phone you MUST use a case, and not just any case.  Stay away from the Samsung flip cover case that they recommend.  It's useless.  I dropped my phone less than 12 inches onto a tile floor.  I picked it up seeing only a small blemish in the top right corner of the phone.  However, the internal LCD was damaged rendering my phone useless.  I have never owned a phone so fragile.  In fact I have been able to own iphones in the past with no case at all.  I hate otter box cases because of thier ugly looks and bulkyness.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now. But apparently the DHS and FBI just noticed this summer. \u00b5", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too BIG", "Author": "J.
