Talk about fast shipping!The phone is beautiful. I opened the package, popped in a 16GB microSD card and my T-Mobile sim card andeverything worked great.The phone is fast with every application, not a single crash in the few days i've had it running.It comes with 2 batteries, microUSB charger, a screen protector, and a case to protect the sides/rear of thephone, headphones, etc. Tons of extra goodies come with this phone.The camera is great (although I have nothing to compare it to, this is my first \"smart\" phone)Definitely use the screen protector as the screen doesn't appear to be glass.I came very close to buying the \"4S\" version of this phone because it had so many positive reviews... but thenI saw the \"5\" version of this phone and I am VERY glad I got the 4.0\" screen.I seriously love this phone! Grab one before it's too late!!!!", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "A four star phone.", "Author": "dramaqueen17", "ReviewID": "R1GLVF7WO4QV7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is good, but don't be expecting an iphone. For the price, I think this phone does well. It is very light (plastic not metal for the most part). The construction could be a little more solid, but if you don't drop your phone all the time it should be good. Both cameras are decent. It has a good amount of memory and works smoothly. The screen is bright and responsive. I could be happier  with this version of Android OS. My main complaint (I upgraded from 2.3) is that it doesn't seem to have as many options in the settings. I still can't figure out how to make the screen flash when I get a text. I don't know if it doesn't have that feature or if I just can't find it. The charger requires a mini usb so I am able to use my old phone's charger with it which I am happy about. The sound is ok...a little rocky when it's all the way up, but not too bad. I have AT&T; and put my go phone chip in the first slot (there are two) and I haven't noticed any problems with signal. I use the wifi a lot and it works fine. All in all, it is a solid four star phone for me. It's not the best ever, but for this price it's pretty good.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great fone for tmobile prepaid!!!!!!!!!!!!! love it!", "Author": "Chris Swiontek", "ReviewID": "R1QWKD2WM1JUAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great phone fo Tmobile preaid ! im actually writing this review from my laptop teathering of the WIFI hotspot on this fone right now=)  first off:  - its fast! very responcive to touch and feels good in hand {very lightweight too}  - runs 4.1.1. android  actually has enouh system resources to use it ! {nice dual core A9 cpu and a PowerVR SGX531 graphics chipset--which means it can run really highend games and renderings smoothly}  - WILL TAKE UP TO A 32GIG MICRO SD ! {i got one in it now and it works great}  - looks like an iphone 5 ,but just a smidge bigger {1.8mm wider / 2mm longer / 1.2mm  thicker} but  if you put one  side by side with one,they are pretty darn close {the hero actually looks better}  -COMES WITH A NICE CLEAR HAD SELL CASE included!  - GREAT battery life {bout 9hrs  constant talktime and heavy use /wifi gps/ect..and DAYS OF STANDBUY}  [ TO increase battery life to this level ,i installed SuperBox Pro and got rid of all the; B.S. running in th background]  -Flawless GPS ! [i heard somepeople have issues wit the gps,so heres how to gt it working perfect and fast:  step1:  go to settings /the location settings  step2:  check  \"gps satellites\" , \"GPS EPO ASSISTANCE\" ,and \"A-GPS\" THEN reboot your phone  step3:  turn on your GPS and step out side \"line of site \"to the clear sky and wait bout 5min.  DONE!  the reason for having to do this is that the fone was originally built and tested in CHINA,so the fone has never \"seen\" the locations of the satalites over the U.S.A. ,ITS STIL LOOKING FOR THE ONES OVER CHINA=)  by following steps 1-3 you are teaching the fone where the satalites are located and now will work perfectly in the usa. [and the fone is now  triangulating the locations of usable satalites in real time and will remember them-you only have to do this once]  - ALSO...................this fone comes ROOTED right out of the box!  no need to hack it  - free wifi mobile HOTSPOT!  {im using it now actually}  ifyou actually have a data plan  - speaker isLOUD! [good thing]  and the mike on it is pretty sensitive. calls have good sound quality  -GREAT RECEPTION!  [picked up better signal thn my tmobile G1,and thats saying something]now for the cons: {minor actually,but i do need to mention them}  -hard shell real iphone 5 cases WILL NOT FIT THIS FONE [but it comes with one that does,] ,but quitea few of the silicon ans soft cases DO ,so check around and experament a little  -Removing the back plate to get to the battery and sim is a little tricky the first time until you learn the trick to it, but after that its pretty simple [there is a sticker on the outside of the back plate of the fone fresh outa the box...PAY ATTENTION TO IT! nuff said=)  -beside that ...its a great fone!just buy it,youll love it=)", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Maria Victoria Gomez", "ReviewID": "R2WVPRUXEJJWZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love that it looks exactly like an iPhone but it has Android's latest OS,Ice Cream Sandwich.

If you order from overseas, even though they ship it in a few days it still takes almost a month to make it through customs.Overall a very good deal.
