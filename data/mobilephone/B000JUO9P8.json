The paint is wearing off, the buttons show some wear, and it sure won't pass for a new phone, but it has operated all these years without failing even once. Even the battery is the original. If you want a workhorse phone, and most of the time you just to make phone calls, this will work well. And, it is tiny! You can put several of these in your pocket. (I bought it originally as a prepaid phone and then used it on a regular Tmobile account.)", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Nokia 6030 TMO to Go Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41A2657H3YL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000JUO9P8"}}
