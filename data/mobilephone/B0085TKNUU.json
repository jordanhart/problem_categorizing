{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Get it.. you will love it!", "Author": "MV", "ReviewID": "R3MAY2N4AQV3CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Long story short: If you doubt to get this gadget don't do it anymore.Does it work? Yes, and great,I'm 29 years old and I know about technology (different OS versions, sensitivity, resolution etc.). It does fairly everything that you want it to do. So don't worry about it. I used it like agenda/calendar, take notes, record lectures and conferences; take photos or adequate quality for on the go pics (I own a DSLR so it will be ridiculous to try to compare a photo of my camera to any phone or point and shoot camera). I tweet, listen to music and send a lot of mails, photos over the internet and use the browser a lot.Does it work with games? I'm not a gamer, but there are a lot of videos on YouTube about the phone (Star N8000) that claim that it does and well.Material quality: Excellent (there are a couple of newer versions that are made of only plastic, but are solid; this one is metal and plastic).All the things that are advertised on the box works and excellent (Wi-Fi, call-quality, cameras, Bluetooth). Radio FM is advertised to work without earphones and it does but you need them anyway to used them as antenna, so it should actually said it has speaker enable on FM radio (not that it matters a lot to me to use it). The battery does last enough, it's a huge screen so keep that in mind over the use of battery, I can go (without gaming) all day long using it without a problem.Does the size is adequate? Yes, its excellent to read books, browse the web, pictures even Netflix for on the go situations. It fits on the hand very well and in the T-Shirt front pocket. It's thin and light. However if you want a phone that is unnoticed don't choose one. (Those sizes of an iPhone are ridiculous to me if I want it to read).What about the 2nd SIM-Card Slot? I only use one most of the time, but when on call (I'm a medicine resident) I simply put the 2nd one on the slot and works perfect, however if you want to receive calls on both lines forget it, If you are talking on any of the two lines and the other got a call it will sound as busy to the other person.Apps? Its android Ice Cream Sandwich, it's great and lots of apps, I found tons of options on Google play (marketplace)  to solve any idea that I got to use my phone to.So...I used to have a more expensive phone until one got broken and other stolen. This one got everything for a better price. If you don't mind saying you got an hybrid phone (I don't) its perfect, if you mind (no one notice unless you tell them).", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "An OK Phone !", "Author": "Nugejoy \"nugejoy\"", "ReviewID": "R1IYQX37MDZ7DH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Three stars because it took a while to get to me. Don't use express shipping with this one.PROS: Android 4, 1Ghz, responsive, Bright screen, Google android market, comes with usable software/apps. Phone is not too big. Feels solid in the hands.Dual SIM easy to set up ...reception is a little weak but that may be an AT&T; issue.WiFi & Bluetooth works well.Came with an extra battery & car charger.Cons: Poor Battery Life given the size of phone. 2-3 hrs maybe with WiFi/Bluetooth and screen on lowest dim!! A big problem if you need PUSH mail for work. Battery drains quickly...need charger with U most of the time!Guess that's why the extra battery!Speakers are terrible .. need much improvement!

So far so good, installed T Mobile's $50 sim card and everything seems to work just fineAlso, delivery was SUPER fast.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "hhmmm...", "Author": "a.abston", "ReviewID": "R1T0CTF4Y65O58", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "*** UPDATE! I never got internet to work properly. I never was able to send or receive MMS even though I changed the APN as was stated. ALSO, now I am NOT able to call anybody or receive a call. I do not get any service on one side of town (still inside city limits). I was so excited about this phone but after two weeks it is pretty much useless. My bf wanted to buy the same phone but I advised against it. I am waiting to hear back from the seller.I got this phone alot sooner than it was estimated at. I loved it when I saw it. It is huge, twice the size of my galaxy(regular). The screen is rather crisp and clear. It came with the two batteries (neither were charged), a USB charger, and a wall charger. The wall charger is USELESS in the states. It is a foreign charger with two large round prongs instead of the two flat prongs.It was easy to switch over to English although a thing pops up everytime I type asking me what language I want. That is really annoying. Also it highlights everything I type as mispelled when I know its not. (ex. sent text of \"hope you get this\" to bf and it listed all words as wrong). The internet is sssssooooooo slow. I have spent two days trying to download hotmail's app. Still nothing. The battery drains very quickly, but I have been trying to get an app so that part is questionable. The camera is definitely lacking quality. Its not terrible though. I do like that it has the rear and front facing camera. It also has a panaramic (sp?) feature which I like.The first thing I messed with on the phone was the Flashlight feature/app. I love it. My 3y/o goes crazy when I turn it on and off. The radio doesn't work unless you use the earphones that come with it as they have an antennae built in. I was able to get 2 analog tv channels (both religious)on the tv. Alot of people weren't able to use the tv. I doubt I will use it but its neat to know its there. It took me a day or so to realize there was an antennae for the tv in the bottom of the phone. I thought it was a stylus until I pulled it out. It is VERY fragile.I have a sim for Straight Talk in the phone. It shows \"T-Mobile\" as my carrier even though I changed the APN to StraightTalk (that was the EASIEST APN change I have ever dealt with!!!). I don't know how to fix it and am not sure if it's something I did or because of the SIM or what. I'm going to call the company when I finish this.So all-in-all my only issue is the incrediably slow internet speed. Somebody else posted about it on the page of another seller of this phone. She said she had to call t-mobile to get directions for turning on something regaurding the internet. She said that once she did that the internet speed picked up. So hopefully ST will be able to help out on that. My old samsung galaxy was constantly overheating and freezing up. The only way to fix it was to take the battery out. That started happening the first day I got it. I have had this one for 2 days now and have not had any type of issue like that. Fingers crossed.**if anybody can give me some hints/help with this phone please leave me a comment. rudeness will be reported.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Jake93", "ReviewID": "R3QRWE0UA25OGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is an excellent phone everything works great I love the android 4.0 Ice Cream sandwich.

But I am so happy I took the chance and order this. This is a great phone. My phone came with android 4.1.1, very fast response time. Takes no time at all when I swipe from screen to screen.  I have Walmart Family Mobile. This is my first time using a sim card very easy. All I did was buy sim card from walmart and activate on walmart family mobile and put it in the phone. The phone immediatley recoginezed it. It gives you an option to choose what features you want such as voice and data. I always turn my data off when Im using my wifi, so I can save my data for when I need it. I would defintley recommened to purchased a micro Sd card with this phone. It comes with storage but after downloaing 6 apps and some music it was low on memory. One thing I don't like is netflix doesn't work. You can download app but you can't stream. This is known issue with netflix not phone. Netflix only works on some phones samsung galaxy HTC EVO 4g. I love watching movies so I download movie tube and watch alot of movies for free. The battery life is what you would except for a smartphone users who plays games searches web and use gps. My phone fully charged last about 12 hrs with about half that time on standby and the rest using it for searching web and playing games and making calls. The camera on this phone is ok not better than HTC EVO 4g. Camcorder is horrible it alwasys shows dark even with light on. Maybe I have a setting wrong. I haven't had too much time to mess with. But I will update if I can figure that out.This phones includes:* 2 batteries*USb Wall charger ( American outlet order from US Seller)* Usb cable* Phone case for back* Screen protector already installed on phone* Headphones with mic ( they are very uncomfortable, I would recommened Skullcandy)* ManuelAlso I forgot to mentionthis phone has a Flashlight. Speakers are ok not loud enough to play music from too far. wifi Is very good never have issues.If you have any questions about this phone just reply to this post.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice purchase worth the price", "Author": "James Talley", "ReviewID": "R2P5BTV9JU5QX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All aspects are good.
