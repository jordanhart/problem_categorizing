Phone works fine; absolutely no problems at all.I already had a Straight Talk 'dumb' phone. I made the change to theIphone4 online at Straight Talk web-site. In one hour my service wasswitched. For my area, the service is AT&T.;Still in learning curve for the abilities of this phone. It does everythingI need. Certainly would recommend making the change in thisway. The Iphone4 came in its original case with earphones. I purchasedthe Sim card at Walmart. Make sure to use the frame for the Sim Card.If you are not comfortable with the Sim Card, go to your nearest Applestore; they will help you for free.IPhone4 was received in secure package in no time!

No problems porting my phone number and it came with a SIM card, which I had already purchased. Wish I had known it was coming with the SIM card. Anyway. The charging cord was obviously damaged, hard to believe seller didn't know it was broken, and no headphones were sent. Emailed seller, he apologized and said he would send charging cord and headphones. Like I said, it has been 3 weeks, and I have not received them.

It, also, did come with a SIM card for straighttalk, along with a number to call. The ONLY thing was that I did request for was faster shipping and it still took almost 2 weeks to receive - but I can't really complain too much bc it snowed here and the weather may have permitted it later or bc it was being shipped to a PO Box. Anyways, I do love this phone and are very happy, I will buy from you in the future. :)", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "tbre8197", "Author": "tina brewer", "ReviewID": "R1JWKUUNA622WT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone its awesome!! love the pay as you go plans toonly 45$ a month for unlimited deffinetly worth it!I paid 100$ a month through Verizon  Thanks!!!recommend to everyone!!!
