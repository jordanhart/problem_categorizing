I definitely would have liked to know this before I bought a $70 phone that was worth $20.

First of all, the seller Cougarcell sold me a phone stating that it was a Sprint phone. It was not. When I received it I immediately requested a return & refund. The seller then proceeded to argue with me via email about the fact that it was a Sprint phone. I finally had to send them the proof that Sprint phones do not use Sim cards. After 2 days of back and forward emails I receive a return label, return the phone, tracked the return and sent the seller proof of receipt (they received it 2 days after I sent it). I then request a refund. However, After waiting for 6 weeks for the refund and didn't receive it even after sending them the tracking information.  I finally had to contact Amazon for assistance in getting my refund back!Results, I will never purchase anything from Cougarcell ever again, nor can I recommend them to ANYONE!I would suggest to anyone purchasing from any seller other than Amazon themselves that you always return item via a sources that allows you to track your returns on-line, and always keep a copy of that tracking information somewhere you can retrieve it for at least up to 6 weeks after it was sent.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Teresa E.

Since then, the amount of dust that gathers behind the LCD protective lens cover is so great that depending on the angle that light hits it, I can't see my phone. Sprint advises against carrying the phone in a pocket to prevent this issue. Although hyperbolic, it is similar to Ford suggesting not turning your Expedition to keep it from tipping over.Beyond the fact that I can't see the screen during the day when I'm outside, I would say it works pretty well.

I am not mad at that.Now what gets me is the lack of apps! I know apps does not make the phone but COME ON! The most interesting app I have is a lame pinball game that only has 1 level! All my other apps are on ATARI level! You have the iPad that can play graphics that look like you are playing a PS3 game! And I am stuck with ATARI! Sorry, but also the apps are expensive as hell! 7.99 for PACMAN....???....................???? HERP DERP! This sucks!No touch screen.Small buttons.Lame apps.Slow 3g.Ugly interface.The trackpad thing was cool, but now its annoying!Mediocre cameraBattery life sucks.The only good thing about this phone is that its sturdy and can be dropped like hell and nothing happens!
