Since a lot of time I was willing a phone that I could put 2 or more simcards for differents carriers and this phone according to the descripcion was a great: wifi, TV, triple sim. I started open the box take out the battery from the bag, grab the simcards I have and place it on the phone. GREAT!!!! It worked for all three carriers and they were working smooth...Now it came the nightmare, battery dried and when I was going to look for the charger, it was missing the cable. I was only able to use the phone for a few hours, no other charger have been able to make the phone charge even if I let the phone charging all day/night long and I tried with three different charger.Now I realized from the one I have tried they were loose from the usb port charge, and tried with another that was a little bit longer than the others, and voil\u00e1, it started to charge. That's why I am giving 4 star, it will be 5 stars if the phone could be charged using different usb chargers.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for temporary Very bad for permanent", "Author": "TH", "ReviewID": "R2L9P7SA71JO3Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had never seen this phone before buying it, in fact I had never even heard of a phone brand called Blu. What made me interested was that I was trying to get my hands on an unlocked phone so I could switch to a different mobile network with a cheaper plan that fit my budget and this seemed, from its appearance, like a decent phone. I also saw the exact same thing on walmart.com for a slightly higher price so I was excited to find it on amazon for lower.Now the phone is quite light, actually lighter than my previous \"unsmart\" phone. It came with all necessary accessories (of cousre u have to buy your own memory card..duh).My beef with this phone is that its battery doesn't seem to be very strong, at least by today's standards. It seems like I lose 2 bars a day just by having the phone on and texting (not browsing internet or playing games, etc). I usually have to recharge it every evening. My old phone did not run down that quick and I had it for about 3 years.Next is that its software or operating system or whatever is quite \"primitive\", like getting from home page to wherever u want like alarm clock or calendar etc is a kind of a small journey. Also, u cannot select and delete multiple text messages at a time. There are probably some other things people will find beef with but I'm not that much of a nit picker.I've only had it for a little over a month and it is not bad.Bottom line, I believe it is good choice if u are looking for an unlocked phone to serve u temporarily but I'm pretty sure it would be a disaster to get it as something permanent for yourself.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable delivery time!", "Author": "A Lee", "ReviewID": "R34ILTYPDAGZ92", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We received our phones less than 24 hours after ordering.
