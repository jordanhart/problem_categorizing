{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "J Michael", "ReviewID": "R42RU0DPRTMOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone.  It has so many features to it that normally would have cost me much more on newer phones.  I've always loved the motorola brand.  Samsung is not too bad...LG just plain sucks.  Every LG phone I had (when with Verizon) would randomly turn off on its own after having it for 6 months or so.  This phone has a large screen, a front camera, and the battery seems to last pretty well for me.  The only time I notice it drain is if I am playing a game such as Wordfeud.  I do have a few complaints, which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  For one, it is not a phone from the USA.  The charger is a thick 3 prong adapter.  However, it does come with an attachment so you can use the charger in the wall.  Also, I already have plenty of phone chargers that fit from my previous phones and my Kindles.  I use the one with the attachment for the dock.  Yep, thats right; they give you a dock which is pretty cool.  I leave that one by my bedside to charge at night.  The dock is supposed to plug into other devices, but I haven't had a need for that yet so I cannot judge how well it works.  My other complaint, and this is a big one, is I was limited on which service I could use (even with the phone being unlocked).  Verizon won't take it and ATT (which is where this type of phone originates) told me I couldn't do the prepay with a 4G unless it was talk and text.  I would have to do a plan for the data.  It was going to be close to $90 a month.  That is not what I wanted to pay on a prepay.  I reluctantly went with T-Mobile.  Because this is not a T-Mobile phone, I don't get 4G right now.  I was told by the sales guy this should change by the end of the year when T-Mobile adds towers to their service.  It does run a little slow when I'm out.  I usually connect it to my wireless at home, though, and it's really fast.  Also, I have lost service in some spots and didn't have any service in the ER one night.  This would have never happened with Verizon.  It is a pain, and hopefully this will change once T-Mobile adds towers, but overall I am really happy.  I pay $50 a month to have EVERYTHING on my phone.  My husband will go with the $30 a month plan since he never talks on the phone.  $80 a month for 2 phones with everything is quite a deal if you ask me!  I will just have to deal with the little inconveniences.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "product failure", "Author": "destiny", "ReviewID": "R3KFWLSHRSEJFB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product came with many problems and even tho it said unlocked it still came locked very disappointed purchase at your own risk", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy from a dealer named BREED", "Author": "V. Burnsed", "ReviewID": "R1RADKL7LZO59X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is great. The dealer I bought from not so great.  When I bought this phone for my daughter for her birthday recently, she was very excited with all it's features. However, the charging cord for the HDMI dock was damamged upon arrival, and when I complained to BREED, he first sent the wrong charger cord, then when I contacted BREED about the incorrect charger, he then claimed he never sold me the dock to start with.  My only option was to return the phone, insured, and wait several weks for reimbursement.  As the replacement charger was less than $10, I chose to replace the cord myself, rather than deal with all the hassle, as I'm sure BREED was counting on.  DO NOT BUY FROM dealer BREED.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone but old", "Author": "Christian", "ReviewID": "R3K1DFW5CTML4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone for a great price, but at the end you will feel like its really old because it only gets as good as gingerbread...", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery did not fit phone properly.", "Author": "Robert J Mejias", "ReviewID": "R1LD1YH82DP637", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Battery does not fit phone properly, due not want to jam battery in back of smartphone.Will return everything ordered with this device.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great price and product , got my monies worth and have", "Author": "abel", "ReviewID": "R1PWQH1N4ODMSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "is agreat price and product and uniquegot my monies worth and  ,have no complaints or second toughts ,works great , except the battery which has to do nothing with the phone", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it !", "Author": "younes", "ReviewID": "RCG7TSN0JD0GX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gosh, I received a beautiful package.

We couldn't believe at how much accessories were included. There were so many plugs/connections/USB that came in the package. We think this might be due to the different ports and outlets used if you are in another country outside the US. Though this phone is 3G, it does the job---connection can sometimes be fast and other times a little slow. Picture quality looks blurry at first soon after taking it, but is clear and decent when going back to view the picture. We haven't figured out how to download pictures yet, but the manual has good info about certain step-by-step directions for a lot of things about he phone.
