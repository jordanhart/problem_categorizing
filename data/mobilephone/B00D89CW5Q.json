Android version 4.1.2 and has not been upgraded from the manufacture, but it does run everything I want so it is acceptable.  I need a dual SIM phone to separate my home/personal use from work, and this fits the bill. Internal storage is small, but I understand the cost of the phone, so I can tolerate that.  I am not a gamer and only use it for calls, tasks, IM and email and some social networking.  Only 3G so it is not as fast as some phones.  I live in the mid-west of the United States on the T-Mobile system and reception is as good as other phones I have had.  I do like this phone, small and easy to use.  I would recommend this phone to others who just need a simple smart phone. I am sure my teenager would need/want a more powerful device, but this one fits my needs.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Stndard, nothing outside of this world", "Author": "Hugo G.
