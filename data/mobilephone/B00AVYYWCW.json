After 2 years, he's worn the letters off the buttons, beaten the poor phone within an inch of any device's tolerance, and it still works.  It does glitch a bit (it doesn't always ring when he has a call or message), but considering how hard he's been on it, I think this is a very good buy.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I adored this phone", "Author": "GoAskAlice777", "ReviewID": "R1NIC7BI3FC719", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG Neon 2 (GW370) is an amazing phone if you're looking for a phone that isn't a smartphone. I, personally love that it is a slide QWERTY keyboard. I love the minimal amount you have for a touchscreen. I bought a microSD card for it so I store hundreds of songs on it and it plays them beautifully. It has it's quirks here and there, sometimes it'll switch my message tone back to the original selection (no biggie, I just switch it back), and sometimes it can be a little slow. But, for someone who doesn't like smartphones and just wants a phone for calling, texting, and listening to music, then this is a perfect phone for you. I had it for 2 years, I knocked it off furniture, dropped it a hundred+ times, the screen has never broke and it's never faltered.......until I just recently dropped it to it's watery grave (there was really no coming back for it). I am so going to miss this phone, it's fantastic battery life, it's keyboard, and all it's other features I have become so comfortable with. Whether or not I'll buy the same one is still up for debate, for me it might be time for a change.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Working well!", "Author": "NDT", "ReviewID": "R2LC4APKIBMW5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is smaller than expected and the battery back plate was black and instead of red as it was displayed and should have been.  However it wasn't a big issue.  The joystick is difficult to maneuver and some button placements aren't ideal.  It's working well however, and it sufficient for someone who likes qwerty keyboard for texting and a basic-non internet user.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked for 6 weeks then died", "Author": "gallett \"gallett729\"", "ReviewID": "R1YFTK3S4VHPWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter got this phone for a Christmas gift - here we are in early February and it has already died.
