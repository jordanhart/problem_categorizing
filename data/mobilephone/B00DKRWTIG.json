I did not know how to hook up an unlocked phone so i took it to Walmart and they did every thing for me. The phone works grate 3g is just as good as my last phone the HTC one. This phone is super fast I have had it for several days now and not had any issues other then normal issues of getting use to a new phone. The phone came with a 3200 mha battery and it lasts 3 or 4 days depending on how much i use the phone and they sent an extra battery two so if I have both battery charged I could go a week with out plunging it in. p.s. I got Walmart family talk plan works grate with the phone. I think it goes with out saying that the screen is huge it still fits in my pock though even with tight gens on, i am a big guy though so plan accordingly. I would highly recommend buying a generic phone they have more bang for your buck, to get a brand name phone with the same specs as this one wold be double or triple the price, I am actually looking for one for my wife now.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's Great", "Author": "Casca Adjepong", "ReviewID": "R1VE71PV5HGZQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is very fast and works great.

The good thing about a gadget shipped from a Chinese vendor is that it's possible to receive a phone that has a relative newer update of the OS than that advertised. For example, the one that I bought from lolbuy came with Jelly Bean 4.2.1, instead of the 4.1.2 in the description (btw, 4.1.2 is not Froyo, it's JB). Guess what, I confirmed my order with Amazon on Oct 17, and both the kernel & build number of the software were dated Oct 14... fresh from the oven, eh? The bad thing could be that you might want to return the item the same day you got it.48 hours into owning this phone:1. the speaker volume is OK, after adjusting the max value using the engineer mode;2. the gps acquires a lock in a matter of 15~30 seconds, depending whether I am outdoor or in my living room. The sensitivity is pretty amazing;3. I have rooted this device successfully using PDANet and a suitable driver;4. both the headset and the mic seem to work well without statics;5. antutu tests produce a score of 13,564 on stock rom, not the best of of its kind, but it's something I can live with;6. FM radio functions properly when the earphone is plugged in;7. most of my 1080p avi/divx/mp4/x264 clips, except some vc1 ones, play smoothly with vibrant colors without jitters or out of sync;8. the calibration app for the G-sensor on-board seems to work somehow;9. another app for calibrating the distance sensor also seems to interact with the relevant hardware attached, but I'm still fumbling with it;10. my 2 T-MO sim cards proved to be an easy plug-n-play for voice & text. I'm not into 3G, and I can't test it with T-Mo in my area anyway given the 850/2100MHZ bands.I suppose there must be tens of thousand of such generic MTK6589 phones in the market under a myriad of house brands, many of which were manufactured using similar or standard layouts and without stringent quality control. The first few batches may very well be infested with speaker/gps/reception issues like those you find on various forums or here at Amazon. I'm just glad that I picked the right seller, which perhaps happens to carry an improved/updated version of the phone.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "you get what you paid for", "Author": "Michael Thai", "ReviewID": "R3B1VXJC6CBMXP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this phone because of all the great reviews and it was priced good for me.Seller:I ordered this phone on October 2nd but it took this seller a complete week to start the shipping process.  It was not ship but just entered into the system a week after I order and paid for the item, then it took another 2 weeks to get to me.  I understand when shipping from over seas, it may take a while but to start the shipping process a week after the order was place was just bad business.Phone:The good:The phone looks great and feels pretty light in my hand.  I actually would like it a little bit heavier but it ok.  Touch screen is relatively responsive and with minimal lag.  I love the large screen and can't really go back to those 4\" and 4.5\" I used to carry around.  The cpu on this phone is about the same as a Samsung galaxy s or s2, so decent processing power.  The gpu has a little lag on some games but is still good.  I have tried many apps on this phone and all seems to work fine.The bad:Sound is very low for a phone this size.  I can not hear my calls when in a room full of people or just going through the supermarket.  When I play a movie or watch youtube, the sound is set to the loudest but still I have to keep the phone pretty close to me to hear it well.  Basically, sound seems to come of one small speaker on the back that is very weak.Radio on this phone is very bad.  I tried it with both AT&T; and T-Mobile but both has a lot of static.  I'm also not getting full 3g with any of the bands even though it's advertise as 3g.I have had the phone for only a few days now so I don't have the final results but call quality is the one thing that needs to be address on this phone.  One more thing, this phone DOESN'T have 8g as advertised but only 6g. I'm debating on if I should return the phone or not.***UPDATE****The phone's usb charger connector is bad after a few months.  It has to be placed a certain way for it to charge, bad connector.  The 8G ADVERTISED ROM.. is useless.  ROM stands for \"read only memory\", which means you can NOT write to it.  The only memory you can write to is the 1G RAM, which is shared by the os.  Now, with the installed micro sd card, I get an error that it can not install apps to default location.  That can be resolved by changing the location to \"let android chooses\".  It will install to 1g and fill up fast.  I would have to go back in and move all installed apps to ext. micro sd card.  pain in the as$.I'm giving it 2 stars because of the bad usb connector and can not install error after only a few months of used, plus useless advertised ROM but I can managed with the installed micro sd card but it's a pretty good clone if you take away the defects I just mentioned.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reminds me of the treo series before android", "Author": "tremine", "ReviewID": "R1V5CNOJ4DXTYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone for the buck, just buy the cover and new battery and say forget buying another phone from the mainstream market.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "How could you be disappointed?", "Author": "A.

Basically t-mobile is trying to increase phone sales but is instead sealing their own fate.  Now with net10 I get blazing speeds and coverage everywhere.  The screen is larger and nicer than the Note 2 I broke and got this to replace.  Seriously only $200 how can you go wrong?  There is not even a reason to root it that I can find.You want a con?OK, the camera isn't super and when I saved apps to SD card they kept getting deleted.  Maybe it was the SD card, but saving them to the phone solved the problem.  Also I use swype and everytime I reboot the default keyboard gets reset.
