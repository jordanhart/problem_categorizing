Don't hesitate .  If you are looking for a good carry phone that is solid , has good voice quality , takes pictures fairly well , and will hold a couple of mp3 tunes this could be the one for you. This is not a champion multi-media phone but it will handle your light work. It is solidly constructed and I actually liked the rubber finish. It's an older model so the U.I. is a bit dated don't let that scare you. If you just need a basic phone that has a few tricks up it's sleeve you may just get a Pebl for your thoughts.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002WQN9NA"}}
