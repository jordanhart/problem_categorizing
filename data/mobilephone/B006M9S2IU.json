{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!! They STOLE my money!!!", "Author": "Tavo", "ReviewID": "RVDIQ9IWG7VBK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Blackberry thinking that it was 4G phone as it was advertised in the product description when I bought it and until about a week ago. The description used to say \"BLACKBERRY TORCH 9810 WHITE UNLOCKED GSM 4G WORLD PHONE WITH 3G BANDS 1,2,5&6, and now they changed it for \"BLACKBERRY TORCH 9810 WHITE WIFI UNLOCKED GSM QUADBAND 3G CELL PHONE\". I guess they changed because they realized their mistake... Still, they refuse to return my money back which I think is a FRAUD.After I got the phone and used it for less than 2 weeks, I noticed that it was even slower than my former 3G BB so I took it to my phone provider to check what was going on and they told me that the problem was that my new Blackberry was 3G not  4G as advertised. When I wrote to the seller saying that this wasn't the product I was expecting and I wanted to return it, they say:\"Depending on which carrier you are using it with will determine what speed you can get and if 4g is available but I have gone ahead and authorized your return request so you can send it back to us\"I was happy that at least I will get my money back. But a couple of weeks after I returned the item, they wrote me an email saying that they will only refund $169.84 for the Blackberry I returned, even though I paid $287.99!!!!! This means they are taking $118.15  from me! And they don't recognize that it was their responsibility to have advertised the product mistakenly.I have called the seller 6 times and talked to different people from the Department of Returns and Costumer Services, and they always find that \"I'm right\", but \"they don't have the 'authority' to give my money back\". The last time I called, the agent run out of arguments and told me he will transfer me to his supervisor, which it turned out to be a voice mail... unacceptable!! They always say that the person in charge will call me back and he never did.This whole process has been absolutely annoying and time-consuming, I felt absolutely cheated and nobody in the company was willing to take responsibility of their mistake (MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT and then MY MONEY STOLEN). I would never ever will buy from this seller again. After all... I guess it is time to change to an Apple device, where they do care for the costumer satisfaction.I will also fill out a consumer complaint with the Directory of State and Local Consumer Agencies and will see what happens... I really hope that the seller will call me back, recognize their error and return the rest of my money.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Carlos Varela", "Author": "Carlos Javier Varela", "ReviewID": "R3VMT9UAU1ZO46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente equipo la compra fue exitosa muy responsable el articulo llego a la fecha indicada lo recomiendo para futuras compras", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "i like it", "Author": "ikem obi", "ReviewID": "RY5B3L55N0XWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my write upon this phone , was in error so the phone was what the sale describe is what I get, the phone work so good.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfect phone", "Author": "Bernadine Atwell", "ReviewID": "R1C63A4UH37L3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It completes me!
