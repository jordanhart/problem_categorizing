{"Reviews": [{"Title": "hard use in Alaskan Boonies", "Author": "Esquimaux", "ReviewID": "R2P92G8W7B31M1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We live a hard life in the boonies of northern Alaska and a Sat phone is a must have especially in the winter time when it can get to -80 degrees and you are relying almost completely on your vehicle and the small amount of gear you can carry.  We purchased this phone as soon as it was available on the market so it has seen a few years of use.  The size is very good and is easy to carry on your person without too much discomfort.  It will work in very cold weather as long as you pack it insulated or near your body.  In winter we store it on our person under our gear in a soft waterproof case, in the warm months we store it in our back pack in a waterproof and shatterproof case.  The battery lasts a very long time and we never had problems with it though after a few years it holds a charge for less time then it did new, we are finally buying a replacement now. Extra batteries are fairly cheap at about 25$ a pop.  Don't lose the charger plug in as they can cost over a hundred bucks.  We also charge the phone on our goal zero solar power set up when we are out and it works great.  It is very important that you understand and have reliable phone service basics besides the phone itself, and it's pretty much your choice like regular phone services.  We found a company out of Florida that are amazing and very helpful.  We re-charge our minutes every six months for around $250, which gives us enough minutes to use for check ins and for emergencies.  The service also lets us make emergency calls even without minutes which is awesome.  You can also send text messages to this phone via the internet which has been very helpful.  It's easy to use and is intuitively set up, but you will need to read the owners manual.  We did have a person use the phone and then for some reason tried to twist the antennae to store it.  It cost us a pretty penny to have it fixed, but tons less then buying another phone.  The antennae is the only weak spot we can see in the design of this phone.  This phone has saved us and family countless times.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Jpurdywy", "ReviewID": "R3ICWJ5QOMZ7KY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the Iridium 9555. The phone was delivered on time and was in perfect shape. Everything needed to get up and running . Two antennas ,a soft case, 12 volt charger and a wall charger with adapters for all outlets. The SIM card was furnished as well. A very professional product! Works good and is built to last a long time.

I have actually never used it so I don't know if it works or not because I have spent the last freaking 10 days  trying to figure out how to use it!  This is NOT for the person who thinks, \"I'll buy a satellite phone, turn it on, and talk to anyone I want to,from almost anywhere\".  The fact is that when you get the phone, having spent well over $1,000, it won't do anything at all.  You go outside, turn it on, wait a few minutes and it says \"Insert SIM card\".  I had done that.  Removing, re-inserting, cleaning connections, etc. still result in the messages \"SIM card not found\" or \"Insert SIM card\".  There are no instructions on how to get service or make a call, or what the phone number is.  Nothing except technical details about the phone and how to use the setup menu and voicemail that WON\"T WORK because the SIM card won't work. That began my ordeal, writing to Iridium for help. Frequent emails to iridium elicited no reponse. I wrote and asked, \"My phone says \"Insert SIM card, but I have inserted the SIM card. What's wrong?\" \"Do I have a phone number?\", \"How to I set up an account to pay for service?' \"Is it billed monthly, like my regular phone service?\".  With no responses, I tried to go on line to their website and to user blogs for my answers. Nothing!  So I registered for a new SIM card, figuring that when I get it I can plug it in and see what happens. It's only $60 or so, and it may save me many more hours of hassle. It hasn't come in yet. There is virtually no information on line as to how to actually USE the phone. They will not provide a phone number to call. Is that crazy, or what? For a phone service company to REFUSE to let you reach them by phone??!!  FINALLY, after a week of emails, I got an email asking me to rate their customer service!  I rated it accurately and guess what? They called the next day. It was hard to hear the person who called. They could barely be heard, spoke in a strong foreign accent, and there were many other voices in the background. Obviously a low-rent call center. I was told I had to go on line and buy a service. I said I had just done so. She said that won't work because you bought a re-load for a working SIM card and you don't have a working SIM card. She suggested the $400 one. But, she added, \"Be sure that anyone you might want to call tells their phone company to allow satellite calls. Many won't allow them\". I said, \"In an emergency, how do I know I can get a call to the right place?\". She didn't have an answer for me.  I asked, \"Do I, or will I, have a phone number for this phone?  She said, \"You'll get that when you get your new SIM card. I went on line and ordered the $400 SIM card today. I entered all the info. It asked for shipping address, credit card info, and credit card billing address. I entered it all and hit \"send\". It went.  But at the top of the page appeared a new message. It said, \"We can't send the SIM card to an address different than the billing address. Please go back and change your payment method\".  You guessed it...you can't \"go back\".  I have, once again sent a service request telling them that the new $400 SIM card must be sent to my condo address (where I am) and not 2,000 miles away to my home address, where I am not.  Since they are only open 9-5, 5 days a week, and closed holidays, they won't get it until tomorrow.  If I ever do get the new SIM card, I will, once again, go outside where there is a clear view of the sky, get out my User's Manual, and try again. I now have $1500 invested and don't know if I could ever get my money back, so I'll keep trying to make this work. If it works, I'll let you know by amending this review. But I would NEVER go through this again.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satellite Phone", "Author": "A.

Many of the new batteries are slightly warped so that the battery doesn't actually make contact with the corresponding points on the phone. This means that not only will the phone not charge but it will also not even turn on.You could try to push the battery in to make contact but this is hardly a solution. We have 6 of these handsets and only 4 of them actually work.We now have to send them back to the supplier and hope that they will return in working order.Don't buy these unless they have been tested prior to shipping.Sort out your problems Iridium!!!!Here is the only article I could find that addresses this issue:(...)", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Invaluable!!!!", "Author": "Frank Tillman", "ReviewID": "R38AICAU8CSF2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you sail the oceans and do so w/o this device you are a fool.If you live on a planet that is very likely to experience the greatest upheaval in it's history an do NOT have this you are a fool.I have been a lot of places Nepal, Antarctica, North Pole, South Pole, Straights of Malacca, Bering Sea, even in a submarine (Marianas Trench) and it has NEVER failed!I suspect it would work on the International Space Station.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gift from me to Disaster Rescue Team", "Author": "Richard E.
