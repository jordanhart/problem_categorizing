That is extrememy Inconvenient and annoying. There are other Problems as well. Charging the phone takes forever. Some of the applications download slowly. To improve battery life one has to invest in another bulky battery . It just runs like a sick little phone. I should have known it was too good to be true to get a brand new phone with all these features at such a low price. I don't know Why they continue to sell this device.

It is her fist smartphone with data. the screen is huge for great display. when she first got it it was so fast. I do like how you can download diff themes for the phone and the sms. it is very \"personalize-able\". if you stay on the internet or just the phone itself alot the phone will perform excellence. I keep a car charger and just automatically plug it up when I get in the car. It has  a lot of memory and is very easy to use and understand. overall i love it.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "This phone is the worse phone i've ever had", "Author": "bg callahan", "ReviewID": "R2LILYINY59XWE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i have had many phones and this phone overall sucks.
