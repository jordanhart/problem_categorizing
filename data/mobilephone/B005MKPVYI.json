I bought it knowing it would upgrade to ICS Android 4 and it did so and works great. The screen is so bright that it drains the battery pretty fast so what I do it lower it so that the battery life is extended. The screen is still very vivid but phone battery last me for 3 days with normal phone use and not much internet usage.Its very easy to set up and use and I would recommend to some with very small hands. My hands are on the smaller side and I can't even use the qwerty keyboard in portrait mode. So then I am stuck using it in landscape mode, and T9 with phone pad in portrait. But really that's my only complaint.I use the hotspot option from time to time and it really takes a toll on the battery but I suppose that is to be expected.Oh! come to think of it I have a couple weird things that happen at random times but I am not sure why. One is that I would be replying to a message and then when I look at my screen there is nothing typing. I would have to come out and the message and then return and it would work.The other things is about 5 times since I got the phone in March, it has told me that I need to insert a sim card when I already had in a sim card. Restarting my phone is the only way to fix this. But as it doesn't happen often I don't consider it a big deal. However when it does happen it is very annoying.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love sony ericsson", "Author": "Celina", "ReviewID": "RHHZ4PTM242AZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great.
