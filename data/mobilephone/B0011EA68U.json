Kelly", "ReviewID": "R3AV8W1HQOXNL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was contemplating buying the Nokia N95 8G, but when I saw the specs for this phone I changed my mind - mainly due to the use of microsdhc memory cards on the N82.  Although the phone only shipped with a 2G card, I theoretically could expand up to 8G at the present time, and possibly higher when flash memory is developed further.I guess the phone doesn't look all that interesting - silver on silver, candybar style, average size screen - but at the same time it certainly isn't an eyesore.  Go to Nokia for the full specs, but I thought I'd mention a few things I've found handy over other phones of the same ilk.1.  Sliding lens cover protection.2.  GPS, with added voice nagivation.  Voice does come at a price, but in the scheme of things it's negligible.  I'm not sure text-to-speech is available for this model, and I haven't been able to download it as yet.3.  Having the speakers on one side makes it easier to listen to music or videos - although it should be noted this phone will not stand up on its own, it needs something to rest on.4.  3.5mm generic headphone jack on top of unit.5.  Music sounds great through headphones, car cassette etc.  A nice touch is that if you happen to be playing music in the car through, say, a cassette adapter and the phone rings, you can answer the call using the car's sound system, hang up, and the music will resume, gradually increasing to previous volume - nice touch.6.  Excellent 5mp camera with Xenon flash, plus front vga camera for self-portraits etc.  Of course there's the usual slideshow functions, zooming, emailing.7.  3G networking.I guess the only real glitch I've experienced thus far (only had phone for 5 days) is getting my iTunes ACC encoded songs onto MusicPlayer.If you use the PC Suite software that comes on CD, you'll need to download WMP 11, as there's an issue with protected files.  To do this you'll also have to download Microsoft's Genuine Advantage Support (WGA) -which I wasn't that keen on.The way around this problem is quite simple.  Instead of using PC Suite when loading songs, use Data Transfer.  No probs with protection, WGA etc. Music goes on seamlessly and sounds great.If I feel the need to add anything further on the N82, I'll update at a later time.  All in all, I think one of the best phones of its type on the market today.", "Date": "December 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Caution:  no US 3G on this phone", "Author": "Debt Free \"Eric\"", "ReviewID": "R1EIKU2EXAEBGU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was minutes away from ordering this phone on Amazon.  It looks amazing.  Trouble is, it does not have the proper 3G antennas for United States 3G (AT&T;).  So you will only get EDGE speeds unless you are out of the US (Europe, etc).  Everything else on the phone will work just fine, but 3G will not.Just a heads up if you missed the mention of no USA 3G in the description.  I just got the N95-4 instead so I could have 3G.  The camera on the N82 is much better, but I can't stand EDGE data.  Too slow.

It replaced a SE K790a. The above mentioned features work well and I've never been able to fill my installed 8GB SD micro SDHC card. Initially I was concerned when it turns out some of my favorite programming is transmitted over the internet using the Microsoft WMA format which symbian doesn't support, however, I was able to work around this using my home Sling Player AV and installing Sling Player Mobile on my Nokia N82. Now through T-Mobile internet I listen to and watch a variety of cable programming worldwide which is coming off my home's Verizon FIOS box. I also get Shoutcast internet audio programming directly off internet websites through T-Mobile internet and this, of course, works flawlessly and most efficiently. It would be nice if more internet broadcasters adopted this format. Overall its hard to beat this phone.

This is by far the best one for me.  The biggest difference between the N95 8GB and the N82 is that mine(N82) is equipped with the Xenon Flash, while the N95 8GB has LED, which is far dimmer, but can be used at night for video, which my bulb can't.  To keep it short, if you won't let go of your Navigation device in your car or your iPod, or would rather use many devices instead of one, then this product is not for you.  Here is a short list of what I HAVE ACTUALLY DONE WITH THIS PHONE.1. Free Nokia Maps App with A-GPS (radio towers and GPS to lock on location within 10 seconds, tops)2. Superb music and video app, standard size headset jack, my iPod headset sounds great on this phone3. Best pictures ever, best video(30fps), and TV-OUT!  Watch movies, recorded clips on my big screen!4. N-Gage gaming platform!  I have been playing various games against other people across the globe.5. Battery lasts two days with heavy use, right now it's playing Newsweek Podcast downloaded over WiFi.6. Youtube in the browser, not on a separate app like the iPhone.  This is a Real Browser!7. Post directly to Flickr.  No special address to send to, just take the pic, choose post to web, select Flickr.8. It geo-tags for me, when the pic is taken.Best phone for me, but not for everyone else.  I did a lot of research before buying.

It was part of a contract deal so I got it for alot cheaper than the ones here at Amazon.com. It came in a very cool box and the package includes an USB cable, an AV output cable (to be able to watch your self made phone videos on a TV screen is just amazing, and the image quality was great during my test runs), a pair of earphones, a 2 GB micro-SD card, an adapter for the SD card, a charger, a DVD containing Nokia's own PC suite, the manual and, of course, the phone itself. There are two colors for this phone as far as I know, silver and black, and I got the black one. It looks really sleek and cool, much like the Iphone, and I love how it feels in my hands.It's got great software, great multimedia capabilities and a great camera too. Nokia designed this phone to be a great photography phone and it shows. The five megapixel camera has a state of the art Xenon flash and Carl Xeiss lenses. It's practically unheard of in the mobile world. This phone has camera features that are second to none.And the amazing thing is that it has almost all of N95's features (save maybe the extensive video playback capabilities and a few others), making this phone one of the best smartphones out there now. I'm already loving how I'm able to do video presentations using my AV output cable (I'm studying Mass Communication). It's small things like that that make N82 such a great package.But it isn't without it's faults though. Sometimes I wish everything were a little more accessible; the camera controls are great and the camera is easily accessible, but access to features like music playback is cumbersome and tedious. I had to press upwards of about five buttons to play the songs I wanted. A letdown. Also, there's no touch screen or QWERTY keyboard, it's pretty much a conventional mobile phone even with the sleek feel, so if you're jonesing for a touch screen or a Blackberry style keypad you might want to look for something else.But, it isn't anything to shout about. If you're looking for a smartphone to replace your bug riddled Iphone, look no farther, the N82 will satisfy your tech hunger; everything about the phone screams next-gen.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nokia N82 silver", "Author": "S.

Wu", "ReviewID": "R1HV9DX7D8C11S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nokia n82 for 3 month. This phone is an all-in-one feature phone.1.The basic recieving and talking functions are good. I have used many Nokia phones. They all have good recieving ability.2.Build-in GPS is a nice feature. When I travel by car, n82 becomes a navigator (I installed Route 66). One thing mentioned by other reviewers is that the small screen issue. So I mainly listen to the sound instructions and just take a glance on screen when navigating. It works well for me this way. Also, I use Nokia Map as an electronic map, the map is free, good in details and can be updated.3.The camera and vedio is great. The lens is a Carl Zeiss authorized lens. The photograph has well balanced color, sharp and nice contrast. The N82 white balance is accurate which I think a good camera should have. The Xenon flashlight is great for dim environment, much better than LED flashlight like my previous 6682. I have Canon DSLR but still love to use n82 as a carry-on camera.4.The multimedia is nice. I listen music a lot--MP3 and radio. The sound of n82 is equal to iriver mp3 player when I use Sennheiser CX300 earphones. Besides, you can adjust EQ of N82. The podcast is the other good stuff. I can download podcast episodes via wi-fi and listen whenever I want. Its sound may not as good as N81, but impress me as a smartphone does.5. Bluetooth function is important to me because I use bluetooth headset. It pairs well with plantronics 510 and nokia BH-211. No dropping happen until now. I am satisfied with it.All in all, N82 is a good smartphone with many functions. I am very satisfied with it.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not as good as one would think it could be", "Author": "Pavel Kuksa", "ReviewID": "RFOAYQX1J63PF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There few main drawbacks that really should not be there:1. the battery is really weak: the phone runs out of charge in less than 48 hours withvery moderate usage (no internet, no camera, etc, only talk 15-20 min a day)2. there are very obvious bugs: Gallery application doesn't work at times (just displays 'no images or videos found'). It seems to have problems reading directories with images or videos both in phone memory and on the memory card.3. GPS application (Nokia maps) seems to have problems locating/finding maps, as a result I would have no maps displayed when I need them the most (i.e. when travel and no Internet)4. Automatic screen rotation really leaves much to be desired, and one would think this function should have been solid by this time.Now, I used Nokia smarphone (Nokia 7610) since 2004, that phone had great battery (7-10 days! with same usage pattern), gallery was working without any problems, and no noticeable bugs, always worked really sharp. When I got this new Nokia N82 I expected same level of quality (seeing that standby/talk time have increased according to the specifications). I really have to say that the N82 battery is really not up to theexpectations. I used to not even carry the charger for my old Nokia 7610 even when I  went for 4-5 day trips, as the battery was awesome. Basically, I am very disappointed with Nokia N82 as it does not get up to quality that you would expect from $400 phone. With short battery life and key functions not working sharp (like Gallery), this phone is a downgrade for me, not an improvement compared to my old, but sharp Nokia 7610.Having said all that, phone has lots of functions (Wi-Fi, 5MP camera, GPS, etc), but unfortunately you will not enjoy them much as the battery runs out really quick, or they simply sometimes not function right (eg. Gallery or GPS).Another thing (may be minor) is that Nokia Maps seem to require PC with Nokia Map Loader (and Windows!) application to get maps for your GPS, as a result the maps cannot be obtained using your phone alone; I must say this is just outright wrong, one would think there will support for LINUX users, as this is Symbian, not Windows Mobile.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "What a great phone", "Author": "T.

Brown \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R3U7DJFUBBVAZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MORE THAN JUST THE CAMERAYES, THE CAMERA: Enough has been said of the camera. It's all true. I can take a photo in pitch blackness. The infrared will shoot across a room to auto-focus & the bright Xenon will illuminate the room to take excellent, quality photos in complete darkness. This is no exaggeration. It has replaced my actual camera so I can carry less. I record all of my YouTube vids with the phone, too.It's not just the flash. It's not just the 5 megapixels. It's not just the lens cover. It's a lens that can handle the megapixels and an autofocus that makes it worth while. Most of us aren't trying to take poster-sized photos. For best results, I reduce the initial size of the photo (to 5x7 or so) so it doesn't have to be edited down.OTHER COOL FEATURES:TV-OUT function that comes w/wiring. Plug the N82 into a tv and see the webrowser, photos, movies, MSWord docs, Excel docs, PowerPoint, PDF files, etc. Record video and see it on the screen simultaneously.(If you purchase a collapsible bluetooth keyboard and mouse, you'll have a 'laptop' that is more portable and has a larger screen than a Mac Air, fits in a jacket pocket and uses any modern tv's screen.)MEMORY: Comes with 2gb memory card. I added an 8gm sdhc Ultra to mine. It's fast, no delay. It can take 16gb card. 128mb RAM. Never get 'memory full' warnings. Dual ARM 11 332 MHz processor w/ 3D graphics hardware acceleratorGPS (comes w/ Nokia maps as well, but download Google Maps for free. It's better). At cost, you can add voice-guided directions as well.DOCUMENTS: You can view MSWord docs, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF. With an upgrade, you can even edit them.ZIP: Creates, opens, downloads and sends ZIP foldersWiFi that is very easy to configure. UPnP to wirelessly connect with other wireless electronicsVIDEO CALLING: This feature doesn't work in The States, but it allows you to take self photos/videos and see yourself as you shoot. In a few years when video calling reaches us, your N82 will be ready....Bluetooth, Podcasting, FM radio, currency/measurement converter, world clock, photo editor, video editor, NGage gamesThis is not a slider or a flip. It's a solid piece and that means it's very sturdy. Sliders come with flex cables that are subject to damage. Just Google \"flex cable\" and add any slider phone.N85 & N86: These newer models are sliders which look cheap. One of them has an 8mp camera, but no Xenon flash to accompany it.OTHER OPTIONS - WINDOWS MOBILE OR APPLE OR PALM: No other operating system offers as many downloadable apps as the Symbian systems. This means you can download Symella and download music, video and files to your phone like LIMEWIRE. You can download Handwave and direct your phone w/o even touching it. You can download Nokmote, Rockandscroll or Rotateme and direct the N82 by motion. There are countless more free apps available. It's just more expandable than any other operating system.Touch screens are gimmicks. They require a greater range of motion, usually two hands and make your screen dirty. A cursor only requires I move my thumb a few millimeters whilst iPhoners are using two hands and strokes. Cute, but not practical.CONSSMALL KEYS: The keyboard is the size of my thumb. Although the keyes are are spaced, Braille-touch is still near impossible because even my pinkie finger can touch two keys at once. Ridiculous!NO QWERTY: The T9 is both predictive *and* teachable. After a short while, you'll teach it most of the odd words you're going to use. I can key in my name by touching the same amount of keys as I would on a QWERTY, but w/o the range of motion and the bulk of a QWERTY.SPEAKERS: Considering this unit has two speakers and is an upgrade from the N80, the sounds isn't quite as clear, good or powerful as that of an N80. There is an equalizer, boost & surround feature, none of which improve the sound. The sound is good, but not what it should be and is an obvious step down from the N80. That 'said,' the N82 offers a 3.5mm jack. The headset sound is stellar.3G: The N82 doesn't come w/ US 3G frequency, unfortunately.CONFIGURATION: If this is your first smart phone, you should know that, because it's not released under the umbrella of a carrier, it will take a lot of configuration. You won't be able to just pick it up and do all of the things I've listed here w/o downloads, upgrades, input. These are not simply calling phones. They aren't for teens who just want games and music. Know this.SMALL SCREEN: The screen isn't as small as you may think. It's bigger than most and as large as some PDAsLOOKS: This stealth phone definitely flies under the radar. No bling. No wow factor. I like to think of it as a high end, understated Benz whilst the iPhone is a mass-marketed, gold-laden, flashy Cadillac. Of course, the iPhones aren't even remotely in this phone's league. The upcoming N97 from Nokia has more features, but it is larger, is a 'slider,' uses a touch screen and doesn't have a Xenon flash. Oh, and it's $300-400 more expensive.CARRIERIf you pair the N82 w/ T-Mobile in The States, you can enjoy unlimited web usage and downloading. If you go w/ AT&T;, you'll pay as you go. Although AT&T; offers 3G in The States, the N82 doesn't carry US 3G frequency so save money and spend all the time on the web w/ T-Mobile.If you opt for PDA like a Blackberry with any carrier, you will have to pay an additional $25/mo to be able to access the Internet. Nokia's smartphones are more expensive to purchase because they don't come with service in The States, but they are cheaper to operate because they can be configured to us the Net w/o hefty, monthly PDA fees.This phone runs circles around almost anything you'll come in contact with. The best part (to me) is that it's feature-packed but stealth, tasteful, compact, sturdy and doesn't shout \"trend follower\".", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Versatile phone with great camera", "Author": "Stewart Midwinter \"gadget guru\"", "ReviewID": "R2T4OIW0V50NQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone primarily because of the camera: 5 Megapixels, and with a real-camera xenon flash (most phones have inferior LCD 'flash').  In that respect I'm not disappointed.  Still, a few details about that camera: in order to turn on the camera, you have to slide open the protective lens cover (a few times I've been frustrated at my inability to launch the camera app - until I remember that protective cover!). Next, the camera is a bit slow to start up. Count on 3 seconds from the flick of the cover switch until you're ready to shoot.When you start the camera app, it's in picture mode. To switch into video mode, you need to find the right icon in the little vertical toolbar on the right side of the screen, and press OK.  That toolbar has more elements than can be seen on the screen at one time, and if you have at one point in the past scrolled down that list (perhaps inadvertently) you may end up wondering why your picture/video icon has disappeared; simply scroll back up.After taking a picture (using the dedicated shutter button) on the right side of the phone, in order to take a second picture (if you are in single-picture mode) you will have to press the right soft key (below the word 'Back' on your screen). If you instead mistakenly press the dedicate multimedia key immediately below that, you'll end up launching the Gallery application instead, and you'll have to press the right soft key again to exit that app and return to the camera app.If you leave the camera app for any reason, there are two ways to start it again. Either close and reopen the lens cover while on your home screen, or else press and hold the camera shutter.Once captured, pictures and videos can be saved to albums, or uploaded over the air to Nokia's Ovi on-line application, or to Flickr or Vox. I really like this feature! Take a pic while you are out and about, and immediately it's online for your friends to see.Turning to other features...The GPS is fairly useful and does a good job of recording a tracklog using the free Nokia SportsTracker application (see [...] One gripe: you can only upload tracklogs to the SportsTracker app using a cellular data connection, not WiFi.The WiFi works well also, and you can define named access points, which, when you are trying to connect to the internet, will only appear in your list when you are in range of them (you can delete them in Tools if you want).  You can set the phone to always prompt you and ask if you wish to connect via WiFi or cellular data. Save some money on data usage!The built-in browser is acceptable, and *way* better than the Microsoft Pocket Internet Explorer that's provided on Windows Mobile devices, but if you are a demanding user you will prefer to download and install Opera Mini. Speaking of downloading, you can download many apps and install them over the air - no pesky desktop synchronization required.The built-in messaging client is acceptable, and can handle multiple accounts.  One quirk is that it wants to define one account as being active, and all outgoing mail will try to go through that account (you can change active accounts with the \"Connect\" menu item) unless you change it in Sending Options before pressing Send.  Make sure you are properly communicating with your mail server before composing a big message however, since Messaging will simply delete your outgoing message if it cannot connect to the server.Others can talk about music and video playing as I don't use those features much.Gripes:- This phone is billed as 'US Version' but the UMTS (3G connection) is on 2100 MHz whereas most N. American cellular providers are on 1900 MHz. So, you may only be getting EDGE speed for your data transfers. (about 150 kilobytes/sec).- intensive texting is a bit of a pain given the very small keys. You can substantially improve your accuracy, speed and overall pleasure of text input by installing Adaptxt, which provides predictive word completion for a reasonable fee; you can try the app for 90 days from adaptxt.com before you buy.  On the plus side, you can pair a bluetooth keyboard (like the iGo, or Apple's wireless keyboard) to the N82 and type away with a real keyboard. I love this capability.- unlike Windows Mobile phones, there's no office suite included with the phone. But if you have a good data plan, you could just use Google Docs instead and do all your work on-line.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "None better", "Author": "John F.

I used it for my music, to surf the internet at the Hotel via WIFI and using Skype installed in the phone, i could stay in touch with friends and family for cheap. Since the quality of the picture was very good i used it in many cases my N82 instead of a regular camera. Another thing is that with a free software that can be downloaded to your computer from the internet, linking your ITUNES music playlist to your nokia phone is no problem.OK, the cons: The Battery is week and only last for a couple of hours when using WIFI conection and music.

I have never been so satisfied in the pure performance, ease of use, and specifications. I don't mean for this to sound the wrong way, but I spend a lot of money on mobile devices. In doing so, I obviously get a good first hand feel of them.

The Nokia display, video and picture quality are excellent.  You don't need to bring a separate digital camera on trips. I'm a map freak and GPS on this device is really good. A definite aid when I was out of town trying locate a place to eat.  It just a downer that you have to pay extra for the voice service for the GPS.  The Sony Ericsson P1i does not come with a GPS however Sony does has a touch screen but that is no big deal with me.

Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy.N95 had a lot of bugs and very annoying lags in the camera when shooting (see my n95 review). Worst was a few seconds (literally) from the moment the shutter was pressed to the moment the picture was taken, processed and have the camera ready for the next one. An absolute no go... Slider is so flimsy on the N95 that I was really afraid the screen part is going to crack and dislocate.The N82's camera is a great improvement on that part. It has a Xenon flash and a much faster response time. I personally prefer the lens slide as a camera activator because it prevents accidental camera mode when in the holster, something I have experienced with the N95 quite a lot.Very useful function (especially for travelers): The modem function works great either via the USB modem driver or the Bluetooth, with download speeds that could put some so-called `broadband' speeds to shame. This is great in places where you have no Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi for your laptop (like in Airport terminals, etc).The phone also syncs with the PC (outlook) using the same connections (through the USB or via Bluetooth)MicroSD: The N82's spec doesn't state support for HC MicroSD memory, but I took the chance and bought an 8GB one and it works flawlessly...Screen: Auto rotation is somewhat annoying but it can be disabled.Media player: Sometimes it freezes with other applications running to the point when it freezes and restarts the phone. It happens rarely but it does (with the latest FW version). Sound quality is reasonable although on my phone I hear clicks and pops on the over tones which is weird because I only transferred the songs as MP3 without additional compression to MP4 which is available through the Media Manager.A-GPS: Well this is a debatable function and whether useful or not it is up to how much really one needs a GPS. I find it to be a nice toy to have but I don't consider it as a serious GPS. In fact the Nokia maps are not so great for this service. The Voice guidance is free for only 3-days after which the navigation is disabled and when used, it redirects to purchase options which are so ridiculously expensive. I downloaded Google maps for the phone which work much better overall.Battery life: Much better than the N95, though it is not even close to what's in the spec. I don't know why Nokia doesn't think about that. The battery should be at least 1300mAh to give a decent battery life between charges.Overall it's a good phone for the price I paid (I don't see why one would pay more than a $150) for the black one as priced on Amazon, or even more for the N95 which doesn't give you more for the money.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "N82 hit or miss", "Author": "Research Concepts", "ReviewID": "R3I8XD3PIGGKTC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently had the pleasure of trying out a Nokia n82 for about 2 weeks give or take a day.

GPS is useful also although I havent fully relied on in since I have a GPS navi in my car. Keypad buttons are tiny but at least tactile...i find myself using my fingernails when typing or dialing. Another thing i liked was the independent ports for the headphone, power, and usb. Some cel phones use the same port for each of those and allows the user to just do one thing at a time whereas the N82 lets you talk on the headset, charge your phone, and access or transfer files in the computer all at the same time. Screen is rather small in today's standard especially since videos and internet are utilized. But then again its a candybar style so screen size is limited.
