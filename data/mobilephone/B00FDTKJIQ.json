I was surprised how much power it used. The standard battery must go! I ordered an extended power battery from Amazon and... that fixed the only problem I've ever had with this phone. I wore out the face of my keyboard because; I often-time have chemicals on my hands but... that is my problem.I've dropped this thing more times than I can count and... it just keeps on working. I have 6 email accounts running on it at all times. (personal and 5 business) it has never let me down in over two years of beating it up, lol...What can I say except... this phone works very well for me and you really can't beat \"StraightTalk\". Actually, it works so well... I just went out and got a spare one so... when my letters and numbers are completely gone, I'll be able to switch-over to the new one. :) They started out around $179. Now you can get one for around $80+ but... they are getting much harder to find these days. Hummm... maybe I'll go get a third, just in case.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "L NELSON", "ReviewID": "R3FVSPPM5S6Q0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had mine for about a year. only reason I got another is that it would no longer boot up. may just be the battery, I don't know. all I know is I want another one. it was perfect for me for doing everything I need to do. lost without this phone!", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Some issues", "Author": "vavidion", "ReviewID": "R3KT7DVFAD406V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love playing candy crush and for some reason this phone wont allow it to install.

It was easy to use, did what I needed to, and had good call quality. I got the apps I needed, one being Olive Office and because of the QWERTY keyboard, it was easy to edit my story files. The signal was good and the battery was great! The only down side to this phone is it's lack of memory. If you need a lot of apps stored on internal memory, you should get another phone. I recommend this as an intro to Android phone. It could be a good temporary phone as well.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R3BPJJMAPJIAY7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think it works fine,but I got It for my son and he says it freezes some times, plus it dials out randomly", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "BEWARE", "Author": "Anna Prater", "ReviewID": "R1QBAQGAMKF1V1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own this phone and would advise not to buy.
