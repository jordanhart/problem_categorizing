LOL  How about $9.99 instead?I own one of these. It was nice hardware, but the operating system/firmware was very buggy. Any Sprint store will upgrade the firmware to make the phone useable, but expect it to still black out once in a while when you try to text, and then you have to type your message all over again. This is nice for a flip phone, but not a $300 phone.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cell Phone", "Author": "donna malveaux", "ReviewID": "REJ2LRAD5DM20", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is pretty, but lots of time the other person cannot hear me, sometimes it rings and sometimes it don\"t.
