{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Windows Phone as of early 2013", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R20EWOSG359FMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Though Unlocked, Certain Features Could Not Be Enabled", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1Q05F4EP9OWTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone came from Canada. Though the phone was unlocked as advertised, a key feature called \"internet sharing\" or sometime \"connection sharing\" or \"tethering\" would NOT work in the USA. Tedious and hard to find internet research undertaken subsequent to purchase confirms that this feature will NOT work unless a phone is first sold and provisioned in the USA. Apparently security code requirements in the installed Windows8 software cannot be installed on phones provisioned outside of the USA. Without this security code no computer can \"see\" the phone or connect to it. If the \"internet sharing\" feature is important, it is senseless to try to by a phone that was not initially provisioned in the USA, since despite being \"unlocked\", it will not have the required Microsoft code loaded to provide \"internet sharing\". ...

And I am 33 years young so I've owned a few of them by now. I bought this one for my old man (who is also a Nokia guy like I am), but of course I had to play with it before giving it to my dad. I own a Lumia 900 and I was intrigued by how different from my 900 this 920 could be. It turns out it has many more settings possibilities than I was expecting it to have. On my opinion, it is even more user friendly than the Lumia 900 and much more informative for sure (i.e. the distribution of the memory usage, pics, apps, email, etc). Another big change with respect to my Lumia 900 lies on the camera of course, not to mention it has a much broader app market so you can find many more cool apps for the camera. All of this with the same \"unbreakability\" (if you will) that every single Nokia product is known for, and without sacrificing on materials as its design is simply astonishing.

I was very excited and the phone didn't spoil my expectation when I open and use it.The weight of the phone is relatively heavier than the other latest smartphones. Despite its weight, the phone feels better to hold than any smartphones.The side buttons are easier to use and packed in a single side.The sound quality of the speakers are better than the iPhone.I really like the position of the rear camera. I never get my fingers during capturing the photos. The quality of the camera is too good. The application has the ability to change some settings, but the default settings is more than enough for normal use.The phone is more responsive than other smartphones. My friend who owns a Samsung Galaxy S3 used to tell me about crashing and not responding. But once I got my phone, I've loaded too many apps and games, and tried switching between applications. But never had problem of crashing. The loading speed of apps / games are far better than other smartphones.The touch sensitivity is better than iPhone. The display colors are brilliant, bright and vivid.All the pre-loaded Nokia apps are much better than other apps. Especially the Nokia Here Drive and Nokia City Lens. The offline maps are too useful which usually all other OS's apps lagging on it.I accept that Windows Store does not have more apps when compared to other market places. But I expect all the major app developers are making apps compatible with Windows Mobile OS.Skydrive is one of the best cloud sync application. It has lot many features than the iCloud. But still there is a major problem on Syncing your contacts / calendar from Outlook directly which you should do it through your hotmail / live / outlook account.The OneNote application is relatively simple to use it and have more ability than the Notes application in iPhone.So overall the Nokia Lumia 920 is an excellent mobile device that I've ever used so far.

Built like a tank, I feel if I were to drop it at any moment, it would act like nothing happened (Almost as if it sneezed). The quality of the phone is also above and beyond. It is very smooth in your hands and comfortable to hold. Now for the actual OS, I am still getting used to it, but here are the pros and cons of such OS.Pros:+Very silky smooth interface, no lag+Easy to navigate to one place to the next+Adding tiles to the screen is easily done as well as re-arranging them+Camera is crystal clear, you will notice the quality in the shot+Included Nokia apps do wonders. (i.e. Nokia Maps you can download a location and navigate from one place to the next without having to use your dataplan)+Quality apps are starting to emerge.Cons:-Exiting out of an app requires spamming the back button in it until it has fully quit (Unlock android you can hold the home button and a task manager will pop up, allowing you to quit out of any app), in windows, you can hold down the back button to display all the open programs, but you are not able to quit out of it from there, you can only go into the app and spam the back button. (The side benefit of this is that you can redo your steps on how you navigated to the app, but I am more of a guy who likes to remove a task rather than rework all the steps I took to get to said app.-No great \"Windows Phone\" games titles, besides the ones already from android and iOS such as Angry Birds, Plants vs Zombies, etc.-NO MEDIA PLAYER CONTROLS NATIVE TO THE DEVICE. What I mean by that is, you can play a song from the music player, but if you are in another app or want it to play in the background, the ONLY way to get up some interface on how to control the song (Stopping, Pause, Play, Skip, Previous) is by going to your lockscreen, which can be a simple as tapping your power button on and off really quick. But android is very fluid in that you have something built in and it is easily accessible, AND GOD FORBID YOU DON'T TOUCH THE CONTROLS, it will then auto hide itself. Also, there is an app on the windows phone that somebody made for $0.99 cents/dollar that will basically stop the music for you and clear it from your data.... I mean, really microsoft? Please fix that, lol. -_-That is my review, I hope it will be helpful to anybody looking to purchase said device, I mainly got it from developing but am using the device for my own phone purposes because of the quality it actually has, just the additional fixes would make this the phone to be for others I feel.-1 star mainly for the media player controls only being on the lockscreen or inside the media player itself, no native controls to it while the music is playing in the background (Also a simple stop button and clear would be nice as I said in the cons where a person made an app that does such and sells it for $0.99, which is pretty sad).", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "review of Nokia 920 international phone", "Author": "Robert Waters", "ReviewID": "RYQWW5YG3VUV2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "NO!
