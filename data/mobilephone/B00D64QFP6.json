Screen is much bigger than the S3, has a SnapDragon chip and the good battery life (so far). Yeah, it's only got 4G of built in RAM... So what?!? The $avings have to come from somewhere and I highly doubt most users will ever need more than that anyway. Just in case you do need more, slide in a memory card. It accepted my 16MB chip without even a hiccup. I was so impressed with the first one I bought, I had to come back for seconds. Works with my StraightTalk sim card without issue.Bottom line - Good phone, great price and the best Android phone value I've was able to find. This is really a no brainer.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product for $$", "Author": "Dr. Fisher", "ReviewID": "R3VX0HAT9O9KG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Using this phone on Straight Talk have had no issues with the phone. The only drawback is availability of accessories. The phone does come with a jelly case and screen protector, an otterbox type would be nice if I were any rougher on it. Blu makes a great product for the price I've purchased others for the rest of the family. I would recommend this phone and brand to anyone using a bring your own phone service.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "blu verses s3", "Author": "rick c.", "ReviewID": "R3NWYPOKQSJZ7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice screen, fast,I would have given it a 5 but sometimes it locks up.a little hard to find a case, but I still like it a lot, had an s3 before but it was stolen, didn't want to spend that much again, but I like this one about as much.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "An excellent option in the contract-free arena", "Author": "Qwertz", "ReviewID": "R2Q8WCQTYIPNLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be frank, this phone, with its quad-core, and ample space on deck, provides more phone for your dollar than any other that I have tried, and gives even top-shelf products a run for their money. I have had this phone and used it daily for 4 months, and have had absolutely no issues with it. The display, camera, sound quality and other features are comparable, and for the price, head and shoulders above the other phones that I had in mind.Between the large, bright screen and support of apps like Tasker, and some of the newer add-on apps for google-voice, this phone will serve, long after I replace it as a phone. It is the perfect size to supplement my tablet use; large enough to use daily, small enough to carry anywhere.It definitely works with Net10, and is root-able and rom-able, as well.Alll in all,a great phone.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "I have been using this", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWM5KZ10O4P0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for about 7 months.  It is fast, sharp screen and has an unexpectedly good camera.  Know that you are getting a $200 off brand phone, but that being said, it does not operate like it is off-brand.  There is little lag as long as you are not running too many apps at once (any device will lag if you have too much running at once).  It connects well to Straight Talk's mobile network and any wifi source available.  Videos play well and look sharp on the display.  The camera takes and displays great pictures, that still look great on a large desktop LCD screen or displayed on a TV.  The video is the only part that is not consistently good. About one in 5 videos I shoot have sections that get pixelated at certain points, generally when there is a lot of motion happening.  My next phone will probably be a BLU.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "BAD PRODUCT.", "Author": "Valdir Jesus Luz", "ReviewID": "R7KEEZWVFNAHV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item has a problem in that the touch screen does not work.

During use this phone was sucking down power at the rate of 5% - 10% every 10 minutes. We contacted the seller Breed and they informed us they do not have batteries for this model available and offered a refund or $10 reimbursement if we could find a battery. I could not find a new battery in town so we called the manufacturer BLU who does not answer their phone (1hour on hold) or their email. I will now seek a refund, do not buy this phone or any phone from Blu, their customer support and accessories availability is horrible.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "This review is about the seller, D&E; Fashion", "Author": "LA friend", "ReviewID": "R1SYAWF1TTBLS0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone itself is fine so far, but it's only the 2nd day and it came in an unsealed box!!!  It looks new.I think it's no fair to Blu product if I gave one star, I have to say it clear this one star goes to D&E; Fashion, the seller.  They deserve no star; one star is for responding to me at least.I meant it is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS that the seller made decision to hold the item at the Fedex office for NOT DELIVER to my home until I emailed them because its already passed it's arrival schedule.Eventually, I had to ask someone to arrange a special ride to pick up the phone for me from Fedex office.  My expectation to D&E; is a total lost, but NOT AMAZON; however, if Amazon gives D&F; a free hand to dealing with customer, I think it is dangerous, because they could do whatever they want.  D&E; said is a two-days free shippment, but end up 5 days with no reason and no advance notice for customer pick up, I had to pick up the cellphone myself!!!Also, at the beginning, after placing the order, I received the order confirmation c/o Amazon, then D&F; sent email saying that they need my full name which I don't have any problem with my name for shippment before, anyhow, I emailed them right back with my full name, one day later, they emailed saying that they are out of stock and tried to sell model 5.5s to me, I accepted, but they didn't mention the price different which model 5.5s is $15 cheaper than 5.0 until I found out at Amazon myself and they are willing to credit back.I kept checking my order status and it arrived on the 16th april morning, however, no sign of delivery until 18th april in the afternoon.  I emailed D&F; and the reply is \"I HAVE TO GO AND PICK IT UP FROM FEDEX OFFICE\".  All in all, I am speechless and disappointed.Now that the phone's camera is not working properly, might be I might need to consider returning it for no more hassle.My point is \"Why they could make a decision not to deliver the phone to me???\"", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "regular phone", "Author": "Danny", "ReviewID": "R2BL6X7YJ4AAMY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I Hace difficults to connect this iPhone wi-fi.
