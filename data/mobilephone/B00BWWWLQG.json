{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not quite as advertised, good phone so far though", "Author": "Jason A K", "ReviewID": "R126AAOVI2BOWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was bought for me from Amazon. It was sold by Tablet Distributors. They advertise the phone as being new. If you expect it to be a brand new phone, don't. It came in a third party LG box, not the original OEM box. When turned on the start up screen even said certified like new. The phone itself is a good phone so far, keep in mind I opened and started it up last night. I did email the seller and inquired about a warranty which they did tell me it has a one year warranty. That email is saved in a folder set aside just for them. This device will sustain me until my upgrade in late October, early November. My only problem is the battery life is a little shorter than I was hoping for. Still got a solid 7-8 hours of extremely heavy use though. Much better battery life than my Samsung Galaxy Nexus SCH-I515. This is definitely a much faster phone than my old one though. If you do get this phone MAKE SURE you turn on the power save settings and customize them to fit your needs or it will die on you fast. If anything changes as far as future, unforeseen problems with this device two things will occur: 1. Tablet Distributors WILL be notified for me to make use of the one year warranty, and 2. I WILL update this review for others to be made aware.If you have the option to but \"New\" or refurbished, certified preowned, get the certified preowned. That's all I received when paying for a new device. 5 stars for the phone (so far) and 2 stars for the manufacturer for giving me a refurb when advertising new. The manufacturer got a plus one star because of the warranty, that saved them from me returning it and getting money back. Hope this helps anyone looking at this phone.Keep in mind, This model was discontinued in 2013, so any that advertise \"New\", most likely will not be.

I dont want to deal with contracts anymore so selling my iphone and purchased this. The reviews were impressive and the price was perfect! Purchased used. If you have small hands, its a bit hard to text one handed, its just too wide but i dont mind using two hands makes me feel fast.I had a hard time seeing anything on my iphone.
