I have installed on it Netflix, Skype, Whatsapp, Spare phone for voip wifi calls, file manager, Pandora and 650 megs maps of Sygic Gps and Dolphin full browser!First, you must download from the market the app APPMRGIII, this will enable you to move each app to the SD card. It will be best to install and move each app one by one to free space as you go.Second there is a confusing terminology used on this phone. To move the app to the \"SD card\" use the option \"move to internal storage\". This will move the app from the phone storage to the internal 1 gigabyte storage which is different from the sd 4 gigabytes card!Some apps would not be allowed to be moved, so you will need to be selective.Because the resolution of this phone does not require lots of processing power, apps load amazingly faster on it than on my LG Esteem which costed me several hundred dollars.The battery life is amazing. It leave the  phone on all night running of the battery pull with Wi-Fi and cellular radio on and the battery will be fully charged the next morning!The phone has bluetooth and Gps hardware. I installed Sygic which is a self contained Gps program which does not need network connection to work.Photos and videos don't look very good on the phone itself but look good on when displayed on other phones and devices.WhatsApp would take only 1/10 of a Meg from your data to send a text message.I found out that the phone has a switch in to turn off data transfer while maintaining cell phone connection. This is useful to avoid sending data over 3g while on wifi.Also, I installed Spare phone app to make phone calls over wifi to any place just like a regular phone. This will safe plan minutes!For the money this is an amazing little gem and far more value than my costly LG Esteem ($400) which I love as it works perfect, has a great resolution and hdmi port. I only wish it was could work on Trackfone service which is a great value and uses Verizon", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Optimus Dynamic cell by tracfone", "Author": "George \"MartyBanner\"", "ReviewID": "R145JK26J3U97M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This smart phone is great!

This is the first 'smarter' phone I have owned. Apparently I owned 'dumb' ones before. The phone itself is good. I had difficulties switching phone number and my time to this phone with Tracfone. I was going from a phone with a lower IQ to this brilliant one and it appears the services are quite different.The review about memory management was quite helpful because I had similar issues. I went crazy with apps and then had low memory notices. However, as one of my 'phonie' friends told me, I shouldn't expect much from a phone that cost me less than $50.All this said, I think I did all right. The phone has worked flawlessly since I finally got it activated. I would recommend the phone to people who want a basic 'smart' phone without too many bells and whistles. Since I am a pay as you go phone user with Tracfone, this phone almost exceeds my needs. I don't need a music player, book reader (really?) or a handheld gaming device. My camera takes images that are fuzzy. Fortunately I don't have a use for it - not even for gratuitous selfies. The maps and browser are nice on a limited scale.I'd give the phone 5-stars if they would make their memory management smarter and Google (Android) would allow us to remove useless apps...it almost reminds me of Windows and the applications that HAVE to be there even if you don't want them, because they are part of the operating system.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Tracfone", "Author": "someonetofind", "ReviewID": "RCLYY3NVX8GP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose tracfone to begin with because it is pay as you go.

It doesn't have the greatest resolution, but with the camera and web I am now able to share with friends some of my smaller things in life.  If you are connected to WiFi then there is no data usage.

My mom went out and bought herself a Tracfone smartphone at Walmart with birthday money she got from a friend, so I had to bite the bullet and get one, too. I've had the Optimus for a week and I'm really surprised how quickly I've been able to adjust. It's got the same OS on it as my Transformer, so I was already somewhat familiar with how to use it. It doesn't have much onboard memory, but that's not an issue for me since the apps that came on it are the only ones I'll ever need. NOTE: Unlike my previous Tracfones, this one doesn't show me my balance on the homescreen. I did have to download the Tracfone app to be able to monitor my balance, but it worked right away and give me the info I need.I want to mention that the balance on my new triple-minute smartphone is divided into \"buckets\" now: phone minutes/text messages and data usage. I got triple time on all of them, but they can't be used to supplement each other. Again, that's not an issue for me. I did invest in a 1-year card on my old phone on the same day I bought the new phone, so I should be covered for a long time to come considering the way I use my phone.The touch screen is very sensitive and the on-screen keyboard works better for me if I use a stylus as opposed to my fingers. It's not quite big enough to keep me from hitting the wrong keys with my fingers. I like having my most called numbers as icons on my homescreen, too. I think this phone uses Verizon as opposed to AT&T; and I have to admit that the reception is WAY better in our home area (out in the sticks) that my old phone's.If you're a Tracfone user but are looking for something a bit more advanced, I can recommend this phone, especially if you've never used a smartphone before.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus Android", "Author": "Harry T.

Not so! I have a sony xperia Z tablet and the icons on the LG are the same, as well as the os functions.  The phone is easy to carry, has excellent quality and is easy to learn. I received it on time and it was as described which is why I gave it 5 stars. When you buy a 400 minute card for this phone it triples to 1200 minutes and 3 months of use. Thanks to Denise who commeted on this post I stand corrected on the data. It indeed does give you 3x on the data. A 400 minute card does give you 1200mb also. I do not use this much for surfing because I have the Z and use all the hotspots for free such as Subway, Mcdonalds, Burger king, etc etc to do most of my browsing. You can access all the apps at google for the android and there are many of them. This is a 5 star phone and no contracts required. An additional comment I would like to add is the memory is limited so only a few apps can be on it at a time. I did not know that when I posted the first review as I run all my apps on the Xperia Z.

I have had months to try out this phone and as for the basics talk and text it is great.  But I have been experiencing some issues with connecting the the web for browsing.  I am always getting that there is no network available or I need a password to connect to the network for where I am at.  This is very fustrating to be somewhere and to go and use the web and not have access while I see other people on their smartphones looking at facebook; looking up info on the web or using their voice activated text messaging and I cannot. I am not sure if I am doing somethin wrong.  As for a basic phone this is great.  I have downloaded an app that helps me make a \"to do list\" or \"grocery list\" and it works great.  Did download an app for different ring tones - but again if you are not on the network the ringtones you set up for an individual doesn't work and it reverts back to the basic ringtone.

Sure the memory is poor and the processor slower but it is a first generation smart phone so if you are expecting to be able to download hundreds of apps then this is probably not the phone for you. I find it meets all my needs and by downloading a few specific apps you can really get the most out of this phone.Firstly I would be to turn off automatic updates for apps before you even access the internet. App updates on apps you may never use will eat up your memory as all the preinstalled apps are on the phones memory and cannot be moved to the SD card. After you install each app you can go to settings/applications select your new app and you will be presented with the option \"move to internal memory\". Tap this and it will move the app to your phone's SD card freeing up some much needed phone memory. Also remember to check each individual apps settings to make sure updates are off.Next download an app like launcher pro this will allow you to hide apps you don't want to use as well as making some nice changes to the way your phone looks and operates. It will give you an extra option next to settings called \u2018preferences\u2019. Now you will be able to make some changes to your home screen, phone functionality, as well as hiding apps.  If you remove the app data make sure it won\u2019t update then hide it that will ensure it takes up minimal memory.Choosing apps wisely will also make a big difference some are much bigger than others and some cannot be moved to the SD card. You will need to prioritize which apps you want and need on your phones memory. I would recommend not using the browser supplied. Download opera mini, its small and uses very little memory and can be moved to the SD card.An app like DS battery saver will save you huge amounts of battery life. With this phone like with all androids having Wi-Fi/Bluetooth on with multiple apps running uses a lot of battery power. This app will put your phone into a sleep mode when the screen goes to sleep.  It won\u2019t affect the phone for calls and such but will turn off Wi-Fi and clear your data. It turns it back on the phone periodically to check for messages emails etc. then will go back to sleep. This app was a revelation for me. Before it I would need to charge my phone at least every 12 hours when at home and connected to Wi-Fi. Now I only have to charge once every few days providing I haven\u2019t been using it excessively.Lastly I would recommend downloading an app like memory booster. This will allow you to do things like delete cache and kill processes easily with the touch of a button and free up memory.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone! Don't be scared away by the small internal memory.", "Author": "Quixote", "ReviewID": "RQGX1P6EKUOBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is an amazing phone for the money.As for the memory issue, YES, the internal memory is ridiculously small and fills up after a few app downloads. So you need to go to use the App Mgr feature already installed on the phone to move as many apps as possible (not all can be moved) from the phone memory to the SD card (TAKE NOTE: the SD card is referred to in the app manager as \"internal memory\"). This will solve most of the problem. I have also found that the constant updates from Google and other apps fill up the phone memory quite quickly, so you need to manually go in and clear updates and other random data that your phone will surely gather especially if you keep the WiFi on all the time. Kind of a pain but well worth the trouble, given the great functionality of this phone at a ridiculously low price.I also downloaded GV Phone so that I can make free calls on WiFI thereby saving Tracfone minutes for when I am away from WiFi. GV Phone does have a bit of an annoying lag, however.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone, Needs more storage, but not much else", "Author": "David A McKenney", "ReviewID": "R1RUT3IMLTQ1AS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone.  I got it to upgrade my Lg800g and I like it a lot.  I wish that there was more storage when you get it.  The specs say 1gb of internal storage and a 4gb included SD card but what ISNT said is that you only get 157mb of \"system storage\" to install apps, and if you update any of the preinstalled(and non-removable)apps like youtube or gmail you get a bit more than half that.  There are a few workarounds for the memory issue in that you can save SOME apps to the 1gb internal storage to free up space.  Also of note, you don't NEED to update the preinstalled apps as they will run just fine with the stock version of the app.  You can disable auto updates in the settings, if you don't then every time you connect to wifi/3G these apps will update and waste space.  Dispite the limlted space of this phone I've managed to cram a few games and several apps(weather, email, chrome, etc.) onto it, as of this writing I have 12 installed apps with 36mb free for installs.  Not great, not terrible.  Storage is what keeps this phone from getting 5 stars.Aside from the above mentioned storage issue, this phone is great. The 800mhz processor is pretty zippy with Gingerbread and has very little lag.  After only about 10 minutes online, I was able to transfer my minutes and number from the old phone and I like that my minutes were added in the three categories.  I had 2200 minutes, now I have 2200 talk/2200 texts/2200 data, so that's really cool.Setting up the wifi was easy as well and I was able to port all my contacts from my old phone with Bluetooth.  From the time I got it out of the package to the time I deemed it \"all set up\" (minutes transferred, apps installed, a game or two played) was a bit less than an hour.  Calling is easy and clear, although it should be noted that these Android tracfones use Verizon towers while the older phones(non android) use ATT towers, so check into the coverage in you area if you are going to upgrade from an older tracfone.  Texting is pretty easy too, the stock keyboard is fine but there are a few free keyboards available if you don't like it.  I'm not a big texter as I'm all thumbs but I can manage fine on this one so if you like to text you should be alright(my 11 year old daughter looks like The Flash on this keyboard and she says its fine so it must be pretty good).  The 3G is alright and there is a built in browser that isn't the worst I've seen.  Be warned: there is no airtime display on the phone so you need to check the balance online through the tracfone website or a free 3mb app from tracfone.  The screen is bright and clear, youtube videos and angry birds look just fine on it.  The screen is also very responsive to touch, much better than my old phone and I don't need to press hard at all or double tap it.Overall, I think this is a good buy.  I am really enjoying using this phone and I am glad I got it.  It has done everything I need it to and a lot of what I want it to.  For the price I couldn't go wrong and I couldn't be happier.

With Tracfone, you can only transfer android minutes and service to another android (CDMA phone).  You cannot transfer android minutes and service to one of their GSM phones.  So basically, I purchased this phone as a stop-gap, and a place to \"store\" my minutes.  Yes, this android suffers from low memory.

While you can use an \"app to SD\" application (like AppMgrIII) to move SOME apps to the SD card, you cannot move any of the pre-installed apps to SD....the system does not allow it.  Therefore, I would not recommend this phone if you are someone who likes to use your android for lots of functions.  I am only a moderate user, and I find the low memory to be quite restricting.  However, I am only using this phone as a back-up phone, so I am not affected by the phone's deficiencies all that much.

Koller", "ReviewID": "R2XY8MPURI1Z43", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone knowing it would be cheap and dated. But since it's Tracfone, it costs almost nothing for the service, so in the end I feel I still made a smart decision. First things first, let's get the problems out of the way:- Text Messaging through SMS is really glitchy. I've had messages just not send to people, so I do all of my text messaging through Google Voice now (uses WiFi/3G Data).- Voice calls on the CDMA network are not as clear as with Tracfones using GSM. That's a given. However, calls made using your Data connection (requires a VoiP app of your choosing) are crystal clear.- A few of the apps that come with the phone (Talk, Latitude, Messenger) are really dated and no longer supported by Google, but you have no way to remove them without rooting the phone (something nobody seems to know how to do). Further more, the phone comes with some apps (like a stock email app alongside Gmail) which you will never use...but can't remove either. Weak.- Google Play Store/Google Play Services just DOES NOT WORK WELL on this phone. This phone is too old and trying to run all of the updates will kill its memory twice over. Your best bet is to not use it, hide it from your apps drawer with something like Holo Launcher, and download all of your apps from a third party such as AndroidDrawer (using Package Installer). Note: You will have to go into Settings to allow installs of third-party apps.- The browser that comes with the phone is pretty subpar. Throw Opera Mini onto your phone FIRST THING. You'll be glad you did.- Versions of some apps that you should use (I downloaded all of them from AndroidDrawer):Pandora Radio - Ver. 4.1.2Google Voice - 0.4.2.72Holo Launcher - 2.1.0Skype - 3.2.0.6673TuneIn Radio - 7.4QuickPic - 2.2.4All of them are pretty stable and use very little data (with the exception of TuneIn). You can have up to 4 foreground apps running before the RAM begins to have trouble, and it's best to reboot the phone every 24 hours to give everything a quick refresh. Now, for the GOOD stuff:- This phone supports speech to text! You can enable it in your keyboard settings. Also, the keyboard, when in Landscape mode, is just really nice overall.- This phone has a set of switches in your Notification Drawer to toggle Vibrate, Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS and your 3G connection. This means if you aren't using your data, you can temporarily turn it off, and turn it back on when you need it (eliminates waste). Furthermore, you can put your phone in Airplane Mode and still use Wi-Fi, which is an excellent way to save battery.- The phone has a Battery Use graph in settings which shows what eats your battery most, so you know what to disable if you aren't using certain features.- The 3 Megapixel camera is a step up from the 2 Megapixel camera on the LG 840G. No flash capability, unfortunately.- I put 750 MB of data on the phone when I bought it. It's been a month and a half, and I still have 450MB left, thanks to the apps I have using very little data, as well as piggybacking off Wi-Fi where I can. And with 750MB only costing $25, I'm really paying a lot less than a lot of other people.Honestly, despite only being Android 2.3 Gingerbread, I find myself using this phone far more than I use my tablet which runs Android 4.4 KitKat. Because it's small, lightweight, and still does 70% of what my tablet can do, I am much more inclined to take it with me wherever I go and leave my tablet at home. For anyone who's good with customizing devices, this is perfect because it's incredibly cheap and can be made to do impressive things.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "bob", "ReviewID": "R1X8WUZJHX47SD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "spent over two hours with tracfone trying to get it working properly finally got it figured out but the text writing is so small i cant read it i am glad it was so cheap i can throw it in yhe garbage", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 stars for what it is", "Author": "Ratbert the Optimist", "ReviewID": "R10LJV6ZFTDI6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent cheap android tracfone with triple minutes for life for 20 bucks shipped for Prime members.

I have the LG 840G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone) I bought for my sister, but it's not really a smartphone and I missed some of the things my android phone could do (I really disliked how text messaging worked on the phone too).  This one has google play store and with a little work can have everything you want on it.  The instructions in the top rated review will make this phone more useful.  It's very easy to move apps from your phone to the internal memory to free up space.  I would also suggest turning off auto updates and uninstalling the updates on some of the apps that can't be uninstalled or moved.  That will free up enough space so you can pretty much download anything you might need.  It does take more work, but for the price I can't complain.For the cons, the camera isn't that good as expected, but it works.  Everything else is decent on it.  It isn't the fastest phone in the worl and will freeze up if you try to do too much at once, but people should have realistic expectations for a 25 dollars phone with a cheap pre-paid plan.  I bought the phone and 30 minutes for 9.99 so with triple minutes I have 90 minutes, 90 mb of data and 90 text messages for 30 days.  The android plan is different from other tracfones that just relies on minutes, so you might want to consider that.  It also doesn't have the obnoxious tracfone message on the phone (though I think you can turn that off? on the other phones).  So this phone even with the cons is the best option for me.

I followed the instructions set by other LG Optimus Dynamic users in the Amazon reviews in how to move apps to internal memory and it worked exactly as described by several users researched and found solutions to these issues.Next, I connected the usb cable to my pc, laptop and desktop, and moved various pictures over into the cell phone, my pc's run using Windows 7 Ultimate and Home Premium editions, and each system worked easily with the phone.  But, I found that associating my pictures to my cell phone's display took some time to navigate and find exactly which folder the pictures were being kept in.  Apparently on direct transfer of pictures, although you may be able to see your pictures in the gallery area, you will have to navigate and find the folder where the transferred pictures are being kept in because they may have the same folder name as the gallery folder, but, they are at a different path to the folder, which I will explain later when I make notes of it on my phone.  For now, its just good to be able to use my own pictures which I have from my camera, as well as the pictures from the cell phone camera, which btw is great to use during the daytime in these summer months just starting here in June 2014.  Oh, one last thing, if your laptop or pc has a Bluetooth connection, photos easily transfer over Bluetooth connection, to and from your LG Optimus Dynamic.Hope this info may help or encourage someone regarding this phone.

Order it with the Alcatel A382G \"Big Easy\" with double minutes and 400 Minutes (Tracfone).

Then after verifying adequate service on the LG38C, transfer number and service from your current Tracfone.Con: The native phone has to be unlocked and the icons navigated to get to a clock large enough to read.Pro: A larger clock that appears even when the phone is locked can be easily downloaded.Con: I could not even find a timer on the phone.Pro: I could download a timer I sort of liked better than the 840g timer, but unlike the 840g that stays on while the timer is running, at least with the timer I found the phone turns off after a short time, forcing mr to turn the phone back on and unlock it to get back to the timer. Unacceptable in a stopwatch.Con: This phone does not come with a scientific calculator, just a simple arithemetic calculator.Pro: I was able to download a scientific calculator that is better than that on the 840g, and the native calculator is still available as a large key calculator when scientific functions are not needed.Con: I only get one bar of WiFi in my bedroom.Pro: One bar is apparently enough.Con: I only get one bar of Verizon service in my bedroom.Pro: One bar is apparently enough.Con: The low resolution screen looks terrible next to my 840g.Pro: When my 840g isn't there I don't notice.

If you are a Tracfone user and are thinking of switching to their Android phones...DON'T. We purchased an Android Tracfone for my daughter at Christmas thinking it would be nice for her to have the extra capabilities next year on campus. Triple minutes...sounds great too. On her previous phone a 120 minute card tripled was 360 minutes. A text was 1/3 of a minute so she got 1080 texts. On the new Android phones you get 120 phone minutes, 120 texts, and 120 data minutes. Since my daughter usually texts she was out of texts and had added enough air time to have over 1000 talk minutes built up. We decided to transfer her back to her old phone figuring she could at least use those minutes up before getting a different service. They transferred her number, but the Android phone contract does not allow for transfer of minutes. No service rep (and I talked to too many in the transfer process)mentioned that, and the first rep actually said they WOULD transfer. Her new phone from a different carrier arrives today. They have lost one customer from this family and once my minutes are gone I will be considering new carriers as well.

The very next day, I got a stern verbal warning from the company's owners.
