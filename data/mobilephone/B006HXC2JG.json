This used phone was better than the previous in many respects. However, this phone apparently has an internal flaw. It did not receive signals like my other VX8700. In fact, in my house it would not work at all. In did work in an area that had a good signal. It was consistently one or two signal bars less than other phones in the same area. In general, the VG8700 has been better than most phones and always was able to receive calls when other phones could not. I would buy another VX8700 with out hesitation but my wife purchased a Motorola V3c by mistake, so I will try it. This VX8700 is useless to me. I have no problems with either Amazon or the supplier. I am sure it was not obvious to either that the phone had a flaw.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "AN AMAZING DEVICE", "Author": "56", "ReviewID": "ROKANFEYMNWLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "has an unlimited data capatablei have over 1000 of contacts and still have available space for much more.unlimited data capatableis an amazing device the sound and quality is perfect.the complete phone is a hitand it is not a simple junk it partial metal which helps for security and protectionSIMPLE  A MUST TO HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006HXC2JG"}}
