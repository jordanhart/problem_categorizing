Only thing that is awkward is that the bottom row of letters is off compared to other phones and devices. Before this I had been using a blackberry. When trying to type on the nokia I am always mistyping Ms, Ns and espectially the shift key (which you need to hit to insert any punctuation)", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT", "Author": "Luis Malvestuto", "ReviewID": "R1LCLDVFAFTEQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED.

In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen.  Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon.  I've had it for a week and it works great.  Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook).  It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper.  And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse.  I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2.  Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right.  I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "superb!", "Author": "Tahsin Mowla", "ReviewID": "R2RIXXDW0AJEX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "loved everything about it. also it looks like any other touch phone but is not. which makes it stylish yet classic.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "My dad is very happy.
