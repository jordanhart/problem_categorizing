If you buy this phone you are buying a second-hand Vodophone phone (even though it has not been used) and you will have no support if anything goes wrong after 30 days. My phone's LCD screen failed after about four months, and PUT Group would not assist or replace the phone, and the warranty was not valid (well, I could have either gone to Europe and dealt with Vodophone, or paid BlackBerry ~$200 to fix it).I don't know why this listing still says that there is a warranty, because that is FALSE, and they need to update the information along with price of the phone accordingly.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great in the first year", "Author": "J. Fung", "ReviewID": "R6OGK4Q4IHFE1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At first I thought it's great that each number only has 2 alphabets so texting will be easier. Soon enough, the keys start having problems. When entering someone's number or trying to navigated automated systems where you have to enter numbers, the keys sometimes enter twice or even three times even though you pressed a number once. It gets really annoying. I would recommend that you move onto another phone.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "exelente", "Author": "freddy riveros", "ReviewID": "R2AH2EOPKJINK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "el producto llego r\u00e1pido al destino, excelente servicio; agradecido buena puntuaci\u00f3n,  sin mas que decir y una prointa nueva compra", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ahead of the pack", "Author": "Brickcha", "ReviewID": "R9DVA2DALG6CR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All items including the Pearl 3G received ahead of the scheduled date, will definitely purchased from any one of the 3 companies used during this experience.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay", "Author": "jags", "ReviewID": "R1F05ZFE6U3B4B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well i bought this phone so that it can be used in india.
