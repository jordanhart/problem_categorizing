Overall I am very happy with it:PROS:  - Solid build quality and, unlike most other phones, its not a glossy fingerprint magnet!  - Large and beautiful screen with great color saturation  - Runs fast and is very responsive - I have not encountered any lag  - Wi-Fi Hotspot is easily set up so I can pull e-mail into my iP*d Touch  - Replaceable battery in the event that the battery fails  - Image quality of camera runs circles around *Phone 3GS and is better than IP4  - Sound quality is fabulous for music and great for calls  - USB internet pass-through functionality to save 3G data charges  - Its a small thing but the live wallpapers are beautiful  - Setting up IMAP to pull in Exchange e-mail is easy  - Otterbox makes a very nice case for itCONS:  - Battery life is only so-so - a day and a half at best  - Poor design for SIM card slot - the SIM causes a (slight) unsightly gap on the bottom cover  - Removing and replacing the battery cover is tricky - mine has a tiny gap after it was replaced  - Limited storage (8-Gb micro-SD) for the price - should have been 16-Gb  - Android market is a mess to say it nicely - limited number of good gamesComplaints about the box and size are silly.  Why would you buy a large phone then complain about the size?  I have a 3GS and iP4 for games - but this phone has completely won me over for daily use.

However, it's fairly hard to get hold of in many parts of the world, including where I am stationed at the moment. So I took the fairly drastic step and switched to this phone. I don't want this to be an Apple-versus-HTC review but it's hard not to compare them. As the title says, I can sum this phone up pretty easily: it's the little things that disappoint.It all starts with the box. The thing is ridiculously difficult to open. I am a bit of a fanatic about keeping original packaging, and it was quite difficult to open the box without tearing the one vertical wall to get it to slide out. Once you have it out though, the first two impressions are (almost simultaneously) \"Wow, it's big\" and \"Wow, it's heavy\". You're in no danger of building Mr. Universe muscles hefting it around but it is pretty heavy. Must be that amazing screen.On first holding it, the first \"little thing\" got me. The camera. Its lens housing sticks out a fair bit. I am not an electronics expert and perhaps there is a good reason it does protrude as much as it does but it \"feels\" wrong. It makes me nervous to put the camera down on a flat surface. Most likely I am just being over-cautious but it's an expensive device. The second \"little thing\" was opening the thing to get rid of the protective plastic sleeve around the battery, and insert the SIM card. The battery clips felt very flimsy and you have to exert a fair amount of force to get it out. I see more than one purchase of battery covers in HTC's future. Opening the SIM and SD card slot is also a bit odd. You have to hold the phone upside down and press backwards with both thumbs. Lots of fingerprints on the screen after that (but its a touch-screen phone so fingerprints are inevitable). If you do get one, make sure when you close the SIM slot that you line it up perfectly before pushing it back into the phone. It also feels flimsy but less so than the battery compartment.Once the battery and SIM card are installed and you power it up, things really start looking up. The screen is extremely clear and crisp. The initial phone setup is very intuitive, and, if Bluetooth was working on my iPhone, I would have been able to transfer all of my contacts and messages right then and there. The phone comes with a very decent set of applications. I am sure Android is fairly well reviewed elsewhere so I won't go into any of that (although some of the things that bothered me may be Android-isms and nothing HTC specific).I really like this phone overall. It's web browser is exceptionally responsive and having Flash is very welcome. The camera is amazing. Rather than list all of the things I like about it, I'll discuss the little things that bothered me. Aside from these little things I don't really have any complaints. So if these are the type of things that will bother you, I suggest you play with one for a while before dropping half a month's rent on one.First, when you press the Phone button from the Home screen, it would be very nice if you could set an option not to have the keypad come up. Hunting for the little icon that makes it disappear while driving is a bit of a pain. Also, when you have a headset with mic attached, the lack of voice dialing (when the phone has very good voice recognition in other parts) was very frustrating. Perhaps it's a regional thing.Second, the button at the top of the phone that activates it from idle. It is really, really difficult to press, especially with one hand. If it wasn't so flush with the case and protruded just a millimeter like the one on the iPhone, it would be fine. But turning the phone on while driving can be a bit of a challenge.Third, the placement of the 3.5mm headphone jack. If you have a wired headset plugged in and want to type in landscape mode, its a pain, and gets in the way. If the jack was at the top or bottom edge it would be fine. But its current placement is just annoying.Fourth, the screen is somewhat less responsive than the iPhone's, which is what I was used to. A fair number of times I've had to press a button several times before it \"takes\".Fifth, the ear speaker. You have to hold the phone in a pretty precise spot on your ear to hear well. When its in the right spot it sounds just fine but if you bring the phone up to your ear and you are off by 2 or 3 millimeters, you can hear almost nothing. Once your muscle memory is used to it I'm sure it will be fine, but as I have stated all along, its just these little things that bother me.Last, the interface for the music player is very odd when using the \"remote\" on my headset. I am using Bose on-the-ear headphones with the little one-button control thingy. I can accept a call and end a call, and turn music on or off, but there is no way to skip a track or back a track. Doing a double-click (what I was used to using to skip to the next track on the iPhone) instead calls the previously dialed number. There is no way to go back at all. I wish there was a setting for that.All in all I am extremely happy with the phone. There are endless ways you can customize it and the camera and web browser alone make it worth it for me personally, but it does have some rough edges. I don't think you'd be sorry if you bought one but it will take you a little while to get used to, especially if, like me, you are moving from an iPhone which is just that little bit more intuitive and \"slick\".", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "HTC Desire HD", "Author": "PC", "ReviewID": "R1XZRLZDTG9U1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worth every penny and a great step up from the Blackberry and the iPhone.

The wifi connection do not have a proxy support feature that require to download a third party software.  I have download proxydroid to fulfill this need but until now I still can't use it because it require to root device first and I do not know how to do that.The battery life also short, I could use it around 2 days.

Why you ask?It started gathering dust under the screen!!!! WTH! I pay this much for a phone and dust accumulates by the day under the screen. This is sign of the poor build quality of htc.Furthermore, the sim card cover never fit flush with the rest of the case, always leaving a 1mm gap which I suspect was the cause for the dust. I knew that if I kept the phone longer the dust would be too much to handle. I cannot live with that. I wanted to love this phone so much but it didnt work out between us unfortunately sob.So beware.

It is by far my favorite phone and, man, what a huge upgrade it is from Nokia C6!I'm not going to comment on all the tech specs as this phone is already half-outdated (released at the end of 2010 I believe) in today's tech standards.  The touch screen is extremely responsive yet not overly sensitive.  User interphase takes a moment to adjust to for a Nokia user, but it's fairly easy & friendly once you lay your hands on it.  Picture quality is superb, though I am yet to try out how it works with the flash light (many phone cameras are doomed with taking poor quality pictures when using flash light).  Processor speed is very good - most apps can be downloaded & fully installed within 30 secs (of course, also depends on your connection speed).With all my praises for this phone, I do find a few things that bug me:- battery life: so short.  This is my first HTC but I heard it's a common HTC problem.  But, 75% left after 3 hours of AIRPLANE mode w/ hardly any usage or 85% left after two hour with 3G on but no activities?  This phone would never last an 8-hour day with moderate usage.- sloppy design of the battery lid: feels cheap and very hard to take off & put back.  Every time I do so I feel like I am going to break that little poor piece of plastic.  This bugs me a lot.- poorly designed lid for the SIM card & micro SD card slot: the phone looks perfectly smooth out of the box.  BUT, once you insert a SIM card and put the lid/cover back, the SIM card creates a \"bump\", and the phone is no longer perfectly flat.  Doesn't bother me that much, but HTC should be ashamed of this silly design.  Are they expecting people to use this phone solely as a portable wifi device without a SIM card???- Position & design of the camera: without a phone cover, the way the camera sticks out is doomed for scratches.- Doesn't come with a factory screen protector sheet: ALL cellphones I've purchased brand new, whether the traditional ones (i.e. non-smart) or smart ones, even flip phones, came with a screen protector sheet that can be easily peeled off.  I tend to keep those on for as long as I possibly can as I find them effective enough for protecting my screen.  This phone is the first that came w/o one.  I'm quite disappointed because they fail to provide such little things that cost them literally NOTHING all for the greed of making extras (or in favor of merchants lower in the food chain) from the side products.Overall, pleasant to use but falls short on many little things.

I just switched from a Nokia N97 and believe the switch is awesome! I love this phone! It never crashes (n97 crashes at least onece a week) I love the web browser, you can browse any page you want! the flash capabilities are awesome! it is like surfing in a computer.The 8 mp camera really outstands.  My old n97 waws a 5 mp but it looked like a 3.2 mp.  The flash is really strong as well so I recommend not to take picts of yourself very close it blinds you a bit.  The night pictures are just wonderful!  Love the camera recorder as well, it records at HD 720p if im not wrong.If you are not an android user dont worry it has a very freindly startup setup and it will guide you through the configuration.The only con is the manuals of the internatiional phone, it comes in german so i didnt know how long the phone has to be charged the first time, and it turns to be just until the light turns green.Othe con is the battery, it wont last as you expected but in my case i have it always on 3g because of the internet connection and im always online.GREAT phone the money is worth it.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not sure who to blame", "Author": "Suigeneris", "ReviewID": "R1YQQR9ZK3Z0E2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone worked fine for a few months after I bought it.

If you are out on a street and look at the map which I have to  do a lot, within 30mins the phone will be dead from full battery life. And in stand by mode even I dont us the phone I will have to charge it twice everyday to keep it on. Most often it turns itself off and people can't reach me.2. The browser is clumsy, it doesn't render pages right and the touch operation is awful. To fill in the text field of a form it does all funny things.. it will tey to zoom in to that specific field and will not zoom back, if you try to move around with touching the finger it will take you in a blank space of the browser, it will not do automatic screen rotation even after shaking the device for 2-3 times, if you think you had enough it will not close after tapping the home button many times!3. Doesn't remember the settings of face book. email, alarm or weather...  and as it turns of frequently, I have to keep doing it several times a day... and its a new phone 1 month old.4.

When I bought it, I specically chose the International version, thinking, logically, that I would be able to get international adapters and connectors for it.  Well, to my great dismay and disappointement, it arrived with NO international attachments (see photo of sent adapters)at all, other than the USB to phone connection, which is universal. In order for me to charge the phone, other than the PC connection, even in the US, it was NOT possible.  I was forced to spend money and buy one from Radio Shack, so as to use the much dreamed of, and very expensive, cell phone.  I was contacted by the seller, they apologized and sent me yet another wrong (a US plug, useless for overseas....see picture). Now the seller tells me that they sent me everything that came with the phone, so, as always, its the little guy who gets screwed.  I have NO idea who to contact for, either a refund of what I had to spend or another USB to AC connector for overseas.  As teacher, I'm making sure that my students get to see the frustrations of trying to purchase online.Another serious problem with the phone itself is that the battery, with everything switched off (so sad!!)goes dead only after a few hours, not even lasting a day at work.
