{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ripped Off!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Ripped Off\"", "ReviewID": "R2D9TMDTV1355M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been a Amazon customer for many years and this is the first time that I have had any problem - probably because this product was purchased from Tiger Direct through Amazon. I ordered a new 8120 Blackberry phone as a gift for my daughter. I received a damaged phone (the back would not close ), without any documentation or software. I emailed for an return authorization number packing the phone in the original box that I received it in. After several emails over the next few weeks inquiring about the status of the returned item I finally received the SAME PHONE BACK with Tiger Direct claiming that I had sent in the wrong phone. This is the only Blackberry I have ever purchased so I had no other phone to substitute it for. They claim that the packing has no UAPC code which is true -- BUT IT IS THE SAME BOX IT CAME IN! Long story short Tiger Direct via Amazon send me a defective phone that is the wrong model without any documentation or software. When I send it back they claim it's the wrong phone and cannot accept it. IT IS THE WRONG PHONE YOU IDIOTS  - YOU SENT IT TO ME! DO NOT BUY A PHONE FROM TIGER DIRECT - IT IS A RIP OFF!Joe Ferrari", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best NON-SMART phone I have ever used", "Author": "E. S. Gowen", "ReviewID": "R1X0MBHZS73A6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit that this phone is inferior to many smart-phones that are currently on the market. Those all, however, require a data plan to use. If you are like me and want a quality phone without having to pay for a data plan then this is the phone for you. I have been using a BlackBerry Pearl for the last 6 years, so I am pretty familiar with its pros and cons.Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key.-A smart phone quality calendar.-Very good media player-Bluetooth-Great Address book options.-Unlimited text inbox space; not the 250-500 text limit that virtually all phones have.-Many text search options. Great for when you are looking for that text you need but can't remember when you got it or who sent it.-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc....I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good. I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you.-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned. There are many tutorials online that explain how this should be done. Once cleaned it works like new.-The headphone jack is smaller than is standard for headphones. If you want the standard 3.5mm jack then you probably want to upgrade to the 8120 or 8130.I have used many many phones, but this is far and away the best NON-SMART phone I have ever used.
