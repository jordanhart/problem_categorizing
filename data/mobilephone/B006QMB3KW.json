I was so happy with my older Vivid that I wanted another one like  it.  But, since I have had my new Vivid a few  weeks, I  have  really been disappointed with it.  First, I find out that Google  has  a monopoly  on all games and tells me which games I can download and play.  Google also insists that I  allow them total access to my personal information and a complete list of my contacts before they will allow me to play a game.  They also will not allow downloads from other websites to my phone.  I either have to give them complete access to my personal info or I must purchase the full game in order to play without  ads.  I will not compromise my family and friends, so I haven't been able to play any games on the Vivid, which sucks.  I  had decided  to keep  the  Vivid and use it anyway, but then the charger stopped working. My PC will not recognize the Vivid, so I cannot charge it  or transfer photos to my PC.  There appears too be a loose connection in the usb port.  I am returning the Vivid and will purchase a  different  brand.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"sturf\"", "ReviewID": "RKOD6LL8HOCF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new phone is slim, flat and very convienient to hold.
