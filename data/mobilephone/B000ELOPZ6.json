It has the same problems.  That's three phones out of three - two for me and one for my daughter - with the same problem.  Lockups and intermittent operation.  I finally figured out part of the problem.  Whenever an attempted voice dial fails, whether it was an intentional dial or an accident of pressing the button by mistake or pressing the headset button too long, then the phone will not make or receive any calls until you power it off and on again.  At least now, if I am really careful how I handle it, my phone works most of the time.  My suggestion is not to buy this phone for another 6 months or a year!Original review follows:This is a great phone when it works.  There was a report this week on CNN about the RAZR phones that were sold late February 2006 and early March 2006 being recalled for a software bug.  It is my guess that the SLVR, which is a close relative of the RAZR, has the same bug because my SLVR only works about half the time.  Most of the time, when I try to make a call, the display will say \"Calling xxxxxxx\" but it just hangs there until I click End, even up to 20 minutes with nothing happening.Any time I don't use my bluetooth headset for a few hours and then try to use it, the bluetooth on the phone will have quit working and to get it working again, I have to power the phone off and on again.My daughter has the same phone and has the same problems.When it works, though, it is a great phone.  The iTunes holds only 100 songs, like the other reviews said, but that's an iTunes issue - it treats this like an iPod Nano.Cingular is sending me a replacement for my SLVR and, hopefully, it will work better and have these issues resolved.  In the mean time, I suggest giving more time for the bugs to be worked out.  Once it becomes more reliable, I would highly recommend the phone.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "The coolest Phone I ever Had!", "Author": "Go Paris Go \"go paris go\"", "ReviewID": "RKMHNNE46AOU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say I was a bit shocked when I read some of the negative reviews. I buy a new cell phone every couple of months. I got this SLVR thru Cingular. But I like new gadgets. So, sometimes I buy an unlocked phone and change the sim. I have tried countless phones from Nokia, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson and Panasonic. This is my favorite so far. It is thin, sleek and easy to operate. I always laugh when I hear people complain of the Motorola menu or interface. These are people that most-likely started out on a different brand and expect every cell phone manufacturer to use that same menu. Every brand has their quirks. And, most cell phone users have their quirks.On my SLVR I have 50 songs loaded with room for that many more. It accepts the super-small Transflash card, included. I love the fact that there is also an included connection from the USB port that allows you to use your own headphones. In addition, no one makes better bluetooth headsets than Motorola and this phone connects to it easily, with a crisp clear sound.The only thing I would change is the color. It is a deep, almost black, brown color. I would prefer silver or matte black.

I love everything about it; size, function, quality, battery life, iTunes. The ONLY negative thing I can say about it is that it has USB 1 and not the faster USB 2. But the phone charges itself while it's connected to the computer updating iTunes so the slow download doesn't bother me.Apple has limited the phone to 100 songs. The 512MB micro card is sufficient for about 75 songs at a time (saved at 192kb) - not a 60GB iPod, but plenty for on-the-go music enjoyment. The iTunes integration with the phone is very nice; sleek and easy, but you cannot use iTunes for ringtones (those MP3's are stored in on the internal 5MB memory - like on other phones that utilize MP3 ringtones).", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Looks great, but big volume problem", "Author": "lostarchitect \"lostarchitect\"", "ReviewID": "RSGKWOME77P1S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Honestly, I really do like my SLVR. It's sleek and it does everything it's supposed to do. But there is one major problem: the iTunes volume control. iTunes has volume settings 0-7, with \"0\" being silent. The problem is that setting \"1\" is as loud as my regular ipod turned up to 2/3 of its maximum volume! this is just too loud a lot of the time. I couldn't use it in the office or when I wanted to listen quietly. It's even a little too loud for walking around outside.I contacted Motorola about this, but they denied that it was a widespread problem and said they had no plans to fix it, even though it has been mentioned in reviews of the phone. I was forced to do a sloppy fix by buying some new headphones with an in-line volume control. This works for listening to iTunes, but creates another problem. With the included heaphones, if the phone rings while you are listening to music, you can just press a button on the cord to answer. With any other headphones, you must fish the phone out of your pocket and disconnect the cord before you can answer. It's not a major thing, but it is an annoyance.", "Date": "March 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Unlocked SLVR & Mac. Read this...", "Author": "Bardo", "ReviewID": "R2GBPGXUN286MY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got an unlocked SLVR a couple weeks ago and am really pretty happy with it.  As a prior user of three Sony Ericsson phones, I became used to their intuitive user interface and how seamlessly they synched up with my Mac and PC. There's also a lot of software available for the SE's.  It's possible that the SLVR is still too new, and that's the reason for the limited the level of intependent software available for it.  The phone reception is a bit better than the SE (T610) and tends to work in places my T610 didn't.  The music interface on the SLVR works just like iTunes (songs, genres, albums artists, etc.), but it doesn't sync up via iTunes on your computer like your iPod does.  Rather you must drag+drop the music onto the phone's SIM card (there are a couple different ways to do this, which aren't too difficult) It's just too bad this isn't seamless via iTunes like the Cingular versions. As for new software/firmware updates, I spoke with R&D; at Moto, and they said there aren't any plans to make the non-Cingular versions compatible with iTunes, nor are they working on a Mac version of their synching software.  The phone does sync nicely if you use iSync to sync it with your Mac Address Book or Entourage, however.  In all I recommend this phone for many of its useful features and stunning good looks... and I'm just getting used to keying and scrolling through the somewhat antiquated and cumbersome address book.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "slvr is a great phone", "Author": "clarinetgrammy", "ReviewID": "R3PBCAEQ09SQW7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reviewing dozens of quad-band multi function phones, I decided on Cingular's Motorola SLVR7 and am not disappointed in it at all.

It's not clear why the vastly more popular RAZR isn't available in the US with iTunes rather than the less spectacular SLVR model.  I've always had flip phones.  I like them for compactness and their screen/keyboard protection.Basically SLVR is RAZR in a candy bar form factor.  It's a little too tall to fit in a pants pocket for sitting down.  As this is a new phone, accessories are hard to come by, including custom holsters.iTunes works as advertised.  The interface is adequate if not a peppy as an iPod.  The 100-song limit is a mystery except maybe they wanted to disguise the slow upload speed.  It has a very PC-like interface so it's pretty clunky to navigate. (Rumors of Apple designing a phone make me hope that finally a firm with some user interface expertise will enter the cell phone market!)Motorola's radio electronics are the best in the business, but the rest of the hardware is poorly designed.  The keyboard is difficult to use.  I have to press the keys with my fingernails to not double press keys -- and I have small hands!  The bizarre EMU Port isn't compatible with anything, so can only use Motorola's awful headset with the phone AND iTunes.  There are no quality stereo headsets with microphones (wired or unwired) that will allow you to use both as of this writing.  I suspect this is true for RAZR as well.  My phone did come with a 3.5mm adapter to plug in good headphones, but when the phone rings you have to unplug the EMU adapter to answer a call.  I tried using an adapter with my 2.5mm headset but I could only hear sound for system tones and iTunes. When it switched to phone mode, the sound was muted and apparently the microphone didn't work either. The phone needs an ESC(ape) key to help dig yourself out of dead-end menus for which none of the 3 choices is what you want.  It could also use a HOME key to quickly take you back to the top menu, rather than having to go backward 15 levels.I could live without the camera, which takes only fair pictures.  Many places now confiscate your phone if it has a camera. The Cingular version wastes a lot of valuable storage real estate with silly \"protected\" images and movies that you can't delete.The web browser is too slow, clunky (and expensive on Cingular) to be useful. I downloaded a few games.  This was easier to do on my computer then have them sent to the phone.  Their performance is acceptable but the screen is really too small -- if you want games, I'd suggest something the size of a Blackberry.  Also, the phone keypad is pretty useless if you want to do any kind of text messaging.Although the manual says you can't use iTunes for ringtones (which is true) you can use standard mp3s.  You just have to connect the USB cable and drag them to the mounted RAM card, then move them to the phone RAM and assign the tone. You could also email them to yourself.  Any music or sound effect could be used as a ring tone but you will need some kind of editing software (or use Trim in Apple Quicktime) to keep the length under 20 seconds.  Copy protected material will have to be burned to CD first then re-imported.  It seems silly to pay $2 for a 20 second ringtone when you could buy the whole song on iTunes (or perhaps you already paid for it), but you will have to go through a few steps to prep it for ringtones.  Just to be clear though, you can't use ringtones directly from iTunes, you can only use sounds stored in the multimedia folder.SLVR syncs (using iSync) with my Macintosh calendar and address book very well.  Each phone number on someone's \"card\" in your address book becomes a separate \"card\" in the phone, so this can be a bit of a hassle to scroll through.  You'd get even more cards if you turn on the mail and fax number feature (defaults off).  The calendar sync has a bug duplicating repeating events with each sync.  Otherwise the functionality of the phone calendar and phone book are acceptable.The voice recognition feature works fine but unlike phone network-based systems, you will have to teach the phone each name (twice). A daunting task for several hundred names.Voicemail integration with Cingular is non-existent.  It dials the voicemail number but then you're on your own with a generic DTMF interface.  They on-screen commands do nothing.The phone has fax capabilities but apparently no scripts to interface with computers. And I couldn't find any for RAZR either. This seems to me to be part of basic business functionality. Sure you could fax a note from the text interface on the phone...you might have this sentence typed in 2 hours.This is the first new phone I've bought in 5 years and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the overall lack of integration to the phone network and standard computer peripherals.  Manufacturers waste too much R&D; on coming up with new designs and geeky gimmicks like ring tones while you still can't send a fax from your PC.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Unlocked version lacking Bluetooth and USB", "Author": "Tom Digiurco \"tdigiurco\"", "ReviewID": "R1X1YZM1SSN4G6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The SLVR L7 (in my opinion) is one of the sleekest, feature-packed cell phones out there. Unfortunately, my provider (T-Mobile) doesn't offer this phone, so I went with this unlocked phone from Amazon.com.

ALL menu options for connecting a Bluetooth device are not only disabled, but are completely missing from this phone. To add injury to insult, the features that would allow you to connect the phone to a PC via USB are also missing/disabled.I confirmed this through a lengthy call to Motorola's tech support, who informed me that it would be impossible to enable the Bluetooth on the unlocked phone - even IF they did support it. Which they do not.The bottom line is that the phone's firmware cannot be updated to enable Bluetooth. For me, this is a dealbreaker ... especially living in California, where it will be illegal to drive and talk on a cell phone without a headset beginning in January, 2008.

I got this phone for free when I signed up for a TMobile plan (if you are asian you know how to get this phone for free).Anyhow why the heck did I ever get this phone???  Everyone who has owned a RAZR has complained about their phone, but the salesperson (stupid me) convinced me that the RAZR was a significant upgrade from the RAZR and that I WON'T get the problems like the RAZR.  Also, the RAZR had only 3 upgrades v1, v2, and v3 whereas the SLVR had upgrades L5, L6, and L7.  You know what folks?  Those upgrades don't mean jack since they really don't help out at all.So what are the PROS and CONS of this phone???PRO:-I have bragging rights on people who have never seen such a thin phone (pshhhh!!!)-It fits in my pocket so discretly-Bluetooth works well with a Motorola Bluetooth ear piece, I had to switch to a Jabra one when I lost my Motorola Bluetooth and now I'm having all sorts of static problemsCONS:-Compared to my OLD cheap Nokia, this phone reception is severly crappy.  I get so many drop calls per day, I don't have enough fingers to count (this only happens while driving) (sigh I miss my old Nokia)-Battery life is NOT like my old Nokia, this phone needs to be charged about 1 1/2 days (if lucky 2 days) but that is rare.-the OS is super slow.  When scrolling down from name to name, this thing doesn't move fast.  IE when moving from Kathy to Kelly, the interface doesn't respond as fast as you wish.  So sometimes it takes a tad longer to move from point A to point B.  and this isn't just the phonebook, it is on almost every movement in the phone.-Bluetooth... I dunno, I seemed to be \"OK\" when using a bluetooth earpiece but when I switched to a JABRA it didn't seem to well (see my JABRA review for that)-Yes I know this doesn't operate like my old cheapo Nokia phone but that phone just worked.  If you folks want a phone to work as a phone, stick with Nokia.  I don't know why I keep on going back to Motorola but this is my 3rd one and although my first 2 were pretty good, this one stinks!!!-Oh and camera quality is really really really bad.  Not even a full megapixel.I could go on but I got stuff to do.  I laid down the basics for everyone.So what is the answer folks?  If you want a phone that doesn't work so well but to showoff (stupid me) then get this phone.  If you want a phone to operate as a phone and not drop off from the face of this planet, get a Nokia or NEC or a SONY.  Those puppies work great.

Camera! Video! MP3 Player! Look how stylish and sexy this phone is! I get so many compliments!But after the heady honeymoon days of novelty are over, this phone demonstrates some serious, irritating flaws. Let's look at some.1. The physical design. At first blush, this phone looks great. And it really does. It is very compact, and yet it has a heavy feel, leaving the holder with the sense of \"quality.\" Yet because of this, the phone is easy to drop (more so than other phones I feel). If you want to do \"low tech handsfree,\" i.e. wedge the phone between your shoulder and ear, forget it. The person on the other end of the line won't be able to understand you, and you'll probably just drop it anyway. So it's physically attractive, but not particularly practical.2. Battery life. Not bad at first, but if you own this baby for a few months, the battery life diminshes rapidly.3. User interface. Again, it seems really cool at first. Look, ma, at all the things I can do! But once you get over that, and just want to modify basic things, you realize that the interface is clumsy with a lot of confusing submenus. Bad, bad motorolla.4. Picture quality of the camera. Atrocious, given the price of the phone. Much older phones give you better quality photos. What a joke. The pictures of such poor quality, I don't even bother taking any with this phone. What's the point?5. The MP3 player. Little did I know that I'd have to get special earphones to listen to mp3s on this phone. And again, the sound quality just isn't that great. Considering you can get a \"decent\" mp3 player for around 20 bucks, there is no excuse that this phone should have such a worthless one. Also, see no. 2, supra.6. Other little annyoing things about this phone. If you unplug your phone from its charger while the screen is \"on\" the \"phone is recharged\" message will stay on your screen, where the date is supposed to be. Not a big deal, but annoying. Also, I get blank text messages from a phantom sender every time I get off the phone with the voice mail. I've tried everything, and can't figure out how to stop it--if you know, I'd appreciate the help.In conclusion, this phone is all style over substance.

And on the functionality department.. it lacks numerous advanced capabilities:- Camera quality is very poor. This is a VGA quality phone, you won't get the same quality as megapixel camera phones- If you guys buy the unlocked phones, you won't get iTunes. It's a given. The agreement between Motorola, iTunes and Cingular is to sell phones in the U.S. with lower cost but restricted capabilities. For example, if you buy this phone in Europe (or some auction sites) - you'll be able to use a 512 MB trans flash card and comes with a standard MP3 digital player. However, if you buy this phone through Cingular in the U.S., you're limited to the 128 MB card and only up to 100 songs on your iTunes. They don't allow for more than 100 songs (again because of the U.S. contract agreement between those 3 companies)- SMS (Text Messaging) is overtly complicated on this phone. It lacks the ease of use of dictionaries and auto text input like Nokia phonesBut I have to give it props for the style and design. Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing. It looks awesome and it's realy an eye catcher.

I never had it in a case and always carried it in my back pocket and very rarely carried it in my purse.PROSThe speakerphone and regular earpiece were always clear (unless there was crappy reception.)Small enough to fit in my back pocket without even feeling it.Battery lasted FOREVER!!

I probably sent about 20 texts and spent 3ish hours daily on the phone and would only need to recharge it twice a week.iTunes was a nice feature.The flat keys seemed difficult to begin with, but after getting used to them were much easier to use when typing quickly.Can assign the soft keys and middle arrow keys to be whatever shortcuts you want--I've had other phones that don't have this feature.

I have used many other (non-iPod) mp3 players and was happy with their performance. I read a lot of the SLVR L7 and bought the refurb version through cingular. Out of the box the phone is exceedingly simple to set up and use. iTunes definitely makes a difference by updating your phone with any changes you've made to your library each time you connect your phone to your PC. YES the phone does only hold 100 songs but SIZE is not always BETTER. When I used a 10 gig MP3 player I still only listened to about 5 to 10 albums at a time, which, with the right settings, can easily fit on the SLVR. I've read other reviews that compare this phone's performance to much more high-end phones like Blackberry. This is obviously an unfair comparison since the SLVR isn't even in the same category.

I wanted to stay with a Motorola phone because I have Motorola Phone Tools software setup to synch with my Lotus Notes contacts and calendar. This makes my phone SO much more useful to me. Its the ONLY thing I liked about the RAZR. When the Verizon store said I could bring it back in 30 days for whatever reason, I figured I had nothing to lose. I am genuinely pleased after 3 days of heavy use.Software: At first glance you will think that its using the same software as your RAZR. But its definitely improved.* The \"Say a Command\" function is MUCH improved -- and not only because its more polite (\"PLEASE say a command\"). Its much faster at responding and its  slightly more intuitive at guiding you through a command.* The menus system seems to respond much faster to key entry.* The menus have been reorganized slightly. Items are laid out more logically.Other major differences that I have noticed after 3 days of heavy use:* Keypad buttons are much smaller than the RAZR. No biggie. They were pretty large on the RAZR.* The side buttons are flush and less likely to be bumped while holding the phone (big problem I had with the RAZR). Of course, placement of the lens for the camera is alot less likely to result in a pic of a finger.* While the screen continues to perform poorly in sunlight, the SLVR is probably 15-20% better than the RAZR was. If you haven't noticed, most every slim phone has a dim screen in daylight.* The battery seems to hold a charge significantly better than the RAZR. After a day of use, my RAZR would be on one bar by the end of the workday. I had a heavy use day and the SLVR is on 3 of 4 bars now.The Music Essentials kit and a micro SD card are a must for any music lover. Audio is surprisingly good for a phone. The headset that comes with the kit doesn't carry bass as well as I would like, but its definitely adequate. I plan to transfer audio books onto the phone and listen to them via my car stereo's audio input.Edit: After two months of HEAVY daily use, the battery is still holding up much, much better than any of the RAZR batteries I ever hard.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Phone Ive Had So Far", "Author": "M.

The only thing is that you need to convert videos down a bit so that it can play on your phone.  I use itoovideo software.  You can download the shareware which works great for me.  I use 200bit rate 18fps 16000khz audio 174x144 screen size.  It clips look awesome.  If you really wanted you can fit two full movies on the 512 card, but I personally wouldnt watch a whole movie on a phone.Cons-In the direct sunlight you cant really see the screen well-the camera is absolutely horrible 0.3MP camera.  A simple VGA, and just fuzzy as hell.  Dont even try the video capture.  It sucks.  Choppy, out of sync, horrible resolution.  I guess everything cant be good.-The worst thing of all is that it drops calls all the time, and has horrible reception.  It will say its dialing for minutes without saying anything.

While it is all of these things, it has some serious shortcomings.  True:  this phone is going on three years old since it was first introduced, but I expected better from Motorola.First, the good.  The form factor is really nice.  It's super thin and nice to carry in your pocket.  The camera is decent, especially for being VGA resolution.  The screen is bright, and the phone looks really sleek.But with the good comes the bad:  Due to its thin-ness, it can be uncomfortable to hold in your hand for extended periods, and it can be uncomfortable against the ear as well.  It might not be so uncomfortable if the earpiece volume were sufficient but that is not at all the case.  Even at the maximum volume, this phone is almost impossible to hear in areas with any significant background noise.  Just walking outside near a reasonably quiet street can completely overwhelm the earpiece.  This is unacceptable to me.  The keys are incredibly small, as well.  I have fairly large hands, and this is a small form factor phone after all, so this may not be the most valid criticism, but I find myself constantly hitting # when I want to hit 9, and end or the circle key when I mean to hit 3.  I have to use my fingernails to press the buttons.  It's infuriating.Finally, the phone I received was clearly a remanufactured item.  There is a deep gouge in the phone housing underneath the battery cover and a slight scratch on the side of the phone.  Also, it did not include a set of earphones, and the accessories looked to have been just thrown into the box; there was no protective packaging for the accessories nor the phone itself.In all, the phone isn't what I thought it would be, and I'm returning it, and the lack of sufficient earpiece volume was really the final nail in the coffin.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "If you have Cingular, don't even!", "Author": "R.

Older phones I've had were much more usable out of the box.MENUS:I changed the home screen buttons around to have the items I use the most - SMS, recent calls, and calendar, and to put phone book where I'm used to it being.  I also changed menu order.  Some moron put Tools under the Settings menu; that can't be fixed.  Since when is a Tool a kind of Setting?  Maybe it makes more sense in whatever language the developers speak.PHONE BOOK.I changed the phone book listing format - this was CRUCIAL to making it usable.  It has its own Setup menu, separate from Settings. These made it usable, especially View and View by:-- View by:list, Sort by:name, View:Primary Contacts, Search Method: Jump To.  I synchronize my phone book with my Mac iBook using the FREE iSync, for easy data entry and for backup.STORAGE:ESSENTIAL: I changed where it stores images, games, and ringtones (from the phone to the memory card), which allowed me to transfer images to my computer, transfer games to & from my computer (e.g. cellufun's free sudoku, chess, etc.), and use an mp3 as a ringtone.  This should be possible from the phone's internal memory, but it isn't, so WOW - knowing that this change makes is possible makes the phone MUCH BETTER than I thought it was at first.  Also, these settings (and some others too) get lost if the phone loses power and have to be reset; this is LAME!BLUETOOTH:It works well with the cardo scala-500 I got from amazon.  I set up a shortcut for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. FYI, if you get a bluetooth headset, be warned that it can't be used to listen to music; in fact, if you have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music through the built-in speaker.

So with the name Julie, if you have 14 friends or businesses that start with J, you jump to the first J and then have to scroll down (or guess that it is closer to go to K and scroll backwards).- if you have contacts listed by their first name, you can NOT look up someone by their last name without going through about 4 menus to get to the \"find\" function.- the display font is somewhere between 7pt and 9pt, with no ability to change the size.

When you push any key, the display lights up, and you get to see the message for 1/10th of a second.  If you force yourself to ALWAYS push the speakerphone button before EVER doing any other function, like dialing a number, then you can see what was on the display before it went dark.  You may think this is no big deal; but it means if you ever set your phone down, and then leave the room, you must always push the speakerphone button when you pick up the phone, or you lose your reminder / alert.  This also impacts . . .- you can press down on the volume key to go to vibrate mode.  However, one more accidental bump of that key, which happens even in my motorola belt clip, makes the phone go silent.  So, you get a screen message for an incoming call, an alarm, a calendar alert, etc.- You can add several numbers to a name; but accessing more than the first one is a pain. (sometimes the right scroll button brings up the next number, usually not).  What impacts this is - if you loaded names and numbers (addresses are dropped) from your Outlook, and then you add a fax or cell number to someone who is already listed, that number is not sequentially in the phone, and so the number can NOT be accessed by scrolling with the right scroll button.  This was VERY easy on Motorola's i930, and phone types were marked with little letters, like m for mobile, h for home, w for work.  This phone has tiny icons, and if you make something the \"main\" contact number, you lose all traces as to whether that was home, mobile, whatever.- when I first got the phone with the Motorola Phone Tools (paid extra) I could copy pictures and MP3s to and from the phone; but my calendar and phone book would not sync with Outlook.  Motorola sent me a \"fix\".  Now Outlook calendar and phone book sync; but I can not put MP3s or photos to and from the phone anymore.- with my previous Audiovox, Kyocera, Nokia and Motorola phones I never found myself saying \"what did you say?\".  Now that happens at least every other day (I'd say I average 10 to 20 calls a day).- speakerphone volume is the lowest of any phone I have ever owned.- video volume is less than half of what I would get with the i930.  I recorded several songs done by a 100 person womans choral group.  Live they thundered the room.  I stood about 20 feet away to record video (maybe to even use as a ring tone).  When I play these wonderfully full-sounding songs for people, they have to hold the phone near their ear to hear the recording - so they can't see the video at the same time.  The Motorola i930 recorded and played well.What do I like?- setting up the bluetooth was easy, and it syncs right back up when I turn on the headset.  I only use the bluetooth a few calls per week, so I appreciate that it syncs up well.- the menus are customizable.  So I have four functions (most allowed) on the main screen which are things I use often  One item is my MP3 player; but I can no longer put music on the phone.- the phone is small; but not too small.- the screen is decent size.- it has a micro-sd slot; but it is under the battery.  My phone did not come included with a micro-sd card.  Of no use anymore to me since I can not copy pics or music to or from the phone.- the phone is sturdy- the camera zooms in nice - but I can't get the pics off the phone to comment on the quality.This phone does not have any benefits to me over the RAZR and isn't half the phone of the i930.  Before someone comments the i930 costs more, it was free with my last service, I went out of my way to pay $100+ extra to get the SLVR.  I would in hindsight have saved my money and gone with the RAZR or I would buy a different brand if given the chance.", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Cool phone", "Author": "Mystic \"Tulip\"", "ReviewID": "R1O54HR9R1P3YV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has it all!

They had just gotten in the pink one and the idea of iTunes was a huge turn on for an obsessive iPod user.  The phone in general is horrible and had to be replaced once. After about three weeks of having the thing it decided to hang up on who I was talking to exactly 13 minutes into the conversations. On top of that the people I would be talking to could hardly hear me and I could barely hear them even on loud volume. However I will say that Cingular did exchange the phone with roughly no questions asked; great customer service. The keypad is a bit hard to use so if you like to text this isn't the best phone. If you use the calander function on your phones forget about this one. All of the softwear is the same as the Razr which is highly unimpressive. Everything on this phone scratched so easily it was irritating. I'd even keep this thing in a leather case and it'd somehow scratch!

Some good did come with this phone. iTunes was an interesting feature I actually enjoyed. The music sounded very nice despite not going up loud enough for certain situations. I also liked how if you had a message or a call coming in it'd turn the music off so you could answer. The sound of MusicTones was also very good. The bad things about the iTune function was that it took just about forever to load the songs and you could only put 120 songs on it. The hot pink color was pretty cool too. But that was about it.  I put aside my Treo for this. One piece of junk for another.

Yes unless you press a button, the backlight doesn't come on. I don't wear a watch so my phone has always been my watch. Imagine the fustration when you remember locking your keypad as in above and decide to look at the time. Oh now I have to unlock the phone first because of the nag screen before I can see the clock. Fabulous.I have probably more issues with the phone but this is where I will stop. A cellphone must first and foremost do what it's supposed to do. Make calls.What I have is a phone that has bad reception, susceptible to buttons pushed while in pocket and unable to see any missed calls without pushing the button.", "Date": "July 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Can anyone tell me how to open the battery door?", "Author": "Wenjia Liu", "ReviewID": "RRDQ224GHTTVQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My Gosh!

Lawler", "ReviewID": "R3OMZTCXG7J8LD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this unlocked phone for a couple of reasons: to try to improve my erratic Cingular service, especially at my house, and to break free from the chains of my contract. On the first count, the phone does no better, or no worse, than my old phone, which is a bit frustrating, but oh well. At least I am not on a contract.This unlocked phone came with a manual in Arabic and a European-plug recharger cable. A converter to US plug was included in the box. Many of the features I have seen on friend's Cingular SLVR's were missing, including the iTunes software. There is probably some way to hack it on there.The camera is fairly decent for a tiny cell cam, it does the trick.All in all, it's a decent phone. For me it's a stop gap until the iPhone arrives.", "Date": "March 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "The worest cell phone I've ever used.", "Author": "Y. Tang", "ReviewID": "RZ4QL0I9X62U1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be honest, my old Nokia 6210 works much better than this piece of junk.  For example, I used to get at least 3 bars at home by using Nokia 6210; nevertheless, my NEW L7 gives me zero bar most of the itme. In order to make a phone call, I would go to my bathroom where the signal exists.In addition, the original battery is so cheap, which can only last one day. I need to charge the battery every night just in case it won't shut off during the middle of tomorrow.Recommendation: 1. If you live in suburban areas like me, you should avoid this phone for any cost.2. If you don't have a car charger or you travel often, try a phone that can stay up longer.  Otherwise, buy a couple of extra batteries if you think you are so rich.Overall, why should you pay hundreds of dollars for this phone when you can get other great cell phones for free when sign up a plan?", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Seems OK", "Author": "Michael R.
