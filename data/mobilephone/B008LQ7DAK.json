{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Verizon version is no good", "Author": "Frank Rizzo", "ReviewID": "R1HTG0QD0GQY87", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you're interested in this phone, I do not recommend the Verizon version. Verizon has crippled the software and will not provide any valid reason or a way to unlock the full potential of this device. If you like this phone, you will be better off getting it on AT&T; or T-Mobile's network, because they have not crippled the software. Even Google Wallet is disallowed on this device, which is touted as having \"NFC\" capabilities, a very cool and convenient feature that Verizon has blocked out. The Sprint version allows you to utilize your phone's NFC chip with Google Wallet to make purchases at stores with paypass scanners. If you buy the Verizon version your NFC chip will go to waste and the full potential to customize your phone will not be available to you unless Verizon decides to change their mind about this.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Locked bootloader.", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R1WYHAD6DVHAFE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Excellent phone, but lets face it, it is severely handicapped with a locked bootloader.

So far signal wise I do i'll give them that. HOWEVER! With Sprint I was able to use my Samsung Epic Touch 4G to it's full extent because it was mine and did not contain a locked down bootloader! Not to mention I can't even use Google Wallet which is an awesome feature! Wish I could use it. If anyone is looking at different carriers and Verizon as a possible option, if you care at all about your phone, I would highly not recommend Verzion! Their reasoning behind locking the bootloader on the Samsung Galaxy SIII, to maintain the \"said\" great customer support and solid network performance is a full faced excuse! Verizon's response? Oh it's Samsungs fault, they wanted to lock the bootloader... Ok Verizon get real, there are three other U.S. Carriers and ALL three of them have the SGSIII bootloader UNLOCKED, if this was the case, I'm pretty sure Samsung would have kept it that way across the board. Verizon's second response, oh ok well we can offer to sell a developer edition phone with an unlocked bootloader at a marked up price! NO! NO ONE is going to buy the developer edition especially after pre-ordering a device that should have been unlocked in the first place! Verizon I hope you can somehow make this right as I will not stay a customer for very long, nor will my family.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phone is great but Verizon messed up", "Author": "Slinger05", "ReviewID": "R2V4Q9AESCUJDT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone has so much more potential.  I bought this phone thinking the bootloader would be unlocked but come to find out its been blocked by Verizon, not Samsung.  I'll probably return it since they decided to block the bootloader and go with another carrier.  Nice move Verizon.

Just about every single app I download for it that is listed to work on the Galaxy S3 doesn't.  I have contacted three of the developers (people who wrote the apps) and they all told me the Verizon version of this phone is nothing but a head ache for developers its software is a nightmare.  I have had to Factory reset my phone four times because of these incompatibility reasons.  I contacted Verizon and they told me the software is different because of security reasons???? and that using software like the other companies use (Sprint AT&T; and T Mobile) will diminish the Android experience!  Being able to use half the apps that the other phones have and having your phone lock up on half of the ones you are told you can down load....what an experience nice work Verizon.

And the funniest part is they said unlocking the bootloader can cause damage to their network yet now samsung is releasing a DEVELOPER EDITION with an unlockable bootloader on VERIZON WIRELESS...well VERIZON what happened to harming your network you obviously had to give that the OK to use on your network proving your feeding us nothing but lies...thanks again verizon for ruining something that could of been great.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good", "Author": "Ashley Harris", "ReviewID": "R2R72RB3T4DKNQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone came in quick and everything was in great condition when I received it.
