{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Cheap Phone for Occasional Use", "Author": "Full Cleveland", "ReviewID": "R21AB51GIDVJHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not really a fan of cell phones because of the silly and discourteous ways they're used by so many. But there are times they come in handy, even for me.I make three or four business trips a year, plus an out-of-town vacation or two, and the cell phone is really a major convenience on those occasions. But the absence of one has never bothered me enough to make me commit to an expensive phone, much less a long-term contract.I noticed some prepaid phones at a supermarket a few months ago, and did a little research. I was able to get the Aloha for $19.99, bought a $20 card for Virgin Mobile service, and was up and running for only $40.So far, I've used the phone in Cleveland, Denver and Phoenix with good results. No dropped calls, and pretty good call quality. The phone is easy enough to use that you won't forget how if you put it away for a few days, and the storage of contacts, plus the scheduler make the phone worth the money and then some.If you're a cell phone buff, or want to impress your friends, this isn't the phone for you. No camera or outside display. Volume could be a little louder, and you've got to position the phone just right for best results. But at this price, it's a great phone for the light user, or as a temporary phone, or for someone who does not have good credit or prefers not to give out a credit card number.If you fall into these categories, the Aloha is an excellent choice.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Elle P. \"poptart18\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZNE529SA4SNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading the reviews, I was wary, but I'd already bought the phone.  So when I got it I instead tested it to see if it did what one reviewer said.  The phone DID NOT stay on after I closed it.  It cut the call off just like it should.  I don't know what that person did to his/her phone, but mine works perfectly.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "It's a great phone for the money", "Author": "AlwaysFlying", "ReviewID": "R2BDXDS3UFUSX0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am amazed that people slam this phone.  I purchased one for $14.99 at a national chain store.  What an amazing piece of technology for a mere 15 dollars. It's not perfect, but come on, if you want perfection go spend a couple of hundred dollars.  Or, go and commit to a two year contract before you have even tried the service. My hat is off to Sir Branson and Virgin Mobile.  I don't want a contract.  I don't use the phone much but I like having it available for the occassional use.  What a great convenience at an affordable price.  Virgin Mobile and the LG Aloha have delivered in spades.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "No problem", "Author": "Birdie \"Bklynbrd\"", "ReviewID": "R3JTLGLZ4XDFCQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had no problem with the phone no problem with the service.  You get what you paid for with prepaid.  I always click the end when I end a call, instead of just closing the lid.

In other words, if I want to call someone, it works.  If someone wants to call me, it works. The occasional text message, no problem.  Good display, decent keypad.  Easy to understand, I mean, it's a phone for criminy sakes.  The price, fantastic.  I paid 15 bucks for it, and it works EXACTLY as advertised. I love Virgin Mobile!  No BS, no tricks, no hidden fees, just great service at a very fair price.  Well done.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!!", "Author": "Crystal N.

I tried Virgin Mobile as I heard that they have the best prepaid phones on the market.  I got the Aloha on sale for $10.00.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It has great call quality.  It's very simple to use, especially for texting.  it doesn't have alot of bells & whistles, but it's a great basic phone.  It has 2 calculators.  i would recommend it for teenagers and for budget-conscious adults.  You can check your balance with the press of a button.  the only thing I wish they would improve on it, is the volume.  it could be a little louder.  For a mobile phone that costs under $20.oo, it's terrific.  Also a great phone for someone who wants a spare, back-up phone.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Practical Phone", "Author": "CarmenLilly", "ReviewID": "R1UV8FNJFPXD4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this aloha phone from virgin mobile for about one year now.  I was sick and tired of being ripped off by companies and their ridiculous contracts.  First you are quoted one price and as the months go by, your bill keeps getting higher.  My  sister told me about virgin mobile. Can you believe this phone only cost me $10.00 ( mind you, even 30 minutes were included). First when you get the package, you, yourself can activate the phone on your computer at home. You choose your plan and you are set.  True, the activation process takes about an hour if your not familiar with the process. If you need help, virgin mobile customer services reps can be reached. I find that it takes about 5 minutes to get one on the phone but they are very helpful and will walk you through the process. This simple phone is not extravagant, not beautiful, just  simple looking.  But I will tell you that I've never had a dropped call. I hear my caller, loud and clear and have no problems with a poor  connection. I also use the text and data pack.  I can go on the web and read my e-mail, check the weather, surf the web, etc. It doesn't have a camera and the screen is small and not big like other cell phones.  But it is a basic phone, and the thought of purchasing a $100-250.00 cell phone is hard to bear when I'd rather spend that money on food for my family. This little baby has been good to me.  When I'm low in minutes, I've set it up directly to my bank account and can have minutes on it within 1 minute.  If you are sick and tired of being sold into getting the best, most expensive cell phone, I can assure you that you will save money.  I pay about $70 for 600 anytime minutes and unlimited night/weekend minutes, 1000 text messages and 20mb of unlimited virgin internet access. (I'm still learning about MB). The best thing is that if I'm strapped for money, I can change my plan and buy less minutes.  As opposed to a company with a contract who will be more than happy to turn off my service and then charge me a reconnection fee.  Yeah, its simple but there is a certain beauty to simplicity :)", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Plan, Not so great phone", "Author": "Elizabeth.Samford", "ReviewID": "R3IDRTTDAFLD1U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really excited to get this phone because it was so affordable, It arrived 2 days before it was scheduled to and it charges really fast. The graphics are bright and legible, and the key pad is very user-friendly but all in all the phone only gets two stars because the volume is just completely lousy. All the way up I still had trouble hearing the people on the other end every time I made or recieved a call. I happen to like hearing the people I'm calling, or those who are calling me. All it needs is better volume and it would be a five star phone.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT PHONE", "Author": "Richard D.

You call them and they do NOTHING about it. The customer service people are extremely rude and they even hang up on me! they also threaten you by saying that your call is monitored?!?!
