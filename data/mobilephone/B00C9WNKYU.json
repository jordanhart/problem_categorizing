However I am greatly surprised about its features and high standards. I would say, it is a great phone for such a low price. Besides it's an unlocked phone and works very well in Venezuela.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I ordered....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2O6ZTDZKO65FC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered a Black phone with IP67 certification. What I received (a month later) is an ugly, dingy-looking, off-white phone with instructions that state \"WATER-RESISTANCE - Your phone is not water-resistant. Keep it dry\". The instructions mention nothing about shock resistant specifications, and capabilities. I was able to blow through the casing and hear and feel all kinds of air leaks, so dust-proof is most likely a lie, as well. Although what was delivered does say HW--W718, and Haier, this phone is clearly not what was presented on the website. It looks and feels like a cheap toy. I mean exceptionally cheap. Like, uncomfortably cheap, thin, and flimsy.I gave it 2 stars, because I suppose it still functions. Although, I wouldn't know first hand, since I only briefly took it out of the packaging.Shipping on this item took a month, but I suppose that's pretty good for coming from China. As good as that may be, I can only imagine how time-consuming the return is going to be. I'd hate to think about the time involved with any potential claims involving more than a simple return, and reimbursement.Additionally, I added this to my cart, but didn't check out for a few days. Sure enough, soon as I did decide to finish the order, the price rose on this thing by $15. I suppose it was a Christmas scam, because now I can find them for $20 less.I'll be glad when dual SIM, IP68 phones make their way to the states so people won't have to wait so long. It sucks that ya gotta shop overseas, just to find what you want.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.0 Inch 2-point capacitive touch screen IP67 grade Waterproof, dustproof, shockproof\nMTK6575, Cortex A9, 1.0GHz cpu Android 4.0 ice cream sandwich\n512MB RAM + 4GB ROM (system space arround 2.2GB)\nDual camera,Wifi, bluetooth...", "Name": "4.0 Inch Haier W718 IP67 Waterproof Dustproof Shockproof Android 4.0 ice cream sandwich Budget SmartPhone MTK6575 1.0GHz 3G WIFI 5MP dual camera (Black,white)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VWQEihy6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C9WNKYU"}}
