{"Reviews": [{"Title": "awesome phone", "Author": "R. Gupta", "ReviewID": "RLO3JQ6QK1Z1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a former Blackberry user of 5 years who recently switched to Android.  First of all, I'm thrilled with the Android OS. It runs very smoothly.  I am a heavy google user (i use a number of their services), so I was pleasantly surprised to see all those same google services available on the phone as apps.  Immediately, the phone felt very familiar to me.The phone looks and feels great.  Compared to the iPhone, it is a little wider (and obviously much bigger than my blackberry), so I feel that it's somewhat difficult to hold in one hand, but this may become less of an issue over time as I get accustomed to it.Moto x allows you to check and respond to text messages from your chrome browser. via the motorola connect app.  This is awesome. So say your phone is the other room.  Instead of getting up and grabbing it. you can just text from your computer.  Also tells you who is calling so you can decide if you want to go answer it.  I think this feature is also great for those days that you accidentally leave your phone at home and you're at work.  No need to panic.  You can still text and see missed calls from any computer as long as it has the chrome browser and motorola connect app! the touchless control feature is simply amazing.  For example, when I sat in the car, I realized i had my phone in my jacket .  Instead of fumbling and getting it out while driving, I simply said :ok google now\" and asked it to dial the number.  The phone called the contact and it was set to speaker phone.  as simple as that.  It also can follow several other useful voice commands without touching the phone.  It works great if you have a bluetooth headset on too.  In short, this is the best feature of the phone.Summary:cons:-average camera and picture quality.-Battery life was about less than a day with internet browsing, texting and streaming music.  I also felt that the phone charges slowly.Pros:-android is an amazing OS that runs smoothly on Moto X-Touchless features are really unique and useful.-Looks and feels great.Update: 9/18/13. After playing around with the camera more, it does get the job done and the pictures are decent. Although it doesn't take great pics in low light, it offers editing options to improve the picture quality. I also want to mention the wrist flick mechanism which instantly opens up the camera mode without having to unlock the phone or press any buttons.  This is convenient when you need to take a picture in a moment's notice.Overall, I give 4.5/5 stars for the moto X.  I'm very happy and I would recommend it.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A glimpse into the future", "Author": "George R Jenkins", "ReviewID": "RDHAO1TLUSL8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being Google's first true venture into developing a phone with Motorola, they hit one out of the park.  I'm not one for the phone customization options but others can opt for more bling using Moto Maker.  I'm truly impressed with the \"Okay Google Now\" voice assistant.  It only reacts to my commands and performs various automated actions for me.  There are far too many commands and variations for me to explain.  This technology will become a standard much the way Google Search is to web browsing. This \"touchless control\" is quick at reacting to my command even while it's off.  Another innovative phone function I've found is the ability to read a Reddit article via app and quickly share it through a refined and simple interface.  I've only had the phone a week and am already loving it more than my Windows 8 work phone or my previous HTC 3D EVO.  Even the lock screen notifications give me filtered updates and if I swipe up, I can go right to the update or swipe down to open my phone.  This phone is exactly what a wanted: a simple phone that can easily become my daily interactive assistant.  This phone is a benchmark that others will be compared to, as the Apple iPhone once was.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfection.", "Author": "jill anne eastwood", "ReviewID": "RR10JQU0I8OMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "$99.00, what else is there to say? Well, yes, plenty. The phone is gorgeous the weaved back is classy and sharp, nearly no bezel, and i've read complaints about the fact the display is \"only\" 720p, but it's is crystal clear, and vibrant. The phone is suprisingly small, it is not much larger than an iphone but the screen is sooo much larger. The build quality is tremendous, with a healthy weight to the phone without being heavy. The single speaker on the back is LOUD, and the built in equalizer allows you to adjust it to your preference. The camera is excellent, i don't see why people are complaining so much, but it is probably because people like to complain.The lack of Sprint Bloatware is such a relief, it's is nearly completely stock android. The few added apps from Motorola are actually a help for the initial setup. Moto Assist is ingenious, as well as Motorola Connect. The 50 gigs extra Google Drive space is wonderful since the phone has about 12GB free upon startup.The Active Notification system is freaking awesome, it's amazing someone didn't come up with it sooner. The \"always listening\" Google Now is very responsive, although a few times it  didn't understand me, but i've had it for 24 hours, and assume it's still \"learning\" my voice. I've also read articles about how the processor and gpu are slightly outdated, but you can tell that Motorola tweaked everything to perfection, the response time through menus and throughout the system as a whole is lightning fast. I am lucky enough to live near a strong LTE tower, and have been experiencing Sprint LTE for about a year now, but i can say that feel very confident that the radios in the MOTO X are  more sensitive and aggressive than my last phone, i get a stronger signal and it reaches a little farther than before. The battery life is exceptional, and coming from an HTC EVO 4G LTE which had in my opinion, good battery life, this exceeds it. maybe 18 hours of medium usage, i can imagine with light usage the phone lasting well into the 24 hour range.i recommend the MOTO X completely, without a doubt.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thrilled w/ the Moto X - Perfect phone for my needs", "Author": "BrainyGirl", "ReviewID": "R1XKJ5QCMIEWZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SO glad I got the Moto X instead of an iPhone. Aside from the price drop, the Moto X is just a better phone. It's lighter, better looking, and has a larger screen. Not completely in love with the camera, but for me that's not a deal breaker. Do wish I could use an SD card, but after all the apps I use are installed, I still have 9 Gb free, and I don't typically use my phone for a lot of music and video storage, so again, not a deal breaker for me.But the single biggest reason I chose the X, is that it's the only phone made in the US, by workers making a living wage.

Fox \"Gadget Phreak\"", "ReviewID": "RC5Z8RS8WWCQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I considered all the popular options before ultimately deciding on the Moto X for my wife. After weighing all the options with the S4, G2, One, etc, the deciding factor for me was the dedicated voice processor on the Moto X. Yes, I'm disappointed in the lack of SD card slot and mediocre camera performance, but as a phone and an all purpose internet, calendar, and utility device, the Moto X is very good.The \"OK Google Now\" functionality works better than Siri in my experience and the Android functionality is all accessible and speedy.At the end of the day, you need to weigh your own priorities, but from our experience, the form factor and overall performance of the Moto X plus the voice processing makes this a great fit for us.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola Finally Makes a Phone Worth Owning", "Author": "Timothy Swann", "ReviewID": "RO9KYVWX09HK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from Moto Maker (on Verizon, the only difference is the radios so this is relevant) during their holiday sale where the off contract price came down to $350. Since I've had this phone for a while now, and I am now equipped to write my review. I wrote one for the Galaxy Nexus(GNex) after that was released since I bought it the day it came out and my review received nearly 200 votes (mostly helpful), so it seems like people found my review useful. I've posted this review for all the different carrier variants since the hardware and software are all the same except for radios.Hardware DesignThe design of this phone is truly one to appreciate. The fact that I was able to customize the look of mine is not the reason I say that. I can say that this phone does not feel like you're holding an iPhone or a Samsung or any other phone for that matter. It does not feel cheaply made (and being made in the US, it isn't!). It had just enough weight and the part on the outside, don't feel like plastic like most Samsung phones. Don't get me wrong, Samsung makes very good phones, but they all feel cheap, but that's my opinion and others feel the same way. I happen to think the Moto X has a premium feel compared to my old GNexThe screen is much more enjoyable than my Gnex was. This is not to say that I didn't like the screen on my GNex because I did, but the colors seem better on the Moto X. Every user will have a different opinion though. Many people like the IPS Retina display on the iPhone and the best comparison to that is the LG G2, which has a great screen. The AMOLED screen on the Moto X is very good for me though.Continuing with the design near the screen, the rounded edges all around the front of the phone actually feel great. What do I mean by that? Since this screen is truly edge to edge, if you find yourself swiping from the edges a lot, you won't feel the sharpness an edge usually feels like.The mic is on the front of the screen and very noticeable, so when using speaker phone and turn the phone face down to have the speaker facing up, it results in the other person hearing an echo. Didn't have that problem with my GNex, but that is probably because the mic was not very visible on the bottom.I do have a gripe about the design of two things though. Perhaps it's because I'm used to have my GNex, but have the volume rocker and the power button on the same side (the right side), feels awkward to me. But Samsung has it correct in my eyes with the volume rocker on the left side and the power button on the right side. The other thing for me is having the micro USB port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack on the top. I don't like this part AT ALL. For those that don't have cars that have Bluetooth Streaming, this creates cord clutter. However, there are times where having the headphone jack on the top can be nice. For example, as a runner I take my phone with me on runs and use headphones. Since the cord doesn't need to go to the bottom of the phone that can make that experience better.SoftwareThe first Android phone I had was the Galaxy Nexus. So why do I say that here in this review. Well, I've experienced the software of other android phone through demo units and phones of friends. I don't like skinned versions of Android like what Samsung does to Android on their Galaxy phones. I do truly enjoy the stock Android experience. The Android experience is nearly stock android. There are some small Moto tweaks, but otherwise, it's the experience I enjoy.Active Notifications are truly awesome! Yes, this falls under software. Now what is that? Well instead of a notification light, a portion of the screen turns on when you have a notification, telling you exactly what app the notification is from. You can pick and choose what apps you want to show notifications through this feature. Now you might be wondering is the screen continuously shows this notification until you dismiss it. Well, you can dismiss it if you want to, but you can preview the notification and see if it's an email or a text or whatever app.Now for Touchless control. Some people may find this to be a gimmick, but it's actually not bad. I use it when in the car to make phone calls. That's about it, though occasionally, saying \"OK Google Now, what's the forecast for today\" is easier than launching an app. (call me lazy for that, it's true haha).Battery LifeI have been putting my phone through test of my everyday usage. That includes, streaming music in my car, using Google Maps for traffic conditions to and from work, texting, calling, checking personal and work emails, checking Facebook, taking the occasional picture and then some sports-related stuff too. I would imagine the average user might use their phone as much as I do in a typical day. Now, the verdict...it's very good. I was shocked at how well the battery lasted. I got more than a full day's worth of usage out of it (wake up at 5am to sleep at 10pm). That's 17 hours for me. That means most people should be able to get a full day's worth out of this phone before plugging in before going to sleep. Moto really did a fantastic job of optimizing the software, processor and screen to maximize battery life.CameraTruthfully, I haven't taken enough pictures to give a great assessment of this, but coming from my GNex, this takes far better pictures. The pictures I've taken have been in great lighting conditions and the pictures have come out great. If you want to get a good idea on the performance, you can google reviews. Keep in mind when this phone first came out, the camera wasn't great, but that was due to the camera processing software. They have fixed that. Droid-Life has samples of the before and after. They show that Moto fixed this. It's a 10MP shooter and should be good enough for everyone's every day camera taking needs.OtherThrough moto maker the phone came with Android 4.2.2. I have not upgraded to 4.4 yet becaue from what I've seen in forums, in 4.4, Verizon is able to block tethering for those who still have unlimited data (like me). I'm holding off on installing the update for now.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone - nice work, Google", "Author": "C.

Also, I use the phone a ton on the road!  This is not the kind of phone that you can buy multiple batteries for, so if you forget the plug for it you are w/o a phone.

The key to the Moto X is the details. The fit and finish, size, and software experience make using the phone seamless. Everything works without ever having to think about it. Moto Assist has to be the best feature of any phone to date. Whether you're driving, in a meeting, or laying down for a good night's sleep, the Moto X has you covered with thoughtful and useful tools to help you out in each situation (all customizable by the user). A close second would be the Active Display. Only possible with the amoled display, it gives you an unobtrusive look into your waiting notifications.The camera would be considered the weak point of the phone. It doesn't have all the specs of other high end camera phones, but when it gets it right, the pictures are impeccable (especially in low light conditions when compared to my wife's HTC One). Also, since the camera is treated like any other app, updates come out periodically which help enhance performance and usability.The phone runs silky smooth. And since Motorola is a Google company, updates should come rather quickly. I got my Kit Kat update shortly after getting my phone.All in all, the Moto X does everything you would expect a high end phone to do, all without the hassle of trying to figure out how to make it work.

Simple tasks (e.g., moving pictures & voice notes off the phone to the computer) can be done without restrictions & tedious steps to go through with iTunes. While it is easy to pick up an iPhone and just go, when it comes to setting preferences and making changes to settings, many ofbthose tasks are not so \"intuitive\"* in iOS. *--one of the overused words of 2013 that needs to be retired. The point is that preferences and settings are much more sensibly and consistently placed, easily accessible and found, and easily adjustible with more options to adjust on Android. These are things that help make for a good user experience since we humans are all different and have different preference how we want to see things and how things work, I appreciate the customizability and freedom of Android.Now the Moto X, with never owning an Android to compare to I can't provide that aspect. All I can say is I really enjoy it. Very easy to use, very quick and responsive, screen is crisp and bright (I keep on low brightness), battery is about as much as one can expect from a smartphone w 4G coverage. Connects quickly to whatever is available (wifi, 4G, 3G). Great size to operate w one hand. Sound is okay. Camera has its bad moments but should not be a deal breaker, takes some really crisp shots, especially when given time to focus and set itself. Could do with a quicker shutter speed though. Active Notifications is on point, more useful than you think and I think it really helps save on battery life. Touchless control has come in handy on enough occasions (to text or call ppl while driving, to activate navigation while already driving, to have texts read aloud to me while driving...AND send a reply text) to say it's a useful feature and as Google Now continues to improve it'll make this more helpful. Plus the updates Motorola has pushed through the Google Play store to improve some of their apps and the camera...awesome.Of course it'll have a moment of slow response every now and then, but no more than I had w the iPhone. My only real gripe is the lack of expandable memory. Those ppl already rolling your eyes and huffing and puffing about that's what the cloud is for...shut it!!! Again, we humans are all different and have different preferences. I prefer to store my stuff on my own medium and not have it in the cloud...my preference...if you want yours in the cloud, enjoy, I have no problem with your preference...done.Overall I am extremely happy with this purchase and looking forward to Motorola's followup to this model phone.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compact phone, big screen, great features, and near-pure Android experience", "Author": "Barbara Christmas", "ReviewID": "R2F8GIRC3I26O6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a few minutes of buyer's remorse because the Nexus 5 was released right after I bought the Moto X, but I decided to give the Moto X two weeks. A month later, I am still very happy with it. Although the Nexus 5 will be able to do all the things I like about the Moto X, one of the primary reasons I am keeping the Moto X is how well it has performed in durability tests. My last phone was a Samsung Nexus S 4G, and it was a tank. Slow, yes, but I dropped that thing in the parking lot more than once and it only got a few scratches, and one or two times the back popped off. I've put a thin case on the Moto X, something I never did with the Nexus S, but that is because without the case the phone is pretty slick - it feels like it might slide out of my hand - and I like the look of the transparent red case on the white phone.The size is great, and nearly all of it is screen. I don't feel like I've sacrificed screen size just to have a phone that fits in my pocket. Plus, because I don't feel like I need a ballistics case on it - I don't have a tiny iPhone with a huge case just to keep the screen intact.Like I said earlier, my previous phone was a Nexus S, so I was accustomed to a pure Android operating system. The Nexus S was updated through 4.2, and I prefer stock android to the the HTC Sense and Samsung Touch Wiz overlays. The Moto X shipped with 4.3 and KitKat should be coming soon. A stock experience was important to me, and I wanted a phone designed for it.A couple of things surprised me. The \"breathing\" notifications are really nice. I thought it would be a stupid gimmick that I didn't use, but instead of picking up my phone and checking for messages, now I just glance at it periodically to see the time and if there are any notifications. I was also surprised at how often I use the voice command. It's nice to just say \"Okay, Google Now, what's the weather like?\" and have the phone tell me that it's going to be cold. Yes, I could pick up the phone, but I like not having to stop what I am doing and just ask.One phone function that doesn't get covered often is call quality, which seems like a huge oversight to me because I use my phone as a phone a lot. The three microphones for sound and noise cancellation are great. I've left messages on my voice mail to see what the quality is like, and I'm happy with the lack of background noise and voice quality.The camera is fine for my purposes. It isn't the best out there, but if I want to take print-quality pictures, I'll use a dedicated camera, not a phone camera.Maybe in a year I'll be picking up a Nexus, but if Motorola keeps up with the Android updates, I think I'll keep this phone for even longer.I'd recommend this phone to anyone who wants a durable, responsive, and capable phone. The picture quality is fine, the rest of the features are outstanding. So far, Motorola is leading the industry in Android updates, and any of my complaints are about Sprint, not the Moto X.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Siva Chelliah \"Siva\"", "ReviewID": "R1W6YRSTUS6UNQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice phone.
