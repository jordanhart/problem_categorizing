Puretalk Customer service was very responsive and helped me get a refund.I am very satisfied with the phone and like the Windows operating system. The battery is long lasting compared to the last phone.The only negative comment I can make is that the phone is a little heavy, but nothing I can not live with.My Puretalk Sim chip worked immediately.....and I only have the Talk and Text plan. The Wifi works great and the qwerty keyboard is nice on this slider phone.For $85....this LG Quantum was a great buy.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot search contacts by \"company name\" or \"telephone number\"", "Author": "A. Vargas Morales \"Y2K error\"", "ReviewID": "R1EAAFRLE0G7SL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It could be difficult to believe, but Microsoft designed WP7 to search by contact NAME, not by COMPANY or any other field as PHONE NUMBER, etc. Also, if you have Exchange Server, forget about your tasks or notes, they will not sync, and there is not even an application to see or edit them, you only have Contacts, Calendar and Email. Even the lack of multitasking is not comparable to these faults in my opinion.The rest of the features of this phone are simply impressive. That is why I give 4 stars.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG C900, Good Codition for ''USED''", "Author": "Tyrone Power", "ReviewID": "R2LMKG735DG6SD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had the chance to fully test this phone out, however phone came neatly packaged as if new and for half the price of a brand new one..

Big Failure", "Author": "Eduardo Davidovich \"pollotedl\"", "ReviewID": "RWY58J21SSLSU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can't believe that Microsoft products doesn't interact with each other!I bought the product because I have 1700 contacts and I need that my phone remind me all the appointments and task that I have... because the company use outlook for that I bought another Microsoft product... after I bough I figure it out that Windows phone 7 doesn't make a direct sync with Outlook.The answer of Microsoft is to create a live account (hotmail) and create a \"mirror\" of your contacts and calendar in hotmail... please note that hotmail doesn't allow task!Then Hotmail doesn't allow more that 1000 contacts and because you copy the contact from Outlook to Hotmail but the contacts neither the calendar update as you update it on the phone... neither the updates that you make on the outlook!Also, they provide a \"connector\" between Outlook to Hotmail but now I have 2 weeks trying to sync the phone with hotmail account and the same error appear (and didn't sync)... to solve that I make the same thing but with gmail and everything work perfect, well... the sync between gmail and the phone, because is impossible to sync the phone/gmail/hotmail with Outlook!Another big problem of WP7 is about the calendar notification, in WP6 you can choose to remain again in, 15 min, 1 hours, 1 day or so, WP7 only give you 2 options, snooze (in 5 min) or dismiss.About the application is like my cousin said to me, this phone is \"orphan\", very few application for Windows phone 7, you doesn't have skype or Garmin or ebuddy or what up or ungry birds or neither of the other application that your friends use every day.My last telephone was a windows mobile 6... and work perfect! but again, Microsoft did another BIG fail with WP7I promise to myself that this will be the last product that I buy from Microsoft, they never consider the customer needs!Bottom line: NEVER BUY A WP7 device! the phone it self is great of you only call and send text messages, but if you need a software to do more than than, find another phone", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$57.01", "Features": "3G Data Capable, Bluetooth Enabled, GPS, Internet Browser,\nTouch Screen, Speakerphone, Calendar, Color Screen, MMS\nEnabled, Text Messaging, MP3 Player, USB Interface, Polyphonic\nRingtones, Email Access, Java Enabled, Video Recording, Video\nStreaming, MPEG4 Video Playback, Intelligent Typing, Photo Album,Camera:  5.0 MP", "Name": "LG Quantum C900 Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RUTBZfMWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004DPP6SO"}}
