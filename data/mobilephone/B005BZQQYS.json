Easy to use and decent apps. Over the last year it has progressively gotten slower. Phone reception non-existent. Frequent fatal crashes. Yesterday the phone just stopped responding. I gave it an assisted retirement, so I'm going to need a phone without a shattered screen and bent case. Total, it lasted 3 years which is not too bad.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "htc", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R2NBQ80715YCHK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Defective phone back piece did stay attached, so battery kept falling out.

Since it is used, it came with a few scratches which can be covered up with a case, so no worries there. Problem area was making and receiving calls. Screen would go blank so u cannot see to end call or anything. After searching on Web for solution, found out the screen protector was blocking the proximity sensor. Problem solved.

But I really didnt want to spend a ton of money on all the newer android phones. After my friend bought her's and told me about it, it fit exactly all the things I wanted in a phone. It was cheap, semi-compact yet sturdy, good text touch screen with swype, and an awesome media player that not only holds music but videos. I definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a high powered android phone, but at a more reasonable price. I bought this used- like new and it was even cheaper than it already was. The only problem with the appearance is one tiny scratch on the edge but it was easily covered with the case that came with it. Overall I definitely recommend this phone.
