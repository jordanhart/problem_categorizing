{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone. Dual Active, an okay job by Samsung", "Author": "ForexTech", "ReviewID": "R2AVQNGT3HANXM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After waiting for years for good dual SIM phone, I finally get a one. This is dual Active! which is rare to find, there are a lot of dual standby. Its also Android! so I get all the benefits of google mail, contacts etc. For years i have used 2 cell phones, now I use just one. There are some items to note1/ Dual active: One of the SIM cards will be set to forward all calls to the other one. You have a SIM Management screen to choose which one. Which is really no issue, just make sure with your carrier that there are no extra charges for forwarding calls. For most carriers in USA mobile to mobile calls with the same carrier is free. I have 2 lines within the same carrier, so its all free for me. if you have SIM cards from different carriers then the call will be treated as a regular incoming call so you may get a charge, unless of course you have some buddy list or favorite list that you provider allows you to specify external numbers that are free calls for you. Work out all these logistics before you buy.Nice thing about the dual active though is that it all goes to one voicemail. Also you will see the call from the second line ringing like a normal call, it will should you which SIM card the call is coming from. You can select which SIM card to make a call from. You set the default in the SIM manager, so say you set it to SIM 1, by default all outgoing calls will be via SIM1 but you can easily change the SIM for a specific call. Same thing with text.2/ Data plan: You can also select which SIM card to use for data. For instance I have data plan on only SIM 2, so I go to SIM manager and select SIM 2 for data use.3/ There is NO 4G! This is the big minus with this phone, which means that an upgrade is eminient. I probably have to change the phone in the next year or two so I get the 4G. No big deal for me now, I don't do much internet surfing on my phone now.4/ Its Android 2.3. No upgrade to Android 4 yet5/ Here is one big issue. when you are on a call, the screen locks up and you have to double tap to unlock it. It is a feature not an issue but a lot of people don't like it! it can be annoying. Lots of users have reported this issue, see [...] I think it was removed in later Android versions.6/ battery life is great. I usually turn off GPS etc so I am a light user, just calls and light surfing, checking email, I get 6 days inbetween charge.7/ Does not support Adobe flash. So some of your online videos will not be able to play. I don't use my smartphone for any major surfing so no big deal.8/ There is no 3G 850 band so you will not get 3G on ATT. The 3G is 900/1900. You will get Edge on ATT which is slow. If you do a lot of internet use, this can be an issue.In summary, good phone, some enhancements needed but its by far the best dual SIM android phone currently on the market. Not really made for US market where we have 3G, 4G.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Early Evaluation", "Author": "kamal", "ReviewID": "R8Q6ANB77K7U0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Background : I was attracted to this phone because I travel quite often, and wanted to check out the convenience of dual sims. Will be traveling soon, but until then these are my early findingsOut of the Box:1- Version was intended for the UK, not Germany. So language was already set for English.2- Charger did not work, and I did not recognize until the battery, which was initially partially charged, became very low. The battery icon is so small, it is hard to tell. Anyhow, I found out that it is not a faulty charger, but a faulty converter plug which came as an extra item from the seller, but not in the Galaxy factory box. Substituting a good plug solved the charging problem.3- No handbook, and no luck downloading from the Galaxy website. I use a Mac, and there is no provision on the website for downloading mac-compatible file(s). Same problem as with a Nokia phone I have.4- Had quite a time finding the product on the Galaxy website. No recognition of the model in the search box.(Update 16/Mar/2013): I located the uk website for Samsung, and there I found a Mac version for the interface program KIES. Downloaded it and interfaced with the cell phone successfully. KIES is the ITUNES of samsung phones.5- Cell phone works fine, no problems6- Connection to the home network works fine7- To make use of many applications you must have a Google account and link the device to the account.8- Have downloaded emails, and exchanged text messages, all ok8 Have inserted two sims, both work ok. Still need to understand the option/limitations for \"both to work simultaneously\" (Update 16/Mar/2013) : have not been successful in getting the sim cards to forward calls to each other. SIM cards are from T-Mobil.9 Have inserted a microSD card containing data (images, media files).

I was able to get reasonably fast data and the call quality was fine. The battery life seems to be depleted faster if wifi is used rather than broadband. I also used it to take photos and the 5 MP camera is just fine if you are aware that you're not going to be getting iphone-level quality photos (but they're totally adequate for snapshots). I recommend ordering a US Motorola charger (or whatever country you're in) because it comes with a European charger. Phone arrived with Polish packaging and instructions, but don't be alarmed. It's very easy to set it up in English from the get-go (there are instructions included). I recommend this phone if you're traveling.A note about the SIM card: Do NOT push the SIM card all the way into the slot. You just want the gold part of the card to contact the little gold bits in the slot near the edge. A micro sim card will not slide all the way in, so don't panic. You may need to experiment a bit with placement to make sure the card gets read by the phone.

What I hate about the phone is that it's slow. When you turn it on, it takes up to 5 or 6 seconds for the screen display to appear. Other times it's a bit faster, but it's frustrating to have that much of a lag. If you want to take a photo quickly, forget about it! By the time the phone turns on and you tap on a couple of icons  just to get to the camera, you'll have missed the shot. My old \"un-Smart\" phone required only 1 push of a button and the camera was on and ready. Another thing...sometimes when you tap on an icon, it takes a bit of time. You think that you didn't tap it correctly and tap again, and then you realize you tapped twice. Same thing with the arrow to go back to the previous display. It's sometimes slow and you tap it again, only to have it go back 2 displays. This is what drives me up the wall about the phone. I sometimes regret buying it, but it sure beats carrying 2 phones around, since I have 2 carriers. Switching between carriers is easy...just slide your finger down the screen and tap on a carrier's icon.
