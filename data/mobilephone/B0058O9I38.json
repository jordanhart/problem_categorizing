{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone, not perfect, but worth it if you're new to smartphones.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16HTJ217PH22U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not my first smartphone, so I've seen how things can go well and not go well.  This phone is amazing for social networking users, probably the best I've seen so far.  The integration with Facebook, Twitter, and others is noteworthy and will serve you well.  The only hitch comes in that it does import all your facebook and twitter contacts into the contact list.  Which would be fine, except that not everyone lists their phone number on facebook (for obvious privacy reasons), so sometimes you have a contact list full of profiles with just email addresses.  Something to watch for, but not gamebreaking.It's highly customizable, courtesy of the Android 2.1 OS it runs out of the box, and as this is my first Android phone, I'm quite pleased with the OS-- I plan to stick with it for future phones.  If you are an android power user (or at least enough of one that you care to root the device), be aware that rooting this thing is a chore, and there is no single easy tool to do it; you'll have to go command-line.  Even then, the rooting did not work properly.  AT&T; also locked the Bravo from allowing sideloading, and even after I rooted the phone, it still did not let me install the Amazon App Store.  Fortunately for those of us with this phone, Motorola was kind enough to put an app on the Android Market just for us Bravo users to allow sideloading (Search \"Motorola Sideload Enabler\" and find the one for Bravo).I will warn you, also, that the thing comes with a goodly amount of AT&T; Bloatware.  For those of us who root our phones, it's no chore to remove, but I will advise those who do so to make sure your phone has the latest updates, because once you remove them, it becomes impossible to update.However, overall, for the average user, this is an amazing phone that is reactive and integrated.  I highly recommend the device for those new to smartphones, and give a good thumbs up for power users looking for a less-expensive android to tinker with.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "A wonderful phone especially for the new smart phone user!", "Author": "E. Parrish", "ReviewID": "R3DUU35VZZ5OED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all let me qualify my five stars by saying this is my first smart phone so this review is not comparing the Motorola Bravo to another.  I'm one of those people who said they never wanted a phone to be anything other than a phone. But I'll eat those words in this review and say that the Bravo is a great experience! People tell me it is a very clear phone to hear me talk which was an important factor for me. The on-line Consumer Cellular tutorials have been very beneficial to help me understand all that the Bravo will do. There is also an app on the phone called \"help center\" that lets you learn many things at your own pace.The good things about the Bravo are many but I will try to mention a few that were such great things for me. Texting is much better on this phone and when you turn the phone sideways your big fingers can type much easier. The Motorola company has \"MOTOBLUR\" which combines emails and helps you in other ways that seem to make the Bravo the best choice for picking which cell phone to buy. I picked an android versus the iPhone and I am glad. The android market seems superior and works better with Microsoft based computers versus macs which are what I have at home and work. An example of \"superior\" is an app called \"Call Control\" that I have that goes through a list of marketing numbers and you can choose to have them go directly to voicemail at no cost so they don't call you. It's an interactive app where you can update marketing numbers so that others can block them too. I looked for this for my sister's iPhone and read it isn't available for those phones because Apple would not participate. The Bravo works on a 2.2 android system. I read a review that said a person will not know the difference when just starting with a smart phone and I agree. My phone is fast and efficient so I don't need to imagine how the 2.3 improves on perfection.I also thought I would need to go with another company when I got a smart phone because of usage. I upgraded my texting amount and talk minutes to accommodate more than I need and the monthly cost is still only $41.00 which is less than one of the most popular unlimited carriers I looked into. Bottom line for people who haven't moved to a smart phone or for folks who are looking for a quality smart phone at a great price - the Motorola Bravo is a wonderful way to get started! I learn new things about the Bravo every day and expect I will enjoy it for years to come.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific phone", "Author": "luvs to shop", "ReviewID": "RFT4R89Q604Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone from Amazon.  It arrived promptly and exactly as described.  The clarity of the color screen is unbelievable.  Even in bright sunlight, you can easily see the screen details. The size is great - not too large, not too small.The WiFi is a great little feature - especially for those without a data plan.  I needed an unlocked phone that I can use when traveling between Canada and the USA and this fits the bill perfectly.  I can pop in my SIM card for each country as needed which saves a great deal of money.It comes with an micro sd card for extra storage.  It senses when you put the phone in a pocket and locks the keyboard.  It also senses night time and goes into a different mode to save the battery.I purchased a Motorola phone as the last two Samsung models I had, stopped working, within months of each other.  Time to try a different brand, in my opinion.This phone has excellent video tutorials online at the Motorola Bravo site if you can't be bothered to read the instruction book (which I am guilty of).The only con, in my opinion, is the short battery life with the GPS, WiFi, Blutooth, etc. all running.  However, I am learning to disable some of the unnecessary features while out and about to conserve battery power.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "My First Android", "Author": "Warren Wm Gollop", "ReviewID": "R15GKYVIM81QNS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was influenced to go Android based on dodgy BB experience and very knowledgable friends sharing their experience. I have been very happy with the experience so far. May it live long!  For this device specifically, I have been quite happy with the ease of use, nice build quality, solid feel, decent screen size and relatively good battery life. I also quite like the Motoblur interface, but not necessarily all of the AT&T; preloaded apps which I can't use on my network.That said, in the two weeks which I have been using the phone, I have had it lock up completely once. Also takes long to load contact list, which is a pain when in a hurry, or on the go. Screen sensitivity varies greatly, and not just the usual night vs. day variance I have found with most touchscreens, and have had the auto-rotation not work for a brief spell.  Also have experienced some \"ghost taps\" on the virtual keyboard in very bright sunlight. All minor glitches which cleared up quickly enough, but I expected a bit more or less of it. I also would love the phone to have a cover on the mini-USB port to keep out the dust build up.Overall a good phone, with great call quality and functionality.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "a great item for a low price", "Author": "e", "ReviewID": "R2X06OTA4OVE2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this a a great midrange android device just under $200. it does just about everything  any of the other newer android devices do it comes with adobe flash player and was shipped with a newer android os, which was a plus.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent smart phone", "Author": "AC", "ReviewID": "R2O58KESBL2HFV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone. I've now had it for 6 months and I'm very satisfied. I bought it through Consumer Cellular, and their customer service was very helpful with setup. (I ran into a snag with initial setup because I live in an place with a very spotty wireless signal.)I'm far from a techno wizard, but I was making calls, sending texts, and browsing the web right away. It took a couple of weeks of fairly intensive learning before I had everything set up the way I wanted it, but I'm now satisfied with battery life, freedom from intrusive notifications, etc. Consumer Cellular's instructional videos were very helpful for a novice user.I did need to make a couple of calls to Consumer Cellular's support desk to get information on how to download a radio tuner that uses the FM antenna, but the app was free and it works well. A similar app is included if you have AT&T.;I'd never used a GPS and was amazed how much help it was on a trip to Philadelphia, a completely new city for me.Occasionally I've had problems getting my Google calender to sync with the phone. Each time, I've fixed it by turning off the phone, and turning it back on in the presence of my computer.The camera is better than on my previous phone, but not so good that it eliminates the need to own an actual camera. Outdoor pictures on sunny days appear washed out. I've been able to adjust them satisfactorily after uploading.If the camera were just a little better, I'd give this phone 5 stars.

Being Android, there are lots of free programs you can get for it.  The touch screen is large and bright, and its just the right size in my opinion.  Its got every feature you could want EXCEPT its 3G, not 4G.  I don't have any 4G service in my home area, so it made little sense for me to spend more for a phone to support a service not available to me.  Even if it was, I don't need anything more than 3G for anything I do outside the house.  When at home inside, I use the Wi-Fi connection to my wired network service which is even faster, and save on broadband minutes.The only thing I would like and could use are better front and rear cameras.  Fact is, there is no front camera, which is a shame since I use Skype video chat over WiFi, and the rear camera faces the wrong way.  And the rear cameras is only 3MP, which was great in its day, but no longer.  So, I still need my digital camera for photos - which mean an extra thingee to carry in my pocket..So maybe I would only give this 3 stars in today's market if it weren't for the fact that the price is SOOOOO right.  Being Android, it keeps pace pretty well with the pricey new toys.

Big screen, light weight, a wonderful first smartphone for me. Unfortunately, something about the way that Amazon sells it recently has left other shoppers and myself in a conundrum.The first phone sent to me was unable to show battery life, came with a moto blur startup guide that was not relevant to what was displayed on the phone, and would get an \"unexpectedly quit\" message requiring a force close every time an app (or even the Accounts, Data Usage, etc. sections of the settings menu) was attempted to be opened. As the phone was even unable to connect to ATT cell phone service, I decided that the one thing that worked (wifi) was not enough to keep me from sending the clearly defective phone back. There was an odd 16 digit or so handwritten number on a small piece of paper taped to the cover, more on this in a second.The second phone arrived quickly, and I crossed my fingers. I plugged in the phone, let it fully charge for some hours, and then booted it up. The startup guide was still inaccurate, as I still was not asked to create a Motoblur account. Oh well. What is the chance that they would send me two bad phones, I thought? This time the battery indicator showed a full charge, which was a great start! Zero ATT signal, though, in a house that gets great bars usually. Wifi still works, so I figured I'd look into the posibility that the Android version was too old or something. Try to open any of the earlier-menioned settings menu items, phone encounters unexpected error and it's back to the main screen. Try to open up Android Market (didn't do this the first time), phone encounters a slight variation on the same old error. I went to phone information and had the phone look for operating system updates, and it searches for hours without any indication either way. I'm forced to exit. I bring the browser to Android Market, and it cannot recognize my phone. The solution, it says, is to open Android Market from the phone's home. Shoot.The phone seems so neat, and I am sorry to send back a second one. Somehow the price has gone up around 10 dollars from when I purchased it three days ago. Perhaps this signifies that there was a bad batch, that they knew about, that the sellers or Amazon or whoever it is has gotten past. I really do hope so. Luckily, Amazon has such fast shipping and returns that this experiment took little investment. As I read another reviewer optimistically review the phone two days ago, encountering the same problems, saying  that it isn't working yet but he hopes that it does soon, I can't help but cringe. I hope that the reviewer is able to find a solution. He thinks it is an Android software problem, but I cannot come up with any ideas as to what to do to get out of the stalemate of the phone being unable to update.The second phone, I also noticed, has another 16 digit code or so taped to the front cover of the phone. Same green slip of paper. Same handwriting. Could these have been returns from earlier purchases? I wonder as to the solution to these many mysteries.Although I am unsure about other carriers, ATT requires you be on a data plan as soon as you've put your SIM card into the phone. It was a bit of insult to injury this morning when, MB520 packed away and SIM card safely back in my old cingular LG flip phone, I recieved a text stating: \"Did you know a data plan is required for your Smartphone? We have added an appropriate data plan.\" My ATT plan appears to have reverted back, though for those few hoping to not do a full data plan (and use mostly wifi, etc) this may surprise you.The second phone is sent back, and I feel a bit silly for trying twice. I am sure there will be a solution out there. Clear the catch, or erase all data, or something to that effect. With the headache this has caused, I think I'll just try to get a phone upgrade straight from ATT.This is my first product review on Amazon. That's how strange I found the cell phone experience to be. As I said, the phone costs a bit more than it did two days ago. I hope that this is a sign of hope for future purchasers!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "If Only You Knew..........", "Author": "James Zelenka", "ReviewID": "RM5G28DX6KH80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to chuckle when I read all the moaning about how outdated and pitiful phones like this are. If you want pitiful you should have seen my first radio; two transistors, AM only, thin metal and brittle plastic. Expensive 9 volt battery that barely lasted an hour, and yet it wasMAGIC compared to the tiny crystal radio I'd had for years before that.Now days it isn't enough that smartphones improve every few months; where is the holographic above-screen mini-orgies? Better yet full size holo-decks controlled by super phone! Teleportation anyone?It was years before the transistor found a use in AM radios and even more years before the first IC was born (with 2,300 transistors). Now the engineers are capable of putting more than 100,000,000 transistors on the head of a pin! What a time to be alive!As for the Motorola Bravo; I say \"bravo Motorola\". I'd had a big expensive phone for more than a year and was ready to replace it with whatever comes next but it occurred to me that even the outdated Bravo would do everything I want done and it does. Made out of very durable materials it should last years and it only costs the equivalent of my truly pitiful two transistor radio back in 1960!Update: I guess I'm not a \"power user\" and I definately don't want a huge screen phone that screams GEEK everytime I make a call on it, but I've yet to find this little phone lacking in any way. Even the 2.21 OS is entirely adequate. And one final item that may not even be available anymore--user replaceable battery.

I take pretty good care of my gear, but this one has suffered a couple of hard floor drops, with no ill effect. It does everything I'd expect of an Android phone, including the easiest syncing I've done so far with the Google world.My favorite thing about the Bravo, and most other Motorolas, is that it never forgot that it's a phone. In hand-held, Bluetooth and speaker modes, it is simple to use and delivers great fidelity. It is also great at grabbing weak signals. There are even tone controls for Voice Quality. You can adjust the phone sound to match your hearing and typical background. I've had smartphones that almost require you to use a Bluetooth earpiece, not this guy.Also, as with other Motorolas, there is an available charging cradle with magnets that signal the phone that it's time to hold email alerts, etc. and make the screen look like a nice, digital nightstand clock. I'm a road warrior, and my standard call-home configuration is to use a Bluetooth headset with my phone charging in the cradle, aimed for best reception.If you're looking for an Android to be your TV set, fireplace, or reader, Bravo probably isn't it, but if you want an indestructible phone with good battery life on Wi-Fi, once you set the controls, Bravo might be your trusted sidekick.

The phone feature on this smart phone offers very clear audio reception. I've bought this phone to use on a pay-as-you-go calling plan with no data. I rely on mainly using Wi-Fi for data access while at home. The Wi-Fi reception on this phone is not that good. It only works well when you have good Wi-Fi signal strength. The problem with this phone is that it only has a 800 MHz single core processor and may take a little longer to load apps that happen to be heavy on resources. Occasionally, the phone may reboot unexpectedly when the app that you happen to be running crash.Running most apps, the 1.5 amp hour battery generally lasts a couple of hours before you need to recharge. The nice feature of this phone is that it doesn't run hot when under continuous use.The negative with this phone is that the transmit radiation level is almost at the legal limit. At the present time the firmware can be updated only to Google Android  OS 2.2 and not to the latest one without rooting the device which will void the warranty for sure.

The phone continues to be  glitchy when it comes to voice calls. Motorola's support blames the network. This phone is OK for a teenager who sends 100 texts per day and makes only 1 call. If you need the phone for business or would like to avoid frustration because people do not hear you or you do not hear them from time to time, then look elsewhere. No wonder why after Google has recently purchased Motorola Mobile they laid off more than a thousand people and decided to close its Chinese division. I guess Google is hoping to replicate Apple's success by keeping the hardware and the software development in the same pair of hands. The head of their Android division was also moved elsewhere. Good steps that had to be done 3-4 years ago!Anyway, due to all the glitches (despite factory reset efforts!) this phone should not be valued for more than seventy bucks.UPDATE from March 25th, 2013:I've purchased Blu Studio II 5.3 instead of Bravo. See my review here BLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black)UPDATE from March 18th, 2013:I am increasing my rating from 2 stars to 3.The phone has not had its glitch with not sending voice (even with 5 bars and while sending messages) during last 10 days. Also, the problem with the Bluetooth pairing has finally been solved. Motorola Support was not able to help and neither Kia. The problem was with Android OS that was not showing Kia's request to get a permission to access the contacts list. The request was hid by Android in the notifications area.UPDATE from March 8th, 2013:I am lowering my rating from 5 stars to 2.After three days of usage the phone stopped providing voice communication in both directions (incoming and outgoing calls). Motorola was always associated in my mind with strong signals and reliability (just recall those pagers that were dropped on the floor multiple times and continued working!). However, obviously Motorola has made a mistake of playing with Android rather than continuing with a proprietary OS. Android is a big disappointment.After removing the batter the phone started to transfer voice again. But just think about it. If you have to remove the battery out of your car every day in order to drive to work, why would  you buy such a car? Who cares about all the browsing functionality and apps if one cannot make a call? I've lowered the star rating to 2 because I think it is the most crucial feature in a phone. The phone that cannot make a call is not a phone anymore.Speaking about apps, etc. It really makes me uncomfortable that just to start using the phone (or after the factory reset) one must create an account with MotoBlur. And in order to use the Android Market / Google Play one must have a gmail account. The car analogy can be applied here as well. We don't have to register anywhere in order to drive a car. Why, after spending a hundred dollars, I am obliged to register on multiple web-sites in order to just make a call? If manufacturers and Google think that they can impose anything on the end user, then I don't need a smartphone at all! I better stick with a simple/non-smart cell phone that I had purchased for twenty bucks several years ago. For thousands of years people have survived without cell phones and I should be able to survive too rather than jumping over the hoops after spending a lot of money on a gadget!By the way, the quality of the photos taken by this phone is mediocre. It is not very noticeable while looking at the photos on the phone itself, but becomes obvious after they are transferred to a computer. They look slightly blurred (kind of like taken with a soft filter) and the colors are not saturated in red and yellow hues. Also, it does not take widescreen (16:9) photos or videos.The vlingo (speech-to-text function for SMS/texting, etc.) was working well during first day, but then started to take longer time for \"thinking\" and now just quits and does not produce text results. I blame Android OS 2.2.1 rather than Motorola, but Motorola should make efforts to choose a better OS for its hardware.I'll observe the performance of this phone for a few more days, but it appears to me that it is becoming a strong candidate for a return.ORIGINAL post:Ordered from Phone Etc vendor fulfilled by Amazon. The arrived phone was new in an AT&T; branded box. A 2GB MicroSD card was already pre-installed inside the phone. The phone has arrived with Android OS 2.1 version, however, through MotoBlur it was updated the same day to 2.2.1 (took 15 minutes or so to download the update via Wi-Fi). Currently using with a T-mobile SIM card on a value plan without data. Test picture messages in T-mobile environment have been received and sent successfully.The Android OS does not seem to be up to the hype. I had a PocketPC in 2001 and it seems that the Android OS has not made too much of a leap comparing to PocketPC. I expected more of a smooth usability experience that could be achieved during last 10 years (especially when Android is Linux based and not Windows based as PocketPC was).A word of caution to those who are unexperienced with Android. Since Android is Google owned, Google is forcing you to create a gmail account (or provide info to connect to your corporate calendar) for such a simple feature as the Calendar. That is totally ridiculous! Although I am not doing anything illegal and don't need to worry about my calendar, it makes me uncomfortable that under the veil of convenience to the user Google (or any other mega-corporation) wants to own all of your information. Hence, I will try some offline (that don't sync with gmail) calendars that are out there and if none of them will be a good alternative this phone (only because of Android OS) will be going back to Amazon.By the way, the reception seems to be good so far. Where a Nokia phone (3555b) would lose connection in our local Target, so far this one was showing 2-3 bard and maintaining its connection during a test call.Will update this review after some more usage and after the search for an alternative calendar.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "like", "Author": "Carlos Calle", "ReviewID": "R1YI98Q0XTFQ7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good and very affordable recommended, very comfortable and large screen for surfing the internet , I am very happy with the motorola", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone not fully compatible with Consumer Cellular and aps", "Author": "Minerva R.

But the MB520 seemed like a good phone.  It got high marks in reviews, and the only thing I can say about that is that the reviewers probably used it for all of a day before they made up their minds.  It starts out well, but within a week it began to freeze up on me at least once a day.  I tried clearing out some of the bloatware, but no dice.  I'm stuck with probably half a dozen apps which I never use, but which update constantly draining the battery on me so that I now have to carry a portable charger when I go out.It slows down dramatically as the charge drops, and it frequently refuses to recognize the wireless network in my own home!  But the last straw was the other night when I was trying to use the navigator, and had to phone someone to ask a question about the route.  Everything froze.  It took me 10 minutes to pull out the battery, boot the phone back up and get the dialer to come up.  I could have been in Wisconsin by then!Nope, that's it.  Last Motorola phone I ever buy.  I gave it two stars because when it does work, it's a fun phone.  It's just so completely unreliable that the fun ceases to be a factor for me.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "A.

I'm experienced at rooting and installing ROMS, so this isn't because I'm a noob. What a waste of time, hopefully you get a working one that you can root and put a decent ROM on like others have stated. I have a Captivate with a borken power button, but at least it connects to AT&T;! Also, be aware that Amazon is only giving me a refund, so I'll have to wait on that.
