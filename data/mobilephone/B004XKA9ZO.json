{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little watch", "Author": "Jon \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R2UV1U94R38FGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is, without a doubt, my favorite watch of all time.  It's not perfect, but what watch ever will be?  First off, I've used the phone feature only once.  My primary reason for considering this watchphone isn't for the phone feature but rather the MP3 player+Bluetooth capability.  I use it for working out at the gym, I don't have to strap my iphone to my arm, my shorts, etc.  Instead, I just turn on my Motorola S9 Bluetooth stereo headset and I'm good.  Yes, it does have high-quality bluetooth stereo support.  However, you'll find that your watch should be within very close proximity of the headphones.  How close, well... within just a few feet (not the 33ft. you'd expect).  As an MP3 player, it's good (not great).  As a camera, it's good (not great) since the pictures are 640x480 (VGA) resolution.  As a video recorder, it's bad (resolution is really bad).  As a video player, it's so-so (I've yet to figure out how to fast-forward a movie).  But, if you look at all the features packed into this small package and the \"coolness\" factor, I can't help but give it a 5 star overall.I love it, it's not perfect but the makers of this watch are definitely on the right track.  Through incremental improvements in future models, this will be an awesome watch that everyone will someday want.  As it is today, it's a slick little device.  If you like high-tech watches, you probably can't find much better than this one today.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fake reviews?", "Author": "John3:16", "ReviewID": "R3AUOOOOVME1J7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The previous reviews seem very contrived. It seems strange that English would be the second language for all the other reviewers.This watch received poor reviews on other websites. Buyer beware.  Amazon should check the IP address of people posting reviews to eliminate Chinese manufacturers from submitting false reviews to pump up their products.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Attempt", "Author": "Keyeno", "ReviewID": "R1N7RGC29931IZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would first like to say that I very much like this product. But it doesn't go without it's pros and cons.Pros: Very Adjustable Wristband, Durable, Sleek, Good Interface.Cons: Product Image is Not Exact, User Manual is a Little Confusing, Lack of Customization, Very Quiet Speaker.Now for the details.This is day one for me and the watch. I'm not used to watches over all so it makes my wrist itch a little; but despite a somewhat bulky screen, sits well on my wrist and doesn't shuffle around too much. Although I'm on the very last notch since my wrists are small. This is probably better fit for most men.Another issue is customization. The particular theme on the phone was aimed towards women and I have no clue how to look like what is in the image.This product is also not built to be compatible with most PCs and there are currently no working drivers/sync centers for Vista/Windows 7. But I'm used to that since my old phone couldn't either. It would also be nice if there was a product site for this watch.All in all, I like it for its portability, and I would recommend this product to someone that likes the simplicity with dealing with less features than what most competing cell/smart phone companies are doing now. It's not a good geek toy but will definitely get you some wows from those who aren't so tech savvy.Thank you for reading!", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "marks cellfone wristwatch review", "Author": "Marks review", "ReviewID": "R2VI3KXWOEYV6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i chose the rating because the watch looked cool plus has lots of things one can use on it beside.downloading ringtones", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "helen", "ReviewID": "RWER54KTVHXMP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "does not work here in Germany so not worth buying it if it doesnt work in all countries price ok", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Non working gadget.", "Author": "Sapt", "ReviewID": "RE5OFW3R5LO9H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't waste your money on this.

I couldn't transfer from my old phone and it doesn't look up properly.3)  I need to use my blue tooth headset or sometimes can't hear the other party though I haven't messed with the volume.4)  The keypad for name entry is small enough that even with a stylus it is easy to make misteaks and have to go back.It works reliably and I have no issues with operation.  I haven't really used the FM receiver much or other features.  The headset does allow me to listen to music or phone calls which is nice but be careful not to catch the cord or ouch yanking your ear.  I am hopeful there will be an update for the software that will make it more user friendly but can't find much support so far.  Maybe this will get a yelp from somebody.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it, unique type of phone a \"must have\"", "Author": "Suriname", "ReviewID": "R1FSFTNUZSL55Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it, unique type of phone.Although it looks funny if you put your hand to your ear.. imagine that.I also bought an universal bluetooth earpeace but sadly did not work, I have to try another brand then.Got a lot of compliments and it is a \"must have\"", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good article", "Author": "Oscar Armando Vasquez", "ReviewID": "R2I7N7XFKVHSZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a good article, novel.

It says clear on the instruction not to use it while charging therefore if you run out of power you'll also run out of time. It is a little bulky, my wrists are not big but they aren't small either a still a little big for my wrist. Read the entire User manual before started to play with it it is very easy to lock it and very difficult to unlocked.No even a month of use and the touch screen stopped working. When asked for replacement PGD wanted me to buy another so we both save in shipping \"so they said\".

When I receive it, I did blow me away. The functions worked great, the bluetooth was clear and connected easily. The materials were plastic but held up very well. The only problem I have had is it will not charge anymore. I had it for about 9 months, I didn't use it everyday, but last week, I think it died. When the battery went dead, I put in the additional battery and it would not turn on. I even bought another charger for it and still it would not charge. Overall, I think it was intended to last about 6-9 months. Would I buy it again, only if I had money to throw away. One day I hope they improve on the idea of this watch phone.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lacking Customer Support", "Author": "Basserm", "ReviewID": "RI4F8CMSS05IG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have requested details on ordering replacement batteries from the manufacturer several times,regrettably I have not any response,the watch is useless without good batteries", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Watch phone", "Author": "Loudger", "ReviewID": "R3ANRT58WWVS70", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The watch is not the same as the one at the pic.The one I receieved is from China design and the configuration is not the saem.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple & working", "Author": "mahmoud mohab elsawaf", "ReviewID": "R1KQ0SD9P0QIKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is Nice & Accessible -very simple -easy to use - dual sim to use two lines- rubber is water safe-", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "user manuel  so so !", "Author": "marcelino", "ReviewID": "R1DUYX3QCBWEU7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The  watch  is  flimsy  , when i took it out the box the screen  frame came out  .i did put it back on but was not sure it would stay on if i wear the watch.try 3 different sims card  and could not make a callso not very happy with it", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "product/ service great", "Author": "Dave Jewett", "ReviewID": "R272WYZ9BC87G8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am retired and wanted an convenient way to carry my cell phone.

I took my watch off and turn off my phone. She was very impressed and talk to me every chance she got. Well, when we arrived in Germany she asked me for my number.
