The screens have the connector cable torn off or damaged, so they do not function at all. When I complained I was told that a lot of people had the same complaint. They said they would return my money, but they have failed to do so.

The lower part of the key pad and the volume buttons kept getting stuck. Then a week after I received it, the screen went blank. I took the phone to a local shop to fix it. They opened it up to discover it didn't have the original bb battery. It was not factory refurbished. The setting inside some of the parts were plastic and not well cleaned versus the original bb settings, etc. Two weeks later the lower row in the key pad went out again, now I can't dial any phone numbers with 7 or 9.  Can't text as the space button as well as some of the characters don't work.  I contacted the shipper and he said: well take it back to the shop to fix it or mail it back to me to fix it for you!!! So far I paid $117 for this lemon and $50 to fix it, that is almost 50% of the cost of the phone!  Not to mention the time and aggravation.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry on my life!", "Author": "Jose F.
