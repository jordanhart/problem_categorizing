{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Expensive, but full featured and high quality", "Author": "Tobin Coziahr \"Intergalactic bounty hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R1WX3XETSA9ETE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What do you want from your phone?I'm a bit of a gadget geek, so I wanted it all.  I wanted text messaging, a large color screen, web access, AOL AIM access, Java-based games, you name it.  So, I was willing to shell out the big bucks when it came to getting a phone.I got the i95cl about a year ago, and I've been very satisfied with the phone's performance.  I'm not as satisfied with Nextel, though, who you have to get service from to get this phone.  All the features you could ever want are there, but you're going to pay for them.  Web access costs money, text messaging costs money, caller ID costs money...  they nickle and dime you for all the features on their network.  They have package deals, which is what I use, where it's $15 a month for all their internet access features, which makes it reasonably affordable, but if you're looking for a cheap phone and a cheap monthly bill, you won't get it with this phone, and with Nextel.Now, back to the phone.  Here are the pros:- Pretty good battery life (I charge every 2 to 3 days).- Very sturdy design, unlike several phones I've owned before.  The antenna is tough, and so is the case.  Dropping it won't break it.- Loud and clear sound, and a built in speakerphone.- Color screen, which is nice for looking at web sites, or playing the Java games...  which leads us to...- Built in Java engine which allows you to download applications from Nextel right onto the phone.  Games, business applications, notepads, there are lots of fun java tools to play with.  Some are free, and some you have to pay for.- Nextel Direct Connect, which you can only use to talk to other Nextel customers, but the phone functions as a walkie-talkie, and it's very convenient.- Internet access, allowing you to text message, instant message, receive emails, and browse the web (text only).- Voice activated dialing, which is convenient.- Amazing coverage.  I have service inside buildings when no one else does.  The antenna picks up signals well, and Nextel has great coverage.This is all well and good, you say, but what are the drawbacks?  There are a few cons to this phone:- Size.  Man, is this a big phone.  I have a holster on my belt, it really isn't \"pocket sized\".  To get a nice big screen, and durability, you have to sacrifice size.- Cost.  As I said before, the phone is expensive, and so are all the cool little extras.  You probably will be paying $50/mo for this phone.- Web access is text only, which is unfortunate, as some new phones are entering the market with real graphical web browsing.So, like I said at the beginning of this review, what do you want from your phone?  If you're willing to pay for it, this phone has it all.  It's a little big, and a little costy, but I've been in love with it for a year now, and I don't think I'll be trading phones any time soon.", "Date": "October 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Amazon and Nextel do not partner well together", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RANRLKQOA41E6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do not like the phone because it only holds a charge for about 12 hours...If you use it it holds it for less time.  I ordered two of these and it happens with both.  I also tried replacing the phone and it happened with the new one as well.  The second problem occured when I signed up with Amazon for Nextel service. I was told by Nextel that I would not have a specific length of time I would have to keep my service.  They said this was special for Amazon customers...However when I tried to cancel the service I was told I had to stay in a contract for one year.  I NEVER signed or agreed to a contract however I am told I am being held to one.  I have been going around in circles with these two companies and nobody can get their act together...Love Nextel service but not when you use Amazon to get it...Try another plan or go directly through Nextel.", "Date": "December 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Nextel is definitely the Best of the Best", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R35M3KAOFTL8FY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow!  What a spectacular phone!  From clarity of the screen to clarity of the calls, this service beats all other cell phone providers by a mile.  I have never had a cell phone that I can use in elevators before, or in basements, or in the middle of the woods- but this one works in all those places (and for all those who complain about it not working in your house sometimes, move out of the boondocks- all cell services have a few black holes)!  Not only is the cell phone service great, but the walkie talkie feature is creative, convenient and useful.  Some complain about the larger phone styles- but the ruggedness of the phones are so worth it (I have dropped mine a million times and it has never even flinched at working).  I will never have another cell phone service!

I know there are camera phones out there, and phones with better graphics that are thinner, but none of them have the great service that Nextel offers. I've tried all the major providers that are available here and they just don't compare. There are so many ways you can personalize this phone. But one of the relatively few drawbacks is that you can't assign a ringtone to certain people. Although you can with the new phones that just came out. But overall, this is a great phone with many features and you can add ringtones, wallpapers, java programs... I would have given it 5 stars, but it is a bit bulky, and you are limited compared to the newer phones out there. But you really can't go wrong with the i95cl.", "Date": "October 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2SEOPS5FGPSXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is great.

The phone itself is the best I've had in years.  Clear calls and it gets signals where my previous AT&T service would not.  My guess is that this is partly due to the good Nextel coverage my area gets.As for the phone...I did not particularly like the v60 series.  My flip seemed cheap and I broke the antenna really easily.  This phone feels much stronger and better constructed.  Lucky for me all of my v-series accessories fit, so there were no extra purchases needed.

I've used almost all lines of phones. The i95cl was my favorite until i830 came along. The i95 is good for casual and especially heavy business users. The color LCD screen is huge compared to i730 and i830. Apparently Nextel had to reduce screen size in order to reduce phone size. That is one thing I miss in i830. I never had a problem with i95 size since it weighs about 5 oz. Great phone and I could not believe Nextel would discontinue it. *Note: I have an extra i95 for sale. It was my personal phone and in very good condition with some scratches. It is fully operational, travel charger and holster, shipping in USA included for flat $120.00. I will accept paypal only.

It is ideal for people who want a serious phone that is very productive and avoids the frills of other phones. I have used many phones and this one has the best reception hands down. There is plenty of room for Java-apps and ringtones to personalize the phone. It is a little larger then alot of cell phones, but not unbearable. Compare it to buying a different phone and a different walkie-talkie and then carry both of those in your pocket.

Hughes \"NoMoreNextels\"", "ReviewID": "R1K44P0YAY74QV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message \"network not available\". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end.

The Direct Connect feature is easy to use and instant, there are NO ROAMING charges at all, prices are very reasonable, phones are rugged, wireless web and email functions are easy to use and fast, battery holds charge for 2 or more days on this COLOR phone (that is some kind of miracle as other color phone I have had have to be charged at least once a day), and it is comfortable to hold and use.  The blue lighted buttons are cool and easy to use in the dark and the full color display is just excellent with many downloadable wallpapers, ring tones, and java applications. The speaker phone is crystal clear as is the push to talk fuctionality.  The customer service department is fast, polite and effective.  I have never had a phone or service that is so pleasing and easy to use overall.
