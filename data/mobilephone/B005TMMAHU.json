You have to be aware that this won't be a brand new phone. When I received this product it felt as if it were either a used or a re-furb unit. The outer appearance of the phone was like new, but the packaging didn't feel that way.Internals- It is indeed an unlocked (international) phone and it works on international carriers. However, it seems that the phone was not \"Factory unlocked\" i.e. it did not came out of RIM factory as an unlocked phone. It was presumably released as a carrier branded phone because every time I boot up the phone there was a splash screen with a carrier logo I couldn't quite recognize to be a US carrier. After a bit of research I realized it was a Canadian cellphone carrier. So, this phone was a carrier locked cellphone in Canada and had made it's way to the US where someone unlocked it. The next thing that confirmed that it was a carrier locked phone is that the Wifi hotspot feature. That option won't turn on at all, it says \"Activation required\". This is typical for cellphone carrier companies to disable wifi hotspot features on smartphones and even if the phone is unlocked this feature remains locked (I have faced similar situation with an AT&T; GoPhone Android phone, however this doesn't apply to iPhones). On top of that, for some odd reason my sister has to manually select networks everytime she travels, which is a bit annoying. Battery life is not great either.So at the end of the day this is a genuine Blackberry phone, used or refurb one. Not a brand new unit for sure. For this price I think it's ok, but there are other better phones out there that you can get with this money.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "mal funcitioning", "Author": "wendy rivero", "ReviewID": "R3R59HCU2CI9BQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this for my mother.

I am actually very impressed with the phone, just frustrated I can't utilize all of its capabilities. I will update again as things change, hopefully for the better.----Having spent a very frustrating week trying to get this to work, I am finally admitting defeat and sending it back to the seller for a refund.Having tried all the usual things to get the BIS to kick in, including multiple battery and SIM pulls, including leaving said items to one side for ten minutes before replacing. Many attempts to resolve the problem with my local carrier, Digicel, have proved fruitless, including, my last ditch attempt to get this working - a new SIM. It still comes up with 'Registration message queued. It will be sent when data coverage is available' whenever I try the Host Routing Table.  It is beyond frustrating, because I wanted this phone due to its professional email and Docs to go capabilities. Well, now I am sending it back, and I will just settle for a data phone that works! Not one that I need to jump through 10 million impossible hoops to get to accept me. Blackberry - it is officially over between you and me - that was your last chance and you blew it!So now I have to move on with my life.
