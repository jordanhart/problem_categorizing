Before getting into details about a few of the amazing features of this excellent phone, here is a summary of what I really liked about the Blackberry Curve and how the new Galaxy S2 compares:1. It was easy to type text on the Blackberry because it has a physical keyboard which even a user with big fingers can cope with. I was put off on-screen keyboards a couple of years ago by the truly appalling and virtually un-usable Blackberry Storm, but the Samsung is really OK in this department even though its keyboard appears on-screen because the key points are so large, and when you finger a key a larger image of it pops up to confirm which key you have activated.2. The Blackberry's party piece was very easy and intuitive email management, which I need to use all day long for business messages. Well, the Samsung is surprisingly good here too, with the added bonus of a huge screen and the facility to enlarge or reduce text size with a sweep of the fingers, iPhone style. The text clarity is first class.3. The Blackberry has very long battery life and typically I'd only need to charge it every 4 or 5 days, even with heavy usage. The Samsung does not fare well in comparison and needs daily charging, but there's a number of things you can do to prevent high power consumption like turning off features you're not using and not playing music through it (if using the phone principally as an iPod-like music player is important to you, then this Samsung may not be for you as battery life will be reduced to a few hours).4. The Blackberry is small and handy in size, whereas the Galaxy is 3x larger (but about the same thickness) - however in compensation, you get that amazing huge screenFor a really comprehensive techy overview, please look to other excellent reviews of this product. Here's a summary of the main features of this amazing phone from my simpler perspective:* The AMOLED screen on the Galaxy is definitely its star attraction: huge, bright and clear with fabulous colour definition, it's even better than the iPhone or iPod. Designers have finally copped-on that people don't want ever smaller and smaller phones and no-one wants to watch a movie on a screen 1.5cm square; they want something of a convenient size that they can use and read easily at arm's length* Despite the substantial size, it's thin and lightweight at only 116g which makes it no problem in your pocket and a big advantage to a smaller person when making long calls (the iPhone for example is around 20g heavier)* All functions are very intuitive and easy to use - at least as good as the iPod4 with a similar feel* Calls are easy to make due to the big clear graphics and easy-to-follow menus - however it has some minor quirks like you can't answer a call by actually pressing the green phone symbol, you have to `sweep' across it - but once you learn this, everything is OK. The ear-speaker and voice-mike are both very good and very clear; reception so far first-class with no dropped calls* The quality of the image from the camera is also exemplary (but make sure the flash is turned on)* The Galaxy has a standard connect-to-computer/mains charger socket, a micro-USB port located on the base-edge of the phone. Finally manufacturers have chosen (not before time) to stop ripping-off their customers by making them buy new chargers with every new handset and begun to standardize - FINALLY!In summary I'd say if you're looking for a smartphone, the Galaxy S2 is a very serious contender. It's beautifully designed, its screen is absolutely amazing - you need to just use it for a couple of minutes to appreciate how good it is - yet it's lightweight. The menus are intuitive and easy to master; it has loads of optional software and aps (mostly free to the user, unlike with Apple); making calls and managing email is a breeze. It's a weather forecaster, a GPS street-finder and a web browser with astoundingly clear screen definition unlike anything I ever used before.Possible cautions include barely acceptable battery life, and for this it drops a star: if you're a current Blackberry user you'll really notice this, and especially so if you use it as a music player. Also the Galaxy might be intimidating if you're a technophobe who just wants a simple phone to make calls. But it compares very well in all essentials against the iPhone: it's lighter, cheaper and the screen is better, and most of the aps for which Apple charges you, you get with the Galaxy for free.One final point: make sure you buy a good robust case and a screen protector for it; there's plenty of choice and most of them do the job OK.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "This runs on the TI OMAP processor and NOT Exynos", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1X4CVZAWFERJX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this thinking it was the I9100 GS2 but instead I received a I9100G, the \"G\" makes a huge difference.Samsung quietly rolled out the I9100G with a TI OMAP 1GHz instead of the Exynos 4210 which is 1.2GHz and is also what makes the GS2, the GS2.

What we didn't realize, however, was that Samsung made this with two different processors.  The much more common chip was a Samsung Exynos processor called the I9100.  The phone that we bought in this auction was the I9100G.  The \"G\" means that this doesn't use Samsung's Exynos chipset, but instead uses a one made by Texas Instruments.  The phones are otherwise identical, but the performance on the I9100 is slightly better.  More importantly, the I9100 is the \"real\" Galaxy S II.  It's the one that sold in much higher volume, so when Samsung says they're releasing an update for the Galaxy S II, they're talking about the i9100.  Eventually, the same fix trickles down to the I9100G, but it takes a while.  Case and point: the Galaxy S II started to receive the update to Android 4.0.3 (ice cream sandwich) back in late February or early March.  The I9100G didn't start rolling out ICS until May 30th.My wife doesn't care about ICS at all, so this didn't effect her user experience at all.  But I was disappointed because we didn't know this going in.  Fortunately, ICS has finally come out, and we were able to install it by connecting the phone to Kies (no flashing of roms with Odin needed!), and the phone is now a lot snappier and responsive than it was when we first bought it.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to someone who's looking for a thin, powerful phone with a great camera.  But if you're a power user who's going to want to flash custom roms, you should avoid the G model.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "except for battery life, almost impossible to hope for a better phone", "Author": "Manuel Antonio Arce Arenales \"MAAA\"", "ReviewID": "R2H2NANU31HUKN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Of all the phones I've used or tried out -including iPhone 4s- this is hands down the best of the lot.  I have become a fan of Android operating systems after using extensively both an Android tablet and an iPad 2.  On the average, at least for my purposes, Android provides excellent apps for a wide variety of needs at very reasonable prices.  In fact, many of the best ones are actually free.  Aside from this advantage, which might be attributable to my personal preferences or necessities, the Galaxy S II is an incredibly well designed phone, very, VERY light, with a superb screen and a camera that rivals much bulkier point and shoot dedicated cameras.  It is incredibly easy to use -very intuitive controls.  Sound is crisp and reception is excellent. The phone is very thin and extremely light weight, as pointed out before, but by virtue of its oversized screen it is on the very edge of being uncomfortable to carry in ordinary pockets.  However, this slight inconvenience is more than compensated by the advantages provided by the very large display, which has also great resolution, vibrant colors and usability even under direct sunlight.  On the down side -and this is the only reason I knocked off one star- the battery life leaves much to be desired.  If you are a heavy user, you'll be lucky to get one ordinary day's use per charge.

Basically all or most Galaxy phones you see on amazon are counterfeit or as some lame non-English speaking reviewers call them 'fake'. They are manufactured in Asia. Not Japan nor Korea. They come unlocked but they are knock-offs.So how do you get a good genuine functional Galaxy. There are 2 options only: Either directly from Amazon or from your cell provider T-Mob, ATT, Verizon etc. Sprint often sells garbage. Now there is one extra option if you don't mind acquiring a used phone. You buy it on amazon from a private party pre-owned but originally purchased from the cell provider .Don't go on ebay. ebay is a huge gabage dumpster and from my own experience all you are ever gonna get on ebay is.... yes, garbage. So, stay away from used ebay phones. There are other online retailers selling Galaxys (not the Universe, the phone) but again it's a risky business as even they don't know it's a counterfeit.Samsung Galaxy has become so overwhelmingly popular that nothing will stop counterfeiters to make and distribute them.And ... my last advice: don't buy phones that are claimed to be unlocked. There is a 90% chance it's a counterfeit! Same applies to those that are claimed International. They are international for one reason.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone, case quality issues", "Author": "wutzel", "ReviewID": "ROVW1FAQFX6J7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this phone in November of 2011 as a replacement for my Apple iPhone 4.  the difference in display quality and speed is striking, although this is not exactly a fair comparison since the Apple iPhone is an older product. All in all it is very refreshing to work  with an operating system that does not restrict you the same way Apple's IOS does.Samsung created a great phone that works amazingly fast, it would have been nice if they had left the bloatware off the international unlocked version. I ended up fixing this by routing the phone and installing a custom version of ice cream sandwich on it.The phone itself is a very decent quality, it does have a striking flaw in the casing though. The chrome bezel around the casing  is of reality low quality plastic. As a result, the  \"chrome\" just chips off very quickly. The plastic is obviously just painted and not chrome color and underneath its black, so this will become unsightly very fast. I have even had this issue when using a protective sleeve. The quality is so bad that regardless the paint will start chipping off. the rest of the casing is actually pretty scratch resistant and well done so one would wonder why Samsung would choose such poor material on the bezel of a $500 phone.

It also drains the entire battery of the phone within 4 hours. I never connected my phone to a faulty port, I never got the phone wet but this problem persists. I've done research into these problems and they apparently have a chance of randomly happening to your phone. The gs2 also has major problems with its touch screen.

If you've made it this far, then you've probably already done most of your research. Needless to say, Samsung has emerged as one of the top android smartphone manufactures. I bought this phone 3 months ago as my first android phone after making the switch from a dying iPhone. Overall, I'm satisfied with it but there are a few things that I don't like and I haven't found these mentioned in other reviews so I will mention them here for you:1) First of all, this phone comes packed with Android ICS, however recently it received an update to Android Jellybean although it provides many enhancements, not all of them will be available to the S2.2) The Galaxy line of phones have many features provided by Samsung in addition to those which are available as part of the Android operating system. Unfortunately, many of the Samsung branded programs and features are not very useful. I'd even consider them bloatware as they take up space on the internal memory and can't be deleted from the phone. So consider that despite whatever the advertised size of the phone's internal memory is, you will only have about half of that space available to use.Most importantly - CHEAP CHEAP HORRIBLE CONSTRUCTION3) I love the fact that the phone feels light in my hand. Its smooth, polished and slick. I love that it has a removable battery, something the iPhone didn't have, which makes replacement quick and painless without the need for Samsung customer service to get involved. HOWEVER. Its hard to avoid the fact that this phone is made out of plastic; not even thick impact resistant plastic or carbon or some other non-metal durable material but cheap, almost paper thin plastic. Need proof of this? Look at the back cover which conceals the battery. You could easily snap it in half if you're not careful. For Samsung to create a premium smart phone with tons of bells and whistles...and then produce it in a cheap plastic shell is ridiculous. You have to be extremely careful not to damage your phone and with the construction quality, its VERY easy to do. There are issues of the entire phone flexing or getting slightly twisted over time due to whatever reason whether that's caused by handling or being in your pocket, etc...who knows. This is a major problem that Samsung has failed to address. As I've said, I've only had my phone for 3 months and this has already happened to me. Which leads me to my next point:3) Due to the poor construction, there is a possibility that the digitizer (the panel under the glass screen which enables touch controls) to crack. This can also happen due to poor batter construction. The batteries on these S2 phones tend to get hot and expand, applying pressure to the digitizer/screen. I have seen this already as my screen now has 3 hairline fractures which appeared almost magically. Samsung won't repair these phones because they consider that the screen fractures are due to poor handling of the phones It is not. It is due to poor construction and cheap materials.Before you make your purchase, please be aware of these issues which are not exclusive solely to the Galaxy S2 but to all Samsung devices made of cheap plastic. This includes the Note S2, S3, S4 and others. Since Samsung won't repair my phone, I must consider doing on my own but that voids the warranty...which apparently doesn't cover manufacturing flaws anyway so its a non-issue I suppose. However, its still an expensive fix which I shouldn't have to do 3 months into the life of my new phone. I won't purchase another Samsung phone or device ever again. Instead, I intend to get the new HTC One which is a much better phone to the Galaxy line and is made of a solid block of aluminum.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unlocking phone problems", "Author": "Jorge Avenda\u00f1o", "ReviewID": "R3VV1ORTVLBHRX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a problem in my country Ecuador because my operator company Claro has another type of frequency to use it so i 'll go to Orlando, Florida between september and october this year in order to vacations searching the choice to change the phone with another one or returning my payment.

The model came as described, it powered up and worked immediately.  Within a week, however, the screen cracked in multiple places, leaking the LCD liquid inside, making the phone unusable.  It didn't crack because I dropped it or abused it.  It cracked because I had it in my pocket for an hour.  And I wasn't playing rugby or anything while it was in my pocket.  I was simply sitting in my car.  I made a phone call, all was fine, put the phone in my pocket, got in my car, an hour later, took the phone out of my pocket, and the screen was cracked and unusable.  I can't return the phone because I no longer have the original packaging.  So now I'm stuck with a $300 coaster.  Just beware.  If you do buy this phone, save the packaging, and preferably, try to find one with a warranty.  If this was an actual, genuine Samsung product, then I'm alarmed at the poor quality.  I thought Samsung was better than this.  However, given how easily it cracked, I suspect that this may have been a counterfeit or a used phone being sold as new, having been rebuilt with a non-Samsung screen.  Just speculating there.

Juman", "ReviewID": "R3OJG2Q0SCRZV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I was contemplating on this phone or the Nexus Prime, but after seeing the price of the prime I went ahead and got the S2. I am really glad I did because I don't see the prime being worth ~50% more than what I paid for S2 (Just to have a slighly bigger screen and ICS-at least those are the only two additional features i was interested in). My brother has the black i9100 while I got the ceramic white version. Personally I prefer the white version.I am coming from a Nokia N900 so what impresses me most about this phone is the weight, slimness, screen size and to a lesser extent screen quality. Some people arent getting good battery life but I have to say mine does quite well. I unplugged my phone at about 7am and is now almost 5pm and I am still at 80% battery life. I used the phone to make a few calls, send a couple txts and msn msgs. MSN is running and so is Google talk, took a couple pics, sent them via email, golocker with live lockscreen is running and my wallpaper is also a live xmas one. I also did a few other things with various apps. Normally I charge the phone every night but if needed I could use the phone for 2 days easily.What I didnt really like was the contact importation and integration system. It was kind of a mess after importing from google, facebook, twitter, msn etc. I also dont like only being able to join up to 5 contacts.My Pros:- nice screen size and colors- light- slim- good looking phone- speedy and fluid screen movements (almost as good as the iphone 4)- takes great pics- captures nice HD video- lots of apps available since its android- very respectable battery life- microsd card slotMy Cons:- back of phone can get quite hot- no native mini or micro HDMI out- although i like the screen size i wish the resolution was higherI also have to add that OEM shop did a great job with fast shipping and they were VERY helpful in resolving a small issue I had.

It becomes less and less worth it to buy older models that have already been outclassed by newer ones.  This goes especially for the S2 for it's exorbitant price of over $200 after the S3 and S4 has been released.  I personally had many problems with Samsung galaxy types.  I can't speak for this year's models S4, but the S2 and Note 1 have that all to familiar charging port problem.  Hopefully it has been troubleshooted for the newer models for the sake of Samsung's reputation compared to Apple's.  For now, by my S2's dead pixel and column of pixels with discoloration within the first month I got the phone, I have to say that Apple's older(than S2) model of the iphone far outclasses the S2 in terms of at least anything to do with the battery and the make of the display. I also hate this phone's OS.  You can change it yourself, but the one that comes with the phone is not incredibly intuitive, it's cumbersome.  I hate being forced to search for something, and in this case, I had to find a way to close all active applications.  Then I have to close all active applications every time I use the app because I don't want the open app to supposedly drain battery life.  Next problem lies in the downloading for apps which can be synonymous to torrenting in that you do not know what else you are downloading.  I found a couple of unrelated pictures I do not ever remember print screening or downloading that appeared in my S2 gallery.  I used another app to find the problem app I previously downloaded.  After uninstalling that app which I had to do from the play store, my gallery stopped gathering useless pictures.  On the iphone, closing an application and deleting an app is much more intuitive, just pressed the home button and  put your finger on the app and press the x respectively.  I also had a problem with connecting the S2 to the computer.  It is not intuitive in that you had to go into settings to connect to the computer.  For me specifically, the entire connection to the computer failed on me despite the phone's still existing ability to charge with correct ports.  I used multiple USBs just in case the one I had was faulty.On the Up sidethe plastic is more durable than glass.You can open up a galaxy S2 and replace memory and battery, it's harder on iphone circa 2011(I've opened it up to the glass).You can use the galaxy s2 as a portable USB in which you can actually open up pdfs and files if applications exist for it and files can be take out from files on your laptop. I know you can also back things up using google accounts and similar, but the USB is a point of convenience. The iphone I had could transfer files via Google accounts, but you couldn't/ it was harder to find specific files so much so that you couldn't use it as a USB.  At the time it connected directly to itunes through which I couldn't find pdfs or docs.I'm comparing 2011 model iphone and S2.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Any", "ReviewID": "R26OLWBBHF4O4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received what I expected.

I currently own a Galaxy 2 T989 in which I have had for 24 months this month. I love my phone and it has held up very well in fact it still looks brand new. I needed to purchase 3 phones as I pay for my nieces and nephew's phone plans. I purchased the phones from \"DEAL GRABBER\" and I would rate this company 5 stars as on their profile at the bottom they have a phone number and I have called them 3 times on different days and someone has always answered with excellent customer service.1. The phones sent from them were brand new in excellent condition, shipped fed ex with signature upon receipt.2. No one could answer my questions regarding the GT vs SA version (white or black phone option) on Amazon. Ultimately, Deal Grabber believes it is a typo in the listing as each listing can carry multiple sellers. Once I received the phones, the SA white phones had a GT manuel inside so I have concluded that it is in fact a typo on the listing and both phones are GT (the white version lists SA and the Black version lists GT)3. It does not get 3g or 4g with TMobile (but it works with TMobile in every other regard) I spent an hour on the phone with TMobile trouble shooting and this particular model does not work with their signals. Deal Grabber is figuring this out as well, and they stated they are going to try to make a notation on the listing. The phones are suppose to be able to pick up 3g and 4g anywhere in the world but according to the way they are programed with the TMobile code, it only picks up 2g with TMobile. TMobile confirmed that the phone is an interntional phone made by Samsung but it all has to do with the code inside the phone's program (I honestly do not understand much beyond that).4. This phone is fully unlocked. I took my SIM card out of my current phone and was able to make calls, receives emails etc (on the TMobile network). I could not obtain a signal greater than 2g or also read as E.Conclusion, the phone itself is beautiful (I highly doubt in any way it is a knock off as previously stated in another review) but I had to return all 3 because of the 4g issue. Deal Grabber made the return extremely easy and sent me a return label. I highly recommend them and only recommend the phone if you are not with TMobile.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The problem in my life", "Author": "BaThien", "ReviewID": "R1MXQ3N0WCL54I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my sister , the 1st problem is I received this phone with the broken battery door.

The four main issues for me:1. Data speedI am a T-Mobile customer and like many others I only realized after the purchase that I would not get anything faster than Edge with this phone. There has been talk about AT&T; handing over some of its 1900 MHz frequencies to T-Mobile as restitution for the failed merger, but there is no timeline.Clearly my fault, and because I did not do my research, I was willing to live with the data speed restriction, though. I am not a heavy data user and the phone works fine for email and the occasional Google Maps navigation job.2. Spotty GPSI used the phone to track my runs and found myself walking up and the down the street for 10 minutes until I got a GPS fix. When I analyzed the track, it added as much as 1/2 a mile to the distance and had me run in circles along the way. So I got a Garmin Forerunner instead.3. Short battery lifeThe battery life is the worst I have seen (it does not last a work day - dies around 5pm), and it seems to change with every Android update which makes it more unpredictable. I have three spare batteries now and juggling them and making sure they are charged is a major hassle.4. CameraOne of the reasons I bought this phone was the great reviews of the camera. I think it stinks. It does not even come close to the iPhone. Photos taken outdoor in bright sunlight are ok, but  anything less than perfect light conditions results in grainy and underexposed pictures.With these issues, it is time to replace the phone after only 9 months. I cannot recommend the Galaxy S II SA-I9100.11/28 Update: I added 2 points. I just recently discovered that I am now getting HSPA+ service in certain areas. See my uploaded screen shot for proof.

The Samsung chip(comes only with the international version) on the phone has a better Graphics Processor, and I definitely enjoy the smooth screen graphics on it.

Getting a year old S2 unlocked is definitely a good decision made by me.Typing on the phone using the swype technology is really easy. As for the voice recognition software on the phone, it beats the competition out there hands-down. The voice recognition is pretty good at understanding foreign accents apart from just the British and the American accents, this I find really amazing. Good voice training has been done by the software company in this area.If your technically adept you can get a lot out of this phone. It delivers a lot. Even if a person is not too technical he can easily use this phone.There is just 1 gripe I have about the phone, in that the alarm system on the phone is easy to turn off, so if I accidentally hit off instead of snooze, that can cause some issues. I am sure there is a better free app out there in the android store that I can use.The phone comes with a built in radio, an amazing camera, and good maps. I can also use this phone anywhere in the world for maps, as it has google support for maps.

To sell a phone in a country where the service is 3g but the phone can only run on EDGE 2g speed is ridiculous. It is slow unless connected to wifi and when I look at the specs it shows the model number is GT-I9100. NOT the SA-I9100 like it says.As for the only shipping in the US part, when I turned it on the language was in German because the manufacturer is in Germany. What is the point of having a phone that cannot connect to the strongest signal in your area?My main concern is being able to access at least 3g speed. I think the seller should step up and either trade me a phone that works in California on 3g at the very least or refund my money. I'm so irritated with this.It is a fast phone when it comes to the apps I download(which took 20 minutes to download)but when i'm trying to use Facebook or the Internet it's slow and my text messages are delayed.Does anyone know how I can fix this and get 3g?I feel like I have been scammed and I'm really considering not doing any more business with Amazon.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dirty phone and no headphones", "Author": "Gustal", "ReviewID": "R2AHL9BCTQAPYN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I went to open the phone box i could tell that the box had already been opened and resealed bc it was sealed different form the way my wifies Galaxy S2 was(it was bought from samsung).

The attitude of the people at the company \"Transformers & GSM Phones company \" that I bought my Samsung galaxy SII, was very bad.When i got my phone it was nice and it was delevired as they said. after opening the package and charging the batteray, I found that the phone was very slow for a new phone especilly when I open:text messages, connect to the Wifi, answer a phone while im doing something else it just hangs up and GPS was crashing all the time.So I read online that the S2 with operating system 3.X something version has almost the same problems.Samsungs website advices consumers to update to the new Icecream sandwich operating system instead  of the old one which was 3.X something.and that update can be done through Samsung application which is called Kies.When i plugged my S2 to kies to update. The Kies gives a message that this system is not recognised by Kies.When i Talked to the Guys on Transformers & GSM Phones company about the problem the guy was very rude and he said that we are not responsible to sell you a phone that can be updated to a new operating system we are only responsible to sell a phone that works. How it works is not their bussiness.So by his statement and his attitude which basically killed the whole expereince of buying from amazon.com. not worth the headache people being rude to me while i paid the full price.regardsHaider Erbelli", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Questions", "Author": "happy2013", "ReviewID": "R1NPCS855ID3ZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Will this phone works in T-Mobile 4g network and if you have answeer it would be very helpful and also will this phone work in diferent countries.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's awesome", "Author": "Jake Kim", "ReviewID": "R1RWIWOTB9MN8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cell phone is so awesome.
