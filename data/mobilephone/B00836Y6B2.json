This uses the WINDOWS PHONE 7.5 operating system and DOES NOT support MicroSD cards.This is actually an awesome phone (that's why I didn't want to give a 1 star rating, take it as you may) and I'm a WP 7.5 user who really enjoys it but it's important that people buy based on the true information of the product.

The screen just blew me away and the OS is very fast and user friendly. This is the first time I try a Windows phone and I have to say that it's been a wonderful experience. From now on I'll just use Windows phone for my daily use. My next gadget will be Nokia Lumia 920. I just can't look foward for this phone to hit the market. Nokia designs the best and most beautiful phones and now they work with the best OS on the market. Well done, Nokia and Microsoft!Now, let's talk about Apps. I've read many comments of people talking about the ''lack of app'' on the Marketplace. I can tell my own experience. I come from Android and also I had a Apple iPhone 4S and the only App missing on the Marketplace (talking about me and the apps I use the most) are Instagram and OVO (and I've heard Instagram is comming soon to Windows Phones before this year ends). I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MSN, KiK, Viber, Badoo, SkyDrive, Tango, Skype,Youtube,Shazam, SoundHound, Netflix, IMDb, Evernote, ESPN, CNN, Univision,SkyMap, TuneIn Radio, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and Weather much more... Also the Nokia App (Nokia Maps, Drive, City Lens, Music, Trailers, Creative Studio, Counters, Soundtracker, Transit, Contacts Transfer, Camera Extras and much more). The Marketplace keeps growing. The integration of Facebook, twitter, MSN, LinkedIn and Foursquare in my Windows Phone is AMAZING! I can put comments and give ''likes'' directly from my phone due to the AMAZING integretion between those Apps and my phone. and I don't have to go to the Facebook or Twitter App to do that.I'm totally in love with my Nokia Lumia 900 and its amazing OS! I 100% recommend it! If you wanna be different, switch and go for it!

However it's had a lot of problems and the store I bought it from on Amazon made it out to be a product made for the U.S. but it wasn't. As such there was no warranty on my phone and when it started having a lot of problems I had to return it. Amazon was really helpful in this as it was a couple months past the return date and they still gave me a partial refund.Nice Features:Camera: I love this camera. Takes beautiful pics especially up close photos with the macro setting. Colors always come out perfect in the daytime, but in any low light the colors come out really off.User Friendly: I do really like this about the phone. The tiles are fun and easy to use. I really liked the ability to shrink some of the tiles so that you could fit 4 in the place of a big tile, but this quit working on my phone after I was forced to restore it.Dislikes:Windows ''Marketplace:'' As windows is just starting out there aren't really any good apps. There's no good map app for one.Cold weather: This bugs me to no end. Any temperature below 60 degrees causes the phone to black out on the bottom half of the screen. If it's anywhere near 60 dark lines show up on the screen. You can still use the phone if you know where to click, but the blackened part is all pixely and it takes forever for it to go back to normal.Text/Pic Messaging: I bought this phone to use with Net10. I had to search around everywhere to find the correct codes to enter to get text and pic messaging to work but I finally found them. It worked for a couple months but then it just stopped working. I could send and receive texts, but I could only receive pics, I couldn't send them. It was really frustrating since Net10 technically doesn't \"guarantee'' pic messaging so they wouldn't help me.Overall, I was really looking forward to this phone, but it's really disappointing how much quit working. I don't know if just my phone is defective or if this has happened with a lot of people.

If I didn't have to deal with as zune application constantly telling me that my phone is not connected so onto the phone review the phone is solid. It's it's a great phone. It's true what they say it does not have this many apps as the Google play store . But before you go and look for another phone from me saying that this phone. The apps that they offer for this phone actually work. They have some really fun games apps that are really useful not just a bunch of apps take up space on your phone. The icons are large to start with, you can make them smaller. If you want you can pen things to your start screen like you would any other phone because zune does not seem to want to work and I'm not the only one that seems to have this problem to the oxidation because a lot of people have the same problem. What I had to do was make my phone into a USB mass storage device that way I can drop my music over to it. I can use my phone as a music player while I'm at work. The speaker is more than decent in the battery seems to last for ever. Or I should say it will last a lot longer than most cell phones. I play with my friends iPhone just to see if I would like it before I even bought this phone to be completely honest with you I am more than happy with this phone, and I highly recommend anyone who is looking to get a solid phone that will make phone calls of course take beautiful pictures respond quickly and not have to stick it on the charger every night, then this is going to be the phone for you. I read reviews where people were saying that they didn't like the pictures that the camera took to be completely honest with you I don't know what they're talking about the pictures that my phone takes their really nice. They even have a little apps in the App Store for free where you can add light little special effects to your pictures a flashlight app calendar apps that are built into the phone already. This is a functional phone into be on you is not going to be for everyone. There's a lot of people who are canis dock on the iPhone craze that will quickly shy away from you know, a Windows phone, but I think this is phone puts iPhone to shame.

I also think there is much wasted space on the front face at the top and bottom, that the screen doesn't use.  Wish it had a 4.5 or better yet a 4.7 inch screen.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. Lumia 900 has been succeeded by Nokia Lumia 920.  For someone interested in a first smartphone which doesn't break the purse, Lumia 900 is an excellent choice. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Lumia 900 has 4.3\" (109 mm) 800x480 resolution 217 ppi 16m compared to the Lumia 920 which has a 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 16 GB storage and 512 MB RAM compared to Lumia 920 which has 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  Lumia 900 has 8 MP camera and 720 p video compared to Lumia 920 which has a 8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.4 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor compared to Lumia 920 which has a 1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass  compared to Lumia 920 which has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.As you can see Lumia 920 has, what I would say incremental upgrades over 900 but nothing earth shattering. Lumia 900  as well as 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 1830 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 900 as well as 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.  Lumia 900 has Bluetooth 2.1, whereas  Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Lumia 900 has the diagnostic tool. It can be obtained by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.On this diagnostic tool one can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It's also possible to perform all the tests in one run. This is really cool to have this power at the user's hand!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 900 is certainly the best and cheapest Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market, it was really the best in 2012, but if you don't mind the budget get the 920 or 820 (for microSD card slot).", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "super fast", "Author": "angie b.", "ReviewID": "R9VE0A8WU5LDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to write 10 paragraphs, but this phone is great.

I love the Windows OS 7.5 - the user interface could not be more simple, attractive and intuitive! Skype app (downloaded from windows store) using WI-fi works perfectly. Signal: Good reception using either Etisalat/ROSHAN or AWCC service - plenty of supported apps left in the Nokia store...This is the best smart phone I have ever owned, EVER.  I like it slightly better than my New LG Optimus G(!) which I just purchased for stateside use. The screen on this Lumina 900 is beyond HD compliant and quite bright outdoors even in direct sunlight - a very important feature! Battery life is as expected while WI-fi and GPS are enabled, BUT it charges rapidly -especially if using USB 3.0 rapid charge -then it's 'incredulous charging speed'. The phone is comfortable in the hand, not too large, perfect actually for my ordinary male-sized hand; the subtle black texture on the back is of a no-slip design; convenient button placement (especially power on/off); responsive touch/tactile screen. The Carl Zeiss Camera has a lot of available useful adjustments as well as 'set it and forget it' AUTO settings - Tested: picture quality is excellent - video quality is HD. Overall: Just Perfect - I purchased this as refurbished and unlocked for travel abroad. I paid only $209 USD - worth every cent - This phone came with a brand new packaged micro USB charger; The seller surpassed my expectations with this one! Much appreciated!

When the Windows phone came out I was interested, and when I won one I was thrilled! Now that I've had the chance to play with and use the Nokia 900 here are my thoughts.First, wow. This is supposed to be THE camera for those who want great pictures. YEAH RIGHT. Nearly all of my pictures turn out blurry, and if I zoom in...OH.MY.GOSH. They are truly terrible. Pixelated and just horrid. This is most definitely NOT what I expected from this phone's camera!Another huge downfall for me is the inability to choose which album my photos go to when I share them to Facebook. This is a developer issue, I believe, not necessarily the phone's issue (but maybe it is?), but it is a BIG deal to me. I don't want photos to just go to my \"mobile uploads\".I miss my speed-dial option. I used to have a set key to call my house and my husband's cell phone, I am unable to do this with the 900. :(I also found it too easy to change the sound for the ringtone and in-call while in your pocket (or purse) or while you are actually talking/using the phone.Another thing I dislike is the ability to change the calendar view permanently. I prefer month view, but you cannot get month view to stay on your calendar settings, only daily view and then you have to touch to see the month view. A minor annoyance, but still very cumbersome to me.The battery life is unimpressive. With minor use I go through my battery in less than 10 hours. I need a battery that lasts longer. Even with the battery saver turning on it doesn't do enough. Also, if you prefer to have a light background vs the dark background you will go through your battery even faster. Have a car charger available!Another HUGE thing is the inability to select text. I often want to copy text that is in an email and I am unable to do this with the Lumia 900. Huge disappointment and another reason I miss Blackberry. :/Things I do like... I like the Windows OS. I like the Windows 8 OS better than this 7.5 Mango, but it's not all that bad. I like the ability to have multiple alarms. I like the screen, it's large and beautiful. The touch screen is pretty accurate, and I was able to transfer from the actual qwerty keyboard to the virtual one fairly easily ( I was very tentative of this).The apps that are available are great, there are plenty of free apps that are great to have. I love that I can watch Netflix on this device!

I bought this phone unlocked so I could use it without a contract. I think it is still connected to AT&T; because the carrier I am with is unable to unlock the section where I can get picture text. I would not buy another one since AT&T; seems to have a monopoly on them.  I was wondering if I can go into their store so they can tell me how to unlock the picture text part of it. I believe it would be better to buy a phone that is not connected to any carrier and there would be no problem.  I get drop calls in places where people with the same carrier doesn't them so I have to blame the phone. Because of all the problems I have with this phone, I would not recommend it to anyone unless I just happen to get one with a fault.

Well this is not the case with this toy..THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PHONE!! - FORGET PRACTICAL USE WITH THIS GADGETSimple, practical and easy is not part of the philosophy in this phone..Things you might be used to do on a couple of clicks, here they take 5 to 6 actions away (or more) and time consuming and frustrating results in many cases.. Understanding and finding your way around with Nokia Lumia 900 wp7 is a very high time consuming effort .. So if you are a busy person and like technology to improve your timing working routing, this is not a phone I would recommend.. Because many \"Basic\" cell functions are missing in the software wp7, and the only option you'll find is to search endlessly the \"market place\" to find app that may or may not suit your needs, download them, install them and use them for a while to see if they really work for you.. (mean while consuming the phone memory capacity) And in my case, I don't want to pay for apps that I have no proven knowledge how they work... So you'll end up searching the \"free\" category (which have advertising on them)-No smart dialing (while you type a number does not display contacts that match the number)-No possibility to customize font size-No \"select or select all\" option when typing-No \"one space back/forward\" buttons option when typing and/or correcting, editing any text-No undo-No cut-No possibility to see or view the date when typing a note, message or document-No return or back to previous task-No easy friendly connection, transfer of data through USB and PC-No contacts transfer, share, backup, update, save, import, export through USB or Bluetooth to your PC or other services-No Bluetooth connection to other phones or PC for picture, music or file transfer--Forget about Bluetooth services with this device (only a handful services incorporated) e.i. hands free and speakers, it's about it..-No message (SMS) save or export to PC..-SMS threads font very small size-For a pretty big screen, contact's info (phone numbers, address, e-mail, notes, etc) are ridiculously small font size!!! (can't change it)-What happened to font selection \"Small, Medium, Large\"?-No compatibility to PC Suite  (Nokia's software)-No ringtone selection as desire by user from own music files-No volume set up by user for default ringtones-Volume adjust same for every sound (lets say I just want to set up SMS sound louder but only that, it can't it won't let you)-No sound selection as desire for \"new sms\" or \"new email\" or \"reminder\" you are obliged to use its small library of boring sounds-the sounds options for \"new sms\", \"new email\" or \"reminder\" doesn't let you customize its loudness or volume independently.-No option in selecting any song from your library as ringtone, message, sms, alarms sounds-When playing a song from my Lumia's phone library, it doesn't have a possible way for moving ahead or scroll through the song (forward or rewind)-No phone book option on \"people\" (only internet accounts or all mixed)-Contacts have a Fixed platform that does not let you customize the Titles for Phone numbers-On Contacts the list of options for labeling Phone Numbers is short!! or limited.-If a Contact's name is longer than the space on screen, it wont let you see the complete name, it won't show it even if you place it horizontal view..-The Export/Import option (that you have to locate and download) for getting my Phone contacts from my older Nokia or iPhone to my Lumia, works mediocrely and poor, many details were left out...-No \"draft\" folder for SMS-No \"recent\" option for choosing contacts on sending SMS-No multiple selection of contacts on one step procedure for sending sms (as on \"Android\")-No possibility to create custom SMS folders, i.e. saving moms sms-Calendar \"Month\" view too small, unreasonable unreadable, no visible marks, tags, color or water marker for events-No scrolling day by day on calendar \"month view\", neither on \"calendar day view\".-Confusing calendar day view (looks like an endless list)-Only hourly settings on calendar day view (No minutes settings i.e. 2:30, 4:45, 10:15 or whatever) it is set up by default as a unnecessary long list even if empty..-No summary  view of daily set events when day selected on \"calendar month view\" (without having to go or redirected to day view)-let's say you enter a specific reminder on the calendar, and this repeats let's us say 4 days in a row.. Well there is no way to copy the whole thing and paste it, you got to re-write it all on each day independently on the calendar.-No tile color and/or size customize by user (a Tile is like a icon for shortcuts to a desired function or application)-What happened to saving contacts on the phone?? Only on a E-mail account??-if you are entering a phone number that already exists on your contacts (but you don't know) it won't tell you it already exists.-No adding feature of related apps to a single \"tile\" to group them (as on iPhone)-Sometimes people can get dizzy scrolling all the way down (or through) the endless \"tile\" collection  set up you might end up having, trying to make short cuts to phone functions.-They claim Zune (the connection app for PC and Lumia phones win7) is the ultimate software, but then again a set back in evolution.. Is quite a drag having to connect and disconnect your device in order to see or check if the file has been transferred.. (I get \"envy\" my wife transferring, music, pictures, etc from her computer to her cell phone ;-) and vise versa)-Many times when \"editing\" the info of a song (artist, album, etc) this info would appear on your PC but not updated on the phone..-Many albums from my collection do not appear on my Lumia \"album list\"-Many artists from my collection do not appear on my Lumia \"artist list\"-If you have a long list of music files as I do, with this software \"Zune\" I have to scroll all the way to find an specific music file (no \"find\" or \"search\")-arranges pictures by date.. which is fine, but what about trying to arrange by folder.. quite tricky-No lock/unlock gravity (when leaning to one side on the coach the view changes to horizontal, and that is not necessary what I want)-When I need to write a contact's number in different formats for dialing purpose (i.e. +country code, city, number  vs city code, number, the software will hide one or the other-Only one option for labeling a cell number, many times a contact will have more than 2 cell numbers, but here we have only one option to label a cell number, \"CELL PHONE\" (but only once) How do you label the second cell number? Home? Work? Ridiculous!!-Same thing for work numbers, there's only two \"work\" labels available (what if there are more than 2 work numbers as usually happens?)-No \"main\" and no \"general\" labeling for a contact's number-Only three (3) email addresses can be saved for a contact, and have a fixed label-No phone search, if want to search any thing from one place like most devices (phone search), this does not have it...-When you choose to forward an email, there isn't possible way to edit the content being forwarded.-And so on...*I have found that many users report that Nokia Lumia 900 w7 phone or device SHUTDOWN UNEXPECTEDLY VERY FREQUENTLY having to check constantly if the phone is on.. And find out that has been OFF for who knows for how long.. Can you imaging this? Expecting an important call or text message and find out that the phone has been OFF for who knows how long...  Well, mine is not the exception !!! it shuts down very frequently and unexpectedly, very annoying !!IN THE OTHER HAND If your life is lacking emotions and adventure.. You'll find this phone very amusing and entertaining... And time consuming..-Nice connectivity to the internet, this is more of a internet, social networking device and software... But not a phone!!-Nice prediction help while typing, but needs an UNDO and back/forth cursor option, and improve finger selection-Many things can be \"Pin to start\" (but size and color can't be customized) but then again, you'll end with a long selection of tiles and therefore scrolling endlessly through them to find the one you need to click-\"forward\" is hidden under reply button for sync email accounts..and you better have a 20 20 sightNOTE: I bought this phone because I used to be a Nokia fan.. I have tried to love this device but has disappointed me in a way I didn't expect.. for a \"smart phone\" no so smart..NOTE: Never the less, I see potential in this device, with an update (or Updates, that I doubt would happen) this would be one of the best and complete smartphones!

I just purchased a new Win8 computer and figured I would upgrade my phone to the Lumia 920 in the spirit of homogeneity. Let me tell you that doing so was a HORRIBLE idea - where to start.Weight - this brick, I mean phone,  tips the scales at a cool 185 grams, compared to the 133 gram Galaxy S3 or 140 gram iPhone 4S. When asked why it weighed so much, the salesman told me it was because the phone is made from the same composite as is astronaut helmets.  Nice - I can now sleep better knowing that if the Mayans are right, at least my Lumia 920 is prepared for its journey through the cosmos.To all my skinny jean wearing hipsters, you and this phone simply cannot be - the sheer size and mass of it make it a nightmare to carry in regular sized pants, I can't even imagine the kind of dances you'll do to get the Lumia in and out of your jeggings pockets. This brick could be a safety hazard if one of these crazy youths tries to rob me on his way to Hot Topic, though my Lumia could possibly double as a shield, or even a weapon if I decided to shotput at my assailant.Onto the UI - wow, anyone who says the apps are incredible must be kidding. Moving past the fact that google refuses to create apps for the Win8 OS, none of the apps that are built for this phone are designed by their actual developers. Facebook is a Microsoft app, Whatsapp doesn't even exist, the Pandora app is a blog about the music on Pandora - sweet, nothing satiates my hunger for The Jonas Brothers or Biggie Smalls like the words of Joe and Jane Smith as they opine on hottest 1950's Christmas album. What few games they do have, i.e. angry birds, looks like they have been shrunk down from a tv screen onto my phone. The aspect ratio is atrocious, not to mention that for me to download anything, I have to use my Hotmail account that I opened and retired when I was in fifth grade - which may be a real selling point for the hipsters as eclectic/old school schwag is all the rage these days.As per the screen size ... the phone may be huge but a good portion of it is cannibalized by the bezel , again probably some brilliant innovation necessary to make the phone more functional as I use it to fend off attacks but not when I want to compose documents in MS office, which is a function I will NEVER use on my phone.But our friends at Nokia were smart enough to include a wireless charger, this was a HUGE plus, I find that plugging my phone into the wall while I sleep at night is cumbersome AND tedious. Corded phones chargers are so 2010 - what are we still using the rotary phones here? Think of all the extra things I can do now that I don't have to plug my brick into the wall! At about 6 hours of battery life, I know that whatever charging device I get is going to get plenty of love.So that's it, this phone is horrible. Anyone who says otherwise is either crazy, or is finally making the upgrade from their Razor flip phone.

While it is a stylish phone of good build quality, you cannot judge a book by it's cover - which is the only place where the quality of this phone shines.  It's pretty, but.....So, Microsoft made a phone that is already obsolete, cannot use ANY instant messaging applications or multitask properly, and has numerous flaws that are just add up to a frustrating experience.  Not to mention that suppliers and third party companies are avoiding the Windows phone platform almost entirely.  Go to the electronics store and try comparing how many accessories you can find for all the other phones with what you can find for the Lumia 900 - it's beyond sad.  And the software!!  I had a Blackberry that ran the mobile MS Office applications with better functionality and feature-set than the MS hardware, MS software combination of the Lumia.  And MS owns Skype but wait, wait... nope, it doesn't work on the Lumia. (unless you disable your screen from timing out {dead battery} and keep Skype as the running app on the screen {switch to another app and Skype logs out}) Running one app works fine, but how smart is it to install an instant messaging application on a phone that cannot run instant messaging while you're doing something like, let's say, looking at the home screen of the phone to see what time it is.  Pathetic.I'm a sucker who used to have faith in Microsoft products, so I gave this phone a chance and believed all the fan-boy hyped reviews.  Repeat - I am the sucker.
