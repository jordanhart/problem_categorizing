{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good budget-friendly touchscreen phone", "Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "R30E7TR5I8SE65", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to replace my Nokia E63 because I wanted a phone with a touchscreen and a full keyboard. Here are what I think are the pros and cons so far:PROS:Nice size touchscreen, very bright and vibrant.Disregard what the previous reviewer said about the blue stripe on the bottom of the phone because THERE IS NONE. The plastic cover on the screen has a blue stripe but the actual phone is COMPLETELY WHITE.Camera quality is great and shutter speed is super quick.Keyboard is easy to use and keys are big.Interface is simple and easy to understand.CONS:A little bulky.Camera could get scratched easily since there is nothing to cover it.Definitely will need a screen protector.One other thing that I found to be more of a nuisance than anything else is that the GPS positioning option was turned on by default so every couple of minutes it would activate itself and eat up a few cents of the money on my phone. Luckily it was easy to turn off so nothing to worry about anymore.Overall I really like this phone. I've only had it for a short time but so far I haven't had any problems with it. I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a touchscreen phone with full keyboard that is also budget-friendly.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "better than expected", "Author": "nokia6230 \"nokia6230\"", "ReviewID": "R2WJ8229AE1089", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I came from an N85 so I'm fairly familiar with Nokia phones in general and the Symbian OS in particular.I wanted a touchscreen phone that had a keyboard that was within my budget. I would have gone for the mini N97 but it's a bit pricey considering the C7, N8 et al are coming out soon.I've read almost all available reviews I can read online so if you did that then you know what you're getting into with this phone.The only thing that surprised me was the resistive touchscreen. I bought this phone expecting to return it immediately but the touchscreen compared to my capacitive 2G ipod touch is amazing. It's just as responsive and accurate. I was expecting to need a stylus or my nails to navigate the phone but you really don't!It is, however, a bit bulky but compared to the N85, it's pretty much the same.The NokiaMaps is redunkulous, tho.I LOVE it. The last time I checked it out was when I got my N85. The Nokia maps back then required a crazy-expensive yearly rate to use the turn-by-turn and was pretty much useless bec trying to enter an adddress REQUIRED a zipcode entry before it will search for it! This new interface works much like GoogleMaps (esp with an ovi account) and much easier to use. It has all the feature you can ever want on a stand alone GPS but you get a phone along with it!I specifically bought this phone to try out the NokiaMaps turn-by-turn while I rode my motorcycle. You can't beat an accurate GPS that you can plug your headphones/ bluetooth headset on and use while riding! And if you can find a suitable handlebar holder for the phone, you can mount it and still operate the phone with your gloves on bec of the resistive screen!The speakerphone is on the weakside bec it outputs to only one speaker so that's expected. The battery does not last more than 6 hours bec the data connection is ALWAYS active (bec of the widgets and GPS). It also doesn't charge off the USB but I can use my older Nokia chargers so that's ok.I'll update the downsides of the phone as I find em but so far, the last week of usage have been problem-free.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Costa Rica, Centroam\u00e9rica", "Author": "Hans0303", "ReviewID": "R3TFOKDM15E0DK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bueno, por si alg\u00fan compatriota leyera esto, le informo que el telefono funciona a la perfecci\u00f3n con el ICE, excelente cobertura, y todas las aplicaciones estan disponibles.

I returned it the same day! It doesn't look like in pictures, the color is off white and is not shiny but very dull looking. The slider is wobbly and loose so it doesn't feel good in the hand.  I've always thought Nokia products were well made but this phone just felt cheap.  I had the Nokia C3 before and even it feels higher quality.The Symbian OS is nothing to boast about but i knew that, however the touchscreen is quite annoying because you have to double tap to select something, if you tap once a \"tip\" pops up instead.  It's okay for the price, but there are better phones that cost the same or just a little more like the Samsung Wave 533 or the LG GW620.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exelent phone with improvement opportunities", "Author": "Fernando", "ReviewID": "R8YA6QT11ZMHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works realy good, is too fast, and both the qwerty and touch screem are really good.

Minimal freezing occurs when running more than 5 applications at once. It is easy to use and attractive in terms of its design, however it is a bit on the heavy side. The default applications on the phone are useful and the ovi store phenomenon made it even better. This is so as many more applications are available both free and those at a cost. the camera functions well; sound is good; the resolution is way better than average; the material used by the manufacturer feels sturdy and durable.

It does what Nokia says and does it well. Yes the OS is a little old and slightly laggy under certain conditions but it's no deal breaker if you understand that and aren't expecting the latest and greatest. Mostly I use it for pictures, video and GPS/maps. I don't text or do the social media stuff because I have no data plan. Oh yea, I use it for telephone service also. For what I do, it excels. I especially liked that I can download and use Google Maps with it as well as a few other interesting time wasters. That said it's no Android or I Phone so don't expect it. If you want maximum apps, you're probably better off paying more and going with a newer phone OS. The only real problem I experienced was a result of buying an alleged \"used like new\" model. It wasn't. The included charger was a non Nokia that was broken and the micro sdhc card that was supposed to be included was MIA so you might want to stick with a new one.

The only drawback I have, and the reason I did not give it a 5 star rating, is that yes, the OS is a bit laggy when opening screens and you get the white screen for a second or two and I had some apps close on me without any apparent reason or any error message (specially true with the Opera Mobile app).The Nokia C6 looks and feels like a poor man's N97, or more accurately N97 mini, except it's not actually that cheap. The C6 suffers from the worst excesses of the N97's software, without the saving grace of its solid hardware, resulting in a phone that's disappointing at any price.he C6 doesn't look too bad on paper. It's got Wi-Fi and 3.2Mbps HSDPA connectivity for fast Web surfing over wireless or 3G. But Web pages don't look great on the 81mm (3.2-inch) resistive touchscreen. It isn't as bright or sharp as the competition, and we found the Web browser slow and clunky to use. There's also no multi-touch zoom, and there's no other quick method of zooming into the text on a page either. Double tapping the screen does zoom in, but it doesn't reformat the text to fit the screen, which would have been a welcome touch.If the Nokia C6 was selling for a song, we could forgive its cheap-looking case and sluggish performance. But, for a contract price that's up there with that of the HTC Desire, one of the best phones of the year, we expect much more. The touchscreen version of the C6's Symbian OS already felt dated when it came out.

I liked the white coloring. However, it wasn't even all white. There was a random baby blue stripe by the control buttons on the front. And the plastic makes the white color look cheaper than it does in the photographs. Besides those little disappointments, the main problem I had with the phone was a huge issue: When I went to type a message using the QWERTY keypad it would always freeze up the phone. The only way to get the phone working again was to take the battery out and put it back in. This wasn't a solution. Every time I went in to type a new message freezing was unavoidable. The touch screen keypad still worked and didn't freeze the phone, but really? Why would I want to keep a phone where half of it doesn't work?

Otherwise I recommend you find a different phone to purchase that actually works properly from the get go.I am returning this phone and will probably stay away from Nokia for a while, even though I have been pleased with their phones in the past.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "cesar", "ReviewID": "R1HF0DI2S44Z4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "exelente compra y me la mandaron hasta ecuador... muy buena la tienda muy seria.. el perfume muy bueno .. personas serias", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "muy bueno", "Author": "M.
