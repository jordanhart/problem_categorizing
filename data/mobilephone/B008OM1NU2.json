I love that it has an FM, it keeps me entertained while strolling my baby in the park. It does not come with a manual, but really you don't need one. Just set the language to english and from there start exploring. You will love it when you get the hang of it. I recommend it very much! I'm in love with my phone! It's like an Iphone plus FM but with a cheaper price.

Panknin", "ReviewID": "RFB7SE86V55NP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone has a great deal to recommend it, it turns on quickly, has excellent reception, and the latest Android operating system.  The things I don't like are: preloaded and irremovable apps in  Chinese (I would guess this phone was originally for the Asian market) and somewhat limited battery life when the wi-fi, bluetooth, and GPS are turned on.  I'm looking into a heavier duty battery as it spends some time on the charger every morning.  For about $150.00 you'll be getting a phone very comparable in quality and features to either the last generation I Phone or a Galaxy 3.  And, of course it's unlocked so it can be used with any GSM carrier, a big plus, at least for me.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "it's reaally slow", "Author": "Bougouma Gerald", "ReviewID": "R15YMR427KAEU7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "LG Optimus L5 is a great phone,but it's really slow.Sometime,it turned off by itself.To make a call,I have to wait like 30 second before making.it's the same when I want to hang up.and using the WIFI,it's making my phone really slow again,and I have to turn off again,and restart it before it work propertly....in somme,that phone is very slow...", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent but not for a noob", "Author": "Haral Jonas Serafini", "ReviewID": "R2DIJH82D98FL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good features.
