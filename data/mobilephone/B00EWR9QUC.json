If your looking for a cell phone to make & receive phone calls, this one is terrific. This is a CDMA phone which uses the Verizon network at a Tracfone price. I use about 1200 minutes a year which cost me a about $120.$10. a month for cell phone service. No contracts. I live in the country and the cell phone gets 4 bars from my house. Buy it, you won't regret it. Voice quality is also great.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "lg220c trac fone", "Author": "MARGE WIGHAUS", "ReviewID": "R2B1ARYXJNQ9TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this trac phone is the best value out there owned for over 7 years cost of phone and cost of use are less than most others no problems with it ever", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EWR9QUC"}}
