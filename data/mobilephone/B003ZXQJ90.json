{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lasts about 1 year if you use it a lot", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R2ZLWKLJ0FNE72", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Review:The phone is ok. It does what a phone should do and the slide out keyboard is OK. Some phones have very hard keys and some do not. The camera is only 2.1 mp so it is not good and does not have flash so the picture quality is not good. It does have a slot for a microSD card which is nice for putting ring tones and picture on the phone. Overall, I would not recommend getting the phone from Costco but it is not that bad of a phone for not being a smartphone.My experience with the phone:My family and I got ours through Costco and also had a 2 year warranty on it. However, after one year they started to have issues. My sisters would freeze and she could not answer calls while the screen was frozen. It stayed like that for around 30 seconds. So we went back to Costco and they replaced it the first time. Then, my mom's has a problem where she could not hear the other person speaking but she could talk to them. We went back to Costco and this time we had to send it back to T-mobile for $10 (shipping). Now, after the year was over, my mom's phone broke again and would not turn on, even after charging for hours. We called T-mobile and they said they do not carry this phone anymore so we would have to pay $70 for a new phone. The warranty said it would fix the phones if it had hardware issues. So why did T-mobile not fix it for that $10.So, Costco service is not so good. T-mobile customer service and warranty are not credible because they do not honor what the warranty states.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "kimbies", "ReviewID": "R12Y162NIIW2BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

Works fine. Easy to use, easy to text, and make calls. Camera is ok, not horrible but not as clear as the newer phones. Easy to use internet. I did not have any problems with the speaker phone or hearing callers. At times, i would have problems of reception due to having tmobile and being in areas without reception, but overall this is a good phone. Very durable and has a long battery life.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dropped calls every 2 minutes", "Author": "G Anjelica \"SHOES SHOES!

We are not into data or smart phones, but we text constantly.
