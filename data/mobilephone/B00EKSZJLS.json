I bought this as a cheap and cheerful second phone. However, it has turned out to be the worst cell phone that I ever purchased, going all the way back to the mid 1980's. The ear speaker is tinny and it is hard to hear what people are saying, the software is very slow and it has a habit of doing nothing and then doing a lot very quickly. The keypad was poor, but I use the swiftkey app to try deal with that. All in all, I think Samsung has made a big mistake going this poor specimen of a phone the 'Galaxy' branding. It will devalue the brand and nobody is going to trade up to another Samsung Galaxy phone, if this is their first Samsung phone. All good news for Apple then.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a joke", "Author": "Brian A Carey", "ReviewID": "RBAGU08C83971", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone  is  really full of crap do not waste your money on this piece of garbage. so very sad", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EKSZJLS"}}
