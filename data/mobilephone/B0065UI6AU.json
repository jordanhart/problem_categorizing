I  am trying to find out if the glass is gorilla glass and I still do  not know. (Does anyone know?) Setting up the apps took a lot of patience particularly Google and Nook.  Thanks to persistence from my wife we were successful.  The tablet runs fast and is easy to handlle.  The leather case I got from Amazon is nice but adds weight and is cumbersome.  I would recommend just getting a gel cover providing the glass is Gorilla glass from Corning.The Samsung is very nice and perhaps equal to Apple 2.  The size is near perfect and easier to handle than a larger tablet.  .  Now that the Samsung is running correctly, I love it.  I recommend this 8.9 to anyone that wants a tablet that is larger, runs on Android, ( better than a Kindle or Nook,) and not difficult to handle.  Hope you have a lovely wife to assist with setting up!Update:  After several days of use, I love this table even more.  I have installed several free apps and this was quite easy.  Battery life seems to be quite long.  After further research, I do not believe the glass is Gorilla from Cornng.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than any tablet on the market", "Author": "Ola Seif", "ReviewID": "R1ME1Q47D8VL6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung tab Galaxy 8.9 is the most balanced tab on the market.
