And there wasn't much visible damage. Butwhat the listing failed to tell me was that the headphone jack is faulty, and only plays music outof the left headphone, no matter what wards or headphones you use. This really sums for mebecause part of there reason I like iPhones so much is the fact that they can be used for music.honestly, this blows. You're better off just buying a new one.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "really upset about this transaction but is toi late now I guess I suck it up", "Author": "laura", "ReviewID": "RZDQMUJM924GG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "camera don't work phone is great except no c\u00e1mara now is too late so I would have too suck it up", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "very goog", "Author": "Kechunming", "ReviewID": "R1UHDAOOXHRB0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mobile phone signal is very good, and the function, used in Chinese perfect, I use China Mobile.

The SIM card was sent to the wrong address so I could not determine if that is the problem.I phone 2 days ago and was told another SIM card would arrive at my address by 3PM yesterday.I phoned today, having not received a SIM card yesterday and was told it was sent, not to my address that I gave (which is the same address to which the iPhone 5 was sent) but to a wrong address.I have had a hellish experience with verizonwireless the past 2 years, first w/Android, now with iPhone. I vowed that would not go back to verizonwireless until I found that the iPhone had a better reputation that Android.The common denominator here is verizonwireless. My hassles are related to that company's lack of support for different devices--so am I stuck with a malfunctioning phone for ANOTHER 2 years?", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0097BUP3U"}}
