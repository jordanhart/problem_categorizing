{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost perfect phone...almost", "Author": "Ali Razeghi", "ReviewID": "R18V3SA63BYOJN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello, I shared this review with the black version of this phone, but I wanted to share it with this one as well so we who bought this version can get some insight. :)I am a phone app developer and have had some 'face time' with the Nokia N97.  I'll let you know some of the more in depth details so you can decide if this is the right phone for you or not.  There are many positive features about this phone, but a few potential pitfalls for power users as well.  Average users will probably never notice any of the pitfalls, but probably will never use some of the best features of this phone either to justify the cost.This is the new Nokia flagship phone and it packs almost every feature anyone could ever want.  It has a DVD quality camcorder with sample videos found here:[...]Notice how well the mic picks up the creeks of the boats in Monte Carlo, and how rich the colors look.  That is due to the Carl Zeiss lens Nokia has put in.  The quality is also great and can be sent directly to the TV via the TV out cable, but I would recommend making a DVD from the memory card as the quality of the cable isn't as good as the DVD quality this phone provides.  Video starts up quickly, which is an improvement from the previous versions.The pictures taken by this phone are of very good quality.  Many consumers are fooled by 'megapixels' (mp).  Well folks, after 5mp or so, mp doesn't mean much.  All it does is make your picture size better, it does NOT increase the QUALITY.  I assume most of us aren't pro graphic artists that need huge pictures to zoom in on the most minute detail, and if you are, then you probably don't need this review :PThe lens and picture quality of this phone is superb, but not as good as the Samsung 8 sadly.  It is by far tho, one of the best mobile phone cameras around.  You can notice some problems in darker areas and they went with a dual LED flash instead of the Xeon gas flash.  The Xeon gas flash would have provided much better lighting in low light situations, however as a phone enthusiast I feel it's good enough.View sample images from thesymbianblog.com:[...]and[...]Judge for yourself.This phone is a TRUE smart phone OS which means you can download apps for it such as VPN software to connect to your office network and apps such as PUTTY or RDP clients to remote control real computers at the house/office.  With 3G speeds the potential is limitless.Now for the bad.  Nokia decided to use the old ARM II CPU found in the N85, 95, etc. phones but increased the clockspeed (mhz) slightly.  We were looking forward to the new TI cpu which would have provided much better speeds, at the cost of battery life.  They also stuck with 128mb ram with about 80mb available after boot up.  I don't know about you but after I load up all of my apps and get cranking, I eat that up.  I was able to notice some slow down in the pre-build when I:-opened up several websites w/ flash content-ran the music player-opened up 'widget' applications-tried basic functionalityMost users will probably never do that.  If you are a power user, then you probably already know about the Samsung Omnia HD which boasts of similer features, but also the new faster CPU and dedicated GFX chip which means you can play Ipod type 3d games with ease.  The final point is with the potentially underpowered CPU, you will not be able to play the super high resolution videos the Samsung can play.Finally this phone has the slower 3G speeds which don't reach 7mbps, will you need 7mbps?  Probably not.  I think for 99% of users, the current 3G speeds offered by this phone are fine.I tried out the phone and pre-ordered, I can't wait to get it.  I can't wait to develop some 'widget' applications for it and really see the power of this phone with the newer more stable build.Thank you for reading this, feel free to respond, yell, scream, or ask any questions!", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "If this were a real flagship, it'd sink", "Author": "John Newdick \"John Newdick\"", "ReviewID": "R2V2F6OYWFCD4H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I first learned of the n97's release, I was excited.  I had been waiting for Nokia to release another ground-breaking phone, like the n95 of years ago.  The n96 wasn't it, nor was the n85.  Then the n97 came - with a touchscreen and QWERTY keyboard to boot!  I was sold at once, but did all of my research anyway and found it to be full of innovative ideas and modern must-haves.  I bought it nearly two weeks ago at a reasonable discount from NokiasUSA after Amazon ran out of stock and jacked up the price.**If you read the specs, you will find all of the high points, but here are some more:-I found the phone to be fast and responsive when given input.  The keyboard is phenomenal - the key spacing and feel is just right and the offset space bar is not as big of a deal as it is often made out to be.  The only thing I could ask for is a little click to acknowledge the button was pushed, though if the sound is on the phone makes a small noise.  The keyboard could have been even bigger yet if they dropped the D-Pad, which I rarely find myself using as it is a touchscreen (maybe make it a secondary feature for other keys?).-The GPS unit quickly finds a satellite signal (faster than most Tom-Toms) and accurately places you on a detailed map.  The turn-by-turn voice directions work well, except they do not read the street name.  Best of all, it doesn't make you agree to do-not-drive-as-you-use-this-device waivers every time the program launches.-The call quality is excellent.-No contract and not bogged down with un-deletable carrier apps and tacky logos that remind you who bought your soul.**The bad and the ugly:-My first thought when I handled it was, \"a little chintzy, eh?\"  It does give off the impression for a little while, primarily because of the battery cover.  They used a plastic, snap-on/ pry-off cover whose snaps are easily bent out of shape, but did not break and easily bent back.  The rest of the construction, especially the hinge, seems to be very solid now that I have used it extensively.-The 5MP camera takes remarkable photos and videos, unless you want to use the flash, which is too close to the lens and whites out a third of the image.  Thinking about this more, I decided Nokia has used a very similar camera since September of 2006 when the first n95 debuted and such a quirk is unacceptable in something that has been around the technology world for so long.-The battery life is terrible.  With normal use, it will most likely get 24-30 hours.-Reception is bad.  The internal antenna does not pickup signal where my Blackberry does and my Samsung (4 years ago) before it did, to include my apartment in Boston (not exactly East Reeve, Wisconsin).-The FM transmitter is hardly worth having.  After trying numerous stations I know to be unused in my area, the reception in my newer Audi with rear-mounted antenna was terrible unless I held the phone out the sunroof.  I assume if you have a hood mounted antenna, it would be a little better (does anyone know?).-The resistive touchscreen is outdated and  somewhat unresponsive.  Resistive touchscreens are great if you wear gloves, and if they are huge, but that doesn't happen on a mobile phone.  Resistive touchscreens use a grid-like system to figure out where they've been touched, as they have invisible lines that make a grid across the screen.  When the selected area is touched, the corresponding up/down and left/right lines are pushed against sensors on the screen's edge and send the information to the processor.  Capacitive screens measure minute differences in its electric field cause by the conductive human body and are generally much more accurate.-The inertia scrolling is not as one would expect, probably because of the aforementioned screen.  It does not matter how fast the screen is flicked, the information displayed travels the same measly distance and stops rather quickly no matter what, if it works at all.  Navigating web pages is probably the only reason I would use the provided D-Pad just because the scrolling with the touchscreen is so terrible.-The accelerometer, which detects the direction the phone is tilted, is often incorrect and the phone is very slow to change the screen's display between portrait and landscape.-Oftentimes, the phone must be unlocked 2 or 3 times to get the LCD's backlight to turn on.  This may be a software or a hardware malfunction, I do not know.-The talk and end button are not raised but should be, especially because the phone does not acknowledge them having been pressed for a second after.  Plus, real buttons are always preferred.**Then there's the software:-The user interface is not so good.  Every application has an options menu, but after the application has been customized, you probably will not find much need for any of the other options except exit, which is buried at the bottom of the menu and needs to be scrolled to.The phone screen is inefficiently laid out.  On the screen there is a \"Call\" and \"End\" button, both of which are physical keys on the phone itself, as well as a \"Contacts\" button which can be found on the previous screen.  I would rather just see bigger numbers.  Also, the phone is setup to display two lines of numbers and forces a single number from the area code on on the second line when I would rather like to see bigger number buttons and ALL US numbers on a single line.-The homescreen widgets do not update as freely as one might like, the AccuWeather is rarely connected and my Hotmail account will ONLY refresh manually.  The FaceBook app is good.-The homescreen has a button on it to change the sound profile, but tapping the power button brings up the same menu - Nokia should just get rid of the redundancy and dedicate the space to, well, uhhh, anything else.-No QWERTY keyboard option on the touchscreen.-Being able to run multiple apps is great, but switching between them shouldn't mean a fight with the options menu, there should be an external button to switch between them.-The homescreen has an option to compose a new message, but not one to read old messages.  The button should be dedicated to going into the messenger application instead.-Half of the menus require a double touch while the other half require a single touch.-Plus a dozen smaller \"Oh, that's silly\" features not worth mentioning.-My phone has needed to be reset because one or more different things were not working correctly at least once a day, though it has never frozen completely.  Once, strangely, the touchscreen would highlight the selected app/item, but fail to execute the command completely.Overall, it is a good phone, but certainly not worth the money.  I recommend you wait for the first major software update to be released and reviewed before purchasing.UPDATE (4 July) - I've made updates on the n97 (Black) page.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Would not recommend", "Author": "Vitra Singh", "ReviewID": "R2MLP7E1KFG35Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have had a world of problems including roaming issues (popped my SIM into another phone and it worked so was not the provider), constant issues with the software locking up (often had to pull the battery to wake it up --- and that takes ages for it to reboot), battery life not typical of Nokia (sadly lacking), flash failed after a few months ... pictures all foggy .... major disappointment.

The backlight won't go on when i would unlock the phone. I did research and find a new firmware wich fixed the issue.Here is all the bads:-the photos made with flash look awfull.glare shows in almost every picture.-bad design for camera slider. Lots of dust gets there. Also sometimes it slides by itself in my pocket.-photo gallery is slow and still doesn't have option to upload photos to facebook. There is an app for viewing the pix wich after one year is still in beta. Can't be set as a default photo viewer.-in one year and still didn't get used to this keyboard. At the beginning of a sentence i have to press twice for a special character & number. In the middle of the sentence only once.- often i would not be able to answer a phone call. The screen is unresponsive.-The answer call and hang up '' buttons'' to close to eachother.  hard press buttons woud be better instead of touch ones. I could answer a call while driving without looking at the phone. Than slide to activate loudspeaker.-the shiny silver frame peeded off showing cheap platic.-No stopwatch and countdown.-i had like 10gb of music in it (out of 32gb max) and it takes forever to scroll thru the music files.-Nokia maps is a joke. Would never find my location where google maps find it on the spot.-bad memory management. I have to delete all the time cookies and cachee to make like 20mb space in the phone.-it takes like 5 seconds to open a simple sms.sometimes even more. -slow browser. I have opera installed so i stop usind the default one. It would be nice to be able to set the opera browser as default-ovi store is a failure. no usefull programs to be found there . I had to send the phone back for repairs last year in august. The headphone was not connected to it but showing that its connected. So the only way to hear someone on the phone was to activate the speaker or connect some headphones. They fixed it , did a factory reset and installed the latest firmware. No change on performance. I guess symbian sucks.Yes. The operating sistem is worst out there. I could go more and more but i have to go. This review was written from a HTC my touch 4G. Sorry for the typos.

There are still a few, small glitchy software issues - but otherwise functioning properly. I am not sure if it was this individual phone or if all N97s have software issues to start. However, now I am afraid to update the phone software, for fear that it will have more problems. One note: it was difficult to get in touch with support and speak to someone \"live.\" I sent the phone in on blind trust without speaking to anyone - but all's well that ends well..._____________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this phone since July 3, 2009. Since purchase I have had to deal with one issue after another, all related to the software and application interface. The hardware (physical) phone itself was great.Negatives:Too numerous to list all of them here, but essentially the software and applications are not intuitive and have MAJOR issues. I am fairly tech savvy and I cannot even imagine how someone who is less knowledgeable in this area would be able to deal with this phone. Very high maintenance.--It took me, and several tech geek friends, A LOT of time to figure out how to set up 2 email accounts.--The wireless access would not \"remember\" my wireless WEP key and typing that long# in repeatedly is not fun! It started 'saving' it on its own one day. (see reboot story below - now it doesn't save any more)--Facebook app and \"Favorites\" app won't load onto the home screen (just says \"Loading\" but never does). I tried to reinstall the Facebook app, but had to go to a 3rd party site to find it. Nokia's Ovi store no longer has a FB app available. Once an app is gone from your phone - good luck trying to reinstall it. Impossible. If you can even find the app anywhere.--Apps randomly work, then don't work. Very mysterious.Yesterday I had to do a hard reset back to the factory settings (which means I had to back up and then delete all of my data, photos, text messages, music, and loose all of my settings, including difficult-to-set-up email connection settings, etc), to try and get the non-working/disappeared apps to work. There wasn't much else I could do the software was so messed up. It was the last resort to get the phone to function properly. However, resetting it essentially \"killed\" the phone interface entirely. It is so bad that I just sent my phone to Nokia's repair site in Alabama (their \"customer care\" phone and email are essentially non-existant: phone tree loop and a \"generic\" email response is what they consider \"care.\") Now, I am waiting to see if/when they fix the phone. Here is how the phone was \"working\" after the hard reset (that was supposed to bring it back to the original factory settings):--The key pad won't function (on screen) so I can't even try another hard reset.--The phone doesn't work (can't access it).--The camera won't function.--Most of the apps are missing. Including facebook and 'favorites'.--Most of the apps that are still on the phone won't function.--The phone shuts off when connected to the computer to update software.--The phone randomly shuts on and off when you try to access an app.--The 'memory full' message keeps appearing when there is nothing on the phone and there are no apps open.Among other issues...My main concerns about having to mail my new, $700 phone to a far away repair place are:(1) now I am stuck with NO PHONE for \"7-10+ days\" and I am trying to run a small business (ironically enough it is for usability testing of products such as this - and boy does Nokia need to test their N97 interface - have they actually read the Nokia Users Discussion board?), and;(2) the \"Repair form\" instructions for returning the phone state that they will \"call me with an estimate of the cost(shouldn't it be free?!)\" or that they will \"return the phone if it is not repairable.\" That's just great.  Can you tell that I am really annoyed? The phone cost $700!!!Positives:Nice hardware. The keyboard is easy to use and read. I liked the matte feel of the keys. The screen is large and crisp in terms of readbility, and I love the fact that you can use your finger or a stylus (or finger nail - which you can't do on the iPhone) to activate the touch screen. I love the weight and solid feel of the phone. The silver buttons and edging is also a nice touch. The camera, when it worked, took nice photos that rivaled my digital cameras' pics.The white phone is pretty cool looking - too bad it doesn't work!", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia N97-As good as I expected!", "Author": "Jeremy B.

I had  an HTC Fuze(Touch Pro) and the screen on the Fuze was loose.The N97 also adjusted between landscape and portrait mode with the screen open or closed much faster than the fuze.

Only during good light it captures great photos and during low light like at the dawn or at the sunset it captures worst photos. The flash provided with camera doesn't help much. Also, most of the times the phones gets freeze while taking pics so you need to restart the phone.Third, phone is very slow. Most of the times it says memory is full close some applications. All applications are close dammit now which application should I close!!!Now the only solution is... restart the phone. >.<It has got only 128MB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory which is of no use because if 10GB or so memory is used the phone freeze out much more frequently then and you have to unwilling delete your files.Fourth, touch is not so good.At the end, there are many and much better phones available in the market for this price.

There is no excuse for a \"flagship\" phone having this many software bugs.I've since bought a droid for $100 that does exactly what this phone does, and they both have exactly 9 bloatware applications. It just doesn't add up. Unlocked phone with un-uninstallable bloatware??No amount of flashing, firmware updating, hard resetting, soft resetting has remedied the simple fact that I cant answer calls 10% of the time. This alone is enough to warrant a defective RMA, yet Nokia Customer Care makes you jump through the same 15 step process to soft reset every time you call them. Friendly, knowlegeable people on the line make excuses for a bad phone.Facebook won't use Wifi. Accuweather won't stop asking me if it CAN use Wifi. then GPS. Then the cell network. Relentless prompting. Map app works great for 12 minutes, then crashes.Entire phone turns itself off every couple days, often just a couple hours after cycling the power intentionally to try and avoid it.What breaks my heart beyond repair is that all of these issues can be resolved inside of this phone - they are all software/firmware issues, sans the poor LED flash design that washes out the left side of all my pictures. I would forgive that one thing if they would address the other issues.This is very likely my last Nokia among 5 N-series devices and 13 total phones. Sorry guys, good luck with your new CEO.

This is a exquisite piece of hardware, the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age, even compared to newer, cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel, the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value, but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double, some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone, droid or iphone 3gs, its just not in that league software wise, only price wise.

There are actually very few apps only available. Most of the Ovi stuff are wallpapers and really bad ringtones. They have to really improve that store.My conclusionN97+appstore=the perfect phone.

I am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messages*not pleasing photo gallery....the biggest problem I felt with this was just how unattractive it looks. I once had a Nokia N85 and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking. This device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if I were trying to show someone a photo*general bulkiness of the device*high price tagand finally I just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly, re-booting itself, not being able to unlock it with the lock key, etc.So, as you can see it really isn't a bad phone. It just fell way short of my expectations for a Nokia \"flagship\" phone and also as a touchscreen device. I ordered the E75 out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen. I've only had the E75 for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen, I now have a smaller, easily pocketable phone with a VERY VERY VERY nice QWERTY keyboard and a traditional keypad for T9 texting. Very happy with my new phone and kinda glad I don't have to deal with the frustration of all the N97's inconsistencies.

It was getting a little long in the tooth, so I was looking to replace it. I considered the iPhone but was convinced by someone not to get one but to stick with Nokia. So I purchased this phone. I have never been sorrier about a purchase in my life.The phone not only doesn't hold up next to the iPhone, it doesn't even do everything my old N95 did!No VIOP calls, No Slingbox player, No internet radio, ( all of which the iPhone and the N95 did )all you get is a touchscreen, but no decent software to run on it.I did however try to make the best of it. Until today when it had hung, and I had to power cycle it. Now it is just a lump of useless plastic, as it never came back from the reboot.And Nokia support requires you mail the device in for repairs ( at their discretion ), If I had an iPhone I could walk into any Apple store in the USA and get it serviced.Will I ever by a Nokia product again? Hell no. And please save yourself the aggravation and avoid this phone tool.I wish I had returned it the moment I got it, as now its 14 days too late to return it to Amazon.UPDATE 10/23/2009Well, I got it fixed, and put it up for sale on eBay.

Here I will go into more detail about certain discoveries I have made using the phone for a little while.I should probably first mention again, though, that in all honesty this not the phone for everyone.  In particular, the user interface is a bit quirky (inconsistent, and not always as responsive) - and it does take a certain amount of persistence to explore and appreciate all the features and capabilities that this phone offers.=== Hooking up to your car stereo ===Chances are that one of the first thing you will want to do is to set this phone up for handsfree use and perhaps streaming music over your car stereo.  Doing so is going to be hit or miss.First, it would not work in \"Bluetooth Audio\" mode (i.e. to stream music over the A2DP Bluetooth profile) with Pioneer DEH-P7000BT unit that I had installed in my car, and which worked perfectly (albeit after a Nokia-specific firmware update from Pioneer) with my previous two phones, the Nokia N85 and Nokia N95 -- though it worked fine as a handsfree unit in \"Bluetooth Telephone\" mode (over HSP/HFP).I went through several car receivers (both buy/return and in store) to get one that actually worked:* A Sony MEX-BT2700 (works fine, nice intuitive controls, but inferior sound and also inferior handsfree pickup),* A Clarion CZ509 (complex controls -- I had to download the user manual on my N97 right in the store in order to figure out how to pair it; would only work in \"Blueooth Audio\" mode and NO SOUND would come through in handsfree mode)* An Eclipse CD5030 (very nice unit, good sound, integrated steering wheel controls for Toyota and Honda; but same problem as the DEH-P7000BT: No A2DP/AVRCP with my phone)I skipped on Kenwood, because from prior experience using a KDC-X492 along with a KCA-BT200 adapter, there was a delay from when Bluetooth Audio were initiated from the phone until it was heard over the speakers. This may seem like a nitpick, but I also use my phone as my GPS/navigation system - and the result was that instructions like \"In 400 yards, turn left\" would become \"n left\". No dice. The Pioneer unit, at least, did not have this problem.I did finally find something that works for me: A newer Pioneer unit, the DEH-P6100BT.  From my original unit, I also knew that this one has excellent sound quality and controls (good dynamic range, good sound shaping features, etc).  The one problem I'm still having though is that each time this unit connects to my phone, it initially gives me only \"handsfree\" functionality (not stereo audio). I need to manually go into the menus EACH TIME and enable A2DP and AVRCP (that's quite cumbersome), OR start playback from my phone (in which case A2DP, but not AVRCP is enabled automatically).  In other words, getting my steering wheel controls to do what they are supposed to do - control the playback - is usually more hazzle than it's worth (except for longer trips).All this said, a Bluetooth-enabled stereo is not necessary with this phone.  If you have an auxillary input or a tape deck in your existing car stereo, you can hook up to its 3.5mm jack using a standard auxillary cable or a cassette adapter.  You should then dock your phone close to your driver's seat (I use a Bracketron Grip-IT holder until a N97-specific holder is available from ProClipUSA), since you'll be using the internal microphone when making calls.  (I actually got better sound as well as better handsfree pickup with this setup and my factory stereo compared to the Sony I mentioned above).  You will need to use the phone itself to control music playback (as opposed to the receiver or steering wheel controls) - but that's why there is a \"Music Player\" widget available for the home screen.EDIT: If you read the N97 specs carefully, you also know that it (like the N85 before it) has an FM transmitter.  I did not even bother to mention this initially, because quite frankly, I don't see the point.  It is far too weak to produce the signals required for your typical FM receiver, even as the antenna is fairly close.  All you get is static.=== Tethering (phone as modem) ===A little known fact about GSM/GPRS-enabled phones (except the iPhone) is that they can be used as a modem for your laptop or other device, e.g. while on the road.  You can connect via a USB cable (one is included in the box) or Bluetooth.  In fact, if you have a Mac from the last 3-4 years (e.g. MacBook Pro), it will automatically set up this modem connection when you pair it with your phone (There is a checkbox that says \"Access the Internet with your phone's data connection\").  For Windows, you can download modem drivers from Nokia's support site.You will need an Access Point Name (APN) from your cellular provider, as well as a dial-up number (often optional), username/password (ditto).  This information is readily available on the Internet.  It should be noted that such tethering is NOT included in the price of many data plans, unless they specifically state so (this is why it is not enabled in the iPhone as sold in the US) - and it certainly would not be wise to use this as your main internet connection.  I find it invaluable for light web and e-mail access on the occasional road trip though.=== Downloading Applications ===The N97 comes with a number of third party applications preinstalled, including JoikuSpot, which allows you to turn your phone into a WiFi access point for internet access; Adobe PDF, QuickOffice, and even an Amazon app.  But of course one of the primary joys of owning a smartphone like this one is being able to continuously explore new applications and uses.The N97 runs the \"Series 60\" User Interface, 5th edition (a.k.a. S60v5) on top of the Symbian operating system version 9.4.  S60v5 is the first version of this platform to support touch-screen input, and this is only the second phone from Nokia to do so; previous N-series devices (such as the N95, N96, N85) all ran on S60 3rd edition.This means that even though the N97 represents a new type of device for Nokia, it is mostly capable of running applications that were written years ago.  Many of these are being updated for the new touch platform, to be sure, but the main outcome of this backwards compatibility is that you will find some pretty esoteric stuff out there.  For instance, I make frequent use of Salling Clicker - an application that lets you use your phone as a remote control for your (Windows or Mac) computer (over Bluetooth or WiFi), e.g. media/music control, powerpoint presentations, etc., even though that application is not specifically written for the new platform.  I also use the PuTTY telnet/SSH client, which HAS been updated to take advantage of the new touch screen, but otherwise was developed long before the N97 (or even the iPhone).  Then there is Nokia SportsTracker - always invaluable; keep it open while you go jogging, biking, etc; you can later view your route superimposed on a map, speed plots and summary, and even what music you were playing at various times.In addition to Symbian/S60 specific applications, and like most (non-US made) phones, the N97 can run \"generic\" mobile applications written for Java (J2ME).  For instance, Opera Mini is an excellent and super-fast web browser that can run on most mobile phones (not the iPhone, Palm Pre, BlackBerry though) -- thanks to its use of proxy servers that compress the traffic sent over the air to your phone.  I myself got a kick out of a HP 45 calculator emulator I found recently, which uses the original HP45 program code and even has a picture of it. :)As you can guess, the applications that you can download for the N97 are not concentrated in one location, as they are in the iTunes App Store for the iPhone.  This is a fact that Apple exploits very well in their own marketing - and to be sure, discovering or searching for applications is unfortunately quite a bit more cumbersome for Symbian/S60 than for the iPhone.  On the positive side, that means that there is no central control (you know, where someone decides that there shalt be no third party web browsers, mail readers, or GPS/navigation apps).  In fact, it is this very open architecture that allows the \"write once, run everywhere\" paradigm of the J2ME platform, whereas Apple, RIM/BlackBerry, and Palm/Pre are only capable of running applications that are specifically written for those devices.Now, Nokia has had a \"Download!\" service for years, and have recently opened an expanded application store, the \"OVI store\".  The content is still somewhat meager in both places; moreover, as I found by trial and frustrating error, once you have purchased and downloaded an application from the OVI store, there is no way to re-install it (should you happen to uninstall it at some point).  I was attempting to get a newer version of RoadSync (a Microsoft Exchange client with very decent HTML support) working, but because it got into a state where I wanted to re-enter my Exchange Account information, I had to reinstall.  (This is also an issue in RoadSync -- there should be a way to reset the information without having to uninstall/reinstall).  However, the original installation package was never saved on my phone, and there was also no way to download it without purchasing again.  For me it was thanks, but no thanks - both to RoadSync (poor design) and OVI store (poor design).The bottom line is that if you expect to be fed with a teaspoon from a central app store, then maybe the N97 and Nokia's infrastructure is not for you.=== Cohabiting with the Mac ===The N97 comes with software for Windows, but not for the Mac.  Well - that's standard fare.  Unlike most mobile phone manufacturers, Nokia have at least developed software for the Mac. :)You will want to download two things from them for ANY of their phones: Nokia Multimedia Transfer, and an iSync plugin.Nokia Multimedia Transfer is a background application (access it via a little menu bar applet) which allows you to, well, transfer multimedia between the Mac and your phone when connected via USB (using the \"PC Suite\" mode on the phone).  It imports captured photos and movies from your phone camera into iPhoto, synchronizes selected playlists between iTunes and the phone (transcoding any movie files that are not natively supported on the phone in the process), and allows you to synchronize web bookmarks between Safari and the phone's browser.The iSync plugin WOULD let you use iSync on the Mac to synchronize contacts, calendars, and todo notes with the phone.  Unfortunately, almost a month after initial release, there is not yet any such plugin available for the N97 -- frustrating since they already have one for the N86 MP, which has not yet been released here.  In the meantime, you can at least transfer contacts from your Mac Address Book to the phone: Select all contacts (Command + A), select File -> Export -> Export vCard; transfer the resulting \"vCards.vcf\" to the phone (E:\\Other\\Contacts), then open \"Contacts\" on your phone to select \"Options -> Copy business card -> From other memory\".How to do the latter, you ask.  Well, once you have paired your Mac with the phone, you can browse the phone filesystem from your Mac by clicking on the little \"B>\" (Bluetooth) icon in your menu bar, then selecting the phone, and then \"Browse device...\".  You can also simply send files from here, or from right-clicking on the file itself and selecting: More -> Send <filename> to ...Finally, as mentioned above, you can use your phone as a modem by simply pairing it over Bluetooth.  Or, you can plug in the USB cable, then open the \"Network\" System Preferences pane.=== The Copy/Paste snafu ===Unlike previous S60 phones, there are no keypad shortcuts available for Copy/Paste on the N97.  Instead, you need to access these functions in the menus (\"Options -> Editing Options\" in most places).  The problem is that not every input field has such a menu available!  For instance, if you are entering settings for a new e-mail account, or the WEP/WPA/WPA2 key for a wireless access point, you are working inside a pop-up dialogue box with no menu available.Ridiculous as this sounds, in these places you actually need to CLOSE the keypad, then tap on the input field in order to bring up the virtual numeric keypad, as if you were using multi-tap or T9. On the top of this screen there is a context menu -- if you first drag to select the text you want to cut/copy, then those two options are available in that menu; if there is text in the clipboard, \"Paste\" is available.Or, you could use a Bluetooth keyboard -- more on that below.  In this case, Ctrl-C/X/V works as expected.=== Laptop/Netbook Replacement ===You laugh.  Go ahead.If you are an owner of any other recent N-series device (N95, N96, N85), you already know that it can hook up to a TV using the included TV-Out cable, CA-75U.  Well, the N97 does not come with such a cable, but you can order one separately and it still works.Also, while the N95/N96 come with a \"Wireless Keyboard\" utility pre-installed, it is not included in the N97.  You can download and install it from Nokia's web site though; go to the support pages for their own SU-8W keyboard.  It will complain that the application is not compatible with this phone, but it will work anyway.So, there you have it.  QuickOffice is already pre-installed to allow you to view Microsoft Office documents - you can purchase an upgrade that allows you to edit these documents too.  Adobe Reader LE is also installed (though note that unlike on previous phones, it is now only a trial - you have to buy it after 2 weeks or so..).Personally, I access remote UNIX hosts over SSH using PuTTY.  Obviously you can also do web browsing, mail reading (incl. Microsoft Exchange), etc.=== Reaching Nerdvana ===Just to be exceptionally clear on this point if you haven't figured it out yet - this is a phone for geeks.  People who follow Boy Genius Reports, for instance, best stick to their iPhone and the eye candy that is afforded them there.  It takes a little bit more persistence to appreciate S60 devices like the N97 - but in return, it will grow on you for a very long time as you keep finding new features and new ways to use it.  For starters, the sheer wealth of hardware that exists on this device (5MP camera with flash and video recording, GPS, 640x360 pixel screen, pull-out keyboard, a hundred different types of sensors including electronic compass, accelerator and proximity sensor) are just ripe for new sorts of applications.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "AVERAGE", "Author": "Ayoola Babatunde Oke", "ReviewID": "R15SH9QT5JX1SF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I found the product interesting because it promised 32 Gigabyte of memory.

The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are ok, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well.

Here are some of the issues I facea) The phone Freezes often requiring the battery to be removed to reset. This for me is a non starter as the widgets and software on the phone should not impede the phones basic functionality but rather enhance it.b) Applications are just not as numerous and ones that exist (Except Bloomberg) are of inferior quality vs similar iPhone/iTouch apps.c) GPS functionality is poor an took a number of software updates to get it to even workd) Phone seems to strangely run out of memory even though a lot is available, it does not seem to be able to load balance memory between partitions.e) Lastly, poor battery life. I cannot squeeze out a full day on while in a 3G networkAll in all it is a poor imitation of the iPhone and if one wants a device that just works and does not have to wait while nokia gets its act together get an iPhone or an Palm Pre.

This phone is so easily accessible and everything is where it should be. My only knocks on it is the GPS Signal is not very strong. I will have wide open blue skies and still cant get a GPS signal. Also I wish it was compatible with the Internet Radio that Nokia offers. I am sure it is only a matter of time. Some great things about this phone is the Video Ringtones the OVI Store, OVI Contacts, and I especially like the 32GB Internal Memory. It can be an MP3 Player and with the FM Transmitter good bye to CDs and I dont even use my iPod anymore. I also love the fact that the homescreen apps are up to date. I have Facebook, Weather, and a Video Game App that always let me know whats going on.  The camera is amazing and has a great flash. I went to Vegas and took my digital camera and ended up not using it. I just used my N97. The battery life is great too. I had the fm transmitter on all day, along with normal phone calls, browsing the internet and excessive text messaging I still had 4 bars before I went to bed. I would recommend this phone to all.

Es mi primer Nokia y al principio fue un poco frustrante por que no sab\u00eda donde buscar las aplicaciones, yo estaba acostumbrado a los celulares Sony Ericksson y me sent\u00eda muy c\u00f3modo con ellos pero por las caracter\u00edsticas que presentaba el N97 su gran cantidad de memoria ser de tecnolog\u00eda 3G, los buenos comentarios que hab\u00eda escuchado y por precio decid\u00ed comprarlo en lugar de un Sony Ericksson.Como mencion\u00e9 al principio me frustr\u00e9 pero era mas por desconocimiento que otra cosa por ejemplo le instal\u00e9 el navegador Opra mini ya que el navegador que el trae no me gustaba pero cuando me conectaba a Internet lo hac\u00eda atravez del navegador predeterminado y yo no sab\u00eda que ten\u00eda que entrar a aplicaciones y de ah\u00ed accesar a Opra. Pero poco a poco fui encontrandole las aplicaciones y debo decir que ahora estoy muy contento.Las cosas buenas de este celular:1) Esteticamente es muy lindo, la resoluci\u00f3n de la pantalla hace que las im\u00e1genes se vean muy n\u00edtidas.2)La c\u00e1mara y el video no tienen nada que envidiarle a un artefacto dedicado es decir a una c\u00e1mara digital o a una videocamara, las fotos son muy bien logradas y el flash realmente funciona en lugares oscuras se pueden apreciar perfectamente los detalles.3) La conexi\u00f3n a Internet es muy buena, gracias al zoom puedes agrandar o disminuir la im\u00e1genes las cuales se aprecian muy bien, logicamente hay p\u00e1ginas que por ser tan grandes no se observaran como en la computadora, pero en realidad la navegaci\u00f3n es placentera siempre y cuando no tengas que estar digitando algo.4) Conectarte a las redes sociales o a tu correo electr\u00f3nico esta a un click de distancia y como dige antes en segundos y puedes leer archivos en formato de word excel o PDF. Es decir si no estas cerca a de una computadora no hay ning\u00fan problema te sacar\u00e1 del apuro, aunque repito la experiencia aun no es como con la computadora pero ese es un problema en todos los tel\u00e9fono inteligentes. Yo reviso mis estados de cuenta, puedo hacer una compra en Amazon pagar recibos entrar al banco hacer transacciones, etc, etc.5) El tel\u00e9fono es robusto se ve fuerte aunque aun no se ha llevado ning\u00fan golpe6) Tiene todas las funciones de los tel\u00e9fonos convencionales pero a diferencia de otros estas realmente cumplen por ejemplo si tienes una grabadora tu esperas que cuando des click esta realmente grabe y esta lo hace, yo he tenido telefonos que cuando quise usar la grabadora esta simplemente no funcion\u00f3. Puedes vivar con ello pero da c\u00f3lera que una aplicaci\u00f3n no funcione como debiera.Pero bueno no todo es perfecto y lo que no me gust\u00f3 es lo inc\u00f3modo que resulta a veces el teclado qwerty a veces cuando estoy navegando si por alguna raz\u00f3n tengo que digitar algo puedo desplegar texto en pantalla pero en otras ocasiones esta caracter\u00edstica no esta disponible y me obliga a usar el teclado y no se si es la falta de costumbre pero soy mucho mas diestro con las teclas de un tel\u00e9fono que con este tipo de teclado y me demoro mucho por lo que me resulta engorroso. Pero bueno no se talvez dentro de unos meses ya me halla acostumbrado.Pero por lo dem\u00e1s creo que son mucho mas las satisfacciones imaginense pueden utilizar este tel\u00e9fono como un GPS yo en la particular no lo uso por que ya tengo un Garmin que es una belleza y al cual ya estoy super acostumbrado pero bueno esta es una aplicaci\u00f3n que bien vale la pena utilizar si esta disponible. En sintes\u00eds le digo comprelo no se va a arrepentir, a y se me olvidaba la pantalla t\u00e1ctil funciona a las mil maravillas esta era una de mis principales dudas, pero me di cuenta que si funciona y excelentemente bien, el secreto es calibrarla la pantalla a tu gusto, si gustas de apretar mucho el l\u00e1piz pues as\u00ed la calibras a mi me gustan los trazos suaves y as\u00ed la calibr\u00e9 y apenas dejo caer el l\u00e1piz y la funci\u00f3n se aplica. As\u00ed es que es una buena inversi\u00f3n la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la que no le d\u00ed cinco estrellas fue por la raz\u00f3n del teclado por lo dem\u00e1s no hay quejas.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not an N95 Replacement", "Author": "Alx", "ReviewID": "R2M8ZWNF98U81X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I already own the N95 and purchased the N97 as a touch screen, qwerty keyboard replacement. It falls short. The manual keyboard is great but not available in all situations. The touch interface requires more touching than I thought necessary. Accessibility to programs and applications is not as smooth as with the N95. The GPS mimics the N95 but constantly resets the phone after 5-9 minutes of use. The address data does not transfer from the address book to the GPS address search completely (State and Country do not always transfer), which is a carry over problem from the N95. Night mode for the GPS is about 5 screen touches further than it should be, and it is needed because the screen is so bright at night that my eyes had to adjust when looking to the road from the screen. The lock switch does not always unlock the phone, and almost everytime I take the phone out of the universal pouch I purchased (a custom pouch is not available), the secondary camera is activated. After I installed the 7/1/09 firmware update, the thumbnails for the favorite contacts didn't show. All in all, I've been trying to return the phone back to Nokia for 2 weeks.

This phone is nothing more than a N95 with a touch screen and poor integration.  There are many bugs in the code right now.It has a chance to become a great phone, but wait till the first software update to see how much time & effort Nokia is going to put into it, right now you are best to hold off.UPDATE: I returned the phone back to Nokia, Too many software inconsistencies, some screens you double touch (click) others you only touch once. Some screens you have to use a scroll bar, others you just drag your finger to scroll down. I don't want to have to learn which screen do what and change my habits depending on the application/menu I'm on. Nokia should have taken the time to make all their apps and menus work the same. I would understand that 3rd party applications might be different but not the installed applications on the phone.This phone really needs to be in your hands for a day or two to figure out the frustrations with it. Don't get me started on the poor use of memory and how if you are not a Nokia user from a long time ago, you install your apps on the default drive only to figured out the default drive is not where all the memory is. Or if you get tons of text messages it fills up the C: drive and you-the owner- have to change system settings to tell TXT MSG'ing to not use the default drive.Search the web for N97 to read and see the YouTube videos of why not to buy this dumb phone - um I mean smart phone.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
