Much better battery life than my previous phone (HTC Rezound).  Gorgeous display with amazing PPI number, the Rezound was no slouch in this department, mind you, but this is off the charts. - iPhone what?  Blindingly fast.  I never had a Samsung with the TouchWiz interface, and I have heard that it has been maligned in the past, but I find nothing wrong with it.  And I like that I can scale fonts, so I don't need my reading glasses all the time.  Fine camera, microSD slot, getting data and voice reception on par with my previous phone both where I live and work. And best of all, no third degree burns so far!  Knock on lithium!", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Phone!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R71LTGI2R3ZCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Of course today\u2019s smartphones are much more than just a phone and the Galaxy S4 is about the best there is as of today. If you are one of those people who are always waiting for the \u2018best\u2019 of something before buying don\u2019t wait, as of now the S4 is it. I upgraded from a Samsung Charge which was at or near the top phone just over 2 years ago and this phone makes it look like a brick. Instant response, large crisp colorful screen, lots of memory and so many options for this hand held computer/multimedia device/personal assistant/phone. For those who use the built in GPS, the antenna is much improved over what I was used to. I have used this phone with the Endomondo sport tracker app during my runs and the GPS locks onto my location fast and tracks great with no dropouts.If you just want a phone get a flip phone, if you want truly mobile computing the Galaxy S4 is perfect.Also, the battery on this phone lasts me all day, a huge upgrade from my Samsung Charge.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone... switched to Android after 4 iphones", "Author": "Vego", "ReviewID": "R1IX2C1BQALHLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 3 weeks playing with my new phone and coming from a long line of iphones (the latest being the iphone 4s), I've been left with a couple of thoughts. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great phone. Compared to the iphones whether they are older or newer, the hardware on the Samsung is better. Way better battery life (easily a day and a half if you turn off the hand gestures and voice control), much better screen size, resolution, and color saturation, much cheaper storage options ($50 for an additional 64GB chip) and excellent keyboard options that really outshine the iOS devices. That being said, iOS has slightly superior software that is overall a bit more polished than Android options. To give you an idea, it took me about 2 weeks of tinkering with all the various options and settings to get my Galaxy S4 organized exactly the way I wanted. Whereas Apple gives you what they think is the most likely to be used set up, Android is a completely open book that welcomes lots of customization if you are willing to invest a week or two of tinkering into it.So far an excellent experience, just required a small investment in time to get it there...", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "This item is $80.00 cheaper through Verizon", "Author": "David W.

My wife has the S Note and that was just a bit too big for me.  I had the CHARGE.  This is right in between and I LOVE IT.  Good controls, easy to use, fast and furious.

I did have a problem with it not holding a charge, however. The wall adapter wouldn't charge it, so when I plugged it into my laptop's USB it showed it was charging, but the battery never filled up at all... Luckily the folks here at Amazon apologized and are replacing it. I know several people with this phone who have never had a problem with it. I'd recommend it to anyone, even first time Android users.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it! Love it!", "Author": "Heidi Griffin", "ReviewID": "R15LWUFBLRA8MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for two months now and absolutely love it!  Had a bit of a learning curve, still learning in fact, but it is still very user-friendly.  There is just so much this phone can do.  I even downloaded a book of tricks and tips to my Kindle.  The down side is that I bought a Verizon phone instead of an unlocked one because I read that all features might not work if I got the unlocked phone.  Turns out, Verizon disables several really neat features of this phone and I have had to hunt to find work-arounds.  Overall a great phone and worth the $$!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "My First Smartphone", "Author": "Ed Brink", "ReviewID": "RF374Y0WDYYJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Meets or exceeds all my expectations except possibly battery life. Easy to use, but an awful lot to learn. Not sure whether my somewhat short battery life is the battery (a friend with the same phone gets better life) or whether I'm running too much in the background. Haven't yet (in nearly two months) found anything it won't do, and do well, and I've tried a lot of things. The screen is on the large side; for me, it's big enough but not too big.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Starbright 4", "Author": "KRH", "ReviewID": "R2QDCBWBZLWI3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered for myself to replace my aging Thunderbolt... My wife has an S3 and loves it.  This is a great phone and I love the screen size.  Was worried if maybe too big but is perfect for me.  I got a good protective cover and that makes it easy to hold as these cases can be slippery.  The phones are very durable.  Kept hearing how plastic they were but my car is plastic too.. oh and everything else as well.  This is a well made and reliable device that has great features.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT CELL PHONE", "Author": "Sad", "ReviewID": "RC4SN3FYOQPOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "CHECK THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO FOR A BETTER REVIEW GALAXY S4 CHECK VIDEOhttp://youtu.be/fGqeZxOqKhgCHECK THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO FOR A BETTER REVIEW GALAXY S4 CHECK VIDEOhttp://youtu.be/fGqeZxOqKhg", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DTVA7U0"}}
