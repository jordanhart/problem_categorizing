My old touchscreen phonewhen I brought it to my ear would hangup, call someone else.... it was very annoying.  Now I can lock/unlock the screen easily.

I got one for Christmas in 8th grade from the at+t store. I really liked it [before I lost it]. Pantech makes really good phones in general. I would recommend them over Samsung. The sliders work good [don't break easily]. Just like any phone, if you take good care if this phone it will last you a long time! I probalby wouldn't have gotten an upgrade to a touchscreen if I wouldn't have lost it. It's a great phone!:+)", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Lorajean101 \"LJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1RU5NSX52K7X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Pantech Matrix is a pretty nice phone for the price. I do not like that it is sold as unlocked, which it was, but all the settings are for AT&T; and cannot be used at all with any other carrier. It even has 10 AT&T; numbers programmed in the contacts that cannot be deleted! It's very basic. If you have a phone service carrier other than AT&T; you can pretty much use talk and text, nothing else will work with it. I bought this as a \"back up\" phone while my blackberry is being fixed so it serves its purpose. I would not recommend it unless you are an AT&T; customer though.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid and functional", "Author": "Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo", "ReviewID": "R2B85IX4BD5ZQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is not big on the smartphone thing, but she wanted a phone to talk and text on. Basically, she wanted a keyboard on a phone that didn't need a data plan or anything like that. She wanted to be able to take her SIM card out of her old, crappy T-Mobile phone and plug it into a new phone. Well, this phone worked just fine for that! I was a little disappointed that we can't use mp3 files as ringtones (as I can on my Samsung Gravity III), but that's more of a patent issue than it is a design problem.This phone is a little thicker than I'm used to, but it has to be to accommodate the dual-direction sliding operation.  That is, you slide it one way and it's for talking, slide it the other way and it's for texting. It's actually kinda nice, though, to have a phone that fits your hand.I don't know about the other functionality stuff on the phone -- stuff like games and apps and that sort of thing -- because we don't use that stuff.  I know that for texting and talking, it works great. We were able to take a SIM card out of one phone, plug it into this phone, and it worked right away. That's what we wanted, and that's what we got. So we're super satisfied.  Oh, one gripe is that it doesn't use the universal charging port, but that's probably because it's kind of old?  I don't know.  Still, a solid purchase for people who want to be smarter than their phones.  :)", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Misty B.", "ReviewID": "RGZNW6BB7ZGOZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really disappointed in this phone.  It is really bulky, plus when I bought it, there is a little green dot in the screen that stays lit all the time.  Also, my contacts kept erasing out of my phone every time the phone would die or was turned off.  Not happy at all.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "AT & T only..!!", "Author": "Shane Hiscott", "ReviewID": "RP2RNFM1KH5U0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer beware, this phone may be unlocked, I can't tell because I'm a T-Mobile customer. With my SIM inserted, this phone doesn't even set the time or date. The box is emblazoned with the AT & T logo so this should of been a clue but I tried anyway.
