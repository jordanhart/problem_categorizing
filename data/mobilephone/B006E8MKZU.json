{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some extra details", "Author": "Michael J. Cashen", "ReviewID": "R3C4QM4UUIPXQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent step-up from the flip-phones that those of us who rarely use a cell phone were stuck with if we wanted to pay low amounts for a cell phone and usage. There's also a similar Motorola model at Tracfone but it doesn't list under my zip code so I haven't compared the two phones.I'll upgrade this report after I've become familiar with all the bells and whistles: for example, the specs call for a max. 8 GB micro SDHC card but supposedly the software will only handle 4 GB. The software has been upgraded (see \"1\" below) and I'm going to test the limits. Meanwhile, here are five key things you may not know about:1) Software Version:When you get your phone, make sure you have the improved software version (V10e as of this writing) and not the older, buggy one (V10d) that might be sitting on a seller's shelf for some months:A) From the main screen press the square with 4 dots at the lower right.B) On the next screen, press the \"Settings\" icon in the lower right.C) On the next screen, press \"Phone\".D) On the next screen, scroll down with your finger on the red bar to the very bottom, then press \"Information\".E) On the next screen, press \"Device Information\".F) At the very bottom, under \"S/W Version\" it should say \"V10e\" (or later). It must NOT say \"V10d\" - V10d is the buggy version.2) Screen Size: The 2.8\" (diagonally measured) screen on the LG-800G is 2 5/16\" vertically and 1 3/4\" horizontally, held in the standard \"portrait\" position. For comparison, the view screen on my 2\"x2\"x4\" camcorder is a typical 2 1/8\" x 1 1/2\", only 79% as much screen as the LG-800G.3) Needed accessories not included with the phone or Tracfone's Universal Accessories Kit:A) Micro SDHC card to provide extra memory: the specs say 8 GB max, users say 4 GB max: I'll update this after some testing with the latest software version (V10e). It's needed if you want to store a lot of apps, vids of your kids playing music, soccer, presenting their science project, etc. A 4 GB card is only $4+ with free shipping on Amazon as I write this. The \"internal memory\" built into the phone is 20.4 MB (0.0204 GB) of which 18.8 MB is free when the phone arrives. That is fine for some pics, messages, a couple of apps, etc. - but not a lot more.B) Cable for phone to computer USB connection ($2.34 with free shipping on Amazon as I write this): Since you can treat the phone's memory like a hard drive from the computer, you can use the internet service on a computer to download apps, etc. instead of using up cell phone minutes. You can also transfer photos, videos, etc. to and from the computer.C) many recommend a screen protector: a thin transparent film that statically sticks to the screen. They're anywhere from $1-$6.4) Comparison Shopping:If you buy directly from Tracfone and pay the full price, you get an additional \"Universal Accessory Kit.\" But there's not a lot of info as to what it contains so here it is:It contains a car cigarette-lighter-receptacle charger (the AC charger comes with the phone itself), an earbud with mike for hands free use and adapters for any LG phone, and a clunky, cheap, but shirt pocket wearable pouch with a permanent belt loop attached to it -but whose weak closing strength I'd never trust on a belt loop: it does offer good protection of the display screen, though, in case something would rub against it or it fell our of a shirt pocket.5) For Existing Tracfone Customers Transferring Phone No. & Minutes:A) When you transfer phone number and minutes: your expiration date is transferred and 60 days added to it and your all your minutes, no matter if they come from the most recent minutes you bought or from rollovers, are transferred and 10 minutes added to them.B) It may take an hour or more for the transfers to take place, so don't activate/deactivate the phones if you'll need your cell phone in the following couple of hours. They have a temporary number assignment workaround if you have to do it that way, but there's a charge.  All that said, it only took about 10 minutes or so for my new phone to become activated after the old one was deactivated.C) For those Tracfone customers who upgraded and say they didn't get their minutes transferred:That INITIALLY happened to me: the phone number was transferred but not the minutes. A call to Tracfone several hours later required about 10 minutes time for them to verify I had had minutes left on my old (now inactive) Tracfone and transfer them. An excellent sales rep who corrected the problem for me said their system is buggy and sometimes cuts off the minutes when the phone number is transferred.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Man's Touch Screen Phone", "Author": "Majermom", "ReviewID": "R2NUDMH4R5QJ5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have owned Tracfone's for 8 years. He's not a big cell phone guy therefore I haven't been able to talk him into phones like and Antroid Touch or an iphone, which I'd love. So I have to settle for what Tracfone has to offer. After losing my newest phone (LG 500g) I deceided to go with what I really wanted and that was a touch screen phone. This model has not disappointed me. I call it the \"poor mans touch screen phone\" because the size obviously doesn't compare to iphones or Androids but if your looking for a phone like that with extras such as web browsing, games (with game download capability), camera, video, and a few other things like an alarm setting ect. then this just might fill that need. The thing I like about it compared to a phone like the LG 500g is that it's a full screen and not a keyboard taking up half the available screen space. I downloaded the Facebook app and it's actually worth using the web browser to check Facebook & email. Texting it easy. Not any more difficult then trying to hit the right keys on the small LG 500g keyboard. I'm finding the screen very responsive to touch as well. I ordered a memory card as well because I needed to get some video of my son's piano sent to me from an iphone but my LG5 500g said there wasn't enough room to receive them AFTER it deducted my units for them:( Had problems with accidently hitting the browser button with my LG 500g and I lost a lot of units that way. Shouldn't be a problem with this phone. That was the deciding factor when choosing between this phone and the Samsung 404g. I hope this review helps. I would also recommend a phone cover because these phones are quite slippery, which is how I lost my last phone.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best prepaid phone I've used", "Author": "simple.is.best", "ReviewID": "R3NN88QRUS2TU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the last year I've been cell-less, one because I could no longer justify a $30/month bill for something I used maybe 30-40 minutes a month on, and two when I did purchase a prepaid phone it felt cheap and the sound quality wasn't that good. This is the prepaid phone of my dreams. I love the touch screen display, it's big enough for me to see what I'm doing and it looks and works like every other contract feature phone I've used. The sound quality is great it reminds me of a land line, no one can even tell I'm using a cellphone it's so clear.I've never used a tracfone before but I'm overly impressed. This phone gives you triple minutes for life and if you're a person who doesn't talk much a 400 minute card tripled to 1200 minutes can last you a year for $100. I love I can use those minutes how ever I want whether on texting, internet browsing or calls. I forgot to mention that the same 400 minute card gives you 2400 minutes of web browsing or a whopping 3600 text, I was even able to use the phone to text my votes on american idol last week. It charges .30 minute to send and .30 minute to receive a confirmation of your vote. That's still less than calling and wasting a whole minute.I live in an area that's prone to rolling blackouts during the summertime and now I'll be able to browse the web to find where the nearest cool zone will be without spending a arm & leg in data charges. That's something I can't do once the electricity is out and my wifi no longer works, plus this phone doubles as a well organized mp3 player. I'm set. I purchased this phone from HSN with 1500 minutes, a case and car charger for $100. Every now and then you can catch it as a TSV for that price. I also purchased a screen protector and 4 gb micro sdhc card to go with it. I literally feel like I won some kind of jackpot with this phone.BTW this phone does not have a flashing light to tell you when you have missed a message. I just realized if you go into settings, then profiles, and select normal, outdoor, silent, etc, there is a secret menu where you can set a audible message reminder of once, or every 1-10 minutes.

Transferring my number and minutes over to the new phone was easy with Tracfone's customer service.As for transferring music onto your Tracfone, just be sure you connect to \"Mass Storage\" so the device icon shows up in \"My Computer\". Then it's a snap to cut and paste or copy/paste from one drive to another.If you are new to the LG800g, Google tutorials for an impressive list of tasks.

The audio is clear, it is easy to use for sending a text message (unlike a neighbors phone that is difficult for sending texts) and the LG800G has worked in a couple of places I didn't think my Apple iPhone had \"bars\" in.The LG 800G easily fits in my shirt pocket and is unobtrusive. The touch-screen requires just a tad more pressure than my iPhone, but I learned quickly to hold it better and be a little more forceful when pressing icons and the QWERTY screen.It blows me away how long the battery holds a charge.

There was a small tussle over \"air time PIN\" for which I had to call tracfone tech support, but buying time from the tracfone web site solved that.Several people have complained about the nearly instant phone lock out time. It can be changed, but the way of doing it is not in the manual, as one person wrote. However - a web search showed me the way. On the phone's main screen, tap the \"dice key\" at lower right, then on the next screen up, tap the \"Settings\" key at lower right. From there, tap \"Phone\", and then \"Auto-lock\". In Auto Lock, choose the setting you can live with. I set mine to \"Never\" for the time being, but there's a danger of the phone \"pocket dialing\" (dialing a phone number because of pressure on it while it's in your pocket or its case) so you may want to choose 10, 20, 30, or 60 seconds.This leads to the second thing I want to say here - almost any question you might have about the phone can be answered by a Google search - so use that liberally, if you need to. There are also quite a few very good tutorials on the phone, at [...]The final thing I want to say is that this phone seems to share the same network of cell towers with the very expensive Verizon \"smart phone\" I'm escaping from. So for about $8-10 per month, I'll get most of the features of the $80 monthly Verizon deal. For a home user who doesn't download movies or play games on the phone, that's an excellent deal.ADDED AFTER TWO WEEKS of owning and using the phone - still 5 stars, maybe more. The phone is much more versatile and useable than I expected. Most of the things which have bothered other reviewers are just matters of getting used to the interface. Texting, voice messaging, and of course phone calls are all simple and quick. Browsing is fast enough for casual use and the cost, in terms of \"minutes\", is very reasonable. I can view and use my Google calendar, so the Calendar is sybched across all my computers and other devices. I haven't yet figured out how to view my Google contacts, but I think that's possible.

Manual that comes with the phone could use more detail on some of the features in the phone but, I really like the LG800g, it has alot more features than I had with the flip phone I was using.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R23K7JL5CQPYYU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the LG 800G to replace an LG 420G that was a backup for my LG 500G. I ordered it from Amazon and the triple minutes for life was the main factor in deciding to get this phone.I used the Tracfone website to transfer the LG 420G phone number, minutes, and days to the LG 800G.  Everything went smoothly and my new phone was up and running in less than an hour after I started the process. I then put in a 200 minute card and it gave me 600 more minutes right away. With tax, the 200 minute card cost $43.18, making the actual cost a little over 7 cents per minute.The LG 800G is smaller than the LG 500G, but the screen is larger.  The 800G virtual QWERTY keypad only works with texting and you have to switch back and forth between kepypads if you want to enter numbers or symbols. The 500G actual keypad is more convenient to use, especially for entering contacts and putting numbers and symbols into texts.When making a call, the 800G keypad locks after three seconds, making it very inconvenient to switch to the speaker phone or enter other data. The 500G is much better while actually on the phone with a call. With the 500G, you have to push and hold the lock button to lock it, while the 800G does it automatically.The 800G has a screen that can be seen outside in bright light, while the 500G is almost impossible to see outside. The 800G touchscreen works just fine for me, although it takes some getting used to.The Internet and camera features are equal on both phones. I don't use any of the apps so I can't comment on those features.The 500G and 800G use the same charger and the same LGIP-430N battery and that is very helpful when you own both phones.As far as the basic features and the convenience of use, I think the 500G is just a little better phone.  However, the triple minutes feature of the 800G is quite superior to the double minutes of the 500G.  If you use up a lot of minutes every day, then the triple minutes of the 800G make it the phone for you.  But, if you only use a phone for basic talking and texting a few minutes a day, then the 500G is the better buy. I really don't think you can go wrong with either one.  They are both excellent phones for the money.Right now, I will continue to use the 500G as my main carry phone and use the 800G as the backup, but I think I could be comfortable using either one on a regular basis.Update (5/30/2014) I am still using my Lg800G as my main carry phone.  I have found a way to listen to your voicemail messages without using any minutes, if you have a land line.  Just call your LG800G from your home phone.  When the voicemail message starts, press * and it will ask for your voicemail password. Enter that and you can listen to and delete your messages without using a minute of your time.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Phone you can Get for the Money", "Author": "stencil", "ReviewID": "R3SZSS2EJPXPF6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really nice phone, plain and simple; IMO, best you can get for the money without a contract. For starters, the screen is excellent. Deep, rich colors, good viewing angle. Hard to believe you can get a screen this good on such a low cost device. As a touch-screen phone, the dialer is responsive and the call quality is clear as a bell (in my area, anyway). For messaging, you get a very nice landscape mode qwerty virtual keyboard. Tracfone is pretty generous with their messaging allowance: 3 texts = 1 minute deduction. The mp3 player is also very good; I don't have one, so the ability to do double-duty was important to me. It has all the features you'd expect (sort music by artist, album, track, genre, playlists, album art, etc). You need a micro-SD card to load music, as well as a microUSB cable. Before you buy a new cable, try the ones you have. I was able use my Kindle cable, no problem. The phone includes a standard 3.5mm jack (nice), so you can use any earphones you want, from el cheapo to high-end. Using some pretty good-quality headphones, I did detect some background hiss when starting/stopping my mp3's, so if you listen to soft music, or classical, for example, you should keep that in mind. Also, be sure to create a \"My Music\" folder on the micro-SD and place all your music files there; that's where the MP3 player initially looks for your music. The phone does support \"apps\", albeit not Apple or Android apps, but rather Java apps. Just search Google; there's plenty out there, just no central \"app store\". The best way to load apps is with the data cable; download to your computer first, upload to the \"Other Files\" folder on the micro-SD (that location is important), then just browse to the folder on the phone and select the java \".jar\" file. The app will install automatically, after which you can access it from the built-in \"Games & Apps\" tool. About web-browsing: let me say from the outset that I wouldn't try to use this phone for heavy web browsing--frankly, at 2.5G (\"Edge\") it's just too slow and the screen is a little too small. But if you get the right browser, it's perfectly competent for light Internet access; I suggest Opera-Mini, which is pretty fast and includes its own virtual keyboard (the built-in browser only offers the T9 keypad; it's basically worthless). Tracfone is a little less generous for web access: 2 minutes of browsing = 1 minute deduction. You can certainly check the headlines, the weather, etc, and get off quickly without using an inordinate amount of your minutes. But I'm at a loss to understand why this phone isn't 3G, which would make browsing--even on the small screen--a whole lot more practical. I upgraded from a 2-year old samsung tracfone (just a basic flip phone) and even it was 3G! Go figure. I won't go into basic operations of the phone or built-in tools; other reviews cover that territory pretty well. I guess my only complaint is that you only get one home page for apps; the second home page is reserved for contacts, which I don't find all that useful. One more thing, the touch-screen is not capacitive like the iPhone, it's resistive, so you need to press it a little to make selections or scroll. It's quite responsive, but does take some getting used to. For scrolling, here's a tip: use your finger nail, not your finger tip. That way, you won't accidently select something. Oh, another tip, the default theme is \"cartoon\"; for a more grown-up look, select the \"black\" theme, which kind of looks like an iPhone.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a great phone", "Author": "Bpollen \"bpollen\"", "ReviewID": "R1VNVFV69WNYY7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you'll notice, most of the reviews talk about the keyboard, the texting, the internet, the features, the looks-like-a-smart-phone, etc. But few reviewers actually mention the main reason for this item's existence: how is it as a PHONE? I need a phone. I had an old flip Motorola. Unfortunately, Tracfone doesn't offer Motorolas anymore in my area, so I went with this, after reading the good reviews. Reviewers were right about one thing: it's spiffy looking, has lots of features and settings. But it is lousy as a phone. The voices are garbled or cut out horribly, whether incoming, outgoing, or even the voicemail automated message. Reception is bad. And despite being set to NEVER lock, it locks even while I'm listening to a voicemail, so I can't hit \"7\" to delete....I have to first unlock for a couple of seconds, then try to hit \"7\" before the automated voicemail instructional message ends. Or I have to start over.The volume is also disappointingly low (the ringer). You don't want to set it loud all the time, but sometimes there's a need for that.I left a message on my home voicemail system from this new phone. When I listened to it, the volume of my voice was somewhat low (my voice is anything but low), and the words weren't clear.This phone doesn't hold a candle to my old Motorola flip phone. So I'm going to ask Tracfone to transfer my time back to my old Motorola, and return this phone.UPDATE 9/24/12: I kept the phone longer and gave it a good chance at working properly.  I did a \"master reset,\" as suggested by another reviewer.  I then called Tracfone, who sent some magic waves to the phone and determined it's working properly (even though it's not).  They kept wanting to do a test call to test the volume, despite my telling them that volume has no effect on the reception, which is my complaint.  In other words, they would not replace the sim card, which was what another reviewer/poster suggested, since that had solved his issue.  So I will have to get a new phone.  The reception and call quality on this one is horrible. Even when I call the voicemail ON the phone itself, it cuts out horribly. I can hear every other word of the voicemail instructions sometimes, and sometimes it goes completely silent. And what is it with the locking feature? Even though auto locking is turned off, it auto locks whenever a new call comes in. So you have to first unlock the phone in order to answer it, which means you miss the short time to answer the phone (you have to press the lock button for several seconds to unlock it). It's a cute little phone, but the first and most important thing a phone should do is have good call quality and reception. It is a PHONE.  I'm so disappointed in LG and Tracfone. I can't really afford to start all over with a new phone and maybe carrier. But I have to.UPDATE OCT. 2012:  Tracfone surprised me with a new (refurbished) LG800g.  It works better. The sound isn't garbled, and the reception is better. I now know that the prior phone must've been defective. It still locks when an incoming call comes in, which is weird. Another poster mentioned that. So either the ph is supposed to do that (which means everyone's does that), or this is a common defect. Another poster said to hit the green \"send\" button when call comes in. I did that on the original phone, but it didn't work...because the phone was locked, of course.  I haven't tried it on the new phone yet.  Anyway, I'm still not crazy about this phone because of hte sound quality, although this phone's sound and reception is better.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT PRICE, LOADED FEATURES, GREAT PHONE!", "Author": "lynn1025", "ReviewID": "R1C8LBCP13W4I0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the LG800G Prepaid phone for 3 months now with NO PROBLEMS.

BUT the cool thing is that I buy the $20 (60 min=180 cuz I get triple minutes) prepaid cards at Warehouse Club who sell them for $18 (instead of $20) cuz Im a business member.  Moreover, I love the TRIPLE MINUTES (thru Tracfone) that came with the phone and how they roll over if you dont use them all up--as long as you add more minutes b4 your service days end.  I blew my font up to large so I can see my txts without my glasses (which I couldnt do on my old phone) I get all my txts and calls now which was also a problem with my old contract company. I quit my contract phone with \"V\" to buy this tracfone and easily activated it online within a couple minutes.  It has tons of features that I use in my business daily.  It has 3 different types of keyboards u can activate on the screen: 1.full querty--like a typewriter, 2. traditional keyboard--where you push a number btwn 1-3X to get a desired letter and 3.I can HANDWRITE my text on the screen with my finger!! Camera and Video work great too. I love how I can set the phone to autoLOCK the screen if I want to so it doesnt dial in my purse and I like how it fits in my purse and is not like the more popular phones out there that are like holding a shoe up to your ear.  This phone is perfect for me.  Plus Im saving a TON of money every month, I LOVE IT!!  It really helps in this economy.

After purchasing LG 800G I was disappointed to see small phone. Quirks I found challenging included constant locking of screen. However the phone screen uses excessive battery juice because the volume buttons and screen activate from light contact with phone case or my back pack fabric. This is true when placing phone in pocket. The text entry screen keyboard does not offer qwirty when searching for contacts. I found the colorful screens and icons visually appealing but difficult to navigate because my touch caused mistakes. Small phone size is difficult for an adult to hold without dropping.

SOOOO if you talk to them long enough, they'll do what they can, completely REVERSING the first thing they said!!!Now, with the THIRD one, they could not activate it, as they said I needed a new SIM card......sent by Fedex......when it came, I just looked at it and the directions to install it, and thought.. to hell with all this nonsense. THREE DEFECTIVE PHONES IN NINE MONTHS???????  forgeddabout it!!!AN EVEN LATER UPDATE, 11/21/2012....THIS MORNING, the screen on the LG800 'froze'....this has happened before but 'righted' itself in a few seconds...not this time!!  the battery is now 4 months, and 1 week old, which is when the first battery died..I removed battery & waited a few seconds, put it right back in..NOTHING....THANK GOD I had activated my new Alcatel which I LOVE.....now I have to go to another phone to transfer my old number to the new phone....I have 1/2 a notion to just take a hammer to the damn LG800 and then put it in the dumpster...and I just may do that.ONCE AGAIN PEOPLE if you are considering getting the LG800, BEWARE......as stated before, THREE of these suckers in 9 months, with this and that and the other going wrong with the same model???????  TOO MUCH FOR ME.Only drawback to the Alcatel is tat it's not triple minutes but double minutes......fine with me!!!!  I'll survive!!  lolSO NO MORE LG PHONES FOR ME.......I will probably stay with TracFone, as I like getting the triple minutes....but the LG phone series?  NEVER AGAIN.......So those of you who may have the LG800, I hope you're having better luck with it than I did.........never again........NOW ONTO MY INITIAL REVIEW...........!!!Got tired of paying $70 a month just to use a cordless phone.....tried getting a lower price on just the features I wanted, but the phone company's as bad as the cable companies.....you just cannot pick and choose what you want!!I got my LG800G from Home Shopping Network, at a great price with many extras. and I LOVE the triple minutes for life!!!!!After 6 days, the record function was not working...you would record something, then it would not play back......you could hear it on the 'record files' but that, of course, was not acceptable.......So tech support had me reset the phone - twice - still no luck...so they told me I'd have to send it back and they'd provide a prepaid shipping label.....TracFone customer support is tremendous!!  every time I call I get in less than 5 minutes; I always call before 8 am or after 8 pm....anyway, now I have the 'pleasure' of having to reenter all my phone names, numbers, & email addresses, but I really can't complain........TracFone is a good company to deal with, & I would not hesitate to recommend them for whatever other type and model of cellphone you might want to get..", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of this Phone", "Author": "will13007", "ReviewID": "R3NJ4AC15CR6EU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been a satisfied Tracfone customer for 3 years using an old Motorola 376G phone.

Additional phone problems include being told I have messages but not being able to retrieve them.  In summary, it's a throw away phone & I'm out $49 & very poor customer service.

Yes, it can be unlocked, but it locks again within seconds.  Over and over.  And you can't turn off the feature.  Imagine making a call to any business with an automated response interactive system, and you keep having to unlock it, press the dial pad icon, then press the number for a response, all within seconds.  Now imagine having to do that while trying to be handsfree.  I don't care what the overreactive, irrational justification (a solution in search of a problem) was for this feature, not being able to turn it off is unacceptably to-the-bone-marrow stupid.

Awesomeness!Actually, okay, no, that's not awesomeness, that's just life in 2012. The awesomeness ratchets up when you consider that this is a Tracfone, and that it cost under $35. Now THAT'S amazing!Granted, we have seen similar phones elsewhere with more features at similar prices. Only, those phones also came with something we DIDN'T want: a two-year contract with some provider or another. Been there, done that, paid the fees, will never do again. We like Tracfone and we're sticking with it. And right now, this is the best phone they have. And it's pretty darned good for $35 too.Follow along with me, now: a nice touch screen display. Bluetooth. Excellent sound and reception. Downloadable Java apps. A 2mp single image and video camera. An mp3 player. Takes up to a 4gb micro SD card. Big enough to be beefy, small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. Easy and intuitive to use. I can create and load my own mp3 ringtones, no more using my minutes buying them from Tracfone. Ditto for the desktop pictures. I'm a pretty fair photographer; I'll use my own.Not much I can complain about with this handset. Add to all of the above that it's made by LG--I am really high on their gear--and looks to be quite durable. And if it turns out it's not, or if it gets run through the wash...well, it's $35, and I get another one and transfer my minutes over again. It takes minutes to accomplish. We ought to know, we did three of them in the past week or so.The more I use it, the more I like it, and the more I wonder what I did without it. And did I mention it's triple minutes? No? Well, I just did, then. TRIPLE MINUTES!Tracfone is really upping their game with the release of this wonder widget. Granted, if you're a heavy user, chances are that pre-pay will not be for you. But if you're on a limited budget, if you don't use a mobile a whole lot, or if you just don't like forking over $40 or more a month to a cell phone carrier, well, this might be worth looking into.

On 2 of the phones at least 25% of the time after the alarm is stopped the phone stays on the the Alarm Off page and the only way to get off it is to take out the battery. You can't even turn the phone off when that screen is stuck on. The people with the other 2 phones don't use the alarms so I don't know if they also have the problem. Lots of people must be having these problems and just be putting up with them like I am because the phone is so cheap and with triple minutes so inexpensive to use.

Fierman", "ReviewID": "R9YKOKRCDJC36", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the LG800G Tracfone for about four months and have differing thoughts.  It is a good deal for a touch screen.  When it first came out, the price point was at $59.99.  Now (July 2012) it is at $49.99.  When I got mine through the Tracfone website, it was at $39.99.  Amazon is offering it for $32.99, which is a good deal.  The phone is easy to use and for a prepaid phone is a giant leap for the technology available.  Everything about the phone is fantastic except for texting.  There is no stylus provided with the phone and texting with your fingers is difficult.  There are different methods of texting input.  You can use the ABC method like the older analaog phones were.  You can use the QWERTY keyboard, which is difficult to do unless you use a pencil or other \"stylus\".  You can use the hand writing method.  I have been told that I print like a walking typewriter (Thanks to Mrs Foster my fourth grade teacher).  Even with this, I have to attempt up to five times to get a \"T\" not to register as a \"J\".  Be careful also about how you carry the phone when not in use.  The touch screen is very sensative and could engage when you don't want it to.  It is also annoying when getting a call.  As soon as you get the call, the screen goes into the lock mode and you have to hold the unlock icon if you need to press any keys for input, (Like when the prompt comes for you to enter 1 for this or enter 2 for that).  I do like the phone for daily use.  I just can't text with it.  Tracfones are relatively inexpensive so I have a second one that I use for texting.  My friends and family have gotten used to me having more than the one phone number.  Is it a Smart Phone?  It could be with the right apps.  Tracfone is pretty \"propriotary\" with their software and can only be downloaded through their sites so you are very limited on what you can do.  I am retired now and do not use my phone as I used to but like to have an upgrade from the \"clamshell\" type of phones.  If you can use a phone with touchscreen but again do not use the phone as your PC, this one is good.  If you use your phone for texting, this one could really slow you down.  Make sure you know what you are getting into when you get this one.  I might just retire this one into one of my desk drawers and go back to my LG500C.  After writng this review, I have done just what I said I might do.  Retired the LG800G into the top right drawer of my desk and used my LG500G I got from Amazon.

Tracfone has been a perfect phone for this level of use.  1 year service is around $100 and you can roll over unused minutes year to year. The minutes do not expire as long as the service is extended before the expiration date. I purchased a LG800G phone to replace an 6 year old phone that stopped working.\u2714 To transfer the old number and minutes--------------------------------------------1.  Before activating and transferring the old phone number and left over minutes, the new phone needs to be charged.2.  You can activate the  phone on-line (if you have an on-line account with Tracfone AND if your old phone is operational).  To do so go to Tracfone home page and choose \"Activate Phone\" link at the top of the home screen, and then selecting \"Transfer my number and service from one TracFone to another\".  Since the old phone was not working I called the service representative 1-800-867-7183.3. To do the transfer you will need the IMEI number (also known as the serial number) of the old phone, the SIM card number of the old phone, and the old phone number. You will also need the serial number of the new phone which is printed on your activation card.4. I had no issues getting full credit for all the old minutes. To activate the phone the operator had to give me five long series of numbers and even though the call center was in India I had no trouble understanding the accent and found the operator pleasant and easy to work with.  The first procedure she performed gave me credit for half of the minutes on the old phone, and then without me having to ask she said she needed to do several more steps to get me the balance of minutes.  I had to turn off and turn on the phone twice to see minutes added in two steps.5. The new phone added 10 units and 60 days of service to the minutes and service time left on the old phone.6. The software version I received on the phone purchased in February 2013 is V10e.  The older version of the software had problems (specifically version V10d).You can check what version of the software you have by clicking on a blue square with 4 dots on the main screen. Then tapping on the following: Settings - Phone - scroll down to Information - Device Information - S/W version.If you have V10e or later you are all set.  If you have V10d you have an older problematic version and should upgrade.I went to LG web site, found support page, and entered 800G. I found a page where there are steps to install software that performs an upgrade for the the phone.  The instructions say \"If your phone needs to upgrade, the \"Start Updating \" button will be enabled.I did not test this because my phone is on the latest version already, but I wanted to see if LG had a page for updates and I found it.  I will post a direct URL as comment to this review, as links in the review itself are removed.\u2714 What I like about the phone------------------------------------------1. I found the touch screen to be responsive, although it requires a little more pressure than the touch screens of my Android devices2. The screen is bright and easy to see. The phone size is 4\" (length) by 2.25\" (width) by 0.375\" (thickness). Screen size 1.75\" (width) by 2.25\" (length). 3\" diameter.  It weighs 3.1 oz.3. This phone will be used by someone whose vision is not very good, and I was pleasantly surprised by many font size choices and how well the font scaled up without losing the usability of the menus and prompts.I am attaching a collage of five photos (which can be found by following customer photos link under the main photo). Photo #1 shows font options, Photo #2 shows a screen with font size set to medium size, Photo #3 shows a screen with large font.4. The price of this phone is hard to beat. This phone provided triple minutes for the life of the phone. That means when combined with 1 year service/400 minutes it is 1200 minutes for $90 (current price on Amazon including shipping), which is 7.5 cents per minute.  Or for someone who uses a phone less than 400 minutes a year (which is the case in our family), then it is $7.50 a month for the security of having an emergency phone.5. The phone has a small set of useful apps: a calculator, a notepad, an mp3 player, and few others.  Using these apps does not use minutes.  If you use the browser then the minutes are used as soon as you connect and stop when you disconnect.6. A charging connector is a standard micro USB connector.  I have been able to charge this phone using my own cables, so if you already have a car charger or an external battery that uses a standard USB connector you don't need to buy anything special to use it them with this phone.  The charging port on LG800G is on the left side of the phone and is covered by a small panel which you need to lift up and turn 90 degrees to expose the connector.\u2714 Customization I have made---------------------------------------(1) I increased the screen time out.  This is done by hitting a blue squares with 4 dots (also known as the Menu icon) and then selecting 'Settings'. From the 'Settings' screen select 'Phone' and then 'Auto-lock'.  You can choose a time between 10 sec and 60 sections or 'Never'.  If you select 'Never' the screen will dim but will not lock.  The downside of 'Never' that if something in your purse accidentally presses on the screen you could be dialling or starting up a browser without meaning to do so.(2) I removed the browser from the main screen to the apps bar (so it would not be hit accidentally start using minutes).  And added \"Profiles\" to the main screen, which allows to change the phone into silent or flight mode quickly.(3) I populated the contacts, and then added several numbers to the speed dial. Once the speed dial is set you will be able to access it by clicking the phone icon on the main screen, and then hold down the number of your speed dial. Speed dial #1 is your voice mail.  Note that when you access your voice mail you get charged minutes. Speed dials also appear as individual buttons on the screen on the second page.  To get to the second page you need to swipe your finger across the main screen right to left.(4) I changed the font of the display. This option is accessible by hitting the Menu icon, then 'Settings', then 'Display', then 'Font'.(5) I changed the ring tone.  To get to this setting you need to go to the second page of Settings. Start with Menu, then Settings, then slide your finger right to left to flip the page, select 'My stuff', then 'Sounds'.  The phone comes with 12 choices for rings tones.(6) You can activate and deactivate sounds by using the volume button.  To do so you need to press and hold the lower portion of the volume button.  You will get a brief message on the screen \"Silent activated\". If you press it again you will deactivate silence and get \"Silent deactivated\" message.\u2714 ADDING SD MEMORY CARD-------------------------------------The phone is operational without adding an SD memory card. The phone comes with some (relatively small) amount of internal memory. Information about your contacts, calendar, tasks & notes are stored in internal memory.  If you are planning to take photos or videos, or listen to music, you should add an SD memory card.  Note that your contacts, calendar, and tasks will continue to be stored the internal memory. I purchased this SD memory Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC  Memory Card with SD Adapter.1. SD memory card slot is located under the battery.  This means that you first need to remove the cover by sliding it down. The first time I had to remove the cover it was a bit difficult, as the cover is very slippery and has no groves to hang on to. I finally was able to do it by using the grippy material used to open cans. Photo #4 shows me removing the battery cover. The grippy material generated enough friction that the cover finally slid off. After removing the cover, you need to remove the battery.2. The memory card slot is on the left side of the white SIM card.  The gold bars on the card should face down towards the gold bars on the phone.  The memory card goes under a metal holder. You need to lift the metal holder, place the memory card, and then lower the card holder, and push it down until it snaps in place.  Note that lifting the holder for the first time requires some force. I used a tiny screwdriver to give me leverage to push it up.  Photo #5 shows the holder in up position, so you can see what you need to do to insert the memory card.3. After the memory card is in place, you need to replace the battery and the phone cover, and power up the phone.4. Now, you need to set your default memory to external, and tell the camera, the video recorder, and the voice recorder to use the external memory rather than the internal memory like before.5. To set the  default memory:  - Tap the following sequence MENU - Settings - Phone - Memory Info - Primary storage settings  - Tap on External memory (red check will appear)  - There will be a FORMAT button at the bottom of the screen, tap on it  - The phone will ask for a security code, enter 0000.  Once you enter the security code, OK button will appear on the bottom of the screen. Click ok. Format takes about 1 second.6. To set the  camera:  - Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizonal position, as you turn you will see camera control setting appear on the screen.  - Tap the gear icon which is on the lower left side of the screen.  - The memory setting is on the second screen of camera settings, so you need to tap the slider on the right hand side (it will say 1/3, first page out of three) once you tap it will change to 2/3.  - On the top row you will see a square called 'select storage'.  By default it will look like a cell phone, once you tap it will look like a memory card.  - Hit OK to save your change7.  To change the video camera:  - Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizon position, as you turn the camera controls will appear  - Tap the gear looking icon on the botton left  - Now you need to switch from camera to video, which is done by sliding your finger from camera to video camera icon on the right hand side slider  - If you do it correctly, you will see a red button appear where the video camera is.  If you do it incorrectly, you will take a photo.  It took me a few tries to get the pressure and location of where my finger slides correctly.  - The storage setting is on the second page of the video camera, so you need to page down on the slider by tapping on 1/2.  - Tap on 'Select storage' icon, and make sure you see a memory card, rather than the cell phone icon.  - Click OK to save your change8. To change the voice recorder  - Voice recorder is on the second page of Settings.  To get there select Menu - slide you finger right to left to page - tap on Voice recorder.  - The top option is 'Storage', tap on it to change cell phone icon to memory card icon.  - Click ok to save your changeOverall, the phone feels nice, the screen is easy to read, when I made a few \"test\" phone calls I was told that I sound very clear.  Other than that I am quite pleased with this phone. Note that this is NOT a full featured smart phone like Android smart phones or iPhone, but it a very cost efficient way to have an emergency phone which can do a bit more than just phone calls.Ali Julia reviewUpdate 3/9/2013:  My original review stated that the thing that I like least about the phone is that its speaker phone is not loud enough to hear well without putting the phone next to your ear. However, since then I discovered that there is a setting which turns on the speaker phone, and with the setting on the phone functions well as a speaker phone.  To turn on the speaker phone press on \"speaker\" icon, this icon will appear when you are connected to the other side on the bottom of the screen that is displayed when you are talking on the phone.  To turn it off, click on the \"speaker\" icon again.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wife and daughter love 'em.....", "Author": "Jonny J. \"GoPenguins09\"", "ReviewID": "R2VH9QZ415RGQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Didn't buy ours at Amazon but at Shopko for about same price(on sale).

We both purchased this phone as TracFones and could not be more pleased.It's amazing how much improvements there has been in cell phones in the past 10-15 years.  The phones are much smaller and have features like internet access that werenot even dreamed of on our last pair of phones.Our phone is a smart phone (though not the latest and smartest) that has internet access capability (which we don't currently use but it's there if we need it). Our land linephone is our main phone and we use this phone only occasionally but it's convenient to have for emergencies etc.  As a TracFone, this phone gets triple minutes for life.So if we pay for one minute we get three. Not ALL TracFone phones  triple minutes, but this one does.  We would recommend this phone with ANY cell phone provider, butparticularly as a TracFone if you use cell phone minutes sparingly as we do.  If you use your phone more than a few minutes a month, we would still recommendthis phone but possibly consider other service providers than tracfone.  This phone is NOT state of the art.

You can only turn off auto lock when using features outside of a call or voicemail.  I understand the purpose of the auto lock is so you don't accidently make a call while the phone is in your pocket, but it's clearly a bad design flaw. The problem with voicemail is you need to access the dial pad and the auto lock screen keeps popping up and getting in your way.  One tactic is to hold your finger on the on/off button on the top of the phone when the pop up lock screen comes and it will take you back to the dial pad.-I tried a few java apps and felt that they were poor quality compared to the iPhone/android market. I was hoping to find a dictionary touch screen app but all they just had keyboard versions.  Opera Mini  is the best app I found for the lg800g but you shouldn't use this phone for internet as it just devours your minutes. I would only use opera mini in an emergency. Also it has no wireless chip or GPS.-The camera gives more clearer pictures over the 1.3 megapixel Tracfone w376g-As for the micro sd card it only goes up to 4gb and prefers SanDisk.

The T301G is available with Triple Minutes which from my experience is the only good feature feature of the LG800 that actually worked well.  The T301G has better reception and voice quality and does not have the problems that I have described below.  AND is half the price!The dubious quality of Tracfone service will continue to haunt the provider relationship.Edited comment Sept 2012------------------------To add insult to injury the battery just died after only 6 months of use.  I have had cell phones where the batteries have lasted for several years.  I normally would not comment about a battery failure, but the product defects just keep piling up.  I suspect that LG's lack of ability or desire to fix the known/substantial LG800 defects reflect badly on corporate policy for support of any LG product. Despite LG's 'Life's Good' slogan, 'Life is Good (even GR8) Without LG.' BUYER BEWARE!Edited comment August 28, 2012------------------------------Changed the two start rating to one star.I just dread the very idea of using this phone!  The phone continues to have a mind of it's own doing things I did not 'request' and costing me minutes.  Many times the phone rings and no one is there.  A few days ago it just froze up and would not work at all until I removed and replaced the battery.  Why do I need to unlock the phone when the voice mail has just asked me to enter my pin?  I guess it's just another built in seemingly 'small' aggravation that can't be fixed or overridden that makes use difficult when attempting to use the phone with one hand.  Once I use up the minutes, off to another phone and provider.  My suggestion is: Don't bother with this clunker!-----------------------------I swiped this comment from another review of this phone.  \"Imprecise touch operation and poor interface design seem to conspire to make this thing do things it shouldn't. Especially when it comes to mis-dialing and either annoying friends or wasting minutes\", clunky.I like the triple minutes but not much else.  It's too late (packing materials gone, etc), but wish there was a phone with a better interface or even a simple flip phone w/triple minutes that I could replace this phone with. I thought the experience would improve w/practice, but is hasn't. Disappointing at best.If possible demo or try a friends phone before buying.I intend to use Skype for most of my outgoing calls were ever possible in order to avoid the interface issues.

Great little phone, brings us into the modern world! Took a whale to set up service but Tracfone CS Reps were very responsive & helpful. We were able to transfer our old numbers to the new phones & set up voice mail after some work. Then it took another day or so to transfer music files & pix to the new phones (hint-quicker to transfer files to memory card via PC than bluetooth files to the phone. Not having a cable, I used my card reader to transfer files & that worked just fine & was pretty quick). VERY COOL!

The only REALLY SUCKY thing is the stupid lock that appears when trying to access voice mail THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY!!! The only remedy for this is to hold a finger close to the on/off button on the top right of the phone, pressing the on/off button unlocks it quicker than trying to use the touch unlock feature. Also not as good reception where we live as the old LG phone-which had 4 bars, here we get 2 bars on ROAM only in the kitchen, the rest of our house has no reception.

Now I have spent some six hours trying to get just basic functions to work, with very frustrating results.For example: the phone automatically locks itself up every two seconds, so in the middle of doing something you're constantly presented with \"Press and hold to unlock.\"A telephone support representative advised that this locking problem is a known glitch with the product, and no solution is available to fix it.I had to call phone support twice just to be able to set up voice mail and retrieve messages.After three calls to support and poring over the tutorial, I still have many unanswered questions.  Example: On the keypad I can navigate to \"Security.\"  Press it, get \"Enter your security code.\" I have no idea what my security code is.  Tech support says to enter the last 4 digits of my phone number.  Great, except that doesn't work either.There is no manual and an online tutorial which I found consistently frustrating.

Phone is so-so...", "Author": "R. McFall", "ReviewID": "RTWUHKM8K05B3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In a nutshell:THE BAD:Lousy Manual (printed & online both), Terrible touch screen response, \"T9\" Texting is not good.THE GOOD: Very Cheap! GREAT phone service through Tracfone, Long Talk & Standby time, Fast Porting of Old Phone Number.THE LONGER STORY:I switched to Tracfone because it's so much less expensive for me.  I only use talk and messages, so I don't need anything fancy.  This phone comes with triple minutes for life, which is why I bought it.  If I had it to do over, I'd get the Samsung 404g instead and try it out since it is the only other one with Triple minutes for life. I chose this phone because it has what I thought was a headset jack that wouldn't require an adapter.  I was wrong. I opted to use bluetooth instead, and got a bluetooth headset that I love (Zelher P20), so now I can get a different phone.THE PHONE: This phone is ok, but has a lot of drawbacks.  The touch-screen combined with the placement of icons etc. makes accuracy necessary, but difficult.  Scrolling through people in phone is next to impossible.  I wind up having to do a search instead, and then dialing their number isn't always successful when pressing the call icon. I have a Kindle Fire, so I'm used to touch screens, so it's not me, it's the phone.I also am not a fan of T9 texting.  If you aren't familiar with T9, it's a method of entering words with the telephone keypad by hitting the keys once instead of multiple times to get to the other letters available.  (For example Hit the 2 key once for A, twice for B, 3x for C) It supposedly figures out the word on its own by sorting through the combinations of keys and figuring out the most probable word you are typing from some algorithm. It's wrong a lot, and necessitates turning it on and off for lots of things -- even putting a question mark at the end of a sentence rather than a smiley face of all things. So T9 works sometimes, but not always.  I think I need to go back to a full keyboard phone like the Samsung.More than likely, I'll sell this phone to someone else, or give it to a friend if they want it, and then I'll get the Samsung unit and transfer my number/minutes, etc to that phone.The instruction manual for this phone is also a joke.  The online one isn't much better.  I didn't know what T9 was, and it wasn't in the manual at all, so I had to Google it to find what it was.THE SERVICE: Not much good about the phone, but the Tracfone service really impressed me, and still continues to do so.  Tracfone uses the ATT network, and coverage in my area is quite good (Suburban Los Angeles area).  I get 12 months service that includes a total of 4500 minutes for $199.00.  This is 1500 minutes that got tripled due to the triple minutes for life on the phone.  Included is 12 months of service.  I can buy more time & minutes on their website, or on Amazon or at the 7-Eleven (seriously).  I told my Mom to get it also, and she got this phone, with triple minutes for life, including 1200 minutes and one year of service for $99.00.  Amazing to me.  I transferred my Verizon Cellphone number to this phone, and the transfer was completed in about 90 minutes.  I was shocked, it was so fast and easy AND FREE!Text messages are included, and they use minutes instead of being considered separately. They use 0.3 minutes per text message.

It was  annoying that TracFone or their vendor would repeatedly text me to promote their airtime cards.  Yesterday alone, I received three such promotional texts from 360 460 8637.  If you know how,  please let me know how to stop this unwanted solicitation.  Those text messages cost me MY air minutes!!!  It is crazy that they would make customers pay for their spams.I had a hard time setting up voice mail box.  The keypad just wouldn't recognize the password I entered.  I had to call tech support twice.  First time after a 15 minute wait, It took me 30 minutes to follow the agent's trial and error instructions.  After 30 minutes, she had to do a complete reset and I was instructed to wait for 4 hours before turning the phone on to find out if the reset worked.  It didn't.  Made another call.  This time, took the agent 45+ minutes but she was able to fix the problem in that call.  Both times, I used a land line because I knew it would deplete my air minutes like crazy. Even with that, all the testing, try and error, they used up more than 60 air minutes.  The 2nd agent was kind enough to give me 60 minutes back.  Not sure if I got an older model (from LG through Amazon), both agents seemed to have problems figuring out the model I have because they kept on telling me to press (differnt) buttons that my phone didn't have.  The good thing about Tracfone's tech support is both agents were patient and respectful.  Although I wouldn't rate them high in product knowledge or trouble shooting skills but they got gold stars for customer handling skills.I bought a one year 400 minute card from Safeway for $99.  Because LG800G is a triple minute phone,  the 400 minutes tripled to  1200 minutes. Tracfone then double the minutes and duration on top of that.  So I ended up with a total of  2400 minutes expriring in Aug 2014 (2 years).  Had I got the card from Amazon, it would have cost me less ($84.99 plus shipping). Does anyone know if the one year card purchased from Amazon would also  double the minutes and expiration date?LG800G is light and small (than Blackberry for example). The keypad and QWERTY are tiny even for someone with small fingers.  But they work if you use a pen to enter numbers or text. I followed the recommendation from another reviewer to get screen covers and a protector case (Mageta).  They are well worth of the few extra dollars.It holds charge well if you don't use it.  But it loses charge and uses up air minutes quickly if you text, surf the net, make or receive calls.  To preserve the minutes, I use it mainly as an answering machine or making calls only when a land line isn't available.So far this phone is doing everything a no contract, pay-as-you go tracfone should do.

This was a replacement for my old phone which after 5 years finally died.  This was my FIRST Tracfone bought somewhere other than the Tracfone website and I will probably be doing this in this in the future as it seems to be the cheaper option.I was able to transfer my old phone number and minutes with ease through the website and the process was pretty painless.The phone itself is the nicest one by far we've ever gotten.  Camera, MP3 player, games, web access, memo pad, calendar, alarms, touch screen... it seems to have everything I'd need and mostly stuff I'll probably never use but I'm still annoyed that it touts having the MP3 player but you have to buy the SD card and cord separately for it to be of use.  I have purchased those but they have not yet arrived so I can't say if that feature is any good or not.The thing I like best about this phone was that adding contacts was so much easier with the \"handwriting\" option rather than using the keypad.  I could use my finger and I got some measure of accuracy but using a toothpick I was able to just write in all my contact names and numbers in no time at all.  It was just awesome.  I imagine there has got to be a stylus somewhere for sale for this phone you can buy separately.  I'll probably stick to my toothpick which is free and handy.The phone menu is a vastly different set up than anything I had previously but it didn't take too long to get used to and now I feel pretty comfortable with it.  Tracfones are always very simple to use, and that is somewhat appealing to me, I don't have to spend hours to familiarize myself with them.  They get the job done efficiently and cheaply.  This phone though looks more complicated than it is.  Fool your friends into thinking you have an expensive cell plan!  Then laugh as you have loads more money at the end of the month!EDIT - I have since began using the MP3 feature and I love it.  It works so well and I have since stopped using my old MP3 player even though the sound quality on it was better.  This is just so much more convenient because it is also my phone.I have also figured out how to disable the \"lock screen\" that comes up automatically on the phone.  That was so annoying to me.  So now my phone is just the way I like it.EDIT - I have also discovered you can convert your videos to GP3 format and load them on this phone and play videos.  This is a lifesaver for me because I don't like my <2 year old son to play with my more expensive Sony media player or my Galaxy Tablets, so I can just give him my inexpensive phone and load a video and he's happy.

It was 2:00 PM when I requested the porting service, but the new phone was not activated until about 7:00 AM the next day (both days were weekdays). This left me without cell phone service for more than 1/2 day. The minutes and service days did NOT port to the new phone, requiring another phone call to TracFone that lasted almost 20 minutes -- but I got all my minutes and service time transferred.  I live in Phoenix, and my old Motorola TracFone was on T-Mobile towers. The new phone is now on ATT towers and voice mail. So, I had to set up my voice mail all over again. You probably can't get the voice mail set up with just 10 minutes of air time, so add air time first. However, you can set up your voice mail quickly (choose the simplest options and hang up)using the TracFone and use the Call Log to find out what phone number the 800G used to call the voice mail provider. Then, you can use a land line to call the voice mail \"computer\" to enhance your voice mail service and options. And in the future, you can retrieve your voice mail messages from any land line: Save that phone number! You will save a lot of minutes this way.The phone does a lot of nice things.

It is best to have the expectation that this phone is inexpensive and therefore will not have the extensive capabilities of customization and convenience as the more expensive phones. I purchased this to use mostly as an emergency phone and so was not looking for the most up-to-date features.The touchscreen reacts remarkably well when tapping. The only time I found any small problems with the response of the touchscreen is when needing to swipe your finger across the screen either for a sliding feature or when using handwriting input. For example, when going thru the contact list, it moves thru the list much too fast (am curious if there is a response setting to fix this?) so I found it best to tap above/below the position marker on the slider in order to go up or down a page at a time instead. This is no big deal to me since there is a workaround in that instance but, this quirk is much more tedious and annoying when using the handwriting feature. I really like the idea of this feature for inputting text (especially when the qwerty keyboard is not available...more about this later) but am noticing that the screen doesn't pick up the movements of your finger accurately alot of the time and the distortion causes frequent inaccuracies. I ordered a stylus so am waiting to see if this helps that problem.I had read that other phones in this price range did not have multiple alarm capability but this one has all the features of alarm scheduling as my old phone and even an additional option of excluding holidays. Included alarm repeat options are: not repeated, daily, M-F, M-Sat, Sat-Sun, select days, except holidays.I do not use the internet from phones so can not comment about this.The biggest gripe I have with the LG800g at this time is the inability to use the qwerty keyboard for every single inputting need. Why make it available for only a couple of features? You can not use the keyboard when entering contact list info (including searches) or the subject/title lines when creating calendar events or tasks. The only time this option seems to be available is for text messages and memo entries. If the handwriting function would work better or if I knew beforehand that there was no keyboard at all, I wouldn't be as disappointed.All in all, I am pleased with the LG800g so far and even ordered another for my husband last night who will also be dropping his current carrier. You just can't beat the triple minutes for life in addition to the affordable price.UPDATE 2013: BOTH LG800G PHONES PURCHASED COMPLETELY DIED AFTER ONE YEAR. ALSO PURCHASED MY MOTHER ONE LAST YEAR AND IT DIDN'T LAST A FULL YEAR.

Wasted $40. *Sigh*", "Author": "Michael Gmirkin", "ReviewID": "R2OU2XP5OQXRIG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this phone, because of the triple minutes for life.And the triple minutes part I *DO* like. But, honestly, the touch interface is more of a hassle than it's worth and I doubt I'd use apps much (twitter would be about the only thing I can think of off hand, and even that I'd rather have a full on laptop for anyway)...Basically, the touch interface seems terribly imprecise and with some terrible interface decisions. the on-screen buttons are too small, so half the time when you're trying to click a ringtone to preview it, you end up clicking on it and setting it as current when you don't want to. And on the contacts screen the scroll bar at the right is about 3 pixels wide, thus impossible to hit accurately, and not only that but the green 'call' button for every contact is RIGHT NEXT TO THE SCROLLBAR, so half the time you're trying to scroll down and end up accidentally dialing the phone number next to where you were trying to click/drag the scroll bar, wasting minutes and annoying your friends. Then when you WANT to click on a ph# and tap it in your contact record, half the time it ends up scrolling left or right to the NEXT CONTACT and NOT dialing the ph# of the person you just clicked on. Then you try to scroll back to the correct friend and you end up dialing the wrong person again.Sorry, but the interface just aggravates me. And then there are silly things like the main screen prepaid button that you CAN'T MOVE. Y'know the button you click to find out the information that's already scrolling along the bottom of the screen anyway (days & minutes of service remaining). Yeah, you can't even move the icon around on the screen. It has to be on the left side, one space down from the top. I mean, other icons you can drag around or remove from the main screen via the little blue tab at the bottom. But, no, not that one icon. I mean, you can't even change its position. What kind of shoddy interface design is that? Couldn't they make it so it can be moved to a less conspicuous location on the main screen, but just not removed completely? That would have been fine. But hard-coding it to a single location?On a more physical side, the phone is all shiny and sleek. So, it looks nice. Until you actually try to handle it. Just putting the battery cover on, I damn near dropped the thing it was so slick (slippery). And the nice shiny glossy screen picks up nice shiny glossy fingerprints and pocket lint like nobody's business. I can tell this would aggravate me completely as I generally prefer to keep my stuff un scuffed and as pristine as possible. Okay, after years of use my Samsung 301 had a few minor scratches on the screen from being in the pocket with keys. But I generally managed to keep it clean and in good shape. But, yeah, it's been pretty impossible to keep this thing fingerprint free. I suppose I could get one of those plastic screen protectors, but why bother?It was a tough call when I originally picked up the LG 800, since I really liked my Samsung 301 and there were both the LG 800 & the Samsung 404 available with triple minutes from Tracfone. Fred Meyer only had the LG 800, so I decided to pick that up rather than paying an extra $10 and having to wait a few days for the Samsung 404 to come via mail. I think I made the wrong call (if FM had the 404, I'd honestly have chosen that, I think). I was honestly hoping that I'd like the touch interface or that it would at least be usable and the triple minutes would make up for it. So far, I'm not much impressed. Sorry LG. gotta' be honest. The tiny scrollbar with call buttons placed RIGHT NEXT TO IT kills it for me. I shouldn't be \"afraid to use my phone.\" Unfortunately, I kind of am based on how the interface of this thing is laid out. Imprecise touch operation and poor interface design seem to conspire to make this thing do things it shouldn't. Especially when it comes to mis-dialing and either annoying friends or wasting minutes, that's a no-no. Just my candid opinion.So, I've ordered the Samsung 404 qwerty keypad slider phone, like I should have in the first place (since I very much like the 301 I've had for some time now). I hope it gets here before my trip to Las Vegas next week so I can have that in my pocket rather than this finnicky touch phone.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money!", "Author": "ASilk", "ReviewID": "R2AN2AKJSQH9JR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased thru shopcelldeals on Amazon.

Sending a text costs .30 minutes and reading a text takes another .30 minutes. Very rarely it will say a text failed to send and you will have to send it again wasting .60 minutes. Sending up to 5 pictures costs 1.00 minutes and receiving a picture(s) costs 1.30 minutes. Since this phone is Triple Minutes the minutes you buy are multiplied by 3. I use the 120 minutes card that costs $30 then it ends up being 360 minutes, and using a promo code gets me to 420 minutes. The internet browser is really slow, but you can use it for basic things. I haven't really used the browser since I use my computer and don't need to be connected to the internet when I go out. Calling is average, but I just use it to talk for up to 2 minutes and it sometimes makes strange noises. It's kind of like a smartphone, but I wouldn't say it is. The touch screen isn't the same as on other touch screens, so you have to push your finger harder. The games on this phone also are pretty bad, but it has a calculator with Sin, Tan, and Cos which I find very helpful in my math class. Every card you buy comes with 90 service days which is great and you can buy more minutes to add more days. Your old minutes won't expire as long as you have service days it's really good if you like to conserve your minutes.

Cheap, but still not woth all the hassles.", "Author": "Dynode", "ReviewID": "R2IGGLV4ZMHDHP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update: I've suffered with this phone's terrible software for about a year now, and last night I snapped. It logged onto the internet from my pocket for the very last time. RIP 800g. Before that it pulled some other fun stunts, like calling up my ex-boss at 2 a.m.! The hardware on this phone is actually pretty good, except maybe the marginal touch screen and reception. But the software is abysmal. Software this bad should be criminal. Did anybody at LG or TF try this horror out at all before they put it up for sale? The built-in browser has no apparent purpose but to connect to the internet from your pocket or purse to drain your minutes. None of the sites I use (gmail, etc.) were functional with it. The Opera Mini browser worked, but took 5 minutes just to get a page of text. Forget about using it on an actual web site. The number of other software problems is far too large to discuss here, but the three biggies are the inadequate protection against doing random expensive or embarrassing crap while in your pocket, the risk of accidentally hanging up on someone while trying to get ringing phone out of said pocket, and equally unforgivable, a touch screen that can't tell the difference between selecting/choosing vs. scrolling. The result for me was a phone so frustrating to use that I smashed it, so it is now downgraded to one star. Now the only question is whether I am so fed up with TracFone that I dump them too, or go back to one of their flip phones.****************************I've used this phone for a couple months now, and have worked around some of the initial problems. Some of the other problems I haven't bothered to look into much, I just curse the phone. So maybe there are solutions. Also I should add that I hate touch screens in general, even on an iPhone or iPad.I bought this phone mostly for the triple minutes, which was nice. I'd hoped for some minimal internet access too, but so far the built-in browser can't even work with gmail. The page is too big, and there's no scroll bar! Online it says to try the Opera mini-browser instead, which I may try sometime.The touch screen for this phone is resistive, not capacitive, which means in this case that it has a plastic cover instead of glass and requires quite a lot of force. I had a hard time writing on it without a stylus (or other pointy plastic object); same goes for the on-screen keyboard.One of the infuriating software glitches that make me want to smash it: at least for me, it interprets my touch as a swipe action whenever possible, instead of a select. For example, I want to click on the name of one of my contacts and tap it. No can do, it scrolls to the next page instead! Trying to click the text window to get the onscreen keyboard to pop up is also an exercise in frustration; in many cases nothing happens, and I can hammer on it all I want with no response. I think this is also a case of a tap (or a hammer blow) being read as a swipe action.If there is a way to take a picture quickly with the phone (not going down through the menus), I haven't found it yet. My flip phone had a button on the side; on this one the subject has long since left the scene by the time I get the camera turned on. Works for sunsets, though.At first it called up all my contacts or started browsing the web by itself every time I put it in my pocket, but after a while I got in the habit of pushing one of the buttons at the bottom every time I finished with it to make sure it was locked. It can be devious - when you call someone the lock screen appears (so your ear doesn't push buttons, I suppose), but this only lasts for the duration of the call, so if you drop it into your pocket etc. right after you hang up, it unlocks and starts merrily dialing and browsing away. I couldn't get rid of the browser icon completely, but it's safer if you swipe the screen with the browser away.One more bad point, and then I'll get to the good points (or maybe point). The reception is significantly worse than on my previous LG flip phone, with the result that I will probably have to get rid of it and reactivate my old phone. I have a usable signal at my house only about half the time. It is definitely a weak signal area, though, and other phones have trouble here too.On the good side, the MP3 player is nice to have. I put in the 4GB microSD card and it works great. Transferring files from the computer is really easy, since the phone pops up (with the $2 cable) as a USB drive. It seems to charge via USB, too. Using the MP3 player seemed to bring out some weird bugs, though. Sometimes the battery would drain to nothing in an hour or two; other times I would have to power the phone down and back up to get it to work again. Once I even had to take the battery out temporarily before it would turn on.Conclusion: Cheap smart phone, super small and fits in pockets, has MP3 player, and triple minutes! But software is marginal, touch screen is hard to use, built-in browser is not usable, and don't expect it to work well in areas with poor cell signal.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Touch Phone That Doubles As Mp3 Player, Camera, Photo Book, And Much More:", "Author": "RPFST2", "ReviewID": "R4O3UHHRYQL82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "~ For just making mobile calls anywhere in the USA to anywhere in the world, this LG Trac-Fone Phone is an excellent \"pay as you go\" option with wide US coverage ~ The majority of the USA is not using this phone so you won't find all the trendy and numerous Apps & Games, it doesn't talk back to you, it does not have GPS, and celebrities won't be seen using it but it is comparable in quality & basic offerings to most phones costing much, much more. Plus the batteries are not soldered in like some phones requiring you to send your phone away and pay someone else to replace it. It also has a memory slot inside, unlike others, to add more memory options to your phone. It includes many features.

If someone wants a copy, I can just send it as an attachment to their cell phone# or e-mail address.  Besides the deeply discounted and dependable cell service, my favorite feature is the MP3 player and Music Software Suite. Not only can the phone display an album Cover (if included in song file) it has a graphic equalizer to adjust Bass, Treble Etc. It scrolls at the touch of a finger to find the right song or you can use the advanced search option to find a specific tune. You can even slide the song (or video) to any position with your finger. You can adjust the volume with a touch-slide or press side buttons on phone. The headphone port accepts all standard mini-phono jacks so you do not need to special order them. It's appearance is streamlined & quite similar to many trending phones and more so if a 'skin' is used; it does not scream 'Prepaid'. There are many hits and some misses but for the price you can not go wrong. The Phone is customizable; I can buy various skins, guards, protective screen films, tripods, headphones, chargers etc. from different brands, buy or load different wallpapers & ringtones from my PC and I can load all of my favorite music on a memory card and use it just as an iPod but for 90% less.

The internet program pre-installed on the phone is very cumbersome, slow to load and then the tabs on the screen are so small that it's almost impossible to press the tab you want without opening something you don't want to. I tried loading Opera's web browser on to it, but the phone apparently didn't appreciate me using it because it keeps saying it has invalid signatures even though I made sure it was a legitimate download. That being said, their are apps for the phone out there, but few seem very appealing to me. Just accessing a few websites will drain your minute balance because of how slow the browser operates. I give it 2 stars because it has the triple minute feature which is very nice if you talk or text a lot, but there are other Tracfone phones with the same feature.

My only complaints are that they only include a basic set up guide, but no detailed manual. I went on-line to get a more comprehensive manual and it is not very good.  I even tried calling Tracfone's customer service and they couldn't help either since the phone is so new, they don't know how to support it.  My other gripe is that when in voicemail, the phone keeps locking every 6 seconds, which requires you to press a button to unlock it in order to delete the voicemail or respond.  The phone's setup allows you to customize the locking feature for anywhere from 6 to 60 seconds, but that option doesn't carryover to voicemail for some reason.

I can make it past this if I keep ready to press off the lock icon constantly, but am looking for a more permanent solution.  Even adjusting the security settings for lock to 'never', does not prevent this.  2) this was more of a problem, but I discovered a solution via the internet (thankyou internet). When I made a call that required use of the keypad to enter options (press 1 for english, 2 for espaniol, etc), and actually made it past the lock to select the keypad, the numbers would not be recognised.  We all make LOTS of calls like this.  I couldn't even set up my voice mail or call Tracfone customer support, because they start with these menus.

I needed to call 9-1-1 once after witnessing a power line fire over the road. It took 20-30 seconds to respond and unlock itself to allow a 9-1-1 call. DANGEROUS.  On another occasion I got a text message alert, but the phone would not respond. I was forced to remove the rubber case, remove the back, and remove the battery and then replace everything so it would reset itself. I have personally witnessed three other family members have the exact same problem.Horrible touch screen that is not even close to accurate. Trying to type a number or message is almost impossible. You touch number 7 and it registers number 3. You then must correct this mistake only to have it register the back space as enter which causes a big problem because the message gets even more messed up. Horrible phone.

If you need to buy minutes or basic needs on their web page you will be OK, BUT if you need to talk to someone for help you may be in for a real experience. My wife and I have had Net10 phones for five years and have been happy. I decided to purchase a new phone for my wife that would be easier to text from so I purchased the LG-800G. It came in two days and looks like it would do a nice job for us. My wife does not use her phone much so her minutes pile up. I use my phone much more so I don't have many minutes but lots of service days.I called and spoke to a Net10 Service Rep. and asked if they could transfer the 2200 minutes from My wife's phone to my phone. The Rep. said \"Sure\". She had me enter data on my wife's phone to take the minutes off her phone and move them to my phone. Well, she got the minutes off of her phone but they never showed up on my phone. I have been on the phone for several hours the past three days with no success. I have been given Ticket Numbers for special help. These have no meaning as the next person I talk to has no idea why I am calling and I have to explain why I am calling each time. The reps. spend most of your time updating their logging system and not providing any meaningful help to the customer.My last call was to a specialist who spent his time updating his records and then told me he was replacing my phone and I would have to return my phone which is out of warranty. He had no idea if that would fix my problem. At that point, I had had enough and told him to keep the phone and I would look for a new carrier. I have read other reviews from people with similar experiences. NOW I know what they are talking about. Net10/Tracphone has good products but their customer support is about as bad as it gets.

Hands down, that's a darn good deal.That said, this phone is not smart and does a terrible job even pretending.The touchscreen is resistive, like the card swipe kiosk at the supermarket; it isn't capacitive, like every touchscreen phone you're thinking you might like to own. This resistive screen, which is tiny, is very difficult to use quickly and accurately, as you really need to press your finger flat down to get a good read, by which time you've missed your mark.While the phone has a web browser, it is WAP based, not true IP based like the browser on iPhone or Android. This means essentially any modern website you enjoy using is crippled to the point of being essentially unavailable. The browser is also disgustingly slow. Slowness might be forgiven under the circumstances of such a cheap phone - except that Trac charges you not by data consumed, as every other mobile company would do, but by the time you spend with the web browser open. Since the browser is slow, and may take a minute to load a web page that turns out to be unusable, you're just throwing your minutes away every time you open the browser. I've taken to just writing a note to myself and waiting til I get home. It takes pure desperation for me to use the web on this phone now.The phone plays MP3s, but the player isn't well organized and has poor management options, and the audio quality produced by the hardware is low. So forget that part too.You can play some very dull preinstalled Java games circa 2004, or pay about half-a-month's worth of minutes to download more. Erase that form your mind too.So why on earth would you buy this phone?It makes phone calls, and receives them. Wow. I know. But the key here is that you can have a phone in your pocket that will cost you only about 10 cents per minute. With a year's worth of service for just over one hundred smackers netting nearly 1500 minutes, this is as good as it gets. If you are on a tight budget, as I am, and don't really talk on the cell phone except to keep family posted on your whereabouts, this phone might only cost you those hundred smackers annually and nothing more.Ah, now you are starting to understand. One hundred smackers a year versus that what... five or six hundred through other plans? I remember a time when I didn't \"need\" a cell phone.

If you're using the phone to call anywhere that you might have to use their automated system before getting through to a human, you'll go nuts. Between every prompt, the lock will activate. Within seconds of your last entry. To unlock and press the apropriate key, you have to hold down the \"unlock\" for two or three seconds (you might have to repeat this process before it actually unlocks), THEN press the keypad icon to get the keypad back before you can press \"1 for English\" or whatever you need to press. It can take so long that some automated systems will return you to the begining. THAT CAN MAKE A PERSON LOSE IT.

Using that phone was a nightmare, seeing how my one finger would routinely push down 2-3 keys at the same time.  Using the new LG 800G is such a nice upgrade from that mini keyboard- love that handwriting recognition feature!  The LG 800 has a great sounding MP3 player (with equalizer and CD cover art), a really good quality camera with instagram-esque filters you can add to your photos, and a very handy touch screen that makes it extremely user friendly.I initially had a problem switching phones - the phone number tranfered okay, but the minutes I had on my old phone (1988) showed up as 0 on my new phone.  I kept getting the \"activation required\" message as well.  After calling Tracfone 2 times, they had my new LG 800G up and running - and as you can guess, I love it!  If you're looking for a cheap upgrade from a basic Tracfone, this is the one to get.  No- it isn't an iPhone or even one of the many Samsung droid smart phones, but for $30 and $100 for 400 minutes per year (did I mention this phone has 3x minutes!) it'll leave your hard earned dollars in your wallet to be spent on other more important things.

Louie", "ReviewID": "R1XUFSR3FPJQ8B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchase ExperienceAfter reading the reviews, I purchased the Tracfone and 4GB SDHC card from one of Amazon's vendors.  The phone came from Virginia with the plastic package opened, loaded with ~year's service & ~1190 minutes. It had an Oklahoma City phone number and was in Spanish language mode. Changing it to English was interesting.  I inspected the phone and everything was in perfect shape.  Since I ordered only the basic phone, I figured they installed the 1 yr service as way to sell an open item phone and the hassle to reregister the phone number.  Because the phone has a phone number, I had to get a new SIM card after talking to Tracfone, which was delivered in 4 days.  I'm glad I did not try to transfer my phone number and minutes via the web.PhoneThe phone is hard to hold while operating without accidently activating a function on the screen at times so you may want to consider a silicon cover.  My phone reception is a little better that my old LG 420G flip phone on the AT&T; GSM network and is much clearer.  The back cover is hard to open once you lock it in its close position, so load your MP3 music from the PC onto the SD card before locking the back cover.  The top power button is small and hard to depress to shut the phone off.  Depressing the power button to wakeup from standby avoids the press and hold to unlock the screen. I could not deleted any of the pre-installed Java games, sounds, or pics.  The QWERTY keyboard seems to be only available for texting. You get a T9 format when adding new contacts.  There were no problems using the bulk 4GB SDHC offered and the phone read the external memory at a little less than 4GB.DisplayThe display resolution is ok, and visibility is outstanding in the outdoors.  LG uses a lot of large bold lettering which makes it easy to read and great for the baby boomer generation.  For some odd reason they made the antenna strength bars tiny.  The screen is plastic, not glass, so you will need a screen protector to prevent scratches.  The resistance touch screen is ok but some of the touch sensor areas are a little small so you must be careful when depressing the screen such as selecting a contact's cell phone versus their home phone when calling. You must continuously press the screen to swipe and scroll..WebThis phone is not a true smart phone but is better than a basic flip phone.  It uses the same web access method as a flip phone except for the larger screen and touch feature.  It is still very difficult and slow to surf the web with the 2G data rate, even with Opera Mini.  Opera Mini is activated as an Java app in the Games and Apps icon.  There are no user app icons.  I also downloaded Google maps which is ok but not great because of the limited resolution, screen size, and 2G.PC Connection (or lack of it)I purchased an USB to microUSB cable from Rapid Orders.  It did not work and it was not worth the hassle of returning it for $2.  I ordered another cable from Wowparts and it worked as a charge cable only showing the battery pic.  Both cables did not get the LG recognized as an USB device by the PC so I could not transfer data to/from the SD card and PC with the cable.  I manually loaded some JPEG pictures and music onto the SD card. The music and controls played fine as albums, genre, and artist but for some odd reason certain JPEG photos of similar sizes could not be opened.  The tiny icon looks ok but no full screen photos.  The 2M pixel camera and video works fine but is not a priority function for me.ConclusionI'm still waiting for a true prepaid smart phone from Tracfone but for the meanwhile this phone is worth it for the infrequent cell phone and mobile web user.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "cell phones", "Author": "D.

Although at times it hangs,  most of the time it's a good connection. And you can add more storage by getting a SDHC Flash Memory Card. Calls are very clear too. This is a full feature phone. It may not be an android but there are many free Java apps out there. I downloaded for free, a ton of ringtones, wallpapers and games and installed Google Maps, which works great. I also downloaded a mobile spreadsheet app. And I synced my Bluetooth headset. File transfer between PC and phone is a breeze. Just be sure to get the USB cable.

When attempting to retrieve voicemail, a message pops up blocking the screen - \"Press & Hold to Unlock\". The message goes away for only a few seconds, then returns, once again blocking the dialpad and all buttons. (Scrambling to enter your passcode is quite frustrating!!)This is a redundant complaint among owners, and, according to TracFone and other users who've inquired about this problem, it cannot be fixed. Others, in their forum responses to this issue, offer suggestions, but it is quite obvious they are not familar with the phone.  I repeat - there is no solution to making the Press & Hold to Unlock button go away permanently on the VoiceMail screen.2. On most phones, one can press and hold a numeral button to lock the phone to avoid pressing a button or dialing accidentally. Pressing said button again unlocks the phone.  On the LG800G, it's a a 5-step process to use the Auto-Lock feature which offers \"Never, 10,20,30,60 second\" intervals as menu choices.  Choosing \"20 secs.\", e.g., will cause the phone to lock after 20 seconds being idle.  A \"Press & Hold to Unlock\" message appears after the scheduled time.BTW - This AUTO-LOCK feature has nothing to do with the VoiceMail problem with the same message, as some forum contributors would suggest.  Setting the AUTO-LOCK feature to NEVER does not eliminate the annoying Press & Hold to Unlock message during VoiceMail retrieval.Conclusion, were it not for these two complaints, I'd give the phone at least a 4-Star rating.  I'm stretching it at 2-Stars.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product but lousy speaker", "Author": "WebCamDude \"webcamdude\"", "ReviewID": "R1VA0AW55FGYIZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's a great little cellphone but it has one huge flaw.

We had been paying about $45 per month for her ATT cell phone, which she probably used three times per year for a total of less than 30 minutes.  She doesn't text and didn't have a data connection.  She decided to try doing without a phone for about three months and then became nervous about not having a phone if she had an emergency.  So that's why I got her this phone.  It has everything she needed, which admittedly isn't much, and triple minutes is a sweet deal.  What exceeded my expectations was that after buying 60 minutes (now 180), I expected they would expire in 90 days.  To my surprise, they're going to expire in a year and 90 days.  This might just be a mistake by Tracfone, but I like it.  I have a smartphone that I'm paying ATT $85 per month for with unlimited data and texting, but I only send and receive about 10 or 15 texts per month and use very little data, especially now that I have a Kindle Fire HDX that I use with my wireless router at home.  As soon as my contract expires, I'm going to get a Tracfone, too.  For my needs, I'm betting I can get away with only paying $20 per month or less.

In many ways I like most of it's features and feel the operating system is laid out better than on the Virgin Mobile LG Optimus for my type of use; and with it's smaller size, it fits nicely into my pants pocket.

The only thing missing is WiFi internet connection (which for me isn't a requirement) and internet browsing over the cell connection, while slow, is OK for occasional use. Haven't paired the phone with a bluetooth headset yet, but it easily connected to my laptop over the bluetooth contection. It  has software version V10e and a SIM for the T-Mobile network, for those who care about these.

Well to begin this LG 800G is not powered by android so no it does not have Google playstore it does have app's that my daughter doesn't use so I'm unfamiliar with that part, It is very small, One of the things I hate is the screen is kind of difficult when responding to your touch sometimes it bounces every where like it's crazy and you have to go back using the back/reverse arrow how ever I do like the fact I can send my daughter music ringtones (Which cost alot of minutes) how ever they do sound pretty good I also sent her wallpaper that looks great on her phone (ex..Minnie Mouse) that I downloaded to my phone first the video Is pretty standard so are the pictures the voice is pretty good better then my android phone the phone stays charged for a nice amount of time activation was simple for the first phone but it was very difficult for the second activation I i bought 2 of them one for my mother and one for my daughter, I like the fact the minutes do triple and for a 5yr.

Heard many reps all talking in the background, that and static made it very hard to communicate. This rep needed to pass info to other rep to complete process, rep very busy.

All I expect it to do is make and receive calls, and it does that well. However it has an annoying software bug that does not allow me to completely unlock the phone. I don't need to ever lock the phone, and I wanted to turn off that function, but it won't let me. Every time I need to answer a call or call voicemail, the unlock icon pops up and needs to be pressed and held first for several seconds. When calling voicemail, the timing has to be quick to hit unlock, then display the keypad, and then enter the password before the voicemail system times out and hangs up. This is very annoying and needs to be fixed.Update:I figured out that momentarily pressing the power button has the same effect as pressing and holding the unlock button. It makes the voicemail process a bit easier. I hope they will issue a new code revision that will allow completely unlocking the phone and get rid of the unlock button if the user doesn't want it. I use a Q-tip as a stylus for typing, and that works fine. The activation process was virtually instant with no problems transferring the minutes. I was impressed by that. Battery life is much longer than I expected. I'm now using it with a Jabra hands-free Bluetooth adapter in the car. Works great.

Some were a little scary to say the least, but I figured the cost and triple minutes benefit would be worth the risk.  Turns out I am very pleased with this phone.First, I knew it was not a 3G or 4G device and if that is what you want this is not the solution.  It is much more sophisticated than a flip phone and provides me with everything and maybe a little more than I want.  The sound is good and I have no problem getting a strong cell signal.  I did check to make sure I had the updated software version and followed another reviewers advice to change the graphics to a more adult look.  It works very well with the Bluetooth in my car although it was a bit of a challenge synching them, which might have been as much a problem with the car as the phone.If you are comfortable with an iPod or Kindle Fire, you should have no trouble using this phone.  I think most the negative reviews are from people that are not too computer literate.  The only glitch that I have found and others have mentioned it as well, is the lock button showing up even though I disabled it.  What I found is that if you touch the screen just above the icon, the phone is active and not in a locked position.  It's only a problem when faced with an answering system that requires numerical responses.  With practice I have been able to use it successfully in that situation.I primarily use it for a telephone, but it does offer easy texting and handwriting recognition, which is really nice when entering a new person in the address book.  I don't really use the camera feature, but it seems at least as good as my previous phone, although it does not have the quality of an actual camera.

The screen does take a little time to get use to as you actually have to put pressure on it to have it respond. One major flaw with the screen is if it is not in a protective case the phone can be unlocked by anything pushing against it. This means wasting minutes accidentally dialing someone from the recent calls log, etc. Sometimes the screen can also delay for a few seconds before it realizes you are trying to select something on the screen. This phone does have a basic internet browser for email, weather, news, etc. If you want to look up more than that, you may have trouble loading pages or images on a page. The browser does not support YouTube at all. I do not recommend this phone for the internet because it can become expensive to surf on at the current rate of .50 minutes to connect and .50 minutes every minute after that.A few of the good things for me are the camera, alarm, pic gallery with editing, games and apps, and music player with 3.5 mm headphone jack. The 2.0 megapixel camera takes pictures as good as my friends smartphone, and for less than $40. The alarm allows you to set specific days and times to wake up to, and saves each one with a screen toggle you can easily press on or off in a second. The pic gallery is good for a phone this price, especially with the amount of options for editing each picture. The games and apps have not been great for me, but the phone can run Java games and apps, so I just have to figure out how to download them to my computer and then to my phone. Buying games through the phone is expensive and does not offer a lot of choice for the categories offered. The music player on this phone has replace my cheap MP3 player I use to carry around. Sound quality is good with a pair of decent earphones, and it is easy to scroll through the music once you pick the artist, track, genre, or recently played menu options. There is also a shuffle that I have not tried yet.For the price of about $10 a month and less than $40 on the phone, this prepaid LG800G on the Tracfone network is definitely worth the money. It comes with triple minutes for the life of the phone, it has a touchscreen which is very popular these days, and the features included were more than I needed.

If you don't use the answering service then you can block out the numbers you do not want to answer and never hear the phone ring.  Just add the unwanted numbers to the what ever group you want to use to block or make your own group title like, junk.  Then, block the group you do not want to answer.You can only add 100 mp3 songs to each playlist, but acceptable.  You just have to make more playlist.  Eventhough, shuffle is on all the time I still have to turn on the shuffle each time I play a playlist.  If I don't turn on the shuffle each time I play a playlist shuffle will not work.The screen could be bigger for texting.  Having the virtual key board reduces the screen size a great deal. The key buttons are too small for me which cause me to mis type.  If you have smaller thumbs than myself then you might not have any problem.If you text alot you might want to look in to another phone or another prepaid company like h20.

I ordered the 4GIG SD memory card only to find out it didn't work in my phone.  I ordered the 2G and that worked fine.  Not sure why the 4 didn't work since so many others have stated theirs did.  I transferred my existing minutes from my older TF online rather than calling customer support, and those units showed up on the LG 800 in about 10 minutes. Had no issues with the transfer what so ever, just be sure you follow the instructions and type in the correct numbers given during the transfer process.  I seem to recall from years ago if you do your transfers via the web as opposed to customer support, the minutes and number are ported over much faster than using customer support.  I guess it's their way of encouraging the use of the web in order to free up CS for bigger issues.I like the look and feel of the phone, but considering I was upgrading from a Motorola C155...you could have put sprinkles on a turd and I would have been impressed.  The touch screen sensitivity is a non issue for me.  I had read another review online that if you use the tip of a pen or pencil when calibrating the touch screen, the results were much improved.  I went that route and find the sensitivity to be just fine.  The default look of the display is a bit childish looking, but you can quickly change the appearance to a more \"adult\" looking profile.  You can also upload your own photo and create the \"desktop\" of your choice.For those who want to use the security features, the default code on my phone was 0000.  After that, you are prompted to enter your new security code.  I like this feature and have mine set to lock immediately.  You can't access the main screen unless you know the security code.Overall, I'm very happy with this phone.

There was a discrepancy of over 850 minutes I didn't want to lose, so after spending a lot to time on line, I still had to call the 800 number and go through everything again with the customer service rep.

Waited a while longer, then went to my account online and went through a another long bizarre process of entering multiple sequences of numbers to activate the new phone. When I finally succeeded, the number and all the minutes were indeed transferred. However, the date on this LG 800G is exactly one month ahead of today's date.

Another 45 minutes on the phone with a different customer service representative yielded no answer to the problem except that I should wait and see if it self corrects in a few days. . . She asked if I had been traveling through different time zones with the phone recently which could have caused it to re-set the time. But I explained that the time is not the issue. The time of day is correct. It is the DATE that is set exactly one month ahead. Problem not resolved. What I think this means is that I am probably losing a month of service time, but I could not seem to convey that concern to the TracFone rep, who consulted with her supervisor multiple times during the course of the conversation, and in the end came up with no plausible explanation or resolution.In summation, I like the phone and its features, and the order placed through Amazon.com was processed and delivered very quickly. But the date (day and month) on the new LG 800G is wrong, and the activation process and support was unsatisfactory when transferring unused TracFone minutes and an existing number from an old phone to the new one.UPDATE: Online research (through Google) revealed that several others in phone discussion groups had the identical wrong date problem on the LG 800G. One individual suggested removing the battery from the phone for a while. Today the date had rolled up to Saturday, September 22 when it was actually Wednesday, August 22, so I figured I had nothing to lose. I tried that suggestion and it worked! The phone date is now correct.

For $20, it's a good deal--triple minutes, a camera, MP3, and more. The camera's ok if you want to snapshot some memories, but really you won't want to use it for nicer pictures at all. It's only 2.0 megapixels and is blurry, and the video is even worse. Also, the MP3 player isn't anything fancy, and you have to have a mini 4GB SD card.Now the touch screen on my mom's, which we got in May, isn't working well--you have to push hard with your thumb and it takes a second or two to load what you pressed, usually. Dad's (from June) works a lot better though, and the touch screen is smooth and semi-light presses work fine and faster. I think this may be because the screen protector on her phone is old (since May we haven't changed it).Also, there are some really pretty cases you can get cheap on eBay or Amazon; $5-10 usually, or maybe sometimes cheaper for the plain rubber ones.One other problem is that the screen automatically locks when you call somebody, and the only physical buttons on the front for options/commands are the green call button, the red end button, and the back button; so if you are in a call and need to punch numbers in for a voicemail or one of those automated machines (for customer service or something) you need to tap the power button or press the screen to unlock it first, and you need to do it every time you need to press the screen, since it automatically re-locks itself.Overall, I think this was worth it and is lasting us a good while.

Olson", "ReviewID": "R1KTPNFAXQZQUJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have used this phone for a year.  Definitely easier to text with this phone than with a flip phone - you get a full digital QWERTY keyboard.  But for entering contacts, you STILL have to use the keypad with \"abc\" \"def\" etc, so it takes forever to add info.  You can do some web browsing -- you can download some apps, such as google maps.  And I used my phone to look things up on the web occasionally (such as a phone number or address of a restaurant), but it is a difficult interface to read and scroll (as compared to a smartphone).  Some things that really annoyed me about this phone:  the on/off button on top did not work well, even when the phone was brand new, so I mostly left it on all the time.  If I turned it off in a movie theater or whatever, I would have to press the on/off button multiple times to get the phone to turn off and then the same to turn it on again; sometimes I would even have to remove the battery and put it back in before I could get the phone to turn back on.  Such a pain.  And then after using it for a few months, it started turning off by itself!  So I would go for hours thinking my phone was on, then get it out to make a call and find that it was off (unknowingly missing calls and texts).  And then, as I mentioned, it was not easy to get it back on.  And even though I don't use my phone much, after a year of light use, the battery completely drains within a day or so even when it is mostly on standby, so I have to recharge it a lot.  Finally, when I received a text, I often did not even notice because the phone gives off one quiet beep and that's it. No repeat, just one little beep.  I found no way to adjust the text alert volume (the call ring volume can be easily adjusted with buttons on the side of the phone).  So I was missing a lot of texts - not finding them until hours after the fact, which was pretty annoying, and even made me miss out on things.

It at least does what it's supposed to do. Nothing wrong there.Let's start with the hardware. This is probably the lowest point of this phone, the fact that it isn't particularly exiting. Don't get me wrong, it's not made of aluminum or something, it's basically a thin plastic, easily collects scratches and scuffs. On the face of the phone are three physical buttons that are very sensitive. So, from having the phone in your pocket, buttons are pressed and it turns the screen on, which uses some of your battery, but that isn't such an issue because the battery is fantastic. It's called an Eight-Day battery, basically if the phone sits around and is barely used, it can last up to eight days on a single charge, which is pretty impressive. The screen is plastic, it's pretty much a Nintendo DS resistive touchscreen, which wouldn't be a problem if it was at least a good screen, which it isn't. A resistive touchscreen is made of two sheets of plastic with a gap of air in between, so it makes a trigger when those two sheets meet. Sadly, that gap is a bit too deep, so you really need to jam your thumb into the screen to do anything. Well, if you use your thumb, the resistive touchscreen isn't ideal for your thumb, but the 800 G doesn't doesn't come with a stylus or a slot for one, so just have one in your pocket because you'll really need it. The screen on the 800 g reminds me of early touch phones from 2006, one of the worst I've ever used. Just leaving your finger idle on the app screen makes it jerk around, and if you're scrolling through a menu, you try to hit something and it slides around. Dialing a number with the screen is also annoying because you'll be hitting numbers by accident a lot. It's also just so dimwitted and slow in general, you really can't move too fast or else the screen can't keep up with your actions.Now for the software. The 800 G has pretty decent calling quality, no complaints there. The one problem I had is with the internet browser, it's awful! Not only is it slow, but combined with the jerky touchscreen, it is one of the most face-palming mobile web experiences on any phone I have ever used. Even the worst of minute phones have a browser that is functional, this doesn't! Seriously, this isn't a phone for the web. Don't waste your time. For MP3's, this phone loads all songs from a micro SD slot behind the battery. The slot itself is this goofy, sliding, snapping thingy that holds the card, but sadly I never got the phone to read any of my cards, so I can't tell you much about the music part, or extra storage for that matter. Camera isn't too special, bad with lighting, and the video quality is atrocious as well. The screen button on top of the phone doesn't always respond. It can take up to a few seconds for the screen to unlock upon hitting the button once. Also, since the phone is so dimwitted and slow as I mentioned before, you can literally hit the button a bunch of times, and the screen will stay off as it rapidly makes that unlocking clicky sound as many times as you hit the button.I'm sorry if this review is sort of all over the place, but in a nutshell, the screen ruins the phone. If you have a crappy touchscreen on a phone that relies solely on a touchscreen, what you are left with is a phone that literally makes dialing a number or scrolling through contact lists more difficult that what it needs to be. I didn't even mention the texting. Just don't, please!Tracfone Samsung Slider Triple MinutesThis is the Tracfone you would rather have, it's called the Samsung slider, and it has buttons, no touchscreen crap here. It seems to be faster than the 800 g as well. If you're interested in prepaid phones, you might want to give this one a look.

The phone lets me know how many minutes I have left and how many days I have left to use these minutes. It is easy to add minutes.  I've had my phone for a month now and enjoyed good reception.  I also like the fact that I can use this phone to text and email whereas with my Sprint plan I would have to have a more expensive plan to text and search the web. I will save more than 60% a month compared to what I was paying my previous provider.  I love the savings and I still have a cell phone to use when I am away from home.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Deal Ever", "Author": "ReviewMan", "ReviewID": "RVF0EUQHK1RP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...

It is poorly designed and although it works and I use it I am constantly disappointed in its limitations and lack of features or the inability to even find out what features there are. It spends the majority of its time on Roam even I am in range of the zip I set it on. It says I have No Service when I have 4 bars. It rings when it is on silent mode and I can't stop it. Unlike old tracfones, you can't easily choose a ringtone for the function you want. It goes into \"lock mode\" when you're making a call and then you have unlock and hit dialpad to punch in an option or code option. Annoying! The \"browser\" gets activated way too easily (I have no idea how) and you lose minutes by it begin connected and subsequently I have never used the internet function. It's hard to turn on and off and sometimes it turns itself off when you're texting or making a call for no apparent reason. You can't turn the GPS function off. The camera is very poor and takes dark photos (forget indoor photos without bright lights). Voice quality, volume and clarity are mediocre. I use this mostly to keep in touch with my college age kids through texting. The texting works, but the keyboard characters are limited and awkward. I had to buy a car charger and screen cover separately and have never gotten a usb cord (haven't tried) so that I could get photos off the phone and onto the computer. I'd love a smartfone, but don't want a plan. On the up side, I do like the triple minutes and it allows me to go for quite a while. This was my first step up to a digital phone. I know now why these were on sale from $49.

Looking on Amazon, I located this LG phone which we know is a good brand from experience with it. This particular phone turned out to be a real bargain. Reduced in price, but not in quality. The icons are large, the font size in contacts and other features is plenty large. Everything about it seems to be perfect for an older person. The Triple Minutes feature was perfect, too. I had a $20 60-minute card from the local grocery and it made the amount become 180 minutes and it's nearly six months in time. Perfect for someone who really needs it mostly for an emergency or when he might be running late to something. Or, if he needs to call the doctor's office. Definitely recommend it for a friend. Has lots of features he may not use, but then, who knows, he may find it fun to play with the camera, which also does video. There's a voice recorder, an alarm, calculator, heck it's got lots of things! Don't remember the description saying, but it does come with a home charger and the instructions are really good, especially when compared to most other electronics you might by on sale.

It's easy to put your contact in. Does have internet, does take memory card. You can have it to lock or not to lock at all. I put it on do not lock but it does lock and it's easy to unlock all you have to do is hold the lock and it will unlock. There is away to get around the lock. If you push the top button it will take you to your home screen with out being locked. Also if you are getting a call you can hit send without pushing the lock to unlock the phone also works when you end the call, just push end. You have different ringtones which are great there are some nice ones on there. Also has picture id as well as caller id & ring tone. I have this phone set to where it will show who is calling with their name & picture. When you put their contact info in the phone hit edit and add a photo also make sure you click the ringtone and give them a ringtone or it will not have a ringtone and will not ring.

However, the phone is a pain in the neck, even compared to outdated mid-2000s phones:When you make or take a call, the screen immediately locks. For example, if you are at an automated switchboard and need to press a number, you must press and hold the unlock icon or press the gray button on top, then hit 'Dialpad', then hit the number. This takes a few seconds and you can't turn the 'feature' off, so if the switchboard times out before you hit the button you're SOL. Also, you have to go through the unlock process every time you have to hit another digit later on. It would be easier if it wouldn't lock and you spaced the phone away from your cheek but you can't turn off the auto-lock.To access voicemail, you have to go into dialpad mode and hold \"1.\" No clear sign of an icon which can be simply tapped.Turning on vibrate mode is unnecessarily complex. Unlike with Motorola phones, vibrate mode is not always part of the volume spectrum. Instead, you must load a 'profile' which provides vibrate.The phone will occasionally crash which will require power-cycling to fix.When fully charged, a message will show up the phone's screen suggesting it be unplugged to conserve power. Skeptical, I left it plugged-in and measured its power draw with a wattage meter. It didn't even register as 1 watt, less than a night-light, so the power conservation idea is quite moot. Even if left plugged in for a year, I can't see more than a cent or two wasted in electricity- probably less than that. Not worth the trouble.The manual which comes with it is not complete which means you will likely be searching the net to figure things out.

The phone could be off in my pocket, in my phone case, talking on and while I am talking you see the police flash on the screen. Tracfone let me transfer my minutes and phone number.

I am not a frequent user but I like to have a phone on me if my wife calls or if I need to text my daughter, nothing like getting home and finding out someone needed something.

I ordered this one from amazon for the triple minutes for life but returned it without activating it, because of the problems I had with the first one.  Perhaps the one I got from tracfone was buggy.  I had problems setting up voicemail. and touch screen was slow to respond. occasionally the screen would freeze, and I would turn off phone and restart it,  and then it would work.  I  kept accessing the browser by accident, until I found out how to remove the browser icon from the home screen, highly recommend doing this. otherwise will loose minutes.  overall I found this phone not very user friendly.  I'm finding the newer model( that I purchased from Amazon) much easier to set up and use, touch screen better, very pleased with newer model.  This model is less than half the price, though, , and ok for making basic phone calls.  at first I could not figure out how to access the dial pad during a call.  the dial pad would disappear once the phone call started and 4 odd icons showed up at the bottom of the screen.  You have to unlock the screen again and then more icons show up, including the one for the dial pad.  One frustrating thing about this phone, the screen would lock during use,  requiring freq. unlocking while using it. program would still work but I would have to unlock the screen anytime I wanted to access other options.  on the newer model the screen does not lock while program is running.  dial pad icon is visible without having to do anything else. much easier to use. touch screen is larger and more responsive.  and browser icon is not on home page.  I found this model frustrating to use,  much prefer the newer model. well worth the additional cost. and Amazon has great deals.  I still love my LG840 phone, highly recommend that model.UPDATEStay away from this one. I kept it and have had it on airplane mode, just using it for it's stopwatch app. but it will not hold a charge. I do not use it very much and every time I turn it on the battery is dead.  the latest time,  I charged it and the next day  it was dead again. with no use of it at all.am not able to use it at all. for anything, is total waste of money.

Fast forward 4 months later(Mar. '13) & while I was visiting family out of state, it completely stopped working by not accepting my touch on the screen. I do not remember anything out of the ordinary that would have brought this on. I talked to a friend and hung up & placed the phone back in my purse. An hour later, I wanted to look at a new text I received & I was unable to. The phone apparently could receive a call from a phone number and because of the buttons(Send/End) I was able to answer. As well as call the phone number of the last number that contacted my phone through this buttons. The alarm still works as well & I am able to press the Send/End buttons for off or snooze, but unable to go into the Menu to turn it off or change to time. The only solution is to turn the phone completely off. I had searched online for various ways to correct this matter and still keep the phone, to no avail. I then found out that as well as not being able to go into the Menu because of the touch feature not working, there is not a way to go to the 'prepaid' option and retrieve the 'parameter number' to transfer the number to another Trac fone( I bought out of town just to have a phone) & have to call and deal with a representative that I feel has been outsourced to another country.

It often misses letters because you have to apply enough pressure to each letter for the phone to register it. This drove me nuts.

(Someone said there is an upgrade to this phone now that uses 3G technology and that the web is easier and faster.model 840G???) The phone also has a tendency to default to the web browser if you bump the phone for any reason...the result is your accidentally burning up precious expensive minutes when you don't realize it.  You have to make sure when you're finished using the phone that it goes to the security screen BEFORE you touch any buttons.

This last time it stayed frozen for an entire day and I had to remove the battery to resuscitate it.  I used to do this with my Blackberry.  So it wasn't a big deal but LG800G's back cover was very difficult to put on or remove so the process was very frustrating.  Because I have bought a rubber protective cover so now I just kept the back cover off to make it ease to access the battery as I expect removing the battery may happen more often than not.  It certainly is not a top of the line cell phone. But the price is right.  I paid $29 for it but it is only $25 now.

Had to go with 3 stars because of the following:It's hard to talk much about the 800G's features, as I can't get signal on it most of the time, and when I do it's roaming. (Even outdoors I don't always get signal!) Since it's roaming, I can't access the internet/browser, which was kind of the point of getting this model. I spent a lot of time on my home phone with a very helpful Tracfone person today, and she ended up having to send me a different model (LG 505C) as a replacement. The 800G doesn't work where I am without roaming, it seems. And I'm not in a really rural area; the University of South Dakota is just a few blocks away. (There's an ATT tower less than a mile away, though, which is apparently the problem.) I can send and receive calls, just no internet.On the plus side, Tracfone was great about figuring out the problem and sending a replacement, even though it wasn't ordered from their site. On the minus side, it'll take 3-5 days to get here, but since that one is the same price on their site as it is here on Amazon, and was more expensive, I'm okay with waiting. (Tracfone sells the 800G for my zip code on their website, but apparently even it doesn't work in my particular part of my zip code.)

It's not automated for you (you have to enter special codes into the phone and type in the results to a web page), but at least you don't have to talk to a customer service agent.Unfortunately, it sometimes does not work properly. In my case, I had over 2400 minutes on my phone, but the code entry process said I had only 140.So I called Tracfone customer support. They predicted a wait of over thirty minutes, so I accepted their offer to have them call me back. That is a nice feature.When the customer service representative called, the first thing he did was have me repeat the code entry process that I had already performed to determine the number of minutes. Needless to day, the result was the same, and he confidently announced that he would transfer 140 minutes to my new phone. I objected, and he said he would have to check with another department to verify my claim of 2400+ minutes. This took about 20 minutes!Finally, he said that he was authorized to transfer a certain number of minutes, which was 15 minutes less than it should have been. I decided not to argue at that point, since he seemed unable to do more. The actual transfer took about 5 or 10 minutes more. At all times, the customer service agent was polite. I have no complaints there.The next day I used the Tracfone web site to send email in which I complained about the missing 15 minutes. I think they tried to call me, but I was not available, so they sent email asking me to call customer service. I did not want to do that, so I replied in email asking for the 15 minutes.

They are so buggy and hard to use that it's no fun to use. For one, the video capture is about as bad as it gets. You might as well see two pixels on the screen dancing around, the video capture is so small and choppy. The snapshots are pretty bad, as well. There is no detail in them. Then there's the touch screen. It's unresponsive and doesn't detect subtle touches. The phone is also too under-powered to have sliding screens; that just makes things tedious.But the worst thing for me is the music playing abilities. [Actually, it does have playlist creation. You have to do it manually, dragging stuff on the unresponsive touchscreen] And it's fine that it doesn't support superior codecs like vorbis, but at least it supports aac in an mp4/m4a container. The problem is the data transfer scheme itself is very weak and buggy. When you copy files to the SD card through a micro usb cable, it tends to make you believe it copied them fast, but then they don't play back; that's because some songs didn't copy and there's 0 bits to those files. Alternatively, some files are truncated. This is the reason I thought there was a bug in mp3 playback, but it's just the files not copying completely. If it's the fault of the SD card I wouldn't know what else to do since it's a class 10 microSD card, and I suspect copying directly to it would be no problem, but since you have to take the phone apart for that, that's not a good option for regular use. I'm still not sure what the problem with the phone is when transferring, but I just keep on re-plugging it in and copying the files until they copy correctly. The data transfer scheme is also very unstable in that it's prone to cause file system errors if you use a flimsy cable. I used one of those self winding cables and apparently this caused the SD card to become read only and had to re-format it.Overall it leaves a lot to be desired, but you get what you pay for.

In reading the reviews here, I decided to try the Samsung S390G, and ordered it last week from Amazon.

It's not an iphone or a droid . . . but if you don't want to pay hundreds for a phone and then keep on shelling out the cash for a contract, this is a great option.  I don't use a cell phone much, so a prepaid phone makes sense for me.  Problem was, with previous phones I used the phones so little that I would end up having my minutes expire, the battery drain, forget what I did with it, etc., so that those times I needed it I couldn't use it.  But this phone has enough interesting features to make me want to keep it with me all the time with the battery charged.  And the home screen lets me know when minutes are going to expire.  The camera is a \"phone camera\" so it's not fabulous, but it's good enough to capture a memory or document something for future reference - it's much better than I expected in a phone of this price.  The MP3 player has good sound.  It has an equalizer - though not a very sophisticated one.  The notepad app lets you input with handwriting (hasn't worked well for me) with a virtual phone keypad, or a virtual keyboard.  The screen is just large enough for me to use the virtual keyboard effectively.  You can add other J2ME apps to it as well - there's nothing close to the number of apps available on a droid or an iphone, but there are a significant number of them out there.  I was able to connect to my computer with a microUSB cable (not supplied with the phone, btw) and with bluetooth without trouble.  The touchscreen is fairly bright, has good contrast, and is quite responsive to my finger or, for more precision, my fingernail.  The phone's sound quality is pretty good.  Sometimes a bit slow to wake up when the screen has been locked for a long time. There are comments about the battery cover coming off - it does seem a little easy to bump it off, but not horrible.  I bought a cheap gel skin for a few bucks and that solves the problem.  Triple minutes are nice.  Works with a 4Gig memory card - developer web site says it can do up to 8, but I got the impression from other reviews that 4 was the limit.

And it's not only the phone but the Tracfone service that is not up to snuff.  First off the phone has a feature that is a real deal breaker.  When you dial the phone locks up and you have to press a button to unlock it (by design) and it cannot be changed.  So if you reach a voice mail for instance that requires you enter a number to choose where you need the voice mail system to take you next, you have to press the unlock button and hope the voice mail doesn't time-out before you get there.  And it always locks up within a second or two after you hit the call button.  There is absolutely no way to overcome the design glich.  (you can google for yourself and see all the complaints about this feature).  What's more tracfone has reduced the services available for this phone since I purchased it last year.  No longer are you able to read the news as those links were removed earlier this year without notice.  Plus whenever you try to log on to a known site like ebay or yahoo it takes forever to log on to the site or times out prior to ever getting a response.

In the past I have bought replacement phones and transferred the phone number and prepaid minutes, usually without incidence. Every once in a while I would have to call Customer Service and they could fix the problem or send a new sim card. Over the years it was getting harder to get to a \"real\" person, but tracfone has now made it impossible.I bought this phone to replace my husband's worn out one. I went to my tracfone account and did the transfer. Everything looked like it was going fine until I got to the last page. Then I get an error occurred message and to call tracfone, with their number posted. I called and got a message that they could not do anything as a request was already being processed for the phone, to leave the phone on and call back in 15 minutes if the phone wasn't working. Of course 15 minutes passed and nothing so I call again, figuring now I would get a real person, but no, I get the same message. This went on for 2 days. I tried everything to get a person: not pressing any buttons, pressing numerous buttons, trying other departments, nothing. I go back online and see there are \"updates pending\". Basically, I had to reprogram the phone, yet, it still wouldn't work. The new phone showed that the phone number, minutes and activation dates all transferred but still wouldn't allow any incoming or outgoing calls or messages, emergency phone calls only.Tried tracfone again.Same song and dance. Went to their website to see where to complain and found a support forum where others were having the same problem. I posted and a tracfone employee contacted me and still wouldn't let me talk to a \"real\" person on the phone, had to go to a private chat room through a private link. Well this employee couldn't help me either as tracfone showed, on their end, that the phone was working. So I finally got another phone number to call to get a real person and was given an access code to be able to get a real person.So I call and after being on the phone for an hour checking everything, they were stumped and was told to call back the next day as I had to talk to another department that wasn't open at the time. Called the next day, and didn't get to talk to the other dept. because this customer service rep told me I'd need a new sim card and I would have it in 2-3 days. That was 10 days ago and still no sim card, no service, nothing.Tracfone's service is fine. However, if you ever need customer service, forget it. When the next tracfone needs to be replaced, I will look to another prepaid company, as this is not worth the hassle.

The LG 800G is so cheap that it might as well be free. I don't even use it as a phone, except for calling 911, which costs nothing (it doesn't have to be activated to do that.) I use the 800G to record videos, take pictures, record audio, play games, tell time, set an alarm, and do about a thousand other neat tricks. Instructions are sorely lacking for this slick gadget, so learning how to use it can be aggravating. You will need to surf the Net for better instructions than are included. To recap, for $12 postpaid you get an emergency (911) phone, camera, voice recorder, camcorder, game machine, music player, image editor, calendar, alarm, clock, calculator, and many other gizmos built into one. BUY IT, IT COSTS A WHOPPING $12 COUNTING SHIPPING! It is worth many times that amount for the video recorder alone, which produces surprisingly decent quality videos, which you can even upload to Youtube!

I bought it after my LG500G suddenly stopped working and thought this would be an upgrade(especially because of the triple minutes)...I was missing the LG500G immediately when I started using this phone. It is much harder to text on this phone because it's so easy to hit the wrong letter, and the lock screen took a while to get used to.  The only major annoyance I had with the 500G (my old phone) was that it was easy to accidentally go on the web. This one is much more complicated.  However, my biggest issue is problems with texting...I am wondering if I ended up with a \"lemon\". My house does not always have great reception, but my husband's tracfone LG500G rarely gives him a problem.  Most of the time my texts will not go through unless I hit send when my LG800G is by a certain window in my house...even then, it takes a little while and does not always work.  Since this is not the case with my husband's tracfone it seems to be a phone model issue rather than the tracfone service itself.  I have tolerated this phone, but the last straw that lead me to write this review happened yesterday after hurricane sandy...I know there can be issues with events like this, but no one else I know of can't even text...I have not been able to send or receive texts, my phone says I have voicemail, but wont let me check it.  It says emergency calls only when I try to call out (i have gotten that message on occasion when there was no emergency too). What good is a cell phone when you can't use it in a situation like this...especially when land lines are down! I went to Target today and saw a daughter showing this phone to her mother with the hopes of getting it...this is one situation where I opened my mouth because I would have felt bad if I didn't had she bought the phone with high hopes.

I bought one in February of this year, and I tested it to make sure that it had coverage in the two main places I planned to use it, and on the drive in between, before I went ahead and bought my husband the same model, two months later. The coverage was worse in the SF Bay Area than it was up in Mendocino, but we kept our home landline, and the coverage up north was fantastic, so other than a couple of weird design issues (the screen locks very quickly when you're trying to retrieve voicemails, you can't download pictures, etc.), we were okay with the phones...until yesterday. When I tried to use the phone in Mendocino the last two days, I got three bars indicating I had coverage, but a \"No Service\" error message. Suddenly, we couldn't even send texts! My husband had the same problem, and a neighbor there did, too. I spent close to an hour on customer service, and they told me that my setup zip code was the only area where I could expect service! If I wanted to change the setup zip code to the Mendocino address, I would be required to accept a crummy \"new\" (no longer for sale) LG 501c phone that has double minutes instead of triple and a completely different design. I'm fighting that, as it is a total bait and switch, and I have a ton of data to transfer. They told me there is no coverage in Mendocino for my phone. I think they decided not to renew the contract with the signal provider there, and to go with a different one. I'm heading for 60, and I don't feel safe driving between these two places if I don't have decent coverage. I plan to make one more call, to the tech service center somewhere here in the US when they open in the morning, but I don't have high hopes. What a ripoff!Update: Having read the reviews for the two telephones they offered as a replacement for this one, I decided not to switch. Instead, I got a landline in Mendocino.

It was one of the few Tracfone options which came with triple lifetime minutes, which I needed to make her budget work.It's hard for her to use. Scrolling through the address book (even one with only a few dozen entries) is exceptionally difficult, and slow.  We bought a stylus and that helped, a little.The screen locks immediately during a call. This is a feature to prevent the touch screen from registering any action while a call is in progress. This includes calls to voicemail, which require you to.... press the virtual number pad (on the screen) to perform various messaging actions.  So the end result is an awkward dance of holding the phone to your ear to hear the voice prompts and then pulling it away to unlock the screen to show the dialpad to press the number, all before you run out of time.There are a few 'screen lock' options and being a technical person I tried them all. None of the options prevent the screen lock.On the positive side, you can place and receive calls, so it does perform the basic function of a phone.This is likely a reasonable phone for someone who is moderately technically savvy.

Their answers were all scripted and automated, I seriously felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.  Whenever I made a comment or asked them a question that wasn't on their script (like \"how do I find my phone number\"), there was complete silence on the other side. They couldn't even find my phone even after giving them my number and my serial number, so then I submitted a ticket on Facebook since their online help wasn't working.  I got a reply stating that because I purchased a bundle (800 mins w/ double mins for life), I couldn't get my triple minutes.  I read on some forums that I wouldn't get the double minutes on top of my triple minutes, which I was fine with.  But don't you think I should have gotten at least one of them?

The price on the phone was very competitive and it came with many extras, however, getting the phone activated and deactivating my old phone was not easy. I had to make many calls to their service department because I was not receiving the triple minutes and there was no record of my phone in their system. It took numerous calls before the problem was corrected.At first I liked the phone because of the many features, however, it wasn't long before there were issues with the phone after the 30 day warranty had expired. My calls would drop out for no apparent reason and there was an echo that the other person could hear on their phones. Even though the phone was not set to vibrate, often it would feel as though something was moving around inside the phone, then the call would drop out. Tracfone tech persons could not explain why this was happening. It was also a pain to transfer photos from the phone to my computer. I finally had to buy a USB adapter to transfer the photos.Finally after seven months, I've had enough of this phone and have just purchased an LG 840G phone for much less than Tracfone is selling them for. I hope the 840G will prove to be a better phone than the 800G model. Tracfone has some of the worst service people I've had to deal with and many of them speak poor English, which makes the situation even worse.While there have been many satisfied users of the LG 800G phone, I am not one of them.

The auto lock mode, regardless of settings, constantly requires you to hold the screen for 2 or 3 seconds first to do the simplest things.Even with a 4GB card in it and set with EXTERNAL MEMORY as preferred, it still saves everything to the internal memory and requires you to manually transfer anything you do/take to the external memory.On the plus side, Bluetooth and the USB work, though I'm kind of annoyed they used a proprietary mini USB port.Be aware, however, that Tracfone goes out of their way to mislead concerning minutes and bonus time with triple minutes and promotional offers.

I purchased the LG800G at Walmart in Reno, NV, hoping to renew my service before flying home so as to be able to communicate with my wife about pick-up at the airport, etc.: not only did that NOT happen, I embarked on a weeks-long journey of frustration with what TracFone calls their \"customer service.\" I don't know how else to explain except to give you a play-by-play of what I went through, but suffice it to say that my family will be switching from TracFone as soon as it is feasible....It turned out that the phone I bought in NV couldn't be turned on because my home address is South Dakota, and they don't sell the LG800G in SD (never mind that it has nation-wide coverage--don't even ask about that). I had to call customer service to figure out why the phone wouldn't turn on, which meant that I waited 20 minutes for a human being to answer. When I explained the problem, he said that he'd send me another phone that would work in SD, but only after taking all of my personal info, multiple times, so that the call ended up being 44 minutes long. My replacement phone would be shipped by regular mail, which also irked me, and I could expect it in 1-2 weeks. Two weeks passed: no phone. I call TracFone, again, and I again wait about 20 minutes to get a human. They had no record of my earlier call; I asked for the manager; she found the earlier call and told me that the phone hadn't been shipped because the shipping address wasn't verified; I pointed out that they'd never emailed or called me to let me know; she didn't care. She restarted the replacement shipment and (due to my complaining) shipped it faster via FedEx. I asked her about some form of compensation for all of the time waiting for a working phone (3 weeks, at that point) and talking on the phone to them (44 minutes for the first call, then 1 hr. and 8 minutes for the second); she said that she could offer 100 minutes; I laughed; she said that she could offer 200 minutes. I asked to speak to her manager. It turns out that the people who will help you are in Guatemala City, Guatemala, and they really don't have any experience using either the products or the company, and they have no idea what normal expectations would be for the average American user of a product like this. I live and work overseas, teaching English to non-native English speakers, so I have some sympathy for their situation, but they really speak poorly, and they have no common ground to even understand what the average customer is calling about.The phone arrived, but it was a different model (LG501C), which is cheaper and crappier, but no refund or discount or free minutes, etc. Also, my original phone had 3X minutes; this one had 2X minutes. I called customer service to ask about all of this; after waiting 10 minutes (this was supposed to be the \"direct line\" for my follow-up calls) I was told (in an unbelievably difficult accent) that the first phone wouldn't work, so they sent me one that would, and if it's cheaper, well, whatever. I was also told that I should have checked online that the phone would be connectable at my zip code, even though I was shopping at Walmart, i.e., it's apparently all my fault ... so, tough.I wrote a complaint at the TracFone site: the same Guatemala City call center called me to basically summarize the problem for me ... again ... and to offer free minutes as a gesture of good will: 10 minutes, this time. It was another pointless 30+ minute conversation with someone whose English was bad, who was reading from a script, and who really had no means of being able to relate to the issue beyond what she'd been told to say.I'm returning the 2nd phone to TracFone, at their expense. I'm returning the first phone to Walmart. I'll buy the cheapest TracFone I can get at that Walmart so as to use up my 1400+ remaining minutes, then I'll NEVER have anything to do with TracFone, again.

After another hour on the phone with them I am just amazed that this is my fault! I was actually told that I should have informed the customer service rep that I will need to reenroll my phone in the same plan it was already enrolled in, when they swapped over to the new phone. I informed her that at no time was I made aware that upgrading a Tracfone was also a cancelation of current phone plan. Of cource I could re-enroll right now however since my wifes phone had already gotten her minutes I would have to pay the full months value plan charges as well as what was already charged to my account for just my wifes phone --oh and she will not get any more minutes since she already recieved hers this month....
