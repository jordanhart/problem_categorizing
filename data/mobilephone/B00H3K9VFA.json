Has a smooth performance and operates at an excellent pace, the dual sim capabilities work flawlessly...and I could probably go on but other reviews have already explained all of its GREAT features.I just want to let any interested buyers know that the wifi keeps dropping in and out every couple 2-3 minutes or even 30-40 seconds (and I mean EVERY), but apparently that seems to be a widespread issue with both S4s and the S4 minis based on numerous results I found on the internet. However there are a number of successful solutions, but unfortunately none have worked for me as yet. I will say though that I have been bearing with it, because it only presents a challenge when I am trying to download or upload a file that takes more than a minute to process, but for other functions such as chatting and browsing the internet, it doesn't pose that much of a problem....but its honestly really annoying.Overall I love this phone, its my dream phone( and I am serious, I told God I wanted a phone with these features probably 2-3 years ago...lol), and I would have given it a 5 star rating if not for the wifi issue. So if you plan on using a data package consistently, this is the ideal phone for you :)O and btw I use my phone to the max(listening to music,video taping, chatting,even as a flash light in dark places lol...and for numerous other purposes) so my battery only lasts me 7-8 hours of full functionality, so I will be getting an extended battery and I recommend any interested buyers to budget for one, because believe me when I say, this phone can be used for almost any and everything, it is truly a \"Life Companion\" :)", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "An amazing phone!", "Author": "CJ", "ReviewID": "R2CVF5W3AYUTDI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing but ... I am with T-Mobile and the internet and apps are very slow when I am hooked to their network, however when I hook up to wi-fi the video's and internet are very quick. This isn't the phone's fault, it's either T-Mobile or our metal roof interfering with the signal. I gave it 4 stars because I am somewhat disappointed that it doesn't have a LED to alert me to new messages or emails although it will play a sound. It also has nothing to alert me when the phone is fully charged after being plugged in. I was unable to find accessories for it locally as far as cases and sleeves but I was able to find them on Amazon at very reasonable prices.

Continuous shot, panoramicWhite is a stunning colour.Very durable. There was a stress test/drop test video on youtube: \"Always On - Is the S4 Mini a knockout\"Reasonable battery life, last about a day and half before needing full recharge. This is with power saver on, wifi on continuously and moderate usage.Can be used with a stylus.Dozen of useful apps. Runs on 4.22 Android, thats an os that is newer than those on the Grand and the Note.Comes with 5 gb internal memory, but system uses about 2gb.Phone works in the Caribbean and West IndiesVery light, only the case makes it a bit heavier.ConsThese cons will more be beneficial to those coming from blackberry.The Logs:The phone does not have a call log only, it groups all the logs in one place, so finding your last place call after sending a dozen text messages takes a lot long.Sim needs to be cut:It is dual sim yes. But micro sim required. If you are switching, YOU HAVE TO CUT YOUR SIM card.Lags:As with all smart phones, I have come to realise, it sticks sometimes. Not for long, but there were a couple times when I had to force reset it.Can not turn off:Unlike blackberry which has an auto on auto off feature, this phone once you turn it off it is out cold. even if an alarm is set, it will not turn back on. As such you have to keep it on continuously, and possibly download an app that turns off the wifi, and mobile data at certain hours.Speakers are not as loud as blackberry.Has no front leds.

Also, the phone's \"activity\" combines calls and text messages together, and despite lenghty efforts I could not separate it into just calls and just text messages.

Now both India and the US are telling me they do not sell the phone and won't fix it and they won't tell me what Samsung site I should go through. On the box it says made in China, I do not speak Chinese and the Chinese site does not have a English option, just because it was made in China does not mean sold from China so that could be a dead end anyway. This phone was a total waste of money. This is horrible customer service, I am sure in one of the interactions I had they probably could have looked up where I should go based on the serial number and helped me with the Chinese service if that is truly where I needed to go. I will probably avoid Samsung in the future. The Motorola Moto G I got to replace it performs much better and is a significantly lower price.The phone reboots and locks up randomly. It can go for days without a problem then it may reboot once every couple of minutes over and over again. On some posts I noticed Samsung would do a complementary replacement of the motherboard on phones with this issue. Samsung is not taking responsibility, they said it is not a US phone so I need to contact support in the country I bought it from (I bought it in the US from Amazon). I found that India sells this model so I contacted them and they said I have to contact Samsung US even though I said in the inquiry to them Samsung US would not help me. Since then I have found WalMart in the US is selling this model. I guess the moral of the story is stay away from international phones unless you really need a international phone. I bought this because it was available first, probably should have waited. There are battery bloating issues and SD card issues that might cause this, I ruled both out so I beleive I am just stuck with a defective phone. The first day I noticed this but then it went away after a hour or so, assumed the software just needed to be up to date, it was not a problem again until after a month or so passed so the Amazon 30 day return had passed.

More importantly, DON'T get locked into a two year contract and over-pay hundreds of dollars. BUY THE PHONE YOU LIKE, then choose the service that fits your needs, Better yet, for $20 take your 'old' number and port it to Google Voice, then forward that number to your 'new' smart phone... so features like text messages of your voicemails become active. But mainly, buy a great phone like the GT-i9192 from Samsung... because:First, size. This phone can fit in my shirt pocket... an absolute must. I don't want a phone bigger than my hand. If you are considering a new phone - size should be your first factor to determine.Second, Android operating system versus Apple. A personal choice for anyone, but there is more 'free' stuff for Android.Third, DUAL SIM SLOTS. Why would you want this? Because this phone can be TWO PHONES IN ONE. So, if you're a businessman or doctor, and don't want to carry two phones (one for work and one for personal) this is PERFECT. If you use the same service provider for both SIMs you can keep both active at the same time and switch between them.If you are trying a new service for the first time, like me, and are unsure of reception, and are hesitant to instantly 'switch' without trying the 'new service' first, then this phone is great!  I tested the 'Simple Mobile' service for a month, then dropped ATnT after giving them thousands dollars over the years, and put the 'old' SIM card in with my new one so I had all my contacts and info instantly on my Samsung. What a great feeling!This phone is for the AMERICAS, NOT EUROPE, NOT AFRICA (like some people are saying they heard from 'Samsung' service folks).  It states this very clearly on the outside of the box.This phone is 3G only... NOT 4G.  This is OK for me because I am not going to watch streaming video on this small screen, nor do I send (or receive) large files.  This means you have greater service range because 3G is nearly everywhere, versus 4G (even though 4G service will drop to 3G if 4G is not found... I know).  In the USA, this phone works fantastic with t-mobile and it's derivatives metro pcs and simple mobile (which I use and like).Icing on the cake: purchase a pair of bluetooth (wireless) headphones (like the Sol Republic / Motorola pair) and enjoy music without wires... and when a phone call comes, it mutes the music, announces the call, and when the call ends, the music starts up where it stopped.

I used my phone for everything, and: phone does decent with high graphics Games Like modern combat 4 and does excellent with any other like The Room, assassin's creed pirates, sonic dash; when I read books or watch any Movies it doesn't lag. The only time that my phone froze was when I installed a 3rd party app to make the lock screen fancy, but once removed phone worked perfectly again. Honestly if the phone gives you any \"problem\", I would suggest to learn how to use the phone before complaining. One more detail, dual version means it can work with two carriers at the same time to receive and send calls or text; but Do Not Expect to get 3G on both Sims. When you switch in between sim, one will get 3G and the other 2G.

It hasn't been a clean break between target platform size and included functionality. The fact the battery is removable and the external memory is extendable should absolutely not be something you have go out of your way to praise, but here we are\u2026 fools in cubicles are taking away common-sense design elements on a daily basis\u2026 and other fools are snapping them up without a whit of pushback. I've owned a tech company that supplies manufacturers such as this with engineering tools and licenses my IP to them for 30 years and truly don't care for the customer-ignorance-exploiting tack many manufacturers have moved to in the past decade.So, I do like much of what this phone incorporates but there is a single show-stopper for me that both prevents me from recommending it, or keeping it. In addition to the hard-to-hit power button (which would be even harder to hit if they put it on the top edge), the home button on the front of the phone turns the phone on CONSTANTLY while it's in your pocket. It has caused a 911 butt dial (far, far beyond acceptable) and on a more mundane level, it literally destroys its already mediocre battery life (this phone can't hold a candle to some of its competitors in this category). I would say with this serious design flaw in place, I am getting battery life that reminds me of early 90's Moto flip phone days. It is TERRIBLE because some guy who shouldn't be designing things made this both the default behavior and did not make it a user setting. Yes, you can go play with aftermarket fixes that involve rooting but 99+ % of the phone's target market won't go there. This crippling design decision should never ever have made it past an initial design review. Oh yea\u2026 I'm sick of the sound of those buttons coming from my pocket too. Some won't mind putting up with it\u2026 some of us just won't go there.I'm not certain the following is the platform or the OS, but I am unable to voice dial via my headset without picking the phone up and entering my unlock code. If that is a manufacturer decision, then change the title of this to \"Two Crippling Design Flaws\". Unlikely I'll find out\u2026 it's going back.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall happy, this is an excellent price", "Author": "Oy Vey", "ReviewID": "R4QE7Z2IJDXIX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I paid $249.99 for it from Verizon only a few months ago.
