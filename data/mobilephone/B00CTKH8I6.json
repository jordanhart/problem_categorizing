{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SWEET!!", "Author": "Barnegat Bay", "ReviewID": "R2CY5GQZ6MW5B7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had android phones in the past, and last year I purchased a Lumia 521 to check the Windows OS.  My 521 was smooth to use and didn't bog down.  The live tiles were pleasing to see.  I liked it better than my android.  The 521 had a 4 inch screen and a 5 MP camera which was ok.  I wanted to do an upgrade, mostly for the camera, but since I use WiFi and have a prepaid T-Mobile service, I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a top quality Nokia Windows phone.  Another plus for the Nokia phones is that it's Here Drive and Maps can be used without a data plan.  That's nice for us cheap prepaid folks.The Lumia 1020 & 1520 are too expensive and the 1320 has a 5 MP camera with an extra lens, so it is only a tad better.  I decided to try this unlocked 925 because the price was reasonable ($410 from FGS Trading) and it has an 8.7 MP PureView shooter and a 4.5 inch screen + it's an overall much better product than my 521.  My old android had a 5\" screen that just fit into my pants pocket.  So, the 4.5 seems just right.The screen quality is stunning compared to my old 521.  Crystal clear and sharp with the clear black screen and 332 ppi.  I'm sure the 1520 and 1020 screens are better, but this 925 is pretty darn good, especially in outdoor sun light.  I put it in full sun and was able to see the screen clearly.  That was a surprise.I received the Black update a couple of days ago, which took 15 minutes to download.  It added some nice features to the camera and other items.  I played with these for a while, but I'm no Ansel Adams, so I'll stick to the basics.The camera does take a much better photo than my 521, which was my goal, and the video stabilizer works great.  The 925 shoots especially good in low light also.There are only two minor negative things about this phone.  One, the phone is thin and it has a smooth back which tends to be slippery.  I wish it was textured for a more comfortable grip.The second concern, a small one, is that I can't get it to keep time automatically.  It loses 5 seconds a day.  Not a major concern, since I simply undo and redo \"Set time\" in the date+time function.  If it becomes a pain, I may try a hard reset.Would I recommend this Lumia 925?
