My contract doesn't expire with AT+T until a few more months, but I needed a replacement phone to tie me over. The nearest AT+T tower is about 180 miles away. I live in an area of the US that is sparsely populated and so having a good signal is very important when travelling. So considering my location I understand that I will not get a full signal. The razor, before it died from water damage, performed very well on picking up a good signal.The sidekick3 doesn't perform well in this comparison. Very seldom do I have more than one bar of reception inside a building, even standing near a window. When I go outside on a cloudless day, I may get two bars. I get texts randomly showing up 2-3 days after someone sends them. There are times when I have a decent signal my phone will not let me send out a text. Once when the battery ran out, all my data and contacts were erased. During a phone call, the person on the other end complains of the scratchy sounds over the receiver.Having the full QWERTY keyboard is a feature that I do like and makes the phone agreeable, otherwise, I would not recommend this phone to anyone who lives away from a large town/city.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "For use with Tmobile Wireless service\nInternet browsing, IM's, text & video messaging and email\n1.3 megapixel camera, flashlight, ringtones, games\nPhonebook capacity 2000 names & numbers\nBLUETOOTH, plus QWERTY keyboard, swivel screen, stores music, songs, videos", "Name": "Tmobile Sidekick 3 - Diane von Furstenberg Limited Edition PDA Smartphone Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Tia7MEwAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001Q9ZTMS"}}
