{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "S. Medel \"Foxy\"", "ReviewID": "R2OZUMXRMZY08W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for 2 years and it is still working just like new! I love the purple color which is what attracted me to get this phone, I never lose calls and love that I can put time on it myself instead of having a monthly phone bill.  I like that you can two way call on it for only $1 and can use it all day like a walkie talkie, I like that it has speaker phone as well for when your busy and can't be holding the phone to your ear. Texting on it is a bit difficult but it works and I recommend this Motorola i776w cell phone.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "This phone sucks!", "Author": "C. Mota", "ReviewID": "R1Q4OZR7TLTB4C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone for a little over three months, just in time for the warranty to run out, and I got the blue screen of death. The phone would shut off on its own, wouldn't text, receive calls, or even come on. If I was lucky enough to turn it on, all I got was that blue screen. This phone is garbage.
