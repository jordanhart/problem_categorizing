There is nothing but good to say about this Amazon experience. The price ($450) for an unlocked international version was fantastic! The black sapphire color can only be gotten by purchasing the international version, and if you were hesitating to do so for any reason, hesitate no longer. I live in Germany where gsm is king, but I actually purchased this and mailed it to Baltimore ahead of my trip there, and actually bought two (one for my daughter and one for me). We adopted a no-contract plan from Tmobile, loaded the sim, and life hasbeen grand since.Everything... Everything... about this phone is phenomenal... Speed, screen, camera, battery,.... nothing is negative. I upgraded from a wonderful phone (Motorola Atrix) with skepticism about the size being too large, the feel being too awkward, and operating system being too foreign. Wrong on all 3 counts. I left my Atrix alone for 2 weeks, and upon returning to try the Atrix after working with the S3, I could never go back. The feel of the S3 in the hand is very natural, the operating system is very very user friendly, and the screen clarity and adjustable fonts keeps me away from my laptop unless I have an intensely long typing requirement.I had been tempted to lean toward an iPhone 5 instead, but thankfully I resisted that temptation. Screen size, compatibility with existing peripherals, expandable memory (I added a 32GB micro SD for only $20 more... also bought on Amazon) and ability to access and share data on the S3 make it easy to see why everyone is shying away from the iPhone and selecting the S3.Add to this the fact I had both phones delivered in only 3 days, and I am now enjoying both phones now back in Germany with the same great performance on networks here makes me all the more happy about my purchase.So", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exelente equipo smart phone", "Author": "Luis Gamboa", "ReviewID": "R4SUQNQC7ENMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El tel\u00e9fono cubri\u00f3 todas las expectativas que me hab\u00eda hecho con la lectura de todas las cr\u00edticas y especificaciones.Hasta ahora lo he usado por 4 semanas y no tengo quejas.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best", "Author": "Raphael", "ReviewID": "R2V61T5CH5V607", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best phone I ever had!Fast, sleek and elegant.Only recommend purchasing a protection for itAnd the best price!", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy 3", "Author": "Con Ming \"movie watcher\"", "ReviewID": "R1NVV0OZLE97FR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

But unfortunately, ran it over with my pick-up. However, this one is quickly becoming my favorite. Its not the bells and whistles. \" there's those that work.......and there's those who talk about it!\" This one works!I cant say much about the shipper. Except that the phone arrived in about 4 days. It came packaged in a nice box along with a USB charger, head phones and a quick start guide. Listed as an International version. I expected to have to change some settings. However, it arrived set in english, and I didnt have to change a thing. It came loaded with Android 4.0, but was soon updated to 4.3. My S-2 struggled around our house on wifi. However this S-3 does not. I get good reception in every room and even out in the yard. I purchased this phone to run on the Straight Talk program. Utilizing AT&T; towers. Even though it is only 3G capable. It is plenty fast enough. Any apps I use, such as fishing and maps, load up smoothly. And the GPS works without a glitch.Short and sweet...........If your looking to up grade. Or just looking for a good solid replacement.
