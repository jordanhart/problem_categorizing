It its underpriced and under-advertised and understated.At $400 vs. HTC one X (almost the same price) vs.  Samsung GS3 (at $579) the choice is simple....... buy this phone. It works in USA, Canada, Europe, Caribbean, and in Latin American countries (e.g. Venezuela).Beautiful screen, vibrant colors, good but simple looks and style, and the battery life with juice defender on default settings of 15 hours usage of internet, calls, Facebook, texting, etc. and now at 20% ....... well you can do the maths.Well done LG. Good work. Keep it up.I recommend this phone above all other 2012 phones. You won't regret it.This is the Diamond in the Rug of the 2012 phones.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "Astaroth.sv", "ReviewID": "RMU0U3ARZEYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This device is nice and it\u2019s a great deal! You get the hardware features of a Galaxy S3 for about $100 less than a Galaxy S3. I did a lot of research before deciding what I should buy taking a GS3 as my parameter, so I was going for Xperia T, LG 4x HD and GS3 of course.Hardware features:CPU:The hardware is basically the same, both offer Quad core CPU (International version) at 1.5 GHz for the LG 4x and 1.4 GHz for the GS3, while the Xperia T offers a dual core 1.5 GHz. I can tell that 0.1 GHz is not a big deal in performance, but Quad Core does a lot better than Dual Core if the OS it\u2019s well optimized for it, so Xperia T loses this one.Storage and RAM:When I decided to buy a new phone I decided that 16 GB where enough for my needs. Xperia T and LG 4X offer 16 Gigs of internal storage, while you can get up to 64 gigs in the GS3 for some extra bucks. The 3 devices have micro-SD slots, up to 64 gigs for GS3 and LG 4X while Xperia gets up to 32 gigs. RAM wise the 3 devices offer 1 GB. Xperia T loses again.Camera:This is where the Xperia T kicks a** by offering a 13.0 MP camera while the other 2 devices offer 8.0 MP, they all have autofocus and LED flash. Most review say that GS3 camera is better than LG 4X and after doing a side by side comparison I realized this was true, also I found out that the GS3 camera is a bit faster. But we all know that Sony is well known for the HQ pics in their devices and is the only one offering a 2 stage shutter button, Sony wins this one, LG 4x loses.Screen:Xperia T: 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.55 inches (~323 ppi pixel density)GS3: 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.8 inches (~306 ppi pixel density)LG 4X: 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.7 inches (~312 ppi pixel density)Xperia T has got the best looking screen, but also it\u2019s the smallest one, GS3 offer the biggest screen but has the lowest ppi, LG 4X stands in the middle with a good screen size and a good ppi, head to head with the GS3 I like the looking of the LG 4X screen more than GS3, contrast ratio and color definition of the True HD-IPS LCD seems to be better than Super AMOLED screen. So since the 3 devices offer the same resolution at different screen sizes and ppi the middle term of the LG 4X wins here.Battery life:This is the weak point of more smartphones this days! They are really power hungry devices with their huge screens, multicore processors and 3G networks. Sony offers a non-removable 1850 mAh battery, while SG3\u2019s got 2100 mAh battery and the LG 4X offers 2150 mAh battery, both removable. 50 mAh are not a big difference and GS3 seems to have the best talk battery life time, while coming pretty close for web browsing. Sony loses this one with over all short battery life.I saw some head-to-head benchmark for processing, video rendering and web browsing at which LG 4X and GS3 would come pretty close in performance, LG being a little faster for 3D video rendering. Both devices perform greatly and the LG 4X is about $100 cheaper so if you are in a tight budget you should go for the LG if you don\u2019t mind lacking 4G LTE connectivity, but since there\u2019s no 4G in my country yet that was not a problem for me.Over all I\u2019m pretty pleased with this device, preforms greatly (gaming, web browsing, social networks, etc.)  it\u2019s good looking, doesn\u2019t looks or feel cheap and it has a great performance for the price I paid, I updated the OS to Jelly Bean a couple of days after getting it and everything is running smoothly. My only complaint so far is that I have to recharge it using a USB port for it won\u2019t make it through the day with an overnight charge with some intense use, and trust me with a device like this you are going to make some intense use of it.Regarding the vendor I have to say that the delivery was in time, the box and everything else was sealed, all the accessories where in the box. There were some minor scratches in the box but nothing to serious. Since this is an international phone the charger is not for the American power outlet, the vendor sent an adapter but if you plug the charger all the way into the adapter the device it won\u2019t work, all I have to do is barely pull it back and it will work fine. You can get an adapter at any hardware store for anyway.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most affordable quad-core tegra phone so far, but with a few caveats.", "Author": "R. A. Racaza", "ReviewID": "R29BKHHNXJTJ1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the black version of the phone a couple of days before this review and have been satisfied so far. After extensive research and forum jumping from review and tech faqs, I've decided to take the chance on the LG Optimus 4X HD. While it is true that it does get real hot at first BEFORE the updates, I still buckled down and followed the faqs given on the android forums concerning this phone. Yes, you DO have to update the software/firmware, get root access, and do a bunch of other steps to help govern the heat management of the phone as well as battery life.  Once you have this phone rooted and all, it is also best to download an app that helps recalibrate the battery.  The first time after I did the root, I still noticed that the battery drain was dropping like the proverbial ten ton anvil until I downloaded a cpu governor as well as a battery recalibration app.  Doing that helps IMMENSELY.  Playing any sort of game doesn't eat up the battery's juices at a phenomenal rate like the Kardasians on an eating binge as it did out of the box, and the unit only gets warm now rather than blistering hot. Prior to updates and manual fixes, the temp of the phone can go up a feverish 100 degrees F and above. Enough that I thought it might blow up or melt. Now it mid-ranges from 80 to 95 on a good solid hour of gaming.  I'm not much of a hard core mobile gamer, so any game testing over the 1 hr mark is something I haven't done.  I've heard of a rumor about a stickable graphite \"ice pad\" heat sink that can be applied to the back cover to help disperse the heat faster but I have yet to buy and test one. If anyone else has done so, please let me know of it does work.As for those complaining about the low speaker problem... Personally, I can live with it due to using my headphones that already has a volume booster control. There is however an app on google play that helps boost/tweak up the on-board speakers higher than normal, but at the owner's own risk - boost it past 100% of the safety levels and your device's speakers WILL die permanently. A boost of 30% above the norm was as high as I dared go during testing, which 10% lower than the 40% safety margin the app's instructions said, and the sound was better than before.So far, this phone is a great buy if you're looking for an affordable quad-core tegra 3 phone.  Just take note that you'll have to work on manually updating the phone via official and custom updates to really get the most out of it. Another good thing to note is that if you're a hard core gamer, an extra battery or two would really help you in the long run. Because no matter what phone you've got, if you're a mobile gamer, one battery ain't enough no matter what phone you have if the battery is easily accessible.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice smartphone", "Author": "Alisha", "ReviewID": "R2VEVZCJ6RDO4L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in Ecuador so i needed a new unlocked smartphone.

If anyone has problems with battery life you have to uninstall the \"bloatware\" LG and google apps and it'll definitely increase life...I had mine on standby overnight and battery drained 40% even on airplane mode!  After uninstalling apps I'll never use or need, battery decreased 1% or less overnight in airplane mode.A-GPS needs 1-4 minutes to lock on to satelites compared to the iphone which is almost instant, but hey as long as it works I'm happy.  I have had issues where the screen turns itself on.  The speaker quality is great with some things, and horrible with others...I don't know what bright engineer decided to install a speaker on the back of the device.All in all for the price you're going to save half what the newest phones cost, and the one I received was actually built in March 2013 so that's pretty sweet!  I'd recommend the phone, but be aware there are not many cases or screen protectors to choose from, compared to iphone.  If you want to save a few hundred bucks buy this phone, other than the crappy speaker on some apps I love it!

LG has been my choice of phone - from the pre smartphone days of yore (5 cellphone generations ago :-) to now) because they never disappoint.The LG Optimus 4x p880 phone has an amazing screen - sharp and bright The processor is zippy. The camera is takes great pix. The LG/Google partnership is satisfying.I planned to root it but LG loaded the p880 with useful apps and just knowing it can be rooted is comforting enough, so I left well enough alone.One of my favorite stock apps that is installed in the p880 is the QuickMemo which is accessed from the notification bar. It can be used QuickMemo to write notes during a call for example.

As an amateur photographer I prefer the decent iPhone camera, but whatever, I didn't want to pay that price.-battery life is so so, I'm not a \"heavy user\" so this isn't so big a deal for me, but it's probably not a bad idea to get an extra battery if you're a commuter, which you can do with this phone.-tiny tinny speaker. It's true the sound isn't great, but this is a phone, so I'll cut it some slack. My wife has the 5th gen iPod touch whose speaker is certainly better, and to think further on it makes my shoulders shrug of their own accord.-You can pretty much forget about finding a good case for it. I gave up.-WiFi connection is sometimes annoyingly finicky.-as a Mac user I had to find and then download special aftermarket software to get my handset to communicate with my computer. This is always a painful and aggravating process when moving media around. Not LG's fault or problem, but, Mac users be aware this is not a match made in heaven.The good:-it's satisfyingly large/has great \"hand-feel\" (keep your jokes to yourself please). The monolithic look is pleasing to my tastes, and perhaps yours.-the screen. I like to read e-books, and the size of the screen makes this a viable reader, as well as a media consumption device.-the price! LG's loss is your gain. Thought about getting an Galaxy SIII, but the savings were compelling.-Micro SD expandability + replaceable battery means you can cheaply repurpose this thing for years to come. Just think on that a moment. It's pretty much THE reason I chose this phone.-Android ICS is pretty solid. I think I prefer aspects of iOS, but in the balance, ICS is perfectly suitable.-TONS of app[lication]s. Seriously, when will there be enough?-quad core? This is my first smartphone, so really, I have no point of contrastThe verdict:Word to LG's mother, I am a fan of this unit. The price was right, and I have been well satisfied with it's performance. I need to be cautious when handling it since I have given up on finding a case, and it's size can make it awkward to transition to and from pockets.

So many excellent functions, and many little 'hidden' things you can learn about on YouTube. In one YouTube  review, LG Optimus 4X HD vs. Samsung Galaxy S III Dogfight Part 1 shows the LG coming in slightly behind the Galaxy, but the LG is only 300 dollars, who cares? BTW both Samsung and LG are Korean companies, known for some of the best technology in the world.It seems light out of the box, alarmingly light. Once the battery and the protective cover (purchased separately) are inserted and applied respectively, the weight and feel is very pleasing.  Display is seen even in bright sunlight, with brightness turned up full. I doubt you will find a better phone for the price.Pros: Well built, fast, powerful. International functionality.Cons: Battery can drain in six hours. Learning curve if new to android... to be expected. I think the phone could have used more RAM. Only one GB, the majority used for phone functioning. I suppose phone apps don't use a lot of resources, but I wouldn't leave a lot of apps running at once.

So I have experience in dealing with this phone from a sample of three phones (two from me and one from my friend)The biggest complaint about this phone is that over time it will deteriorate and it will begin to run slower and slower. This is despite the fact that I had a hard plastic cover on it for the entire time I owned it. The phone will start to spaze out and take long amount of time to load between different screens. This can be extremely annoying when texting, after a few months of owning this phone sometimes the ability to text can be patchy, as there are a few seconds lag between the words you are typing and what comes up on screen.Another really annoying feature that me and my friend used to joke about but in reality still is very annoying is that fact that every single time you turn the phone off and on again, the timezone is set to Taipei in Asia, which is a completly different time zone. The only way around this (and believe me I've tried everything, including trying to download any app to solve the problem) is to root the phone, which can cost a considerable amount of money if you do not know how to do it yourself.Lastly the phones audio jack in both of my phones deteriorated over time. In one phone it broke completely and I was no longer able to listen to music through headphones. In the other phone the audiojack is a bit patch and if I am walking it can sometimes disconnect.All in all, this phone for the money you pay is not worth it. Do not be fooled by the phones specifications (which do look good on paper). It would be a much more shrewd investment of money to purchase either the moto G which is cheaper and better, any one of the Samsung Galaxy series or Sony Xperia Z series.

For starters, YES, you can use this phone almost everywhere in the world. I get HSPA+ here in Colombia, and it works really well. The cellphone is clearly brought from Europe and quite honestly I couldn't care less about it. I somehow expected the box to be completely sealed when It arrived, but it wasn't, I can see they needed to include the EU-to-US AC Adapter, so I don't really mind as long as it is a new phone. This was my only complaint about the product though, my EU-to-US Adapter was not working out of the box. I didn't mind as I have tons of these over here, but it could be an annoyance to someone else. Overall, the transaction with Hassle Free was excellent and pretty fluid.Now, as far as THE ACTUAL PHONE goes:This phone has been slowly becoming a favorite within countries where prices are usually STUPID high even with 2 or 3 year contracts as it is, spec-wise, an amazing phone...LG's 2012 Flagship, the first QuadCore smartphone announced in history and one of the finest screens around. It's LG, you can count on it having great Hardware...and terrible Software. I was quite surprised with LG UI 3.0, it is incredibly customizable, didn't even feel the need to download a Launcher right away as I do with other phones. It is, looks-wise, comparable to Samsung's own TouchWiz but without the stutter and unoptimized mess.INTERFACE: LG UI 3.0 is quite customizable and one of the best in the market, not as \"serious\" looking as Sony's Xperia or HTC's Sense, but it doesn't need to be...it is INCREDIBLY customizable.BATTERY: 2150 mha of pure energy...well not really, but it lasts me the day if with auto brightness (starting point 35%) and using 2G services while using the typical Whatsapp, FB Chat, FB, Twitter, some calls and some internet browsing.SPEED: AS long as you don't update to Jellybean incorrectly (keep reading), the phone is incredibly snappy.OS: What? OS? Yes...there was a hidden tracker left in the JellyBean update for this phone, but you can disable it if you use the hidden menu by calling 3845#*880* and Disabling MLT. It drains your RAM and BAttery, so IF you decide on updating to Jellybean...you're warned (and you have been told the solution)STURDINESS: Wow...yes...it is plastic...but OMG is it sturdy. It can resist quite a beating and it's as light as a feather.SCREEN: Simply beautiful...I never understood when people would compare IPS LCD to Super AMOLED...but now I see the difference and boy, is it a good screen. It is amazing, but it was expected being LG, founder of the tech.OVERALL: This is an amazing phone, as it stands, it's only competitor in its price range is the Google Nexus 4...but if you are from somewhere outside the \"First World\" (hush hush....most people in this review section), this is a definite must buy. I do NOT recommend updating to JellyBean unless you are rooting and booting another ROM, but this is quite a sensational phone and bang for your buck. The camera isn't the best under low-light conditions, but I couldn't care less...if that's your cup of tea. The Volume buttons are incredibly weird, but they work fine.

The charge depletes so quickly its ridiculous, I should point out in all fairness though that it's a standby champion.Who would I recommend this phone to:If you are not a heavy user and tend to just have music playing then this phone is for you since the companion core does not use a lot of power. If you are a power user, you might want to look into underclocking the CPU and freezing some of the services running in the background (LG has a ridiculous amount of  background services that appear to contribute significantly to the poor battery life).UPDATE 10/15/2013I finally decided to root the device, freeze a ton of services as well as change out the launcher and underclock it and now I can describe the battery life as stellar.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product... great seller!!!", "Author": "Omar", "ReviewID": "R9GQ4Y527SEEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product... great seller!!!This cellphone is superfast, it has a huge screen and its beautifullI tottally recomend it to everyone", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "QUAD core ,is this a joke by LG and NVIDIA ?", "Author": "raul", "ReviewID": "R1BG0MQDXTJKTV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Seeing the Nvidia Tegra quad core configuration, I purchased this device.

A few places, indoors and in basements have knocked me down to 2G.As for the phone itself: Everything in the box was wrapped and labeled as new. The box's seal sticker was gone, so it has probably been opened. It did not recognize my T-mobile SIM until I did a factory reset. This may suggest that it had been used before with someone else's SIM before. It really doesn't seem like it though, as the phone even had all the little pieces of protective plastic on the sides, etc. Regardless, it was in immaculate shape.The battery life has been suggested to be problematic, but it's a fair step up from my Galaxy S (original).

At the current price it's a steal, a bargain you can't refuse. You can go check out any number of comparative reviews on the net between the LG Optimus 4X HD and the Galaxy SIII and they're quite a match for each other, no clear winner, but at the current price of both phones, the Optimus wins hands down.The only complaint I have for the particular unit I got is that it came out of the box with Chinese as the default language, so the initial Android setup screen was quite enigmatic - I had to go look for screenshots on the net to find out which button said what, specifically which one was the language setting button. But that was easy to do anyway and if you find yourself in the same position, take note that the button to change the language is the largest one right there in the low-middle portion of the screen. Next step, once everything is tidied up language-wise, just go ahead and deactivate the Chinese-market bloatware that comes pre-installed (these apps can't be uninstalled, just \"deactivated\").Aside from this minor quibbles, the phone experience is superb. I'm yet to test a lot of its features, but anyway make no mistake, the LG Optimus 4X HD is top-of-the-line stuff!:::::::Nota para compradores venezolanos: funciona a la perfecci\u00f3n con Movilnet GSM (dentro de lo mala que es la se\u00f1al de voz GSM de Movilnet), s\u00f3lo hay que dejar que el tel\u00e9fono detecte la red apropiada y luego configurar el APN.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Aldo Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R2ZH9ZE0H41F17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent.
