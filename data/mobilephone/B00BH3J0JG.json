Then, seller shipped a $340.00 phone in its \"own box\" with a few pieces of blue masking tape holding the lid on.  The phone was floating around loose inside.  Amazingly, it is still functional.Product:Sale was for a like-new Titanium Grey Galaxy S3, but received a Pebble Blue GS3 with scratches all around the bezel.  Screen was free of large scratches and does have 16GB internal storage.  IMEI is also clean, ... so far.  Still, not what I ordered.  Don't want to go through return/reorder process.  So, Pebble blue it is.Other:Should have known better than to purchase from seller with NO feedback, but I gave it a shot.  Probably won't again.Terrible experience with this seller (Skeater21).  Stay away!", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone at a Great Deal!!!", "Author": "Roger Leonhardt", "ReviewID": "R29DP7M1YC7SQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung S3 is a great phone.It is not as fast as the S4, but is an even better deal when it comes to price. If you can't afford the S4 this is the phone for you!It has many of the features of the S4 but costs hundreds lower. In my case, I got this phone for my wife used and in mint condition for almost half the price of my S4.I highly recommend it and give it 5 out of 5 stars!", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "BAD IMEI", "Author": "Chicho", "ReviewID": "R7EJ50T0D3R1Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone worked great for about a month and was then shut down by T-Mobile for having a bad IMEI.
