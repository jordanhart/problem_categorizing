If you are nit-picky about being able to change features on your phone and customize them, you may not want this phone...the fact I gave it four stars only means it's four stars as far as it meets my expectations.As noted on other reviews: if you want to use the fm radio and mp3 capabilities of the phone...you should find a different phone...you will be disappointed as you'll need to purchase a special headphone to use the radio, and you can't store much music-wise.I consider my tech abilities above average, but my cell usage is generally pretty basic.What I really like about it:Great looking phone...no one sees it and thinks \"hey, he's using a prepaid phone\"! Not too small, not too big, and light. I really enjoy the slider feature and that it automatically locks the external buttons once the slider closes. I like the display size, camera, and video recorder. Call quality is good, too.I'm not basing this review on Net10, however, I've found it to be good service...same as Tracfone's service (obviously, owned by Tracfone), which is what I switched from. Activating and porting your number is simple. Everything is self-service, and intuitive, so I'm glad I have little need for talking to customer service.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Net10 is great!", "Author": "pdonaldson789", "ReviewID": "R2MZVRK0VFWYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I very much love this phone, more for the fact that it is on NEt10 rather than the phone itself.  The phone works great, got a camera and a multimedia player and all that, very sturdy and reliable.  The service is outstanding however.  I did a little research and learned that it's because Net10 uses the Verizon and ATT towers to broadcast its service, which means it is truly nationwide.  Also, it's darn cheap at 50 a month for unlimtied and 25 a month for 1000 minutes. Woo!", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "a decent pre-paid phone, but there are better choices, updated 10/11", "Author": "E. Swope", "ReviewID": "R181RI4NMSJOKS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After an atrocious experience with T-mobile I moved my family onto several pre-paid phones from different providers so that we would have time to decide exactly what we wanted before signing another contract.  I have to say that after 3 months on pre-paid service, we are unlikely to go back to a contract.I picked up the LG620G after reading several good reviews.  It does have some nice features: compatible with  micro SD cards (only 2g), an mp3 player and radio (the radio requires external antenna), a decent size screen and a few aps installed, also usable as a data phone.  It's a clam shell design, so it is small and easy to carry and the screen is protected.Net10's plans are pretty reasonable: 10 cents/ minute or Net10 has a $25/ month plan which includes data and text.The bad: It is a somewhat cheesy looking plastic phone; not the worst, but not the best either.Many of the features are clunkly to use.  The first time I tried browsing with it I was told I had to log into my phone.  I still have not figured out how to read email on an external website with it.  The data usability was so bad that I stopped using it after and hour or so of playing around to see what it could do).It has a usb connection but does not come with a cable (or car charger).  The cable can be purchased separately, but I have not yet found a car charger for it.To use the mp3 player you need to move the music onto your micro sd card using an adapter (also not supplied).  Using the card is also awkward, as it sits under the battery inside the phone, not in an external slot.Regards the service: I read a review of net10 which said that service is great, unless you put \"customer\" inf front of it.  The folks I have spoken with at customer service are nice, but not very capable.  Some have good command of English and some, not so.  Their customer service is in the Dominican Republic).  I have not been able to buy minutes online, over the phone (either cell or land).  There's a problem with whoever processes their credit cards, such that I was told it was denied, when the card companies said it was not.  I now have hundred of $ \"pending\" hanging in suspension, and ultimately had to go out and buy a physical card to use the phone.  My reception, clarity... is better than T-mobile, but not as good as either what my son gets on his At & T LG Prime Prepaid GoPhone (AT&T;) with $50 Airtime Credit or what my daughter gets with Virgin Mobile.Ultimately I wish I had gotten myself an LG prime.  The screen is larger, and it is a touchscreen.  it has an external memory card slot and takes up to 16g cards. It has better reception, getting signals where I can't.  At&T; customer service is much easier to deal with.  Most significantly, it cost half as much (or less on one I bought black Friday week).  At& T has a plan which is *identical* to net 10s, a straight 10 cents/ minute.  Their flat rate is now $2/ day unlimited (which is on the high end).I would recommend this phone only if you are already on net10, have credit you do not want to lose, and are otherwise happy with their service.  The 10 cent /minute plan is great for those of us who do not use a cell much (for others I would recommend Virgin mobile).I am staying with net10 for the time being because I paid $40 for this phone (which is too much for 2 months worth of use.  However, I wish I had bought the LG prime instead and if we stay with pre-paid, I likely will ultimately pick one of those up.******************************************************************************I am revisiting my review having purchased yet another cell phone :p (gee I have a lot of phones; one could even say *too many*).  While the LG 620g performed OK, the service at net10 was pretty awful.  I could seldom actually use the phone. sometimes having to stand in the middle of the street to get a signal... and sometimes not being able to get one no matter what I did!Beyond that, the price of the LG touch has increased so much I would no longer recommend it (i paid $10-20 for it taking into account the credit AT&T; provided.  They have since raised the price and reduced the credit to where it has become a pretty expensive phone, and... there are better choices for the money).  I recently got a palm pixi plus Palm Pixi Plus Verizon Cell Phone ~ No Contract a pretty basic smart phone (i.e. it is not an android, BUT has *a lot* of features for this price range.  It actually cost less than the LG620g (I paid $36 from a marketplace seller), activated on pageplus cellular on advice from several reviewers. and oh my what a change!  I can get a good signal anywhere!  and, unbelievable, it costs 1/3 as much!  In fact, I am so happy with it I have bought 3, replacing all of our phones (but my husband's... who is happy with his LG touch... and has lots of minutes remaining on at&t;)... but is still considering a palm pixi.I still think that if you get a good signal from net 10 wherever you are and are otherwise happy with them, this is an OK phone... but just OK, and with all the new offerings in prepaid phones, is probably not so competitive any more; no way as good as the pixi at the same price.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG620G from Net10 is a great primary or back-up cell", "Author": "frequentshoppper", "ReviewID": "R2QYLKRNEHYZP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for my mother who had the LG300G. This is a BIG IMPROVEMENT over that telephone. The screen size is larger and she can see what she's doing. No more complaints regarding call quality. She can HEAR clearly on this telephone. NO MORE STATIC OR FADING volume. I liked this phone so much, I purchased another one. The second telephone is for myself. I own a LG Optimus Net but liked this little phone so much, that I wanted one for myself.I haven't used the internet because I have the larger touch screen and my laptop for internet use. However, the camera I have used and have discovered it to be as good as the one on the Moto W376 (much better) and LG800G both of which I used to use. The video recorder on the LG620G also works great.All in all, this phone has all the features of other more expensive telephones. unit converter, date finder, calendar, alarm clock, secret notes(password required), business card, data counter, voice recorder, fm radio, music player, ring tone creator, BLUE-TOOTH, MicroSD card(separate purchase), emoticons(for text messages), etc. The menu can be locked or unlocked with the slider down, it just depends on your settings.As the title states, this would be a great back-up telephone or a primary telephone - depending on what you want to do with it.The look and feel of the telephone is NICE! It doesn't look cheap. The buttons look and feel nice. I mean for 12.99 + 4.99 tax, you won't find a better telephone for just under 18.00. And, if you're looking to update your parents telephone, this will do. To be honest, the phone has to many features for senoirs - in my opinion. Even though I feel it has to many features for seniors, the phone is not so complicated that they cannot figure it out. Regardless, they can see with the larger size screen AND hear..As for Net10, the service is fine as long as you don't have to call them. I called the other night to have my mom's telephone number and minutes moved from the lg300 over to the lg620 and they answered right away. The process didn't take long. Usually it takes a while to get through, and even longer to get proper assistance. So call/wait time and quality of assistance can vary. In the event you discover that you need to call them, just be patient and think of the savings.

Battery life has been good on it too. My Dad is 76 years old and not very tech savy but he figured things out pretty quickly with this phone.

I especially like the slider design with locking keys - no more accidental dialing. I was thinking of getting a qwerty key pad, but the keys are just too tiny for me. I don't do a whole lot of texting, so this phone is a better choice for me. Everything works on this phone, as advertised. The camera feature is very easy to use and works great. I can't believe an item this good only cost me $15.99. If you need to access the web a lot from your phone, then you really need a smart phone.

Overall, Net10's service is very good when it comes to connections (no drop calls!), affordability, freedom (no contracts; no hidden fees) and a good variety of calling plans, from the standard 300 Minutes/60 Service Days plan at $30.00 to the Unlimited Monthly Plan at $50.00 (seven different interchangeable plans altogether - and they can be purchased online, by phone or at tens of thousands of retailers like Walmart, Target, KMart, RadioShack, Walgreens, Dollar General, and many more).The customer service is extremely poor, but one has the option of contacting them through their Facebook page (see net10.com) or direct to their corporate office (CorporateOffice@net10.com).  My research reveals that those are bettet options to deal with any issues that may arise, although I have not had a need to contact them at all.  Just once did I have to contact customer service by phone and the issue was resolved to my satisfaction although after long waiting periods.  Another tip: If one speak Spanish it is better to use their Spanish line since it is easier to communicate with them in their native language, usually in Colombia).  If not, one will be contacting a rep in India, Pakistan or the Phillipines with very limited knowledge of the English language, although not less polite.  By the way, I have experience dealing with them calling for other relatives that use TracFone and SafeLink.  TracFone, SafeLink, StraightTalk and Net10 are all operated by TracFone Wireless, Inc., and they all use the same customer service infrastructure.The LG620G cell phone itself is very good, especially considering the price.  It has a nice, sleek look; it is pretty much sturdy, a compact size for easy carrying, but still great size of keyboard and screen.  While I don't use the FM radio feature much, I do use the MP3 player alot and am very happy with it.  The web is slow, could be expensive if one is using any of the pay as you go plans, as opposed to the unlimited monthly plan, and uses a WAP browser.  Personally I stay away from it since I use my laptop anyway, and only use it ocassionally like to check the local weather, if needed, or to check sports scores if away from my laptop.  I don't do texting all that much, but when I do it is easy and comfortable to do so.I certainly would recommend this phone to anyone, especially if in a budget, and I would also recommend the Net10 service.

The interfaces are uncannily similar, with the 620G's being a bit more polished. I use pre-paid phones as a programmer who uses the Java ME platform for writing educational programs, games, and other applications. There are almost 3 billion Java ME enabled phones on Earth, but a lot of them are restricted by manufacturers to only run SOME Java ME programs. Samsung is particularly bad about this, sadly. LG is one of the better companies when it comes to feature phones, but there is one necessary thing you will have to do to install your own Java ME MIDlets on the 620G. You will have to obtain the .jar file of your choice, open it with the archive manager of your choice ( I use File Roller), enter the META-INF folder, edit the MANIFEST.MF file with a text editor and add the following two lines separately at the bottom. Make sure you spell it exactly as typed, the 'F' in TracFone must be capitalized.Add:Author: TracFoneTracFone-price: 0.0let the archive manager update the file, put it onto a microSD card (you can also push it via Bluetooth), load it into the 620G and it will install. If you do not do the above, you will get an error. The process described also works for the LG 420G and perhaps other LG models.Using this method, you will never have to activate the phone if you just plan to use it as a mini-computer for programming with Java ME.Some other peculiar aspects of the phone are that it has no special volume controls, the microSD card slot is a bit awkward to load, and the back cover is difficult to remove as well. Compared to the LG500G, it supports the MIDI pitch-bend feature far better, but needs a special adapter for earbuds (microUSB to 3.5mm). The battery life the way I use it is about 10 days, which is impressive.The phone supports MIDlets of a very decent size. The largest one I have loaded is 494KB, which may not sound big, but is above the limit of some of my other phones.Overall a very appealing, affordable and thankfully relatively unrestricted phone that lets hackers be hackers (more or less).

I buy them without service, to use as backup phones in my client's cars.  Without service, they'll still dial 9-1-1.  It doesn't have GPS, but routes call based on tower geography.  The 3 times a client has had to use it (minor car crashes where they couldn't find or operate their regular phones), dispatch was able to pinpoint their location within 1/16th of a mile along the highway.If you need to start using it, in the event you break your regular phone, it's easy to activate right from the phone with a credit card or pre-paid Net10 card from the store.  I probably wouldn't want this as my primary handset.  Even for kids or seniors, just as an occasional-use phone, the keys are a little small and sound is kind of tinny.  But, its' the best handset I've used for under $10.  When closed, it fits perfectly in a small zip bag.  When powered off, the battery retains a good charge for about 3 months, before it needs to be topped off.The still camera is surprisingly good.  It's not a true 1.3MP sensor, as it uses interpolation, but the results are still very good for the price.  The camera is adequate enough to take photos in case of an auto accident.  The video camera is very low resolution, with high compression.  It's not very good, but better than nothing.  The audio recorder is only decent with the phone open.  It accepts 8GB MicroSD cards.  It might support larger, but I've never tested it.  The handset is more rugged than I expected for under $10, but I usually keep it in a sealed bag in a glovebox.If you need a backup or disposable phone, this is more than adequate.  For the price, you can get one for every car, first aid kit, or keep them around the house for 9-1-1 service.
