That means I will not have the phone that much time? I asked any spare phone or just exchange it but they said it is amazon.com's policy. I called amazon.com and they said after 30days from the purchase day, they have nothing to do with the phone. I called Samsung manufacture and they said this phone is from UK. In order to repair or any other issue, I should contact UK. Unbelivable.They have 1 years warrenty but which is useless.

I reckon I received this item in 16 hours! That was fantastic. When I opened the box, the packaging appeared good enough to transport crystal. Now comes the phone which was also a bundle of surprises. I have been using a HTC Sapphire One for a long time and after I switched to this, it made me feel that I was using the Android OS all over again but in a newer smaller smarter phone. WI-FI works very well and I did all the software and apps update in a jiffy. No complains about battery. Call processor, bluetooth service - A1. Overall I think it's a very good phone for the price. Fingers crossed!After 15 days of use, I can add that if you have fat fingers, don't buy this phone. Texting is a real pain in the behind and also using the apps. Time to time the phone does become \"No service\" but I guess it's the carrier, not the phone. The virtual keyboard froze just once & a restart fixed it. Stay tuned for later.3 months' update: It's getting worse and worse as the days are going by so I am reviewing my review from Excellent to Very Poor! The phone processor now reminds me of the 386 I learned Word Perfect and DOS in. It responds horribly slow despite keeping the minimum apps & always clearing RAM through the Task Manager; sometimes it responds to a command long after cancellation & it has once,for example, embarrassed me calling an important client twice in a row for nothing. Touch sensitivity, display sensor - pretty much screwed. It has restarted couple of times on its own & I am yet to figure out why. Internal memory is so small that I am desperately seeking to \"root\" it. Another funny thing I discovered is the display appears \"cracked\" when I go to check the \"Phone status\" under \"Settings\"...very weird! It appears fine in other menus/sub menus. I really wish I could give this back but I guess I am stuck with it. To all the potential buyers, lessons learned, #1 NEVER TRUST A \"NEW\" CONDITION CELLPHONE HERE-THEY ARE ALL REFURBISHED; #2 TO EASE ALL PAIN, BE PATIENT & BUY YOUR CELLPHONE FROM AN ACTUAL STORE.

It syncs nicely with my google account and to deal with the first two issues above I have put in a micro card and have removed all none Samsung Apps except for Kindle.  It is unlocked and thus I was able to put my regular sized SIM card in and use right away after 4 hours of charging.  The radio function works fine once the earphones are plugged in, the earphones work fine for driving and speaking on the phone, the wifi also works well, and so does the camera (in natural daylight) which I used the day after receiving the phone to take photos at a wedding.  So all in all, if you want a little Smart Phone for mainly texting and making phone calls then you won't regret getting it (I have the white but the black with the metallic back is also nice looking).

And the main camera is only 2 MP.However this is one of the lowest prices for an unlocked smartphone of any type, and the Samsung brand with no-hassle Amazon LLC shopping experience makes it worthwhile.
