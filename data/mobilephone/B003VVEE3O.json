This is an antiquated, obsolete, overpriced piece of junk. Microsoft stopped supporting mobile 6x on 1/8/13. This \"phone\" won't run anything else because of the processor. It's slow and the OS is BAD, really bad. If you switch apps (which can happen because of the keyboard), everything you just typed vanishes and you have to start over. Apps don't close even if you hit the X, and you have to terminate them using the app manager. It constantly locks up and you have to press 1+9+power to reboot it. The touch screen is as responsive as a car on ice. The keyboard is laid out badly with the \"home\" key between the Fn key & the space bar + other bad key placements. I have the extended battery on mine and it still won't last past lunch time. I work in a metropolitan area and if it goes into roaming it almost never reconnects to my carrier (unless I reboot). The scanner works great, but if you lose your data connection, what good is it? It's nothing but a scanner passed on as a mobile PC/phone. Don't waste your money on this one.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motorola ES400.  Troubles.", "Author": "S.

Lost count of the times I've had to reboot.If the phone falls asleep on it's own I have to hold down 1,9 and press the power button to reboot.3 times in the last hour.  I have had it lock up while in a call and then had to reboot.I don't know if it's the hardware or the Windows Mobile 6.5 OS, but trying to use the phone for anything is pure frustration.If you use it for emails or texting, be prepared to spend a great deal of time back spacing and retyping.As you're typing the phone falls behind about 6 or 7 characters.Do a search for Motorola ES400 and read the horror stories.Motorola makes great phones.I'm not sure what went wrong here. I hope they are able to offer firmware and software updates to fix some of the problems related to the smart phone functions.I picked it up just before I posted this review and it's locked up. I had used it just before I started typing this.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "ES400 comercial handheld with phone functionality at great price", "Author": "Rais Kanwar", "ReviewID": "R3JA3OC0D8PT1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me say that when you buy this as phone with $500+ price, your expectations set with comparison to iphone or galaxy etc. If you are looking for fancy phone with ultra responsive to touches then this one is not for you.Industrial handhelds are very expensive and comes in variety of configuration. This one is with most of functionality required by people in field operations or supply chain operations.This phone device is very handy, smart looking as compared to other handhelds with brick size and weight. It is loaded with bar code reader, GPS, wifi, camera and fingure print scanner.This is an ideal unit for order taking, retail floors price verification, remote site inspections with realtime data transfers.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "andy", "ReviewID": "RN24JB78O6DVQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have had problems since day one.

It's a great phone. Sure it doesn't have Angry Birds, or Draw Something, but what it does for enterprise use, it's perfect.I got this phone to go from a Motorola MC75, which was a big bulky enterprise phone, to an iPhone, to this.The MC75 was perfect, except size. Motorola made some enhancements, but also in doing so, they made things not play as nice with the new Windows Mobile 6.5 compared to 6.1, but overall it works great.The biggest thing this phone has going for it is the built in amazing barcode scanner. If you work with barcodes in the field or in a warehouse. This is a great device.If you work with text messaging, Internet exclusive apps, and email. Perhaps you can do with out this phone. The other thing is this phone syncs oh so well with Exchange servers due to being a Microsoft product. Most devices nowadays do too, but ActiveSync seems to work so much better with syncing calendars, contacts, emails, and tasks compared to the others.I read the horror stories on Amazon, I wonder if it is due to a work configuration... Some phones have some software loaded on it that causes it to act horrible. I had a work iPhone, customized with their software, horrible piece of technology. Battery would last for 4 hours due to the configuration and security policies.Now the only true issue I have had with this phone is going form WinMo 6.1 to 6.5, is the Internet is a whole different animal. Some links don't open and give a Javascript error. Just because the page is coded a bit differently I've noticed Internet Explorer not liking it. Whereas for some odd reason, the older IE works great with the same exact Intranet Page.Overall, I am happy with this phone. There are some tools out on the Internet that can take a Sprint ES400 and unlock it for 100% total freedom, I was able to to get mine switched to I can use T-Mobile with a SIM Card. For an enterprise phone, Motorola Solutions did alright. Sure beats the iPhone I used to use in the service field.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very bad experience", "Author": "Andres Rivero Diaz", "ReviewID": "R350MRKU9ZMPSU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very bad experience The phone is slow to make calls is the worst thing confused agenda, the camera the slowest of all not to mention extremely uncomfortable to carry it as it is very big and heavy have a lot of functions that in the end there no use is as a scientific calculator keys and functions and many end up using just as a simple calculator.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "POS400: Worst cellphone experience in the past 10 years!", "Author": "Fat Goat", "ReviewID": "RJZDVGXIX2IBW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone should be named the POS400 instead of the ES400!  Being multifunctional it does nothing well.  The Camera is horrible.  There is a painful delay in the shutter so that you will not capture the scene. The Windows Operating system loads very slowly and will hang up during applications -- necessitating the removal of the cover and battery to re-boot the POS400. ..and the ringer?  Sometimes it rings on inbound calls, sometimes not.  On bluetooth or wired headset the ringer automatically goes mute. Being a small brick, the POS400 would be best suited either bluetooth or wired headset -- yet does not work well that way.  Texting is slow and cumbersome.  The POS400 then gives two confirmations of your message being sent and then delivered --  a nice to know, except the messages come up on the screen and you must remove it to do anything else with the phone.  There is no voice recognition software --  so, everything must be manually input  -- and finding your contacts is slow, painful, and clumsy.  This is supposed to be an enterprise device - -- except the applications will not synch with my laptop! Finally, being on a Verizon plan the POS400 does not interface with Verizon's BACKUP MANAGER -- so if something happens, all your contacts on the POS400 are lost.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Over $600 for a cell phone and it's made in China?", "Author": "venividivici", "ReviewID": "R38RS5W6AYVCNP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The best thing about this phone is the worst thing, it weighs a ton.  It borders on barbaric.  Although it is bulky and looks sturdy, it's made in China heritage leads me to believe it will be easily broken.  The battery cover is difficult to remove.  The touch screen and touch pointing device are nice, but there are no soft keys for the menus and the start button is in an illogical place.  The stylus' cap is molded to align only one way with the case, making it difficult to put back (and replace if lost).  Why anybody would pay over $600 for this is beyond me, but appartently there are companies who need this as a data acquisition device.  I was hoping for a SIMPLE well made phone with a full keyboard.  What I got was a huge heavy needlessly complex piece of junk from China and promply returned it.  I will keep my Korean Samsung for the time being.  At least I know the plastic probably wont crack or disintegrate.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003VVEE3O"}}
