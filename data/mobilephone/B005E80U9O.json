{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "Terry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R31MFWE6BPLEO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Blackberry Style as a replacement for the Blackberry Curve that I've had for two years. I think the Blackberry Style is amazing! It's so much faster than my old phone and I'm so happy to get rid of that track ball. The microphone on the Style is located on the front, rather than the bottom, so the party I call can hear my voice much more clearly (as attested by my mother). I love that I can connect via my own wifi network or to the Boost data network. That feature is probably standard on many smartphones, but my Curve didn't have that option. I'm crazy about flip- and slide-phones, so the Style's flip design suits me perfectly.I've read a few reviews where the user complained that there was only one convenience key. Personally, I like that there aren't a bunch of keys on the side. I was always pressing them on the Curve. The Style has only one convenience key and two volume keys on the right side. The ports for charging, ear buds and micro SD card (which was included) are on the left. While the camera is an improvement, its placement is unfortunate. It can be a bit awkward holding the phone while keeping your finger out of the viewfinder.Since I was upgrading from another Blackberry, I had the advantage of using the Blackberry Desktop Manager to configure many features for me. My email and Blackberry App World were migrated automatically, as well as my calendar, contacts and several apps that I use often. I was a little disappointed that a couple of apps wouldn't migrate due to OS 6 incompatibility, but I'll live without them (and maybe find better apps to replace them).I'm very pleased with my new Blackberry Style and I'll hopefully be using it for a long time to come.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my blackberry flip", "Author": "Audrey", "ReviewID": "R2ZNJ1M3RRTSD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Flips are like so early 2000 but i love that i could have the quality of a blackberry and a flip at the same time (Love flips!). This phone looks way better in person. It has the Facebook and Youtube app already installed, along with Twitter and Myspace if you're still into that. The internet really looks like the internet and the interface is awesome in that it moves so swift and stylish.Sprint had this same phone early this year and last year for over four-hundred dollars, I know because thats how long i've been wanting this phone. But It took me till now to get it because i miraculously saw that it was half the price on boost. Plus the 110 a month bill using sprint is only 60 using boost. what a savings!I love my phone, and i don't even like cellphones. Plus this phone comes with a 8GB micro sd card already installed and the charger converts into a usb cord for your computer or laptop if you want to transfer pics or music. Plus earbuds! too cool.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice but has a few problems", "Author": "Marcia", "ReviewID": "R3R3XBGFZ9OJXJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone because I love blackberry phones, and this is not a bad phone . But the problem that I am having is when you plug it in to charge it does not want to charge. I have to play around with the charger and the port of the phone to get it to charge. Also when I try to turn up my music I have to play with the volume key just to get it to work. when I use the volume down key it restarts my song to the beginning, which it is not suppose to do.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Tammy Crouch", "ReviewID": "R2L5Q8I1P357B9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first blackberry.

I received the phone and used it for TWO WEEKS before it stopped working properly. I contacted Boost Mobile who walked me through troubleshooting and determined it was NOT their service, it was a problem with the PHONE. So, I contacted shopcelldeals to get this resolved and received a stupid response from them: \"Have you contacted Boost Mobile, as this sounds like a service issue and not a phone issue.\" Duh! Of course I contacted them first! It took these people (shopcelldeals) until 8pm tonight to get back to me after I contacted them yesterday afternoon! Now I have to wait again for them to respond!! Every day I am without a phone, I am losing money for my business! I filed a complaint with Amazon.com, but who knows how long till I get a workable phone!! HORRIBLE service!
