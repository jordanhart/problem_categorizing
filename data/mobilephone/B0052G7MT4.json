Heck, I even wrote an awesome review about this phone. But that all changed over time. The first few weeks it was really neat. I had the huge bulky Body Glove on it. A screen protector, and all the care I've ever put in a cellphone.The texting is fun, the screen sucks, and the camera is even worse. The text aspect is what the phone was evolved around. Although it fails. The keyboard is nice, but cramped and kinda too flush with the rest of the phone. It's hard to determine each separate key. Now why does it suck?It can't keep up with fast texting. It lags extremely bad.The so called \"auto-correct\" features are terrible. It doesn't auto correct, it opens up a box of options it could be... The worst part is that the box has to be opened manually. It's practically impossible as well. It pops the smallest box ever, with an even smaller gray arrow to open the list of options. While if the touch screen was capacitive it'd be so much easier, but the screen is resistive. EnV Touch anyone? You have to actually apply pressure to the screen and it's so inaccurate. Forget the box, learn how to spell.The camera is a whooping 1.3mp... stand back if you see someone talking pictures with this bad boy. Just 5 feet away and you're a blurred pixalated piece if garbage.It can't record video, it can't play videos either by the way, and loading pictures is a nightmare. If you wanna show someone that picture of that awesome car show, forget it. It take 3 years to load a picture. Of course this all got worse over time, to the point it wouldn't even display the thumbnails. You had to guess which picture you wanted to see out of all the same thousands of \"loading screen\" thumbnails. Picture Roulette?Calling isn't the best, certainly isn't the worst though. It has pretty decent reception but over time it decayed. Messages sent fast when I had service. Now it takes it's sweet precious time to send messages even in areas of full coverage. Calls take for-ever to complete and once they answer, it's hard to hear them. No matter how high your volume is. Luckily enough, the calls rarely drop. About the messaging, you won't like it if you're a heavy texter. Why? If you're sending a message to someone, and you're phone is receiving a message at the same time, it stays on the \"sending\" screen FOREVER! Until you manually cancel the message, receive the other message, and go back to resend the failed message. Talk about a headache...The phone is very small, the screen is tiny for a touchscreen phone. It's hard to actually select the option you want. Plus calibration is impossible. Seriously, I can't get through the first calibration point.The battery life is a joke. I get up at 7am and it depletes around 9pm. Oh well. The music player is \"O.K.\"It features a 3.5mm headphone jack, so use those fancy Beats. The music player is in a blue color scheme that can't be changed. The music will only play within the music player. You cannot multi-task and listen to music unfortunately. What's that mean? You can't put your music player in the background and  listen to music while texting or anything else.Over time of course this feature died... the 3.5mm headphone jack will only play audio out of all my headphones on the left ear. That really sucks.Anything about this phone I'm forgetting, isn't worth mentioning. I'd avoid this phone, if need a phone and this is your only option go for it.I had this phone since August 2011, and it fell apart a little every day till the point I retired it in April 2012. So as you can see it's not very durable. Even with a case, it destroys itself in the inside.I went out and bought a Windows Phone. I'm surprised at how Verizon gives feature phones the middle finger in features, usability, and durability. It's sad really, cause not everyone wants a freaking 70 dollar a month data package.Out of all feature phones out there, avoid the touch screen phones. Their screens are terrible, and never provide multi-touch or anything \"fancy\". Get a Samsung Zeal, or a GzOne Casio phone.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Cosmos Phone  VN270", "Author": "Barbara Maynard", "ReviewID": "RVO2CF818EM67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my granddaughter loves the touch screen it makes it easy amd fast for her to use when in a hurry", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Fast Service!", "Author": "christina wallace", "ReviewID": "RZF3K69BIC8W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a used phone and it was in top shape and the service was very fast and i highly recommend NEW2YOUCELLULAR services.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't even bother", "Author": "Aussie Mom", "ReviewID": "RGN0H6MDC423W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not sure who refurb'd this phone, but it's awful.

It was nice at first. I don't text, surf the web, and whatnot that you cool kids do these days. I need a phone to store numbers and make calls. This phone hasn't filled that basic need for the past six months.The touch screen malfunctioned within the first week of ownership. I exchanged the phone for a new one, which was slow but functional for the following year and a half. One average day, I received an email from Verizon stating that I was eligible for an upgrade. This would be wonderful news if I were considering renewing my contract. During the next week the screen stopped responding to touch (hmmm - conspiracy, anyone?). The phone is useless without the touch screen. I use voice dial to call the contacts in my list, but I can't add any new contacts. Nor can I look up anyone's number or return a missed call after checking voicemail.I've been paying Verizon $70 a month for a POS phone that can't even make a call. <sigh> Just biding my time until I'm contract free...BTW - I have phones from 10+ years ago that still function.

So, naturally at fist i thought it was amazing. I loved how it was a touch screen so to me it seemed closer to a smart phone, I loved how small and portable it was, the slide out keyboard, even all of the ringtones. Don't get me wrong i still like some of those features, but over time everything started going down hill. After a few months the touch screen became so bad i had to press down so hard my finger would turn white. This is probably what I hate most about this phone. For a while I thought it was because of the screen protector i had put on it but i took it off and nothing changed. Another example of a Con for this phone is the Media Messages. The phone has many apps that you can get if you have a data plan but if you don't, there are constant advertisements that go off at no scheduled time. Often times it wakes me up in the middle of the night advertising \"Bing's Mobile Email\" or \"VZ Navigator.\" It is extremely annoying and even after I turned off the messages in settings it still goes off. This phone is just hard to use in general, but if you are looking for a phone to JUST call contacts then I guess its okay. The slide out keyboard is really good; i do like that a lot, but the text message set up is definitely NOT efficient. To sum things up, unless you are the kind of person who all they would do on their phone is call people in their contacts (because of the touch screen, the number dial-er is really hard to use) then DO NOT get this phone.

I love this phone. have been thinking about getting a smartphone (to have the best camera) but i can't imagine living without this phone. lol. that's why i said its the best phone i have ever had. my favorite thing about the phone is that i can just start typing on the keyboard and it opens the notepad and when i'm done i press save and i have a new note. how easy is that! all phones should have this feature.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a decent phone - these reviews are skewed.", "Author": "C.

I would buy this phone again, in fact I dropped mine in the dishwater and couldn't bring it back so I am shopping around for one right now. Battery life is also extremely good; only have to charge it every three days or so - I use my phone to text and for calls only. The only problem I have ever had with the phone is that occasionally, when I slide it open, it shuts off and I have to turn it back on. Recent texts are lost for some reason when it shuts off like that, but not all saved texts.  My husband got his the same time I did and has never had this problem.

The camera to start is very blurry, it is very tough to get a photo that is understandable to someone that doesn't know what you took a picture of, so if you like taking pictures, and especially showing them to others, then this phone is not for you. Next, call clarity is terrible, even with the clarity at max (which you can set in the settings.) You can really understand people ONLY if you're both calling from quiet locations, otherwise you will not be able to understand them, and vice versa.

The third one I have now is not any better than the first two. They all would constantly reset themselves randomly. I have been in the middle of texts and phone calls and the phone will just decide to reset itself.There have been numerous occasions where the phone would just stop making/receiving texts/calls for the whole day. I have no idea why it did that, and there was no explanation. I have reset this phone more times than I can count and it always does the same thing.I am a heavy texter and this phone cannot keep up with me.

Nice and large it was an attractive silver with the buttons being illuminated in a beautiful blue.

Impossible to see unless you are texting in the dark and I found myself going back over and over and over to correct mistakes I made all the time. I finally bought a Samsung Rogue after reading the reviews on Cnet, and guess what? NIGHT AND DAY with the keyboards, Samsungs being responsive, quick and easy as heck to type on.
