I have AT&T; service and was un-able to get picture messages. I called Sony, AT&T; and no one was able to help me. The features of the phone is great, but too compact for me. Texting was too time consuming, and placing a call was not that easy as well. I like the look and what it offered but it needs to be in a much larger body. Pictures were great, moving through the phone was fast, but just was un-happy that I paid so much for the phone and could not get picture messages, nor use the video calling feature. How funny, now AT&T; carries this phone, I would have been able to use all the features now.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "waste of money!!!", "Author": "jessica", "ReviewID": "RFOWENHJIZ07D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this was a waste pf money i feel like no one should get this, i mean the camera is great but takes forever to send pics and videos and i only had this phone for not even two weeks and i had to return it of how many problems it gave me .. the charger just stop working", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Xperia's bastard child?", "Author": "N. Lau", "ReviewID": "R1DY0VAGLT5JK7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "\"I feel stupid for sticking with Sony Ericsson\" that's how I felt after turning on this phone. I mean after using Xperia X1a, I just thought SE had a lot of catching up to do in the smart phone market. So I was prepared to be wowed by this phone but I can't say I am at all impressed with it. Anyhow perhaps I am a bit too critical in comparing the Vivaz with the X1 but heres what I thought:First off the casing feels cheap (it's just plastic all around) and when you try to pry open the back cover it sometimes feel as though it's going to crack. SE was nice enough to leave a 8gb memory card in the slot. The battery life like in most SE phones seems to last pretty long (I didn't time it so can't give you an estimate). The usb port has a plastic cover which is situated in an awkward position so as to make it quite hard to just simply plug in the cable for a charge. The camera lens does not have a cover so it seems to me any prolong use will inevitably scratch the lens. Other than that the phone has a nice slim design and a glossy finish.Now for the Symbian OS... I had a lot of trouble navigating around. I couldn't get my email to sync up with the phone. I ended up opening too many apps and the phone started freezing up. And it was then that I realized I had to click option for every application and click exit in order for the application to close. As for the panels, I found it a bit awkward, since I don't use twitter and I don't feel compelled to look at what seems to be the flow of water in the background. But I have to say the multimedia panel is quite nice and I think if you like the PS3 and PSP layout then the controls feel more natural. Internet browsing was slow and altogether an unexciting experience. The speaker didn't exactly play crisp sounding music, rather it sounded like an analog radio. But hey at least they give you a screen protector and a leather jacket for the phone, I ve never seen that before.. But I doubt any of those things would protect the phone from one's frustration and anger that would no doubt be caused by the phone's unfriendly user interface.To sum it all up, I really would not recommend anyone to buy this phone. It's not exactly user friendly..", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it!!!", "Author": "robin wong", "ReviewID": "R18BEJNIC8OLT1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone in June of this year and it died on me two weeks ago!  Was trying to download some pictures from the phone onto the computer and left it there for, like, 20 minutes and it burned the motherboard of the phone.  The picture quality was superb, that's about it.  All the other negatives like, can't download pictures nor send 'em, etc, and too many to list.  Just stay away from this model will save you lots of headaches and money.  Only two words can describe my experience with this phone that cost me over $275:  It Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small and efficient Symbian", "Author": "Christer", "ReviewID": "R29MOFB9DWC5CJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone that does most of the things that I want a phone to do: multiple email accounts, Opera Mini, Skype.There are a few things that bring this phone down from a perfect score. The call quality is somewhat poor - microphone picks up any wind and the speaker gives static. The Symbian installation seems somewhat non-complete: apps die once in a while when turning the phone sideways, if you keep the phone running more than 24 hours and try to take a photo - the phone will complain about insufficient memory, I have yet to figure out how to add Opera or Skype to the shortcuts in the top menu.However, even with these quirks this is one of the best phones I've owned (T-28 through W890i).

Let's see, where to start...Scolling is a problem. There's no way to scroll one line at a time, so if you have a long list of contacts or messages that require you to scroll, you will have a hard time stopping at the right point you want it to. Changing screen orientation is not very sensitive. When you turn it around, there is a delay in the change of orientation, and sometimes it doesn't change at all. You have to click on menus to active it, sort of to wake it up from hibernation. Battery life is extremely inconsistent. Phone audio is inconsistent, and the media audio is pretty bad.
