{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Business & Entertainment Phone", "Author": "Diego Vega Aguirre", "ReviewID": "R1SL76LU2H3F6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for about six weeks by now. Before I got the HTC Surround I used Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about HTC Surround.Dimensions and CharacteristicsI think the screen size is the same of iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I can't find any differences between them, of course there might be some technical differences but I am not able to notice them with my eyes :).The phone size is very similar to the iPhone; HTC Surround is a little bigger because of the speaker, but I would say there is no size difference. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience.User InterfaceMicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 with \"Metro\". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are \"alive\" and are not static icons like the iPhone. The tiles gives you information about your contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger), some applications are using live tiles like Weather channel, so you don't have to enter the app or contacts to see the information. I think the \"live tiles\" will be very popular in the near future, because they can give you the information you need without wasting any time opening the application unless you need more info from it. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them.Zune vs. iTunesAfter using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the UI is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod.TouchscreenI think HTC's touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!)Marketplace vs. AppstoreIn Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms, but in US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Whatsapp, Waze, Google Maps and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered in fall this year). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software.KeyboardIf you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that help you to correct misspelled words (only English), since 99% of the time I write in Spanish I have turned off that option so I cannot tell you if it is good or not.Office HubI expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC, or transfer files from the PC to the Phone. Microsoft has announced that Office Hub will be much better with the next upgrade (codename Mango)ConclusionIn conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like this phone. Of course there are things to be done before it reaches the level of Android or iOS, but Microsoft is doing a great job with Phone manufacturers like HTC.PS: Last week I got the \"NoDo\" update, and now I am able to copy/paste information.--- Update: nov 6 2011 ---Many things have changed in the OS since my original review with Mango update (WP7.5) which was delivered last month. Live tiles as expected are more useful today, now you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS.In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS.Now I have Whatsapp and soon will have Skype. Waze and Google Maps still missing but I hope sooner than later they will be available.There are many changes in the phone with the upgrade of the \"new\" OS (WP7.5) and I don't want to make this review longer than it is already, I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Windows Phone", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R2V8JUXR352MZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is quick and extremely responsive.

PHONES ARE SOLD PAST WARRANTY.  You will not be able to get any help from the manufacturer, and they will charge you at least $40 just to take a look if anything should go wrong.  Many comments show the phone consistently has problems 3-6 months past purchase.I ordered this phone February of 2012.  It initially functioned fine, though the cosmetics (plastics on the surface, colored designs &c;) came off within a few weeks.  I had trouble with the charger within a month of ordering - it did not fit snugly into the phone but buying another USB chrarger solved the problem.After 3 months, the phone has started to reboot constantly and always reverts to \"earlier\" states - losing recent messages, pictures &c.;  It seems like the storage card (microSD inside the phone, inaccessible without voiding warranty) may have gotten loose.  Some searching told me this seems to be a common problem with HTC Windows 7 phones.  My phone is currently bricked with a \"STORAGE CARD NOT WORKING\" error message.I called HTC and they told me the phone's warranty expired in November 2011, months before I purchased it and that I have no recourse except to send it in for out of warranty evaluation.  Once they look at it, they will quote me a price, usually between $100-150, and if i decide against it, I will be charged $40 for my troubles.I feel silly having bought this phone despite numerous reviews that have cited this exact problem.

My cousin has this phone, she bought it about a year ago and she loves it. I played with it from time to time and found it easy to use and very stable (unlike my Android phone), and the slideup speakers to be cool. It eventually inspired me to buy an HTC Radar 4G and switch to T-Mobile as my carrier. I love WinPhone 7.5, so much so that I wanted to become a developer.Which led me to purchase this \"unlocked\" phone, to use as a development phone. I purchased it from OEM Planet (aka Young Kimbrogh) fulfilled by Amazon.com.  Unfortunately the phone never worked.  It would turn on, show the HTC logo, and then just vibrate and reboot itself.  I even purchased a genuine AT&T; SIM card and activated the SIM card (against my wishes... as I'd had some real bad experience with AT&T; before!) but it didn't make no difference, the phone simply refused to go beyond the logo screen!Guys... If anyone has bought an unlocked Surround that works, please let me know where you bought it from! Thanks.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Decent Handset", "Author": "Alessandro Fuchs", "ReviewID": "R8HFUPJK8KXPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All in all the HTC Surround is a great handset.I purchased the device for use with the Straight Talk Sim Card program.  It works very well excluding the ability to send mms which is a issue which is universal to WP7 devices.On to the device.THE GOOD:Screen - The device has a very bright screen that is of decent quality. Its not an AMOLED but its close.Cellular Modem - I looked this up as best as I could before hand to see if this was an HSPA+ device.  It does appear to be an HSPA+ device. I have speedtested it at well over 4+mbps on straight talks att mvno network.Physical Dimensions - The phone is a good size and heft. It feels like a sturdy device and the back covers matte finish gives it a sophisticated feel.Speaker - Other reviewers have listed this as not all too impressive, I would disagree here. I think the speaker adds a lot to the device and is miles betters than a standalone smartphone speaker. It outputs a full rich sound.  Is it a reason to buy the phone, well , no not really but its a nice bonus.Performance - Like every other windows device the surround has a smooth user experience with no hickups or bugs. Netflix streaming was smooth and high quality. Apps functioned very well with no noticeable issues.THE BAD:Updates - As this is an older handset it required over 8 updates to be installed prior to being functional.  This process took well over 2.5 hours.Kick Stand - The kick stand seems a bit flimsy.The Camera - The video recording component forgets its settings every time you close out. Not a huge issue for me but it could be for some.The Big Picture:All in all the HTC Surround is a solid WP7 Device.  You should not, I repeat should not buy this device for its speaker.  It is a great all around smartphone with a great screen, good performance and great feel, that just happens to have a nice slide out speaker system, not the other way around.  If you are looking for a device without a physical keyboard that is thin light and sturdy with good performance that is priced competitively this is a great choice.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good price, not such good phone", "Author": "Reinita55", "ReviewID": "R1FK2B7MJ563D3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Even though the OS is very nice, it doesn't work well when it's come to play apps at background, for example, to see my Whatsapp messages, I have to open the app and then all my messages arrive at once, when I closed the app it gave my a notification but it takes more that I would like to, Whatsapp is not stable  as it is in IOS, Android or even BBAfter three month of used, the wireless funcion didn't work anymore, I even replaced the antena and still nothing, I thought it was an OS problem but I couldn't find a proper support for Windows Mobile in my country, so I had to buy an other phoneMaybe I had bad luck, I did liked the phone but it didn't work for me.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC", "Author": "Ssalazar", "ReviewID": "R3A30CX22HGW3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello,In my job all people uses bb, nokia, samsung's cellophones, etc. So my phone was an experiment, and I didn't think i will like it at all.

I think the setup is very well designed, i can easily manouver through the different applications with ease. its very responsive! I was very impressed how well i could text with out making many mistakes. the screen is bright and colors displayed are amazing. the camera quality is very good, no complaints whatsoever. I love listening to music! and with the slide out speaker, i can take music with me wherever i go.  its pre loaded with 16gb of internal memory.  the only things i wasn't fond of was first, theres no spot for a micro sd card. but i can't fill up 16 gb of memory so thats not a big issue. and last the battery is pretty good, but i wish it could be a little longer.

If you do not plan on listening listening to music for at least a couple hours a week through its speaker, I would suggest going with a thinner phone.  The speaker is nice but does add bulk to the phone and after a couple weeks never really snaps shut - this is was why I gave it a 4 and not a 5.  I also do not like the rocker volume button or camera button - they feel cheap.This is my first smart phone and I am not aware of the capabilities of Apple and Android.

The design is pretty. I didnt find the dimensions uncomfortable. It could be a little bit thiner but it is ok, at least for me.The speaker, it has been something that some people like and some other hate. I like it, because it is able to sound as loud as i need to listen music while I brush my teeth, take a bath, and do some other stuff. And loud enough to hear the alarm and wake up.It has a good sound quality. Now, one thing that you should think about is that this is a phone speaker, not a home theatre speaker. Of course dont expect a 3D super surround sound. But you will be able to get a good stereo sound and a good quality in the definitions of each sound that it plays. For a phone speaker it is ok.If you think that you wont be getting any benefits from it, then you should consider another phone, but if you think you can, then i think you should give it a try.The screen is big enough to see nice images and to browse web content and play games. It is very responsive and have good colors.Now, about WP7.  It is a good mobile OS. Of course maybe android and ios already do lots of stuff and even more than this one, BUT what i see here is that wp7 is capable of displaying the info about everything just in front of you without you having to tap or click 3 times to get the info that you need.for example you can recall, call back o make a simple call as quickly as 2 taps in the screen. Now, the UI is very friendly. This tiles show infovery nicely. For example you can see updated status from your friends, pictures that you have taken with the camera and lots of other stuff.They really wanted to make things simple and they did. Its very easy to learn how to use this phone. At least in one or 2 days you will be able to use it perfectly.Another thing that you should consider is that it is extremly fast. You dont have to wait between menus or scrolling. And there are lots of programs in the market place. And more are coming soon.Defenitvely an excellent phone. You will be happy to have one of this. Other WP7 phones are similar. WP7 is a good OS, so dont worry about.

I bought one in 2012 to replace a broken Samsung Focus. The Focus lasted 18 months of torture, and the Surround barley made it 4 months.The Surround has two pop-up speakers and a kick stand to watch Netflix, YouTube and listen to music. The problem is that this adds a LOT of bulk to the device. The sliding mechanism is more fragile than a phone without moving parts and this phone does not even benefit from having a real keyboard. Worse still is that you have to slide the speakers out when playing anything or the sound will come out muffled.Now I didn't really mind the sliding speakers as I used the phone for Netflix a lot. The pop-up speakers and kickstand worked fine for watching movies on the go. But the experience was still bad because of the screen. For whatever reason, HTC decided to use some very old tech on the screen. Blacks are washed out and gray. Colors don't pop. The screen was fairly small at 3.7\" and motion wasn't as smooth as on the Samsung Focus. All in all, it's a pretty terrible viewing experience. This is completely inexcusable for any device running Windows Phone that relies so heavily on deep blacks and saturated colors.So how about durability? Yeah, not so much. As I said, this phone lasted 4 months compared to my Previous Samsung Focus under the same conditions (lasting 18 months). When dropped, the screen shattered. This was no Gorilla Glass, and it showed.So how about performance? The Surround uses the same Snapdragon processor of other first generation Windows Phones and many Android phones of that time (late 2010). The Surround uses a slower 16GB Sandisk SD hard for its internal memory (it is not swappable, and cannot be removed). The result is that the phone takes a lot longer loading apps then other phones using NAND memory such as the Focus.If you are looking for a cheap replacement smartphone running WP7, the Samsung Focus is a better alternative. If you want something running WP8, try the Nokia 520.

My Zune HD has been circling the brink for a while, and in the past couple weeks it's been a sad remnant of it's former self.

It's got a high quality amplifier too, and I no longer carry a portable amp.If your Zune dead or is about to bite the dust --look no further.

These boneheads sent the phone without the back piece that covers the back and they sent the wrong battery :( who does that?? I called them and was shocked that they knew why I was calling before I could finish my sentence. So I then thought wow these people are stupid. The rep says to me, \"We are sending out the back and the correct battery for your phone, you should get it tomorrow.\" Well yeah I got the shipment the next day with another phone and no battery!!

Please help.Tech Reply:Please be advised that once you change your Windows Live ID, a waiting period of 6 Months will take place before you are allowed to again change your email address. Since you mentioned that you already renamed your account, I would recommend that you change your Windows Live ID after 6 months and see if you would encounter any error message.My Response:Wow, that's stupid! Why does it let you change it to begin with? From reading other posts and forums it sounds like this is a big issue. People are changing it not knowing it'll screw up their windows phone. What's the benefit to Microsoft for waiting 6 months to let a Windows Phone owner change their ID back to the previous ID after a screw up? It's not like you guys informed us of this issue. If I've got to wait 6 months to get my phone syncing again, I'm going to drop this Windows Phone for another phone ops at the end of my contract in 4 months.Tech Response:Although I really want to help you with this issue, the system is desgined to have a waiting period for Windows Live ID that has been changed.
