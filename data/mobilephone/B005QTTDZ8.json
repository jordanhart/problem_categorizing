By skip I mean it goes onto the next podcast. It does the same thing when I listen to Pandora radio I.e. Changes on it's own to the next song without my hitting the next advance button. I have tried shutting off the accelerometer but his has not helped at all. I a convinced this is one of the bad batches that HTC made.

When my daughter received the first phone, she was so very excited because she was getting an early Christmas gift to take pictures and send them to her friends. She was not able to send nor receive pictures. We took the phone to T-MOBILE and they changed the settings but it still did not work so we returned it and purchased another. Amazon tried to make it right by sending it 2 days deliver so we would have it before Christmas but the delivery was delayed and I did not receive the phone till Christmas Eve. I returned from work on Christmas eve and learned that the new phone did not work. I took it to the AT&T; store and they told me that the phone was damaged as it would not stay on, even after being charged overnight.  Now, it will be a sad Christmas because not only could my daughter not take pictures but she does not have a phone.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "THE WORST ITEM EVER IT CANT BE WORST", "Author": "sheliete  Golding-Bryan", "ReviewID": "R10MEOH1JH1ZG7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THE PHONE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 1 MONTH.
