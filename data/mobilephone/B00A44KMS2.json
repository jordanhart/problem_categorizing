It took me a few hours to understand how to set this phone up with the Straight-Talk carrier, but I now have a really fast (4G compared to my old 1440baud 3G) service on the Straight Talk network for only $45 a month.  Unlimited everything and a 4\" screen to boot.  This beats my old Android by leaps and bounds.  I also learned that if you buy an International unlocked HTC Sensation it will set up a little easier.  Transferring contacts and the like was a breeze.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Qualcomm\u00ae APQ8060, 1.5GHz dual core, MDM8220T modem, Audio DSP and SRS WOWTM HD surround sound.\n1GB RAM, 16GB ROM (expandable to 48GB using microSDTM card (not included)).\n4.3-inch super LCD qHD screen (960 x 540), capacitive touch screen.\nGSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900, UMTS1700/2100/AWS, UMTS2100, 1900, 850.\nAndroidTM 2.3 (Gingerbread) with HTC SenseTM.", "Name": "HTC Amaze 4G Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5142WS6f0FL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A44KMS2"}}
