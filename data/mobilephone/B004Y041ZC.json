I wanted something cheap but fun. That being said there really wasn't any other choice on Virgin mobile for me.I've had mixed feelings for this phone over the month or so I've owned it.The phone is pretty awesome because it texts really fast, it has an OK camera, not great, but then again if a great camera was on your agenda you wouldn't even be looking here. Google maps on this phone came in pretty this summer on my job. I would get texts to random locations I needed to be at and plugging them into the Google maps on this for directions was pretty simple. The music player function is pretty cool as wellI didn't give it all 5 stars because there is some lag when the keyboard slides open after some time using itWhat I don't like about this phone is the lack of games and ringtones. Virgin mobile continues to advertise this as a phone capable of using ringtones and it simply doesn't. Not a deal breaker though if you just want it for texting.I still love it though and would recommend it to anyone who wants something simple with good battery life.

The provided charger is a \"quick-charge\" which will ruin both the charger and battery in your phone by cracking the anodes due to overheating. I would suggest getting a standard Samsung charger, e.i., the one for the T369, or a Kindle charger, since they are all compatible.[...]It's a bit expensive, I know, but it will save you a bundle on a new battery, and/or phone when the current charger blasts it out of the water", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this phone!", "Author": "crudd13", "ReviewID": "RH50420EN73YP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My dad bought me this phone for my birthday yesterday and we ordered it from amazon.

The camera is great except that it doesnt zoom but the video camcorder does. I love how youtube works and how awesome this phone is!

BUT, as a modern day consumer, it lacks in a few areas. Here are my likes and dislikes.Like:Battery. It lasts about 2 days with moderate use. Just don't use the web or it will go down fast.Keyboard: This is a love/ hate. I like the form factor and the feel of the keys. But I wish they were farther apart so I could type faster.Screen: It's pretty large for a feature phone. 2.4 inches is decent and everything is pretty clear.Dislikes:Operating system. The Virgin Mobile menu system is pretty clean cut, but the messaging is a mess. The IM client could use a lot of work, and some of the options are confusing. The text folder isn't organized well. New texts aren't auto sorted to the top, but to when they were last texted by you, which leads to a lot of searching and scrolling. The New Alerts is like a notification area, but it's also a bit confusing. I don't like it.Camera: Terrible. No color and blurry. It doesn't even pass as 1.3 megapixels.Web: Not an HTML browser. Just some crappy mobile version that barely handles facebook and even navigating that is a chore. And it drains your battery in less than an hour. It's a waste to pay $35 for unlimited web if you can't even use it.Overall if you're fine with a basic calling/ messaging phone with not many bells or whistles, then this is a good phone.

Had the phone one week and while charging the phone the LCD screen broke and had a large black spot in the middle with discolored area on the rest of the screen. Contacted Samsung support who said the phone was covered under warranty and to send in for repair which I did. We received no contact (email or phone) from Samsung for three weeks until we got an email saying the phone was being shipped back...unfortunately it was our broken phone. I called Samsung support again and they said the LCD screen was not covered under warranty and there was a charge to fix it and that they had emailed us the information. They never emailed us any info about any charges and when you check the warranty they never mention anything about the LCD screen not being covered. Lots of references to physical damage (which we did not have, never dropped it, hit it or tried to damage it) and water damage (again no water or moisture touched the phone). I tried sending an email detailing our problems, but the response I got was a \"canned\" response telling me to review the warranty and if I had a problem to contact support for directions on sending the phone for repair...everything I had already done!

The features and functions of the phone are basic, as described, and if you're not looking for anything too fancy, or are on the Paylo or Assurance Wireless plan, then your options are pretty limited.My advice, read the other numerous reviews that say pretty much the same thing as I am saying.

Battery Life is pretty bad though on the phone.  As for the company the RECEPTION almost doesn't exist.  Customer Service is awful.  Everytime I go to add money to my daughters account, it doesn't work and I have to call them which half the time a recording says that my call can't be completed at this time try again later and when I finally do get someone I can't understand them.  I purchased it for my daughter and she even gets frustrated with it and she's 8.  She got it for Christmas so she could talk to her father who lives in a different household and most of the time he can't hear her or she can't hear him or the call is lost.  If your looking for something on the less expensive side, don't' go this route, it may sound good, but it's not.  Save your time and money and forget about Virgin Mobile!  I would have been better off just adding her to my contract phone, it would've saved a lot of time and aggravation! That is actually what I am planning on doing.  I've had enough.  What if someone had an emergency and couldn't get reception?  We literally have to walk around the house and hold the phone up to find a spot that will at least give us one bar, same goes for outside.  In the 3 months that we've had this I have not seen the reception bar full.  As for the battery it's unreliable.  One day it's good and will last for a few days and another day you charge it and in a few hours it's dead, keep in mind that she doesn't even use it all that much, maybe once a day if that.  The only good thing about this phone and plan is the data and texting.  For $35 she gets unlimited texting and data.  It's a waste though because she doesn't text very often and she's not surfing the web on the phone.  So if you just want a phone to text on than maybe the plan would be right for you, but don't count on talking too much because chances are no one will be able to hear you!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a Phone, Smart No, Phone, Yes!", "Author": "FreshNess", "ReviewID": "R3HHYC7EZSPVRX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is easy to use and serves it's purpose as a phone, just don;t expect to go surfing the web California Rip Tide Style, its slow and lackluster.

This is not my first. I really only remember the bad because it has so many problems.1) Call quality sucks. I have constant reception problems on Virgin Mobile, but I also had problems with my other Samsung (I'd have to look up the model name) while with AT&T.; Since those two carriers are not even of the same type (CDMA vs GSM), I'm faulting Samsung.2) No control over blocking your number from people you call OR even forwarding calls to voicemail while you are on the phone. I do NOT like interruptions and I think voicemail is there for a reason so I want to be able to NOT have a constant reminder that someone is calling me even after I've sent it to voicemail (beeping never stops until I guess the person is done leaving voicemail -- ridiculous). For the caller ID block I had to ask Virgin Mobile to allow that to be my default. They set it at their end. My other Samsung allowed me to set it on the phone -- go figure!3) You cannot assign your own ringtones from your own music. Yes, you can \"download\" them, but those are for pay. The only options are Download, Preloaded, or No Ringtone. There may be a hack, but it is not an easy to find hack since every website I visited about this said that this phone just doesn't support your own ringtones. Again, my other Samsung DID do this. You CAN add music to the phone or an SD card to play it on the phone, BUT you absolutely cannot take those songs and link them to ringtones. This is the BREW OS, not Android, so I'm quite sure hacking isn't as easy as it would be on an Android phone. All I know is I tried for weeks to make my songs (or even parts of songs) into ringtones and I could never make it happen.In the end, the phone is just too restrictive! Even my RAZR allowed me to assign ringtones and block my phone number from people I called. It's just lame.OK, that last comment was lame, but that's the way it is.

The reason I purchased it was the price $80 new (and that was almost a year ago) versus the LG Optimus V the phone I really wanted but was $150 at the time.It's a good middle road phone between a basic phone and a smart/Droid phone.  If you are a big texter, this phone is excellent, the slide out qwerty keyboard had raised keys so you can type by feel and it sends and received texts fairly quickly.  Call quality is good, clear, good speaker and microphone.Downside, its not touch screen.  The LG Optimus V is now $95 new and also if you need qwerty and a touch screen you can get the Samsung Intercept for $80 new.  Also the internet isnt zippy with the 3G and also the screen is about an inch smaller versus most smart phones. Also the camera I would say blows, it has no zoom or flash and have been dissapointed with that aspect of the phone.The last small gripe I have with this phone is the keylock.  If you manually lock the keypad and then put it on your pocket, it only takes one hit of the 'cancel' button and your phone is live.  I have butt dialed my friends at least 5 times with this error in design and it can be embarrassing and eat up your minutes.  If you want a good smart-phone, spend the extra $25 and get the LG Optimus V, which has excellent reviews and I have three friends who own it and rave about it.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok if bugs and inconsistencies don't bother you.", "Author": "SnowBelted", "ReviewID": "R3LTY8BTPZ2XA1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this phone with the intention of using it for minimal internet usage as well as text/phone.Cons:The phone itself (talk/text/camera):-battery life degrades after a couple of months-key lock decides when it wants to work, not you-buttons on side of phone get in the way when typing and/or talking (perfectly placed where your hands naturally sit)-voice recognition turns on when you want to use ear phones with media player; no way to disable it-camera zoom doesn't actually zoom-can't reprogram/assign keys-\"entering/leaving service area\" notifications interrupt or stop whatever you're trying to do-when sending multiple pictures, you have to exit out of the photos application after EACH picture you want to send/upload or it will send the first picture you sent, multiple times (facebook or text).The internet:-sometimes the browser decides it doesn't want to load (if you exit out and reload a second time it works, same with a lot of links.-browser will start to load and then stop randomly-the url's on the bookmarks change randomly sometimes, often times from the mobile site to the non-mobile site-browser won't recognize that Java IS enabled, won't browse to sites that need it enabled-can only view a handful of sites that have mobile access; some sites with mobile access don't load-text messages to the phone stop any internet process; makes any process you're trying to complete (dismissing the text etc.) cause the phone to lag or freeze-VERY limited bookmark list (only 20 spots to use, one being the Homepage that can not be deleted)-doesn't resize images of textThe Pros:-Pretty good camera for what it is. The zoom is terrible but the panoramic and lighting settings are pretty nice.-holds a lot of pictures before you have to delete any.-decent speakers-has a variety of ringtonesNow that I'm really have a hard time coming up with more Pro's, I'll conclude in saying that it's a decent phone for the price if you don't use the internet too much (or care how it works).

Buttons inoperable/phone \"freezes\" at times requiring re-start2. Power button won't shut off requiring battery to be removed then replaced3. Phone enters and leaves Virgin Mobile service area for no particular reason while in the same spot.I have experienced all three of these. Another problem I've had is that the phone would not stay off when I turned it off...it would automatically reboot.I think I've eliminated problems #1, 2, and the phone auto rebooting. The battery compartment is not tight at all, meaning the battery contacts easily come apart from the phone contacts after a good jostle, or setting down firmly on a table. In fact, any time I carefully opened the battery door, the battery immediately popped out...that's even with the phone face down. I took a rubberband of medium-sized thickness and cut out two half inch strips. I taped them horizontally spaced about one inch apart to the inside battery cover. This creates a secure fit. When I press against the battery cover, there's no more wiggle-room. With the exception of problem #3,I have not experienced these problems since.I think #3 is simply an issue of Virgin Mobile service. Overall, I am happy with VM service.Having eliminated the problems described, I actually really like this phone. Slide out board is nice and solid. Good basic phone features. I love that I can quickly check my gmail. That's about all I care for data-wise in a cell phone. Nice size screen, small footprint, solid feel. I tried the blue tooth...failed to connect with another Samsung product. Oh well, that's not something I planned on using. Speakerphone is good and strong.Great phone for texting/email. Good call quality. Quirky if you don't jerry-rig the battery to keep it in place. Good basic phone for users who need a little more than a minimalist phone but don't want a smart phone.**UPDATE**I am now convinced the quirky problems are because the battery compartment is too large. I no longer have the quirky problems many have described since tightening the fit. If you are having quirky issues, and your battery life is terrible, consider doing something like I describe above. I really love this phone!**Update 9/3/13**Occassionally I need to remove the battery as the phone locks up on occassion. Reduced to 3 stars. The battery compartment is certainly part of the issue - but the phone is a bit buggy.

We're rarely ever apart now, so it made no sense to pay a monthly premium for 2 smartphones.  Plus, we have a Toshiba Thrive tablet, and don't need multiple devices that all do similar tasks.  But just in case, we also got a cheapo LG Flair flip phone for 5 bucks at Target, and between the 2, we had all the cell phones we need.In this year since our switch to no-contract, we have seen virtually no difference in service or coverage area with our no contract phones.  They work great.  The only difference we see is to our wallets.  So this year, we decided to take advantage of the holiday sales at Virgin and upgrade our flip phone to this Samsung M575 (aka - Samsung Restore.)  My hubby wanted something that was easier to text with, and that could check emails if need be in a pinch.  So this M575 fit the bill perfectly.  It's really a well made phone, solidly built and looks really sharp.  It's also light, yet still weighty enough to feel really nice in the paw.  The slide-out qwerty is smooth and snaps into place nicely.  The keyboard is very tactile and responsive. After having only virtual keyboards on our touch devices, we forgot how much we like a good tactile keyboard with crisp buttons.  You can text waaaaaaay faster than on a touch screen.Make no mistake, this is not some repackaged 10 year old phone.  It's based off of older phones we're all familiar with, but this is a 2012 updated version, and it's really sweet.  Menus are quick and responsive.  It boots up and shuts down in a blink, and the battery lasts for daaaaaays, literally -- all of which is essential if this is to be a true emergency phone.  Call quality is excellent.  Stock ringtones are really nice.  And best of all -- you can set the ringer to SILENT for all calls, yet still have assigned personal rings remain active for the people you truly want to hear from! (Like my hubby, while ignoring everyone else!)  Perfect!!We really love this phone.  It's a good 2nd phone to have on hand for us, and it barely costs 80 a year to use it.  That includes everything, talk text and even limited web, from time to time.  It's not our main go-to phone, but for a 2nd emergency/convenience backup, this will more than do the job.For what it is, this is a 5 star phone.  Alexander Graham Bell would be in awe of how his invention has evolved.

McDonald \"big_pretty2002\"", "ReviewID": "RI7JQJVJWBPOL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone at Walmart. I have regretted wasting my money from almost as soon as I opened the package. I was excited about the slide out keyboard since I really hate the ones that take so much pushing to get to the letter you want. That, I must say is the best thing about this phone. I took pictures of my nephew only to find out that they turned out upside down because I didn't have the phone pointed right. A user manual would have made that discovery unnecessary. I have had nothing but issues with this phone. I can be on the music player enjoying my music and then suddenly be listening to silence. Upon investigating the problem I get a \"Songs Not Detected\" message. The fact that my memory card is 8GB and has over 500 songs stored on it makes this impossible and very annoying when you have  to convince it that it wants to work again. You have to pop the back off, push the memory card out a couple times, put it all back together, turn it on and then pray that the card will be read. I DO NOT recommend anyone waste their money on this phone. I think you should wait for an Android phone to come on sale and get better technology at the same price that you waste on this one. I forgot to mention the fact that the phone suddenly leaves the service area without any movement on the owners part. I was standing still listening to music when it suddenly died and my screen went black and then said, \"entering service area.\" Really don't buy this phone. I went to Radio Shack Sunday and saw an Android phone for the same price I paid for this mess.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "THE WORST THING FOR VIRGINMOBILE I HATE THIS SO MUCH PLEASE PLEASE DONT GET THIS PHONE DONT IM WARNING YOU PLEASE DONT, TERRIBLE", "Author": "Eli the phone guy", "ReviewID": "R1DMPWJAIJXZL0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone for 1 month and the lcd crashed on it and then it left a huge black spot in the middle of the screen.

Since daylight savings, my phone keeps switching back and forth between time zones - no kidding.  One hour it will be on central time, and within minutes it will be on eastern time.  It's very confused.  You can't trust what time it actually is!  I bought it because it was affordable, and I liked that it was recycled...and I figured I could trust a name like Samsung.
