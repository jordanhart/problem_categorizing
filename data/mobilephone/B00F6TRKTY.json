One black and one white, and they are brilliant for what they use them for. They feel and look like a high quality product and they have worked without any problems since they arrived. The screens are clear and bright and is fast enough to handle my childrens games and Apps. They can get on to the Internet. I have a Samsung phone (not the top end one), which costs a similar amount to this, and the DJC phones outperform in almost every way. If you are looking for a quality phone that isn't too expensive, I wouldn't buy any other.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The DJC Touchtalk comes with a 5\" HD IPS touchscreen, the perfect size to fit in your hand, use as a phone, as well as Internet browsing and Apps.\nWith the assistance of the Media-Tek 1.2Ghz Quad-Core processor and 1GB RAM, the DJC Touchtalk can easily handle multitasking and offers users a fast, fluid experience.\nWith Dual-SIM technology, the Touchtalk is able to have two SIM's inserted concurrently, giving you the flexibility of having alternative personal and business SIM's and numbers on the same phone.\nInternet connectivity has never been easier.
