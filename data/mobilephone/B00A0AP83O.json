But was pleasantly surprised that it was shipped new and in original Sony box with the requisite USA power adaptor,(thank you, FGS). After a whole day of fussing over it, I am more than happy with my purchase. Since this is an International unlocked version, Chinese, I believe, you will have to set the language to English, USA. And change the keyboard from Chinese to Xperia English. Changing the language is a snap, changing the keyboard is slightly harder, so here are the steps:1. Go into Settings.2. Scroll down to Language and Inputs.3. Under Keyboard and Input Methods, click on Default (will show Xperia Chinese Keyboard).4. Click on Xperia Keyboard.5. Click to the RIGHT of the checked Xperia keyboard (looks like 3 slider switch).6. Click on Languages, then Writing languages and ensure that English is checked. Click OK.7. Press Return key next to Home key to go back to Xperia keyboard settings.8. Click on Personalization guide and choose keyboard layout, press arrow key at bottom to advance to next screen.9. Advance through the subsequent screens, and click Done.Hope this helps.I used to pay around $180 a month for 2 Droidx at Verizon, just got $90 no contract plan with T-Mobile for 2 Xperia TX. Best part is, my wife loves her phone, it looks extremely elegant with its pearl finish and silver banding.I am getting around 5 Mbps download and 630 Kbps upload with 2 bars on Speedtest. So no worries about T-mobile 3g service, this phone works perfectly fine on it.So for all the Sony Xperia fans, this would be the phone to get if you want to go the prepaid and no contract route.Cheers.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!", "Author": "Angel Morales \"ANGEL\"", "ReviewID": "R32MJI32LYP29S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ORDERED THE SONY XPERIA TX ON MONDAY FEBRUARY 11 2013 AND RECEIVED IT TODAY FEBRUARY 13 2013.
