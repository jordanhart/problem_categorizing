But after using for a few weeks it is faster than the iPhone 5 for my typing and while not quite a  full physical keyboard it has a lot of new soft keyboard features.  The predictive typing of words saves a lot of time (just \"flick\" the words). Also a HUGE improvement over the Blackberry Bold - no more of the old battery pulls/or lags.  This thing is super smooth and you can work it/type with one hand easily.It is super fast for browsing websites (and the websites work - even Flash websites, unlike that other phone!)  There is a neat feature for reading newspaper and other websites - click \"Reader\" and it formats the page nicely (and you can make the font bigger/smaller).  Perfect for reading a newspaper article without needing to zoom in/zoom out etc.  The other worry I had was with apps - or lack of apps.  This isn't completely settled but in the last week have seen a lot of new mainstream apps available and a number announced (Kindle etc.).It's also a really tough phone.  I accidentally dropped and lost the phone in the snow for several days (I didn't know it was lost outside).  Still works great even though it was inside the snow for 3 days!  And on top of that the battery is replacable (so you can carry around extra power and also upgrade the memory as much as you need via a microSD).Definitely don't regret buying and would buy another!", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blackberry z10 Orange Dominicana", "Author": "Xavier Serrano", "ReviewID": "R142GKUVAZUP4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my blackberry z10 in black about 15 to 20 days ago from orange dominican republic under a contract which i must say its quite expensive (300 dollars locked 18 months paying 50 dollars a month) of course it gives you unlimited internet, 200 mins and sms but still is quite expensive for such poor country like mine.Back to the blackberry z10I have owned the following devices: Blackberry curve 8520, blackberry curve 9300, blackberry torch 9800, blackberry bold 9780 and an iphone 4 and now this. I can say with confidence this is the best phone i have ever bought no doubt.Software: 10/10I love bb10 its really fast, it does everything i need without a hickup.App selection is really good (100,000) apps, i have all the apps that i need (Whatsapp, Instagram, facebook, twitter, dropbox, google maps,amazon kindle) among others.Speed: 10/10This phone is FAST! i mean really fast, you can have 8 aplications and use them all at the same time no problem, watching videos, downloading something, playing games, surfing the web anything you throw at it.Camera:8/10The camera on the z10 its not bad at all, its really good, but its not up to lets say Gs3 or iphone 5. The time shift feature is AWSOME all my friends love it! Works greatBattery: 7/10Again its not super wow, it can last 1 day on a charge, with moderate use, just keep your background light low, stay on an area with coverage and lock it everytime you are not using it if not you will end up at the end of the day with the battery below 10%.Build Quality: 10/10This phone feels PREMIUM! It just feels good in the hand, no plastic at all like the galaxy s3, close to an iphone 5 if not better.Speaker: 6/10Here is a flaw, the speaker sounds loud but not that great just OK.Overall: 9/10This phone is just amazing, gives you something different than android an apple, something unique, an unique way of doing things i love my phone if i could i would afford to buy another for my girlfriend (she has an iphone 4) but wants a z10, i would do it right away.

Two years ago when my old Blackberry Bold died for no reason, I was one of them. I thought they \"lost their magic\" and my girlfriend got me an iPod, an iPad, and I got myself two android phones. My first one was a Motorola XT316, that was a steaming pile of crap. My second one was a Samsung Galaxy Y, and it was okay.I was happy with them. The Apple devices were soo cool. And the Samsung phone worked okay. But I sorely missed on the one thing Blackberries excelled at: e-mail. E-mail, contacts, appointments and so on are a critical part of my job. Blackberry focused on that so much that before long they were no longer with the cool crowd. But communication is what the phones are for, right? Or so I thought. I was happy with all the apps. But no app came even close for e-mail as it was on the blackberry.Anyway, I was really torn between this and an iPhone. They are in about the same price range. It took me two months to finally bite the bullet and spend $650 on this thing. And it has been amazing from day one. My dear e-mail is organized as it should, my contacts, my appointments, everything. I'm in love with the HUB. It has all the cool features the apple/android devices have. Not exactly a carbon copy, but somehow very similar. The gestures work really, really well. And the thing that knocked my socks off is the word autocompletion. I can write a fully worded, well spelled, grammatically perfect e-mail in about 20 seconds. And it's no longer just e-mail... facebook, whatsapp, twitter, everything is in one place, fully integrated, and well organized.Blackberry always had something nobody else has. I agree that the old BB devices where ugly, that their naming convention was confusing (and silly), their camera sucked and they tended to die for no reason. If Android or iOS had some of the e-mail features & security blackberries have, right now I would've been reviewing their phones.In short, this is Blackberry \"hail mary pass\" and it is a resounding touchdown all around. Truth to be told, there are not all that many \"crush the sweets\" apps for it, but I believe that that's what my Playstation is for. I may be in a different wavelenght that the rest of the market, I'm not an expert or anything.

You can find the sub-model number underneath the battery inside the phone.Differences are laid out nicely here:  [...]I bought the phone to use on T-Mobile's network in the United States.  The best models for LTE on T-Mobile are STL1003, with submodel RFK121LW being slightly better than RFF91LW due to being able to pick up both of T-Mobile's HSPA+ frequencies (1700MHz and 2100MHz, found here:  [...] ).  My model, RFF91LW, is running fine on T-Mobile's LTE service here so far.  I haven't even fallen back on HSPA+ yet, although I live in a big city so my LTE coverage is pretty good.For the price, it's going to be near impossible to find a better unlocked phone, let alone a LTE phone.

It's locked own OS and locked own features have caused people later on to create the android OS which is much more free and less constrained by rules of the manufacturer, allowing people to customize it greatly and and manufacturers to create unique devices that would differ greatly from company to company but allow it to be all under once flag, the android flag.Obviously, being the free and open minded person I opted android, where I found freedom to be plenty. Custom roms, rooting, and other features lured me into an android world full of possibilities.I slowly watched as my 8 month old android phone become archaic and urged myself to go forth and by the newest and best android phones every 6 months, becoming a victim of this intelligent marketing scheme. With each newest phone offering the best specs, the best software, and best hardware quality I was eager to treat myself with such.Oh but then I saw through this. I realized that with each newest phone upgrade, the differences between the past models were unnoticeable based on speed. Galaxy S3 versus S4, no one would notice the difference between the speed. Oh, but you can say you have those nifty benchmark speeds, which would greatly be able to see the difference through digits. Oh, but I say in return, those numbers don't mean squat, since the hardware difference will always be too small to noticeably feel it with each next concurrent model of the android phone. Thus, by telling yourself the phone will be faster based on just a benchmark score would be like me judging a book by its cover. It's not enough to have a accurate assumption, and may fall to give one a misguided perception.Then I realized, optimization is key to a fast phone. What does optimization mean? Well first look into the computing aspects of a phone. There is two sides, software and hardware. Just because you have the latest hardware, doesn't mean your phone would be the fastest. Just because your benchmark score is super high, doesn't mean your phone performance will be. What is just as important if not more is the software side of things. Android is supposed to run on hundreds of different phones from different companies, thus, the software is not optimized as compared to a company that codes its own OS in relation to its own hardware. Wait, wait, wait a sec, isn't that what BLACKBERRY and APPLE do? Yes quite certainly, thus, you can see how apple phones and blackberry phones last MUCH longer than those \"premium\" android handsets since there is too much competition among android phone makers, who try to pump the best every 6 months only to forget and leave in the dust it's older phones.But companies like blackberry and apple only create one line of products, which they control the OS to. Thus, they are more careful about the full utilization of software for its hardware, unlike android.Thus, with this phone, I realized how fast it is, even with its one year old dated hardware, it still runs as fast as the newest android phone, because the company cares and has complete control over it's OS, so that it can be optimized the high extent. Can android phones be opitimized as much as a blackberry? No, it is such a broadly used OS, it will never be able to.Now to the actual OS, this phone is flying with speed. It has the core functions of a phone: calling, texting, email and social media all integrated into the OS. They call it the hub, I see it as genius. It is simply where you will be spending most of your time in regardes to communication, which is only 2 swipes away from any screen. This makes checking anything amazingly easy and fast. You can install android apps, which closes pretty much the \"app gap\" people compain about. It has the screen you expect from a high end device as well.All the little things, like the alarm app, compass app, and other default apps are beautifully and smartly designed. They seem to be designed in a way so that you would actually see yourself using them, unlike android where every default app made by samsung is crap and I always turn to 3rd party apps from the store to take care of that. Not Blackberry, everything I need is in the phone by default, since so much care was put into those default apps.Is this phone less constrained by rules than android? No, blackberry made security important feature, thus it is not as open as android. But, it is more open and less rule governed than the IOS, where you can't even view your phone as a USB Device without the use of a 3rd party software.Transferring files? I will never need my USB cable again. How you must scream! Easy, all I did was set up blackberry link on my PC and I have access to my blackberry as a \"networked hard drive\" whenever it's connected to the internet. Damn, that's nifty blackberry. Oh sure, you might say, well android can do that, but I would say, still though, you would only be able to do that through 3rd party apps. I can do that by default on my device. Why should I care? Well for one, I know it's a secured and reliable way, I don't need to depend on a third party company, I only need to depend on blackberry to make the best out of my phone.Smart phone that actually thinks the way you would. Seriously, they should make that their logo if they can because the major thing I noticed about this phone is how much it makes sense logically.Minor gripe, the battery life will last you 6 hours on heavy use and 10 hours on moderate use.

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R33LKJDU410NL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So with all the quality luxury car brands out there, why did I choose Tesla for the analogy? Like the new Blackberry \"10\" series of phones, Tesla arrives at it's luxury and overall driving experience by cleverly blending innovation with simplicity and efficiency. And, Tesla is a newer luxury car brand that is (for now anyway) serving a niche audience and trying desperately to catch on with the masses amidst more established brands. And unfortunately, consumers who choose to overlook Tesla because it is not established are missing out on something that is simply better.The new Blackberry 10 operating system is so good that OUT OF THE BOX it is a complete system ready to be enjoyed and ready for productivity. Try doing that with an Android phone. My Android phone has Kit Kat (the latest os) and it took me weeks of downloading and trying out various apps to get the phone to perform to my satisfaction and to do what this one does right out of the box. I mean lets be honest here, let's cut to the chase- when your phone's operating system along with it's native apps will not perform correctly or lacks certain important features, and you go to Google Play for an app that will do it better, what you are in a sense doing is downloading a patch. Go to your Android or IOS settings menu and call up the list of downloaded apps... that's right... your phone is FULL of os patches. The new Blackberry 10 is clearly the superior root operating system when compared to IOS or Android.When it comes to contact management, SMS, the dialer, email, file system management, keyboard, web browsing, voice recording, notifications, photo management - there is no need for improvement with aftermarket apps. So please, don't reply to this review with comparisons of the size of Blackberry's app store vs. google's and apple's. I get it.So let's go beyond the reliability of Blackberry's new and innovative operating system and discuss some specifics about this Z10 phone that I love. I want to start with 'The Hub' because a phone is primarily a device for communications, right? Well then, what a great idea it would be to have any and all communications - you name it, tweets, texts, voice mails, call logs, facebook updates, IM's, emails, whatever you want - centrally located and \"peekable\" (for lack of a better term) with a simple swipe. Introducing The Hub. Regardless of what the phone happens to be in the middle of doing, a short swipe up from the bottom gives an initial peek of simple icons (with counter) indicating the type and number of new communications you have received. Now continue the swipe slightly to the right and the screen will slide to reveal yet a further peek for more specifics as to who, what and when. Now finish the swipe right if you want to actually open up and interact with The Hub. Very nice! The Hub is agile and customizable. One of my favorite customizations is the pinch function for each type of communication portal in the hub. What this does is give you an alternative view consisting of only messages that meet your customized parameters. For example, lets say that for my gmail account I want my alt view to be only sent messages and also only those I sent to coworkers. When I go to the hub and open gmail I see everything. But if I pinch, everything literally starts squishing down until, poof, all disappears except for only those messages I've sent, and sent only to coworkers. And keep in mind that The Hub is not merely a gateway where you go to launch say an SMS app or a browser or app that gets you to your facebook account...all messaging is done right there. Very impressive.Next up is the neat settings menu and it's customizability. When you call up the settings menu you will always have access to ALL the settings (wi-fi, bluetooth, accounts, sound settings, flashlight, battery monitor, device monitor, airplane mode, brightness/white balance and display, apps, alarms and notifications, voice control settings, security, etc.) because right at the top of the list will always be the button called, well, \"Settings\". But I like how right on that initial settings page you can customize which settings functions will appear. It's like a quick links page.Next up, battery life - This phone comes with an 1800 mAh battery (removable!!) and for some reason the battery life on this phone consistently blows away that of my other phone which has a 2200 mAh battery. I can't really explain this. My only theory is that because this is such a \"young\" operating system, and one which was specifically designed in conjunction with the Blackberry \"10\" series of phones, it is an extremely streamlined system without any bloat and extraneous or redundant processing going on in the background. But admittedly that's just guessing.This phone has no \"home screen\" per se, which is awesome. This is because of Blackberry's focus on multitasking, productivity and simplicity. You do not have to keep tapping the Home button or the recent app button in order to proceed on to another application that you want to use. Instead, when you are done using an application just flick up from the bottom of the screen and it closes, gets pinned to the wallpaper, and turns into a widget-like live tile (for example, if you were on twitter the little tile would continue to show you your latest twitter feeds). You can have up to 8 tiles (4 on a screen) before the system begins to sequentially turn them off as others go onto the wall, and they can be turned off manually as well. To view all applications just swipe left.The operation of new Blackberry phones is very dependent on getting the swiping gestures down. It can be tricky at first but once you learn it, the phone is a real treat to use and is very interesting, intuitive and user friendly. The screen quality and resolution is stunning to look at, the phone itself is well built, exudes quality and is handsome looking. I am very psyched to have discovered the Blackberry Z10 as well as it's fantastic operating system.

Same product, different color)I have the white Z10 running BB 10.2 (leaked version) and I'm blown away by how awesome this phone is. I love not having a home button to worry about anymore (it's cumbersome on the iPhone and starts to get 'sticky' after awhile) - the gestures take a few days to learn but once you get it everything you do will be faster. It's smooth, the graphics are slick, and this phone is a *perfect* size. The iPhone 4S and 5 were too small or too awkward and the Z10 hits the sweet spot. One of my favorite things about this phone is the Browser - it's snappy, I've had up to 25 tabs open before and it still runs, it's intuitive, the browser bar is on the bottom which is out of the way and not bothersome and it maximizes screen real estate.I've had this phone for a few months now and the only thing that is remotely frustrating is waiting on app developers. I also really wish that Blackberry would give you all the apps that are tied to your search queries (ie if I search for a Pandora app it provides me with a list of all apps that are similar to Pandora or are 3rd party Pandora apps).Summary:The Good-screen size-battery (being able to swap it out for a fully recharged one whenever I want is life-changing - I didn't realize how annoying it was to find a charger mid-day with my iPhone and now I could never go back)-fast and snappy-browser is best I've seen-everything I usually use is already baked in (evernote, twitter, facebook, email, etc.)-very secureThe Bad-apps are slow to arrive on BB (but you can sideload android apps)-battery life is meh but it's mitigated by being able to swap it for a fresh one whenever I want-siri was more helpful to me than the BB assistantThis is a great phone. I recommend it for people who want an NSA free phone that is fast, attractive, well-sized, and overall awesome.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier", "Author": "Andrew John Spencer Bolton", "ReviewID": "R3HQ8ENFCX6IDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing phone, by far the best piece of technology I have ever owned.

It's easy to use, outgoing and incoming calls are clear, the hub is amazing (email, texts, Facebook notifications, twitter, and whatever other accounts you can link) are all in one location.  The only negative thing about the phone is I wasn't able to download a lot of apps that I once had for android such as: instagram, pinterest, and ifunny just to name a few and I can't personalized the phone with more creative themes like I once could with my android phone. However, that's okay because I can access some of my old apps by using the web browser and it works almost like the app.  With time however, I know the blackberry will come out with more popular apps that the iPhone and android users have access to.

I purchased an unlocked version and was pleasantly surprised that the phone was indeed a brand new, sealed, factory unlocked phone.  Prior to this purchase I attempted to purchase the same smartphone, only to be sadly disappointed, as those had been previously owned; they were an opened item being sold as brand new.  When I initially received the brand new blackberry z10, I was very happy to receive the phone; but disappointed because it will not work with Straight Talk bring your own phone program; the network I use.  I was going to return the blackberry z10 for a refund and decided to keep it for a point and shoot camera, plus the smartphone has a very current version of docs to go; which is a wonderful software program.  I can successfully use a WiFi connection, using the hot spot system with my current phone.  I can get cell phone and text usage with the z10 with Straight Talk, just not data usage/internet.  The blackberry z10's APN isn't compatible with the network.  The blackberry z10 is actually a pretty nice smartphone.  It is light weight, takes a good picture, is relatively simple to use and I seem to like it enough to keep it regardless of the incompatibility issue with the network.  The smartphone is not overly complicated, but there are enough options and software to make for a very nice higher end smartphone.  It can be used for multitasking; depending on the applications being ran.  It can be used as a stand alone modem for tethering and also as a WiFi hit spot.  It's a good smartphone with many usages.  It does have a port for HDMI, which makes it great for hooking the phone up to a business projector or television.  There is a software program, photo story, which helps with creating a timeline for photos.  I have not personally used it for this yet.  I like the compass and GPS coordinates which is a feature of this phone.

(That was sort of a BB pun...) This is the BBZ10 STL100-3, with 4G ready and the QualComm Snapdragon S4 Plus dual-core 1.5Ghz Processor.Battery life:If I *had* to complain this is where I would do it. The battery life is not legendary. It's about what you would expect from a smartphone. I charge it everyday and it works the whole day but don't expect much more than that. In this day and age where every smartphone has multi-core processors, 5 different radios, push email etc. I think a whole day's worth of battery life is what you can expect. If you're answering emails all day or gaming or surfing the web, battery life will suffer but you can always buy an extended pack, one of the accessories BlackBerry sells.Call quality:Call quality is fantastic. The new 10.2 software upgrade comes with natural sound technology. And I have to say that it sounds superb. Voices are full and rich. This phone has also never dropped a call in the 6 months I've had it. (The iPhone has dropped at least 3.) Video call quality is also good. With crisp voices and decent video quality.Experience:The swipe interface is amazing. Whoever said that it has a \"steep learning curve\" is obviously a moron. There's only three gestures that you ever have to use and if you can't handle that then maybe a touchscreen phone isn't for you anyway. Programs are fast and responsive and it's NEVER frozen. I have also never rebooted the phone because its gotten slow or lagged. I've never used the Mini-HDMI output so I have nothing to say there.Email:As the original push-service email device, the BlackBerry still holds ground as the best workhorse phone for email. My BlackBerry gets email faster than my computer EVERY TIME. With Priority Hub on the new 10.2 OS, the phone also learns which contacts and conversations are important (read: not ads) and pushes them up to the top of the Hub so you get your important emails quickly.Storage:You can use the device as a NAS through an encrypted WiFi connection. This is STANDARD and integrated on the BBZ10 platform. It seemlessly integrates with several cloud based services too including Box, DropBox and Skydrive. It also accepts a 64Gb Micro-SDXC card so its tough to run out of space too.Build quality:The phone is well built, feels hefty and substantial but isn't heavy and is EXTREMELY thin (.36 inches to be exact).Display:The display is clear and beautiful and with a 356 ppi resolution, it's sharper than the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. It's also 4.2 inches diagonal where the iPhone is only 4 inches. But I mean...some people say size doesn't matter.Overall:This is really a fantastic phone. I've run phones with Android and tested iPhones (dark days) before and I think that the BlackBerry really gets down to what you use a phone for. Messaging, taking and placing phone calls, updating social networks, email and browsing the web while your girlfriend is shopping for clothes. It's not app-hungry, which could be a downside to some users. But for the most part it does the job, does it well, is fast, responsive, looks and feels like it means business, keeps you connected and lasts all day, take a look at the BlackBerry Z10.

Before I converted to iPhone with the first iPhone, I was an avid blackberry user & lover. This makes that loving feeling come back a bit. The way the inbox is managed is beautiful. The way the OS swipes and moves around is simple and great. The speed is ok, not great, but not bad either. The screen looks great, the weight & size are good, overall, I'm very pleased about this device! If you're at a company that requires blackberry, this is certainly the best option available and it's quite a large step up from previous options. That being said, the severe current lack of apps is probably enough of a buzzkill for a lot of people to steer clear.All I can hope is that additional apps come along.

I ordered this phone about a two weeks ago and have been living with it for 1.5 weeks. So far I've been enjoying it after having lived with a curve several years past its time. I was starting to think I would have to conform to the crowd and get an iphone or something. Bleh! My only issue with ordering was based on there not being an option in the buying section on amazon to select the model of the phone you would want! I searched for the model that would give me 4G on T-Mobile's network and this phone was the second one in the search results. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and on the box there was a verizon sign and the model for Stl 100-04. I did my homework and my research for weeks prior to buying this phone just to avoid this problem, and here the problem is! I had to spend a day running back and forth to T-Mobile to try to get 4G with no luck. I have to live on my Wifi connection in order to search the web or do anything, so if I am not at home or roaming the street guess what won't work...Googlemaps! I was and still am slightly frustrated by this issue and since my previous phone bit the dust in functionality I have to live with the wrong model and now consider switching to Verizon because my phone is an unlocked Verizon phone. Allow buyers the option of selecting the model they need or at the very least a messaging option to say which model we need! I'm glad I didn't have to sacrifice the features of blackberry that I had grown to love so dearly, such as bbm and the professional connectivity that blackberry prizes itself on. I also love the other new features that I keep noticing everyday such as Documents to Go and my ability to edit documents and powerpoints right from the phone! I'm not an intense app person and I'm not picky when it comes to apps, I rather quality instead of quantity and I think there are apps in blackberry world, don't listen to the bad press on this phone about there not being apps!

Do not throw away your SLR.-Headphone jack didn't work out of the box-Like the I5 or any other smartphone, the battery cycle/capacity is simply not adequate to rely on the device as a phone/messenger you can actually use through a complete business day. After 6 hours of light/moderate use, maximum, it's 2 hour recharge time. The others cons are nit picky but this one is a biggy.

The camera is great, I understand it has a feature where it captures a few seconds before and after the photo is taken and this can be used in case the subject blinks etc. The browser speed blows my iphone out of the water. I also love how the url box is on the bottom of the phone, compared to the top on the iphone. Many times in google I had problems with trying to re-type in the search bar and the iphone keyboard pushing the search bar out of screen. I have no issues with battery life as was one of my initial concerns with the phone. Seems to be holding up great. The keyboard is absolutely amazing with the new feature that can finish the word for you by making a small swipe up. Another concern I had with the phone was the apps available; however, I spoke with netflix this morning and the representative reported that they are currently working on developing an app for blackberry, so this is great news.

It needs a lot more development and software testing. Lots of bugs with the software and the touch screen isn't as nice as the Samsung S3 or Iphone 5. Don't be a beta tester for Blackberry. Wait for a year or so. Can't use the phone with prepaid cards or when traveling. Unlocked isn't unlocked if you can't change the APN for data. No other phone manufacture is locking the APN. Blackberry support is terrible. So bad that you want to throw the phone away. Do say I didn't warn you. Try your SIM card in a Blackberry phone before you buy it and watch out for the model number. There are 4-5 different models of the Z10. Be sure to find out what you are buying. Or just don't buy Blackberry.

Ahh no whatsapp :-) , try to sideload without luck.Also I am one owner with the Apn problem of no data so I was thinking on resell my z10 but I guess I would keep it because the price drop and wait until my Carrier officially release the z10 to fix my data trouble.  Hope it takes a few months only but never know with Rim behind.I like the phone but by the moment it is useless to me.UPDATE April 1:Finally I got Internet service, but even when they announce whatsapp since March 8, it's still unavailable.  Also waiting for Skype.About the phone, as a new os we have to get used.  It's not as intuitive (same for windows 8) but you can deny is fast and reliable.  I have to say that battery didn't last a day long of intensive use.UPDATE April 8:Finally with hard work I upgraded my bb z10 and could install Whatsapp from the App Store (it was available since April 4) , so now I really can use my phone completely like a charm.

For those who did not listened to me you might as well trade your blackberry Z10 Q10 Q5 with iphone, Samsung or nokia Smartphone's while it still has some value left on it. You don't want to have a piece of junk  months from now cause THERE WILL BE LESS AND LESS APP'S AVAILABLE FOR THIS SMARTPHONE and expect more BUG'S because app's developers might become lazy in updating their existing app's running on BB10 knowing that this company may go under in the future. Besides blackberry employee are for sure very demoralize as they see their future dwindling and many maybe looking for other jobs. I was thinking talented employee's of blackberry many of them maybe leaving or looking for other job. So my friends and co-consumer BE WISE and save your hard earned monies. My belief is there will only be 3 major Smartphone OS in the future and they are Apple OS, ANDROID AND WINDOWS. So if you like your investment in technology and knowledge relevant in the future just concentrate on these 3 Smartphone OS and I am pretty sure your investment will not put to waste.Tried this many times but the problem is there are very few good Apps for this blackberry new operating system, Most Apps are google apps emulated softwares design primarily for android so future updates and performance is an issue. Developers has anemic support for this new Blackberry operating system so I don't see future development of popular apps for this smartphone, I don't see any reason to spend so much money for a smartphone like BB10 if only you will use it for text messaging, voice and few apps. Some functionality are also buggy (With bugs), battery is not good enough to last if you browse a lot. Maybe be if they lower the price below $100 as compare to other smartphone with the same feature as this I may consider, I think paying more than $600 dollars for this phone is a waste of monies . Buyer beware cause this operating system may not last just like other new smartphone operating system without application developers support. Companies are starting pilot testing to convert from Blackberry to Iphone and Android smartphone so I think it is better to invest in the future and learn new technologies than stick with this new operating system that don't have support of major developers and popular tech companies like Microsoft, Netflix, facebook, google etc. Take note that if you buy this smartphone facebook, Netflix and other popular apps is not supporting and developing apps for this smartphone so you may regret spending a whooping $600 plus for smartphone like this.Buyer specially current user of blackberry should also realize that this new blackberry is totally different from the old blackberry phone they have before, this one has new operating system, functionality and features, so effort in learning how to use this is similar to learning how to use the much popular smartphone like iphone, android and even windows phone. Iphone, android and even windows are tested and with strong big hi-tech company support and application developers support, so why not spend your effort in learning popular and tested smartphone instead of spending so much money for this new blackberry smartphone that I for sure will be gone in the future. Without developers and big hi tech company support this new blackberry operating system will be gone in next couple of years.I hate it when consumers are being reap off, if you buy this phone for close to $700 including taxes what you get is a phone good for texting, browsing the internet and emails, very few popular apps are available for this phone yes they have 100,000 apps but most of the popular one are android apps, if the underlying android apps where updated user of this phone will have problem using them unless they manually upgrades. If you buy apple, android and windows phone after two years you can sell them and get some money back or you can even trade them to get new phone, this blackberry phone, theres nothing you can do with this phone after two years it maybe gone and there is not enough senior citizen to buy this phone in the future. I believe buying this phone is a bad investment in terms of money and technological knowledge.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "BB Z10 is not what Blackberry user expects.

Firstly it's no where close to a bb experience in terms of single finger control, android software is leaps better in windows usage. Outlook does not sync directly anymore.

I wasted half a day in trying to change over from my bb bold os6 to bb10- my god was it contrary to saying its easy, like the website says. I ended up finally changing over to my old bb.
