WOW!!  I have owned three previous Tracfones.  I started with the candy-bar Nokia 2600 ($30 @ Office Depot) which got dunked in a lake.  I moved to a candy-bar Motorola W175g ($6 @ Walmart) which fell in a toilet.  Then I had a LG-420g flip-phone ($15 @ Walmart).  All of these phones have served the purpose well - inexpensive, low call volume, pay-as-you-go, mobile communication.  My wife and I both had double minutes for the life of our phones and we buy the 400 minutes/1 year plans (=800 minutes/1 year with doubling) to minimize per minute costs.  I don't need games, apps, cameras, music player, multimedia capabilities etc.  And we have reached the point where our land-line is just about to get the boot because of how pleased we are with Tracfones.  Don't get me wrong, Android phones and iphones are really outstandingly cool.  But I refuse to pay those rates because I don't have a compelling reason to have a smartphone.  I am not addicted to texting friends, facebook, electronic books, multimedia consumption, etc.  However, I discovered the ability to check my email on the LG-420g was quite convenient.  I am a person who can get along without a smartphone but I really appreciate good user interface and user friendliness.  So, when I saw that I could get triple minutes on the LG-840g I did some digging.  Improved touchscreen interface, Wi-Fi, 3G, the possibility of replacing the 2GB microSD card with a larger one if you do want to store music and photos, AND triple minutes - SOLD.Now that I have the phone I really like it.  Let's remember it is a Tracfone.  It is not a smartphone.  The touchscreen works very well (with occasional sensitivity behaviors), the screen landscape is like all out-of-doors compared to any of my previous phones.  Web pages are much easier to look at than on a Blackberry I once had due to the larger size of the screen on this LG 840g.  There is a degree of sophistication with the feedback sounds and touchscreen behavior although there are minor navigation inconsistencies from screen to screen.  There is a greater user friendliness and navigation flexibility than with my previous phones.  It is far more intuitive.  This is a very clean phone.  There are just five buttons on the phone - On/Off, Louder/Softer, SEND, RETURN, END.  Four of the buttons are flush with the surface and the Louder/Softer button is subtly sculpted to extend just a bit from the side.  But, the dependence on buttons typical of the candy-bar and flip phones is nearly eliminated because 99.9% of all the navigation is done on the touchscreen rather than those cryptic menus and multi-function buttons on the candy-bar phones and flip phones.I have successfully used the Wi-Fi with the wireless router in my home.  The phone takes you through the process.  You just provide the access key.  I did use the pay-by-using-up-minutes browser to check the web for prices on one purchase in the hardware store (no scan the barcode - use an app to compare prices opportunity with this phone) which was convenient but not something you don't want to make a habit.If you are satisfied with the Tracfone concept and don't have business or other demands that dictate the use of a smartphone, then I personally would take a good look at this phone.Here's a link to download the manual - [...]  (Of course like most manuals you don't get the complete picture.)Update 5-29-2013 I just purchased a Nissan Cube and this phone works with the Bluetooth hands free system on the car!!", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 840G", "Author": "Dr. M \"Professor\"", "ReviewID": "R3CZFCTA4FKYA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is supposedly the TracFone successor to the very popular LG 800G TracFone.  So if you are familiar with the LG 800G, then perhaps the best way to think of this phone is as the WiFi/3G/plus version of the LG 800G.  It is already available in some WalMart stores, and now on Amazon.  Check out the Turk Forum for actual pictures of the bubble pack.It is NOT a smart phone, and doesn't run Android.  But if it is anything like the LG 800G (which is one damn fine feature phone), it will be a runaway hit with the otherwise minimal phone use crowd that TracFone attracts.What it has (that the venerable LG 800G it replaces does not) is WiFi and 2G/3G data. And it has all the well-executed built-in widgets (Music Player, Audio, Picture Viewer, Video Recorder, Voice Recorder, Calendar, Notepad, Tasks, Stopwatch, Calculator, Tip Calculator,  Unit Converter) that came with the LG 800G, incuding a 2 MP camera.  In addition, the LG 840G has an external microSDHC card capacity up to 32GB, versus 4 GB for the LG 800G.Sorry - no GPS.  But you might be able to hook it to an external GPS if (and that is a big IF) you can find a Java app to process the GPS output.  I don't offhand know of such a Java app.  But then again, I was a long time in realizing their was a java app for facebook.The touchscreen on the LG 840G is larger (3.0\") than the LG 800G (2.8\" -- 320x240 pixels).  No info yet on the LG 840G screen resolution.There is a 180 page user guide (90 pages in English, 90 pages in Spanish), which is quite an improvement on the next-to-nothing user manual for the LG 800G.The LG 840G comes with triple minutes for life.It is too early to tell if all the LG 800G fanatics will migrate to the LG 840G.  But based on the high popularity of the LG 800G, I betting the LG 840G will be a hot seller.  If you are a minimal cell phone user, better get your TracFone version before they are gone.  If you are a moderate to heavy cell phone user, you might do better with the Net10 or Straight Talk versions.EDIT (26 Dec 2013):The Lg 840G continues to be THE most popular feature phone.  It is the most popular cellphone purchased on Home Shopping network (HSM.com), and the most viewed and commented on Turk Forum. Its staying power comes from its relatively low price, triple minutes for life, sensitive touchscreen, WiFi, Bluethooth, and 2/3G data capability, as well as the many well-executed built in features included.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG-840 tremendus improvement over the LG-800!", "Author": "Mike-in-Minnesota \"Mike (In Minnesota)\"", "ReviewID": "R1J2LFWC7NS4GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my new LG-840 Tracfone.  It took me well under ten minutes to activate the new toy.  I used the toll-free number on the SERIAL NUMBER card (the RED one) that was included to accomplish the following needed steps:- Transfer the phone number from the LG-800 to the new LG-840- Transfer the days-of-service remaining to the new LG-840- Transfer the minutes remaining to the new LG-840- Add the \"1200 minutes\" of time and the one-year of service to the new LG-840 (This number is on an included sheet of paper)- I also mentioned the \"promotion code\" of 24572, which was reported to add 250 minutes in a YAHOO USER GROUP, when coupled with a one-year service card.  (This may have added more time, but I have not taken the time to do the math.  The lady at Tracfone offered no comment or resistance, so...)The bottom line is that I got more than I had assumed, as follows:- On the OLD '800 Tracfone, I had 924.80 minutes (High-resolution readout, it seems!) of time remaining, and was set to expire on 8-1-2013.- On the NEW '840 Tracfone, I now have 2390 minutes of time remaining, and it will expire at the end of September of 2014.(!!!!!!!!!!!!)-----> WAY better than I had assumed, in other words.The unit works a LOT BETTER than the LG-800 that I retired.  The wi-fi works nicely.  The WEB BROWSER is extremely quick, compared to the LG-800.  Also, the web browser on the '800 was always informing me that this was an untrusted site/app, whatever. -No matter if I had just been using this same app, accessing the same web site!  I have not seen this at all on the new LG-840, which is really nice.  (And, EXPECTED, I must add!)I REALLY LIKE the responsiveness of the '840's screen!  It is about like what the coveted iPhone has, or really close.  (And this is GOOD!)  The '800's pressure-sensing screen worked, but not as nicely as this one.  The '840's screen is of the \"capacitive\" sensing design; -What this means is that it takes just a light touch to click or drag.The camera is easy to operate.  The LG-840 has a 2 Megapixel camera, where the LG-800 series has a 3 Megapixel still camera. -So, a bit of a step-down, but still just fine for me.Getting the still pictures and the movies from the camera (cell phone) to the computer was very quick and easy with the '800 phone.  It assume that the '840 will do as well!  (I just have not tried this, yet.  The images DO SHOW UP, when I hook the LG-840 to my iMac with a standard USB cable; The camera shows up like an external hard drive or flash drive.)I do miss the three mechanical buttons that the '800 had just below the screen.  This is a small loss, as the LEDs under the '840's \"button area\" go OFF (time out, but are still active) as needed, it seems.  -But they do come back ON, if one taps the body of the '840 phone, so not much loss there.  The one convenience I do miss is the way that the '800's \"real buttons\" would wake up the phone, so one could press the \"unlock\" button on the screen.  Now, with the '840, one must tap the POWER button on the top of the phone's body.  It is entirely possible that NOT having the mechanical buttons is a better design, as if a button is accidentally pressed while the phone is in a pocket, it would allow the screen to light up, but fortunately would not proceed further.  (Maybe, maybe NOT...) The button press of the newer '840 is a lot more secure, so I will offer that this is BETTER.The LG-840's screen is larger than the '800, but not by much.  It is bright and easy to read.All in all, I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with the LG-840.-Mike-", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just what I am looking for", "Author": "webmania", "ReviewID": "R3NRMJ3X4X3KZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a long time Virgin Mobile user since I only needed a phone for emergencies. My daughter arrived last year and as a result my cellphone usage slightly went up but still not high enough to justify a contract phone with the monthly bills. My wife has a company IPhone and from time to time I do envy her ability to get online just about anywhere. Too bad that tracfone doesn't offer a smartphone, and the LG 840g is probably the closest that they have.I bought this phone for $99 from Amazon with the 1200 minute package, with the additional 250 minutes coupon code (obtained directly from tracfone's own website) this is a very good deal. Considering normally the 400 minute time card would cost you $99 (this is a triple-minute phone, hence the 1200 min), I basically got the phone for free.After having played with the phone for a few days, here are my findings. First the positives:1) In terms of functionality, this is just what I am looking for. Long standby time, touch screen, a web browser that I can use to check some info when needed, an email client, and the optional Google Maps app, a good-enough camera/camcorder. Nothing fancy, but something that does the job in a pinch.2) The phone has a high-quality feel to it. People will believe you if you tell them it's one of those Android smartphones, unlike the previous prepaid phones that I had, which all looked low-cost.3) I have managed to install the signed (and touch-enabled) versions of UC Browser, Opera Mini 4.4 and 5.1 (7.1 is too sluggish), and Google Maps. All apps run fullscreen without the virtual keypad. The trick is to download the signed jar and jad file, and append to the JAD file the following linesNokia-MIDlet-No-Exit: trueNokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: noMIDlet-Touch-Support: trueUseNativeTextButtons: hideReverseSoftkeys: hideUseNativeCommands: hideNavi-Key-Hidden: trueMIDlet-ScreenMode: ROTATEMIDlet-Landscape-Support: trueLGE-MIDlet-Width: 320LGE-MIDlet-Height: 480LGE-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: noLGE-MIDlet-Display-Mode: bothLGE-MIDlet-TargetLCD-Height: 320LGE-MIDlet-TargetLCD-Width: 480LGE-MIDlet-Indicator: HIDESave, copy both to the phone via data cable or bluetooth, use File Manager to browse and install JAD file. Everything works beautifully.4) Putting music/video/photos on the phone is as straightforward as copying to directories once you connect the phone to the PC using a microusb data sync cable. The included 2G microsd is plenty for my usage.Now a few minor downsides:1) The qwerty keyboard is not enabled everywhere---I wanted the qwerty keyboard in a touch screen phone. I understand the rationale since the screen resolution is relatively low and a T9 keyboard would result in bigger buttons. But Opera mini 7.1 can display a full qwerty keyboard even in the portrait orientation just fine, so it's certainly doable. At least I would have preferred an option to use the qwerty keyboard by default every time, even if it means switching to landscape mode2) 3G speed is hit-and-miss depending on where you are. At my home I get usable speed, at my office it's too slow. But I don't consider that a reflection on the phone, but rather on AT&T;, which is my local tracfone carrier.3) Unlocking the phone is a two-step process, which I don't like. You have to first press a button and then swipe to unlock. Again I understand the rationale, but the unlock button is very small and almost flush, so it's rather unlikely that you will press the button while it's in your pocket. Again, an option would be nice here.4) The phone disconnects wifi when you are not using it to save battery. Therefore, when you unlock it, you should wait for the wifi icon to show up before you try to use any internet features, otherwise you'd be paying with your tracfone minutes.UPDATE 1: having had the phone for a month now, I am glad to say that my impression hasn't changed. I actually used its 3G capability twice in the past month, in both cases it worked just fine. BTW, tracfone seems to charge your 3G usage by transfered data volume, not by how long you stay online. UC Browser is now my browser on this phone, much better than the default browser client, which was very limited. For those who want to install a signed fullscreen copy of it, here is my packaged file that you can use:[...]download, unpack, copy both files to your phone, then install the JAD file.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for an AVERAGE USER!

If I ever do upgrade my phone, I was thinking of this one. I love playing with new tech devices too, especially if someday they'll end up in my hands for good.On the surface, it looks like a really nice phone. It has Wi-Fi (huge feature for Tracfones as they never had it before), a good quality touch screen, and comes with and SD card (only 2GB, but they never used to with this either)! It seemed like a high quality phone in general. However, when I dug deeper, I noticed that a lot of features are missing and the phone is not an upgrade over my 500g AT ALL.1.  The call recorder is GONE. They removed the feature! I have looked everywhere, it simply does exist. The phone has a voice recorder, but that can't be used while you are in a call. This is feature is deal breaking for me. When I get calls with important information, I record them so everything is captured. I don't want to have to take notes (and it's not even always possible, like while driving) or miss something that is said. It's just not as efficient. My 500g had this, so why not the 840g!?2. They removed the previewing of new, unopened text messages. You must open them the whole way to see what they say now. On the 500g, it would show you a little bit, even before you opened it. This was so useful because it saved me minutes not having to open things like \"OK\" or \"be there\" or other really short things. Now you need to open every message to see what it says, even if it's just a dot. Put the feature back!3. The keyboard is never used by default, and for some forms of entry, completely missing. The only time the keyboard appears automatically is when sending text messages, otherwise the text entry mode is keypad, even when it makes no sense, like making notes. To switch to keyboard, it takes 3 clicks. It may not sound like much but if you plan to do any typing or text input it gets old fast. And if that wasn't bad enough, the keyboard is unavailable for places it seems necessary, like for typing Wi-Fi passwords, renaming files, and the calendar. Who is responsible for this!?4. When you put profile photos for contacts, it doesn't simply take them as - it requires you to crop the head out. The crop size is quite small even at the \"largest\" size, and it took 3 tries to get a single photo pic for a person because the original photo and even the phone's camera were making images that were too close to use. Ridiculous. I had to find a headshot that was really tiny in a large resolution picture. Way too much work for what should just be crop or use full image. I would even be ok with an aspect ratio change (which is what I think the 500g does). The phone also uses a square crop aspect ratio, which is odd because nobody has a square head. Either you chop off some hair or their neck in most cases.5. The camera is the same Tracfone low quality.  However, now you get 2 megapixels of it, not just 1. Seriously... no autofocus, no improvements? It looks like nothing was improved from previous generations.6. The \"Call Reject\" feature is missing as well. Previously you could block who calls you: all calls, those with no caller ID, unregistered, anybody in your contacts, or contacts from a group. Not anymore. What do we, as users, gain from this!?7. The fonts are kind of large, even at the small size, and almost ugly looking. I really don't appreciate them.8. Settings all over the place and somewhat sparse. I wish they were all consolidated in one place. They've also removed the Profile feature, which makes making changes to your ringtone volume and other common settings fast.9. The phone takes 30 seconds to start... it feels like molasses. It also prompts you when you turn it off, with no way to disable the prompt.I would never recommend this phone. It looks like an upgrade at first, but what kinds of upgrade cannibalizes past features!? Like my 500g, it's also an LG, so I expected some consistency. This is the usual Tracfone phone quality - feature phone with basics, but with the basics missing. A lot of these problems could be fixed with a software/firmware upgrade, but Tracfones don't have the ability to update themselves, and I doubt updates would ever get issued in the first place. This is their 3rd or 4th touch phone, and so far, TF can't get it right. I've heard complaints for the EX124g, the 800g, now this.Quick update to clarify some stuff too: I dug through everything. So when I say something is removed or gone, it simply is. The manual (like all Tracfones) is limited to begin with, so you're left to your own devices, and I really searched and searched. And I know this is not meant to be smartphone, so I'm not expecting the world, but I am expecting basic features to work well. I actually am the perfect candidate for Tracfone as I don't make many calls and plan to get a tablet for serious activity. But I'd still use my phone for the basics (and what if I someday forget my tablet or the battery dies?).", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone ever", "Author": "Mabel P.", "ReviewID": "R2LGLYM66S2LPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after reading many reviews for this phone and looking at 2 other phones for consideration and taking several days before deciding I did decide to go with the LG 840G phone and I am so glad that I did. I love, love, love this phone.  It is everything that I wanted and more.  One review said that the phone was slick and easy to drop but I have not noticed that I am however still going to buy a case just to add color though.  It has a camera, video and recorder, voicemail etc.  The touchscreen is amazing and easy to use.  The phone as many features and I am still learning how to use some of them.  I went online and activated my phone and changed my number over from my old phone to my new phone with no problems at all.  Something I did learn though is that if you have less then 10 minutes tracfone will not transfer those minutes but I did get 30 minutes so I didn't lose out on any minutes I got extra minutes and extra days added also.  I did not have any problems at all getting everything set up.  I don't know if I can transfer my contacts or not or if I have to enter them again but either way I don't have many so that's not a problem for me but it may be for some.  My phone is just for emergencies and for my husband and mom to get a hold of me and texting is for my friends.  My voicemail transferred over so I didn't have to set that up again.  My thumbs are a little fat so texting is a little bit slower for me but it would of been the same with a keypad and not a touchscreen.  The phone arrived on the day I was told that it would by UPS.  I would order from this seller again.  Amazon is a amazing place to shop and I have started shopping there a lot.  I have found there prices to be mostly cheaper on things and a lot of things with free shipping or low shipping.  Some of the reviews I read didn't give this phone as many stars as I did but lets remember folks this is a tracfone with no contract not a smartphone.  If you want a smartfone then you need to get a smartphone but if you are looking for something to make calls and text etc. easy with no contract this is a great phone.  I have not tried to check emails or anything like that yet to see how that works as I am low on minutes and am getting ready to buy more from Amazon.  I almost went with a slider but am so glad that I went with this one instead.  I am going to buy a larger GB Micro chip for recording and also a USB cable so I can just connect my phone to the USB cable and then to the computer to upload my video's.  Even though you don't have to take the battery out to get to the chip you do still have to remove the cover and why bother when you can get a cable online from Amazon for $2.89 and free shipping.  I am also going to buy a protective cover to keep the face from getting scratched.  Again why not when you can get 5 of them for $6.50 and free shipping.  Better than replacing your phone because of scratches.  Tracfone minutes are also cheaper online even though you have to pay shipping.  I have found everything that I want at Amazon cheaper than Walmart or anywhere else.  One stop shopping.  This phone may not please everyone but you know the saying you can't please everyone but this phone does please me.  I can't say enough good things about Tracfone for selling this type of phone and the seller who sells it shopcelldeals and Amazon.  They all have pleased me.  I hope that this review will help someone else who is looking to buy a tracfone.  The reviews that I read helped me a lot to make my decision.

They finally had a prepaid touch screen smartphone that you could just purchase the minimum minutes and service time you wanted. Trouble was, after researching the LG 800g on the Amazon website, I read some bad reviews explaining about trouble with the screen lock on the LG 800g.I happened on the LG 840g at a Walmart store in my area. This is the new improved model of the LG 800g. It had some good reviews on the Amazon website.I purchased it on the Amazon website because it was offered by one of their sellers with forever triple minutes with tracfone. I noticed that the tracfone website said that it wasn't going to work in my area.  So I made some phone calls to tracfone and finally reached someone higher up in the company, that let me know the phone would work in my area.I purchased 1 for my wife and 1 for myself.  I put in a 8 micro sd card....works great. All the features work well. I have taken pics and video with the camera. It's easy to text with this phone also.  I even used the wifi feature to get on the internet before I activated the phone with tracfone. I also put my music on the mp3 player, some of which I download from my Amazon cloudaccount.I give the phone 5 stars because everything works well at an affordable pay as you go price.This is an entry level smartphone. Do not expect anything in the way of apps or games to work very well on this phone.

The activation was easy, and I got the 1200 minutes and year of activation as promised. Before buying, I read all of the reviews posted here and researched on line.  The LG 840G met, and in some cases, exceeded my expectations.  It is shipped by Shopcelldeals, and I researched their reviews also.  Found a very old review that was negative, but no need to worry.  The phone arrived quickly and all promises were honored.  My phone needs are simple - I use about 300 talk and text minutes per month and was tired of paying $74 a month to a phone company.  Tracfone is a radically less expensive way to stay in contact with my friends and family.  I calculate I'll be saving about $40 a month (what a relief).  I did try wifi and was quickly booted off before I could really do anything.  That's a bug I'll have to work out.  But my primary use of the phone will be for talk and text, so it isn't a deal-breaker.  I especially love the alarm.  It wakes me up to a very pleasant chime.  I plan to buy another one to use as a home-phone and back up.  If you have a hefty, steady stream of income and are willing to pay, definitely get an IPhone.  But if you care more about your personal economy, then I highly recommend this phone and the awesome 1200 minute, year of service package from Amazon.  The only glitch is the phone is very thin, lightweight and slick, and I wasn't able to find a gel case for it.  So it could easily slip through your fingers.

There were a few different choices that had full keyboards that slid out or appeared on screen.  Unlike the other choices available, this one didn't have any reviews complaining about how often those phones would dial 911 or surf the web while locked in your pocket.  Those were features I didn't want.This LG 840G gets some good reviews so I gave it a shot.  Glad I did.  I really like this.  The screen is responsive and easy to navigate.  Audio is clear, I have been told I sound better on this by others.  There are a lot of different settings I can adjust to my liking.  Free Wi-fi where available is quite nice and can use 3g if needed.  Yeah, the screen is too small for much surfing but the info you are after is right there.  Triple minutes is very nice.The alarm functions on here are sweet.  Very simple to tweak them plus good scheduling options so my alarms change depending on the day of the week.  Can even alter the volumes of each alarm so I can have the first alarm be gentle and save the jarring stuff for later.  The only downside is that the Off and Snooze icons are right next to each other.  Easy to hit the wrong one when sleepy.I love the mp3 player here.  The volume goes all the way up to 11!  Makes me chuckle every time I crank it.  Gets decently loud too without distortion.  I have to turn it down when using earbuds.  The phone comes with a 2GB micro SD card installed.  I swapped that out for a 32GB card that should hold about 4000 songs.  Removing the back cover was the only difficulty there.  I finally figured it out.  Stick your fingernail into the microUSB port on the bottom and pop that part of the cover up.  Work your way around both sides from there and just keep popping the cover a little bit more up each time.  I's plastic so don't go Gorilla style on it.There are ways to get more out of this phone too.  I downloaded the Opera Mini 7.1 browser to use while surfing, it's definitely better than the stock browser.  I will add Google Maps to it soon since that is reported as giving you a rudimentary GPS system the phone lacks otherwise.  Upgrading the card is well worth it too if you want that capacity.Bear in mind that if you connect this phone to your Bluetooth devices and then swap in a new SD card after that, then you will probably have to redo your bluetooth connections.  The phone saves your bluetooth connections on the SD card by default.  This option can be changed to save that info on the phones memory instead of the card.I bought a combo offer with this phone with home/car/usb charging cords and a 3 pack of screen protectors.  Those weren't worth it.  The phone comes with a home charging cord anyway and the screen protectors won't be delivered until the last week of February.This is a worthy purchase.  The 400 minute/365 day Tracfone card costs $100 by itself.  For an extra 10 bucks you get this beauty.  No contracts, capacitive touch screen, mp3 & wi-fi plus it's adaptable and expandable.

Then I came to Amazon to read reviews, and found if I bought this deal, I'd be paying for a year's service and almost getting the phone free.First off, this isn't a smartphone.  A different website is marketing it as a smartphone and ticking off its customers who are giving it bad reviews.  As long as you know it's a feature phone and are comparing it to other feature phones, you should be very pleased with it.I don't know why the manufacturer chose to use the promo photo of the menu screen with the cartoon-like icons on a pale blue background.  That was almost enough to cause me not to take a closer look.  The actual three home screens are classy and professional and are customizable to where you rarely have to go to the cheesy menu screen.What makes this a huge step up from the LG800 is the new touch screen, which feels smooth and responsive.  The LG800 had a pressure type touch screen that could make you want to scream.  Typing out texts on the older phone was also so painful.  I'd try to find a pencil and use the eraser to type with, but on this new phone I can use my real fingers and it's actually not too bad.The internet usage on the old phone was something I did only on the rare emergency situation.  It would take me about five minutes to navigate to my email or one of my other accounts.  On this phone I can get right there, using bookmarks that I've set up.  On a screen this small, surfing the web isn't fun, but if you need to check something, you can and it's not too painful.The wifi is nice for setting up bookmarks, finding how to get around on the internet, and downloading pictures and whatnot.  If I'm somewhere that offers free wifi, I can certainly check what I need to online and not worry about using minutes, but if I'm at home, beyond the novelty of it, I'm not going to replace my laptop or my Samsung Galaxy player with this.  I haven't used the 3g to get on the internet, but I will when I have to.You can put your movies on it using Handbrake with the Ipod touch setting and making the width 320, keep aspect ratio, and let it choose the height automatically.  Pretty good picture.  Again, this would be for emergency situations when I'm away from the house and am bored and need to kill some time, since a screen this small isn't going to be as good an experience as a larger screen.Call clarity is great, and the ringtone is the loudest I've ever had, which is good for hearing my phone when it's in my pocket.

However, I \"upgraded\" to this phone from an old flip-phone. It does not work well where I live, yet the flip did! My husband got the LG 840G and we both have phones that barely get service where we live. Tracfone would not offer a reason for this problem, and frankly their customer service is very frustrating.

Need was more for saving money since I am not a heavy cell phone user and Verizon with taxes was $52 per month. Just a great quality connection and sound phone. Setup was simple, transfer of my Verizon number to Tracfone was simple and FREE as super quick. Added an additional 32 gig memory card for MP3 music files.To be clear, this is not an iPhone with a universe of apps and features. Navigation is clean and simple, exactly what I wanted. I do not text, send/recieve email or send/receive files; but the phone can do all that easily. Bluetooth setup is easy and automatic. Wireless setup is easy and automatic - I use my home network otherwise you pay for TracFone wireless. MP3 music files played well with good sound quality.Customer service - I experienced very little wait time on the phone and emails were answered by Tracfone calling me back on my internet phone number. Overall customer service for my needs was very good and i could understand what the service rep was saying.Drawbacks1. Tracfone lacks features such as Call Forwarding, that I used to use a lot. I would forward calls from my Verizon phone to my internet phone as I travel internationally.2. You must use your Tracfone to check your voicemail, you cannot call your phone from another phone, press #, enter password; to listen to messages.3. Phone reads .txt (text) files but oddly, sometimes it has problems. I used Notepad to create .txt files to store addresses and other information, then copied the files to the \"Other\" directory. Sometimes \"Format not supported\" error message comes up.4, Comes with a small set of ringtones but you have to purchase any additional ones from Tracfone.Overall, I am saving $500+ per year over Verizon so I can live with a few less features.

Except for a brief experience I had with Metro PCS several years ago, I found that TracFone had (much) better Nationwide Coverage in Rural Areas. Most of my TracFones have all been very basic candy bar style, clam shell or slider design.  Most have been GSM versions that use a SIM Card.  My last TracFone was my absolute favorite being the LG 290C  CDMA Phone operating on the Verizon Network.  This simple slider phone had very good battery life, easy functionality with excellent reception both at home and wherever I traveled.  I decided to give a shot at owning a newer style Touchscreen Phone and pulled the trigger finally on the newly released LG 840G a serious upgrade from last years older LG800G.  Mind you, I did`nt want or need a smart phone/ android/ or iPhone.  I don`t need apps, I don`t need a hand held computer/browser, I don`t  Wi-Fi,Tweet, Facebook, You Tube, or Download Music Files.  I use (my) Phone for an occasional outgoing or incoming call and once in a while send or receive a Text Message.

I`m still a bit nervous that I might accidentally sweep my finger and end up with a (widgit) that I won`t know how to remove from the Home Screen but so far so good.  I highly recommend this TracFone for anyone needing a modern thin Touchscreen phone that does (not) need a Smart Phone and uses their Cell Phone sparingly.  Its \"Triple The Minutes for The Life of The Phone\" is a very nice extra making refill minutes very affordable especially when adding on TracFones frequent Promotion Codes.

Some of the LG840G Phones come with a T-Mobile SIM card that works on their Network.  I have found from (my) experience when traveling, AT&T; has had better coverage.

However, none of those problems have been had with this phone (so far).I received my phone yesterday and couldn't wait to post a review due to how much better a phone it is. First of all, since it's a touch screen and requires the user to swipe up to unlock the screen, it's nearly impossible for the phone to unlock and for the \"buttons\" to be pressed while it's in my pocket. Second, the phone connected to my WiFi Network without any problems. Like the Samsung, this phone features Tracfone's Triple Minutes for Life and is a great value when purchased with the 1200 minute deal.The touch screen is very responsive and the menu layout is smooth and simple. I like the software on this phone better than any previous Tracfone, for it offers simplicity plus some added little features that provide a better user experience. However, the reason I took away 1-star was due to the fact that the menu screens cannot be customized with different colors/backgrounds (as they could on the Samsung), and the phone doesn't allow for a Password Lock feature for when the phone wakes up. The password lock CAN be turned on manually or set to turn on when the phone has been restarted/rebooted, but I'd have liked to have been able to password lock the phone every time it wakes up. But, those are just little issues that, in no way, should deter anyone from getting this phone. The phone offers the low-cost phone service of Tracfone on an easy-to-use, touch screen device that does most of what a phone owner would need.

You can also hear people pretty well on this one. Hardly any crackle at all.-The touch function works really well and there isn't any lag. And the buttons on the bottom work the same way, they are not click buttons but touch buttons with the same sensitivity. It's really fun and easy to use. One main drawbacks to the touch screen however is that while you're talking to someone you have to make sure you don't touch it to your face because it'll do stuff (e.g., dial numbers, mute the call, hang up, etc.) It's not really that big a deal though, you just have to get use to holding it away from your face a bit... or do like I did and use it as an excuse to get a Bluetooth headset XD Which connects really easily, but more about that later.-The Wi-Fi function works great. As long as you have Wi-Fi active and connected to a router it'll surf the web without taking any of your minutes. You can even watch youtube video's on this one, which is a feature I haven't seen in any other tracfone I've had. I'd suggest only watching them when connect to Wi-Fi though, it takes a lot of minutes to watch them without it. This phone's web browser also has a multi-tab function and bookmarks, which is a nice step up from the other tracfones offered right now.-This phone has Bluetooth capabilities and it works really well. I've had tracfones before that were supposed to have Bluetooth but they were a hassle to connect too for anything. This one connects really fast and simple. Just turn the Bluetooth on and search for the device and wham you're connected to it. Seriously, it's been that easy ever time I go to connect it to something :)-Another cool feature this phone has is the MP3 Player which works really well. You have to get use to how the playlists are set up but after you do it's free sailing. This phone also comes with a Micro SD card so you can store a truck load of songs and photos on this thing without and problems.-The 2MP camera is pretty good. It has a lot of cool options for both taking the photos and editing the photos after they are taken. The video camera function isn't that great however :/ it has a very little resolution and comes out as a little 300x250 box when transferred to your computer...Over all this is a great phone though :) I really love it.

It's not laggy because as said, it's not a smartphone. So it doesn't have resource hogging bloatware and apps. It has all the things a well thought out feature phone has plus wifi and 3g. 3g costs minute by minute, talk time. It works well enough, I have not tried wifi yet.The phone has a nice, clean squared off design and looks like a smartphone just sitting there. Right down to it's Android look home screens and completely smooth facade. It's easy to navigate and it's menus simple to use. The camera is 2mp but takes good pics imo, and features a nice array of adjustments. It also takes decent video. I find the phone easy to text with and it's touch keyboard more then adequate and accurate.This is like a regular full feature phone, but deluxe. IOW, it's not a smartphone, pda, mini tablet or otherwise.

You can download Google Maps and if you want to use your minutes, can use this as a GPS of sorts. I have, on several occasions mapped out my route at home on my computer and then if something wasn't quite up-to-date on the map material I printed at home THEN I use the Google Maps on the road to look for alternate routes (also it does contain live traffic patterns - shows colored roads for busy or stopped traffic).A feature I didn't think I would use but have many times in the since I bought this is the wifi features.  You can open a wifi connection to any public or private network (if you have the password of course) and it doesn't use any of your minutes. I ran into several reviews before purchasing this phone where people thought if you connected to a wifi hotspot your phone calls would be free over wifi as well (like the way a Magic Jack works).  However, the free use of wifi is only for internet access and will not make phone calls free; you only get internet access free.  Also, the phone isn't a true smartphone so you only get a mobile browser (no choice of using any other). This phone isn't running any version of the Android operating system so with the exception of Google Maps (it isn't preloaded on the phone, you have to download it) there really are only a couple apps you can get.As for reception, I live an apartment that is a pretty dead area for most people's I-phones and even most of the high end Samsung phones. I was surprised, to say the least, that I get decent reception using this 3G phone...better than the 4G phones most of my friends have. And before anyone gets upset, I wish I had one of those phones with all the extra features. And yes, my simple Tracfone is using the same carriers and cell towers as some of the more expensive phones.So, who would I recommend this phone to?  A second phone for ANYONE. If you make a moderate amount of phone calls and texts it should meet your needs (like I mentioned, it has all the essential apps built in: contacts, mp3 player, camera, calendar, Google maps and a number of other apps) and while the phone doesn't have a huge amount of memory - it comes with a 2 gig memory card - the memory card can also be replaced easily - no screwdriver needed - to hold your tunes and pictures. Since the setup function in the phone lets you decide whether to store things like music, contacts, pictures and a couple other things on the memory card or the built in memory I would recommend getting a larger memory card as well. After all, music takes a lot of space so if you use this as an mp3 player as well you won't have to worry about running out of space. For such a small and inexpensive phone it really does serve well.

Additionally to magnify the screen you can not touch expand, there is a icon to select to magnify the screen for each screen being viewed. In the browser a selection for landscape is available.  Also the on-screen, keypad doesn't come up when needed for data entry on WiFi browsing. The telephone keypad comes up and you must press buttons forever to enter data.

I bought it because Tracfone had refurbished models for 10$ and my keyboard on my other phone was kind of glitchy making texting a pain, so I thought I'd give it a try for that price. Basics: It has triple minutes (I buy 1500 tripling to 4500 once a year.) It is touch screen- no slide out keyboard which I wish it did have. Camera, video, works on GSM (AT&T;) towers. Wifi, bluetooth, a couple apps a 2GB micro SD card for music. It has a nice large screen that is easy to use and see, similar to using an iPod touch.Texting: this is basically what I use a phone for. You can make SMS texts up to 5 pages long, it sends them as so many pages but you don't have to start a new text every 160 characters. You can add a picture, music, video or other files to SMS texts, otherwise it will send them as SMS rather than MMS, it doesn't give you a choice which kind you want to send beforehand. As usual with tracfone you don't get to see who's texting you until you open it. I don't really like the touchscreen keyboard, I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also when you try to scroll through stuff like templates it's nearly impossible because every time you touch the screen it thinks you're selecting something. It has autocorrect, but I have that turned off. It's useful to have a stylus.Calling: If you live in an area with good AT&T; coverage calls are fine.Browser: I don't use this because it takes up tons of minutes and most websites don't actually work or show up correctly because there's not a real operating system. Works fine to check email or facebook messages though.Camera: Camera is 2MP but doesn't take great pictures. There's no zoom, unless you are using a low resolution, which is silly, why would you want to take low res photos to be able to zoom? There are lots of adjustable features, however, such as brightness, white balance, night mode, color effects like mono, sepia, negative, blue, a timer, normal or continuous shot mode. Plus you can edit pictures you've taken or downloaded with frames, flip, rotate, resize, add an image like a crown or a heart etc. to the photo, change the colors, adjust brightness, contrast, hue etc., add a filter such as sharpen, emboss, water color, sketch, neon, cartoon etc., draw with a pen, add text, crop, or add a stamp. You can also print via bluetooth.Video: Basically the same settings the camera has to take the video, plus the ability to zoom.Functions: Screen locks after a set period of time (you can adjust the amount of time) You push a button to turn the phone back on, and slide the lock up to unlock the screen. There's a \"home\" button at the bottom left on the screen. You can set contacts to shortcut to from the main screen, and you can set shortcuts to the widgets like email or messaging. There are also 4 buttons in a bar on the bottom of the home screen to make calls, go to contacts, go to texts or go to the widgets screen. You can scroll through widgets using this bar, or click on the apps button to go to the apps screen. If you don't want to add a widget to your shortcuts but want to easily access it for a period of time, you can slide it from the bar up to your wallpaper and it will stick on the main screen until you slide it back to the bar. These widgets include prepaid, where your phone/minutes info is located, contacts, messages, dialing, recent calls, games, calendar, camera, video camera, alarm, browser, settings where you can change the display, call, phone, and touch settings and sounds, email, SNS (facebook, twitter, myspace), voice recorder, file manager (photos, videos, music), pictures, music player, notepad, audio, video, sound settings, wi-fi, bluetooth, calculator, tip calculator, stopwatch, unit converter and tasks.Ringtones: You can add your own ringtones, but for some reason you are limited on file size. I put several ringtones on the phone that I'd had on my other phone, and all but 4 of them were blocked from being set as ringtones because the file size was too large, even though they were only about 16 seconds long and I'd used them as ringtones before. On my old phone, I kept the volume set at medium. I have this phone set all the way up and I can still barely hear it when I play the ringtones. It seems loud enough when the alarm goes off though.Contacts: You can add photo ids and ringtones and emails etc for specific contacts. But unlike every other phone I've ever used you have to crop the photo to a little square. You can move the square where you want on the photo, but you don't get to resize it the size of the square is what you get. Which is annoying. There are message and call icons next to the contact name in the list, so you don't have to click on them to send them stuff. And, as I said, you can add your frequent contacts to the shortcut on the home page and not have to go into contacts at all.Bluetooth: This works fine, I transferred several files between the phone and my computer as well as my other phones and had no problems.Case: I got a case because I like the colors, but you really don't need one for this phone. The screen isn't covered by a case anyway, and the back cover is textured so you don't see scratches or fingerprints for the most part. And a case is only going to give you minimal breakage protection.Battery: I still have a full charge though I've been playing with the phone for a few days. But I'm not a heavy user so I don't know how long it lasts with frequent calls/ texts because I just got it.There are tap sounds when you touch things on the touch screen that you can turn off or change.When you enter info into contacts etc, the default entry method is keypad, but you can change it to keyboard. You can also add things to your dictionary and change between English and Spanish languages.Managing calls: One of the reasons I liked the AT&T; phones I've had on tracfone was the ability to block numbers from calling or texting me, so I didn't keep getting the same sales calls etc. This phone does not have the option to do that. And the lack of that feature when it was on the other phones knocked it down a star, because it was one of the two selling points for choosing AT&T; over Verizon, along with being able to create multiple page SMS texts, if the network works equally well for both in your area.So overall, it seems like a decent phone. If you like touchscreen keyboards, AT&T;, and don't care about being able to block numbers (which you can't do on the Verizon phones either) or take good pictures, you should like it, especially if you get the refurbished phone for 10$. It has a 3 month return window and a 1 year warranty. Though it is quite disappointing to \"upgrade\" your phone after 2 years and have to take a step backwards in functionality on many of the uses. If you've never had any of the things this phone lacks, however, you'll probably be a lot more pleased with it.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Huge upgrade over my old Tracfone Flip Phone", "Author": "Johnny S", "ReviewID": "R39Y7I2XUPGE3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone as a replacement for an older aging flip phone from Tracfone and and love the upgrade!

It is very difficult to find a phone that is simple, easy to use, and intuitive. I don't do a lot of texting, and I did not want a phone with a slide out keyboard...just something that is reliable. So, my choices are rather limited. After having this phone for several weeks, I think I could have made a better choice because there are several things that I do not like about this one.First, it is very difficult for me to find the screen that I want. When I go from stand-by to a screen, it is usually because I want to make a call. In my way of thinking, I would like the screen that pops up to be my frequently called numbers, but there is not a way to program this phone so that happens consistently. I get an arbitrary screen, and must hunt around for frequently called numbers. You can punch a number for speed dial, but then why bother to take someone's picture, put it on a favorites screen, then not be able to access that screen instantly?Next, I would prefer to enter names and numbers into my phonebook using the screen's QWRTY  keyboard rather than  the old-fashioned phone method (eg. pressing the number \"7\" four times to get to the letter \"t\"). I would also like to use the QWRTY keyboard for Calendar events but cannot access it. It takes so long to input Calendar items that I don't even use this function. Really, the only thing I believe the keyboard comes up for is texting, which I don't do often. Also, there is a handy place to write notes to yourself, but, in that app, you cannot make a list because there is not a return key. Once again, because the keyboard cannot be used. I would like to make a \"to do\" list or a grocery list, but you only have the option of writing out sentences, which, when it gets long enough will finally move to the next line. This makes reading your note as a \"list\" more difficult. .Next, the touchscreen is not responsive, so instead of scrolling to the next or the previous page, you wind up selecting an item that you didn't intend to. I guess I am just used to my iPad's touch screen which is so excellent, that many other products seem far inferior.Next, the speakerphone is not available until after you answer a call. I would like to answer my phone using speaker, not have the caller wait and not talk until the symbol decides to pop up and I can find and engage it.Finally, when you check messages, there is not an instant way to disconnect. You have to scroll to a previous page to end the voicemail connection. And yes, this only takes a couple of seconds, but they are seconds that I have to pay for...and as I previously mentioned, this phone can be a little temperamental when using the touch screen.OK...what I do like is that the letters on the screen are large enough for me to read. I had to take one phone back because the font could not be adjusted. And silly me...I thought they all could. And, the sound quality is good.It is just a shame that you have to purchase a product before you realize that you don't like it.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Going back to my antiquated flip phone", "Author": "Robin B.", "ReviewID": "R2KAFITWOLS3AI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this phone from my original LG Flip phone.  I got a better price though amazon than Tracfone.  I've been using it for a couple of months and am generally happy with it.  It is not a smartphone, so don't buy it thinking you are getting one.  But if you want a phone for basic calling and texting functions, I think you will like this LG.  The texting screen is easier to see than my flip phone.  The touch screen takes some getting used to, but now I don't have any problems with it.  One thing I don't like is when you get a call, you have to handle it carefully by the sides of the phone or else you will inadvertently answer, reject or ignore a call.  This isn't easy when digging the phone out of a purse.  I have had Tracfone service for two years now and would NEVER go back to the larger service providers.  My one negative comment is why can't they include an instruction manual with electronics anymore?  It would be so much more helpful if they did and I might be more proficient at using all the features.Update:  I have had the phone for about six months.  Yesterday, I had three \"dropped\" calls.  This usually occurs if I am in a car or otherwise walking around (one time it happened three times in my home when I walked into a particular room).  I NEVER had a dropped call with my antiquated LG Flip phone.  Also, I have a vacation home in a somewhat rural area, and I cannot seem to get service there with this phone.  I was able to get service with my old LG flip phone, but not this one.  I do like certain features of this phone (the screen is easy to read, texting is easy with the keyboard), but the dropped calls and dead zones for service are a little too aggravating.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a low use owner.", "Author": "Ronald Farrell", "ReviewID": "R1ZTQVC9KVWBSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fun little phone with most of the features of the big ones with a fraction of the cost and its not a heavy item to carry in a shirt pocket.

(modified the JAD files to remove that pesky keypad, per earlier posts).I have since discovered that the built-in browser works even better, as long as my wifi symbol is active- I won't get charged airtime minutes for browsing. Also, I set up Google Voice on my pc, and then downloaded the google voice app from getjar onto the phone-  now I can text and receive texts for free (to my free Google phone #/google voice app on the LG, and as long as wifi is activated).Suggest the purchase of a PC bluetooth USB adapter or a micro-usb data cable to easily transfer files to and from the LG.Also, I installed a Kingston 8 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SDC4- set the phone to use that for primary memory storage.So far, I like the phone, and being frugal, I like the associated costs (or the lack of them).  I have a semi-smart phone without a monthly, locked in, 2 year agreement.Have some patience when talking to Tracfone customer service- so far they've been polite, but I'm guessing they use a text-to-english speech translator.Now if I can just find a case for this phone!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not quite an android, but close", "Author": "CabbieMom \"Spoiling grandma\"", "ReviewID": "R2YHCR9A4L8RII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this and have been very happy with it, but now I see Tracfone has come out with a true android phone. :-( I wish I had waited as this is good, but not an android.

I would lose signal completely multiple times a day, and spent countless hours trying to restart it or step outside to gain signal back, only to lose it again.

I had to make a switch to a C model phone which uses Verizon towers. Since the switch, I have no reception issues whatsoever, and consistently have 5 bars for signal strength. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use this phone like I wanted because it is such a nice little phone.

It has a message \"unregistered SIM\".  I spent several hours on the phone with Tracfone support trying to resolve it.  Eventually they said they would send a replacement.  The support people are good but they are forced to follow a rigid procedure which is slow and ineffective.  Worse is that they are on a truly awful phone system so you can't understand what they are saying.  Not due to an accent but just due to the terrible quality of the phones they use.  (I think it is voice over IP).  All in all pure torture for a phone that does not work more than a week after I bought it *and* they won't extend my time to compensate for the time I am losing.Update June 1:  ShopCellDeals came through for me, provided a pre-paid return label and refunded both the phone and calling card.  Tracfone is much worse than I said before.  They promised a replacement phone but never sent one, then claimed they never had promised a replacement and hung up on me when I gave them my problem tracking number.  They may be okay for routine issues like setting up a phone that has no issues but are incredibly bad if they can't get the phone to work.  After over three weeks trying to work the issue with them I decided to return the phone to ShopCellDeals.  At first they wanted me to return the phone via over night express at my cost but after I objected gave me the pre-paid label.  They are good guys.  Amazon on the other hand is not so great.  They weren't going to honor their A to Z guarantee because I spent 3 weeks working with Tracfone instead of ShopCellDeals.  The lesson learned is that you should NEVER try to fix a phone problem with the carrier.  Send it back immediately as defective if there are any issues so that you don't lose your Amazon guarantee.  Bottom line grades:  Tracfone: F,  ShopCellDeals: A,  Amazon: D, Phone: ?? (it was probably Tracfone, not the phone that was the issue).By the way, I found out that all of the major carriers let you buy pre-paid minutes, though they don't advertise this.  I got a T-Mobile phone with 1,000 pre-paid minutes at about 9 cents a minute, good for a year.  The other carriers have similar plans though AT&T; and Verizon cost more.  You don't have to enter the Tracfone/Net10 rabbit hole to get a phone with pre-paid minutes you can use sparingly with no chance of surprise overage charges.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG did a good Tracfone...", "Author": "Ronnie", "ReviewID": "R32X0OU0S5946B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works are voice record, video and picures.

As a person who didn't use his phone for much other than calls and texts, I figured that, since I lived in a more digital world, it was long overdue for an upgrade.So, after some digging, a little bit of research and one weekend later with an Amazon Gift Card, I bought this and something else for another piece of technology I own (which I am satisfied with the other purchase as well).If any of you are looking for a super-awesome smartphone that can download and run apps within minutes, just leave this page and look at what TracFone has to offer for Android phones. If you're looking for a phone that does only the simple stuff, you might be better off getting a flip-phone. If you're looking for something above the standard phone that won't break your bank,THIS is the phone for you.Already, this phone has proven to be above and beyond what I had originally expected. So far, I've toyed around with it for a little bit and found out that it comes with an MP3 playing function built-in to the system, a camera that doubles as a picture camera and a video camera, a voice recorder, WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, a browser, an emailing app, a notepad... so much stuff on one TracFone. I'm really only scratching the surface here, too.Most of you will be pleasantly surprised that this phone comes a 2GB microSD card already inserted into the phone's microSD card slot. I myself actually switched out that for a 16GB mSDHC card I had in my tablet that refused to work, so that worked out well - I've already octupled my SD card storage without even needing to do anything too big.If you wanna insert your own SD card, you just take off the back (mind you, I did it while the phone was turned off to avoid data loss) and the mSD card is right above the battery to the right. Slide that puppy out, put in your own and you're good to go. Currently, I've only been able to test a 16GB mSDHC card in it, but if it can handle that, I'm sure that, since it's within the same model of it, this phone can handle 1GB and 2GB mSD cards and 4GB, 8GB, 16GB and 32GB mSDHC cards. As of now, I'm not sure about mSDXC, but if someone wants to test that out, they're more than welcome to.There's also some phone internal memory, but I've been able to determine that the phone itself has secure, encrypt access to that storage as it doesn't appear in my computer when I turn it on. It doesn't really bother me much, but I think that it should be open for usability on your computer when you plug it in.Speaking of which, this phone CAN be plugged into a computer as a Mass Storage Device. However, to activate that function, I'm pretty sure that you need a mSD card inserted into your phone for that to work - so far, my tower's read both the preinstalled 2GB and my 16GB, so that works out well. The folders are already installed by the phone and are clearly marked, so there's no need to worry about what goes where. You just put it where you want it to go and you're set!As of right now, I haven't really been able to test out calling functions too well, but I'm sure this phone is great at it. Texts come off of it great, too - if I had one nitpick for texting, it's that I sometimes mispress on the keyboard and write the wrong thing. Not a biggie - keyboard comes with a backspace button on it - but I wish that the screen was just a smidge bigger so that could be more prevented. However, I do kinda have big fingers and thumbs, so... that may be just me. You'll have to find out for yourself when you get it.Any updates on this phone will be posted on this feedback as well as changing of stars (possibly) as time goes on. But, for now, I guess I'm done. Hope you have fun tinkering with the phone - I sure will :DOh, and to Safelink Wireless customers looking at this phone: This DOES work with Safelink. I've already transferred my minutes and plan flawlessly to the new phone from my old LG 300G after a bit of tinkering. Just a protip, though - that Serial Number you get with the phone? Don't throw that out. That's EXTREMELY important, so keep it next to the phone until you activate it, then keep it for future possible use. Just a penny for your thoughts.UPDATE 1** I've been able to test calling on the phone and OH, BOY, is it fantastic! The signal's just as strong as it was on my old LG 300G and the call quality is flawless! Protip, though: Don't have regular old headphones plugged into the jack when someone's calling you or they won't be able to hear you. I got a call from my brother while I had my Apple Earbuds in and he couldn't hear me, so that was a bit of a downer.Photos on the phone come out great, but I'm slightly saddened by the lack of a forward-facing camera. However, it's not much of a bother to flip the phone for pictures. You just can't see the screen, but the button to take pictures is next to the \"Go Back\" touchspace, so that does mean you have to ready your finger before you take the photo. Other than that, works fine for me!Another protip: Using the browser when you're out and about on the 3G signal'll drain your minutes pretty quickly, so be sparing in that and use the internet when you have a WiFi connection readily available.Bluetooth works somewhat, but not completely. This phone has trouble connecting to some Androids and Apple products, so if you get this, keep that in mind if you've got a Droid or an iOS device.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price", "Author": "Garrett Aldrich", "ReviewID": "R1NGM430W9EXB2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone does all that it says just in a basic function.

Then I learned I needed to cut back my spending to achieve some financial goals but, it was really time to replace my Java OS LG 800G, from Tracfone.It took me a year and a half to really get familiar with everything my LG 800G could do and I was even starting to feel comfortable with it's primitive .jar Facebook app.  So, after getting familiar with the LG Java OS, I decided to just upgrade to the Tracfone LG 840G for only 23.99, tax free, and with free shipping.  I'm very happy with this phone because, even though it's not running on the iOS or Android, I'm still enjoying an almost-full-featured smart-phone, something that my Tracfone LG 800G feature phone never was.The Tracfone LG 840G lets me export my Mac OS X Address Book to the phone's address book and the phone even displays the picture icons in my contacts that originated from my Mac OS X's Address Book.  It lets me connect to the Internet with wifi which saves minutes.  It even has a high-quality camera with pretty decent color science.What really makes it seem like an almost-full-featured smart-phone is it has it's own email client app and the built in web browser handles my Twitter Account really nice.  It runs the same old Facebook.jar app that my old LG 800G ran but, it runs it a lot faster.  Not having push-notifications for Facebook and Twitter probably keeps this product from being a full-blown full-featured smart phone.So, by getting a powerful phone that is not the latest and greatest from Tracfone, I was able to get it for a song.  Maybe two years from now I will be able to buy the Tracfone LG Optimus Dynamic II, with Android, for a song or maybe, I will be so addicted to the Touchscreen Java OS LG phones, Tracfone will have to come out with an LG Java phone upgrade for Tracfone LG 840G users that are addicted to the LG's Java OS.By the way, I got the \"LG840G Dynamic Hybrid Tuff Hard Case Snap On Phone Silicone Cover Neon Green/Black\" for this phone and it's the sexiest phone case I have ever had.I am an iOS lover but my budget decides what OS I use, when picking a phone and cellular plan I can afford but, since this is an almost-full-featured smart phone, in my opinion, I find myself using my iPad and iPod Touch less.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone !!!!!", "Author": "F.

The only feature It seemed to be missing was Call Forwarding to my land line if the Cell phone was off are out of range, which I like so I just have to manage one voice mail, and when I am home my incoming Cell calls are just sent to my land line so tracfone minutes are not used.Some Googling provided me with some info that the LG 840 uses AT&T; infrastructure.

Texting is more user friendly than before. I now enjoy having a camera, calender, and better calculator plus all the other features because of this phone.Wi fi functionality is limited. For me it is adequate as I only need to access email, weather reports, stock prices, and public transportation schedules. The default browser is unresponsive. I downloaded Opera Mini from other reviewers suggestions and it works much better. You will not be watching movies or videos on this phone but as I say if you want the big thrills than be ready to pay the big bills. If you want a phone that functions like a laptop in your pocket than this phone is not for you. Others have suggested ways to tweak Opera Mini to make it more functional but I haven't needed to do that yet.Transferring my minutes from my old Tracfone took a little effort. I couldn't do it online so I had to contact customer service in Miami and they were great. Just be prepared to enter a lot of activation numbers into the new phone when you call.

Within a week I noticed that I sure had to charge my phone quite a bit but I wasn't sure the time between charges so I conducted a test.  I charged my phone up to full and it completed at 2:00 am.  I made sure Wi Fi was off and turned all the settings like back light to as low as possible to conserve battery.  I didn't use my phone at all except to check the clock once and awhile.  No phone calls, no text messaging, no wi-fi or web browsing nothing.  I got the low battery warning at 9pm later that day, that's only 19 hours later it had to be recharged and I didn't use the phone at all, it pretty much just sat there on standby the whole time.  I hear reports of people going several days with mild use before it needed a recharge, mine only lasts 19 hours and that's with no use at all, so I can't imagine how little it will last with regular use.Im forced to return the phone and its a big pain in the butt because I already canceled my other wireless provider so I will go without a mobile phone now for a couple weeks at least until they receive this one, get a refund, then I have to order a new one and wait for that to get in.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Friend Saw Mine Thought It Was A good Deal So Got This One As A gift For Him Which He Was Thankful For", "Author": "Rich(Anime&Games; Will Always Prevail!)", "ReviewID": "R3EJ004FCOQV48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I found the LG800g to be good and functional after an accident it wasn't working so good afterwords so I had to decide repurchase the 800g or go for this one for the same price.After having this cellphone for about a week I found it to be a good choice,the touchscreen and online capabilities are definitely better then the earlier model and with the added bonus of getting triple minutes instead of double. Again a word of warning though this is a prepaid cellphone and while it does have some decent capabilities it obviously isn't going to match up to a Samsung Galaxy and the like so if you want those bells and whistles you should just get a contract cellphone instead.The cellphone is pretty sturdy about the same as the LG800g and could probably handle a drop relatively safely(Though mine got stepped on by a heavyset person before I could pick it up again)but you can get a protective cover pretty cheap here as well if it makes you feel safer.So again for those who have needed a phone in a dire or problematic situation here's a very affordable one to get without the hassle of signing up for a yearly contract and worrying about monthly costs or early cancellation fees but also remember if you're one of those need to have the latest model to keep with the fashion crowd then obviously this phone isn't going to be for you.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Love it.", "Author": "Rajah Varatharajah \"Peeveeaar\"", "ReviewID": "R3LM8Y9MRFWDX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a very nice product, easy to use.

It took some getting used to replying by starting a new message.  You cannot set the clock to 24 hour (military) time.

The manual can be downloaded from the internet but is missing a lot of information.  Luckily I was able to find answers on the internet forums or Amazon reviews.  I also like that the phone is small and light weight.  However the downside is the screen is quite small so the image from weather radar (one of my primary uses when accessing the internet) is very tiny and low-resolution.  Also many of the keys on internet screens are so small that they are difficult to select with my large fingers, requiring several \"pushes\" to register.  I agree with other reviewers who have mentioned that text messages come in with only a few letters of the message displayed so it is difficult to decide whether to open the message (and use up prepaid minutes) or discard them.

It took about 3 weeks to get the new phone and I had to call again to find out why it was taking so long but finally got the new phone which seems fine. The LG840G was a bit confusing to me since you cannot get your voicemails by clicking on messages (apparently that is for text messages only but simply says \"messages\". You have to click the \"Dialing\" shortcut until a number keypad comes up and then hold the number one key until the phone dials in your voicemail telling you if you have messages and then playing the messages if any. I never would have this out without help from Tracfone and they had to look it up while I listened to music for 10 minutes. If you want to silence the ringtone for movies and such you have to go to a shortcut called \"sounds\" it took me forever to stumble on that since my other phones had this option under \"settings\".

I wanted the features of a smartphone but without the monthly bills that usually come with it. This seemed to have all I needed plus 3g and wifi.The good points: Ive had it for three months now and it has been a reliable phone. The apps are easy to learn (transitioning from a push button phone menu anyway) and if you already have an iPod its a synch. The apps are ok; calculator address book, notepad, calculator, calender, voice recorder, music player, web browser,  a weak video camera, Facebook, Twitter and My Space access and Bluetooth. Tower reception is usually better than most of my friends have with their smart phones in \"dead zones.\"The not so hot: The 3g will EAT up your points! I use the wifi wherever I can to avoid having to buy more minutes. I don't use this phone as my primary method of web surfing while I'm on the go, but I found that just a few minutes of surfing the web and looking for a ringtone or a game to buy will really chew at your prepaid points level. Also this phone does not have Android, you cant get the variety of apps like you can on a smartphone or an apple device. That said, buying games and ringtones will also cost you prepaid points and the selection is limited and disappointing. I also didn't like the menus for all these \"features\" and it took forever to search and find what I wanted (another reason to use the wifi.)

I just wanted to say that because it seems like people my age are so addicted to phones and have to have these 500 dollar phones. I never got into the phone craze. Even as a younger girl I hated talking on the phone. But I do love e-mail and like the convenience of having a cellphone.I needed a phone because my car is getting older and I was worried I might get stuck somewhere. This phone is so perfect. It came with 1200 minutes (tripled for life!) and I've had it for almost a year and still have 300 minutes left. I don't really use it for calling much, more for texting and playing games (I'm so addicted to bubble bash).It has great features and is easy to use. The little music player is great. I love the camera-- basic as it is-- it works for me and is really clear. I left it in my car in -15 degree weather once and it still works. So it's durable. It's thin and light, but not cheap.The negatives: the internet is horrible. It's very slow and sometimes doesn't automatically catch the WiFi in the area. It also doesn't come with a sync cable... only a charge one. But you can buy a sync cable for about 3 dollars here on amazon.The memory is also light. I'm not sure if you can upgrade it to a larger memory chip, but I'd like to look into it.The absolute worst feature is the 411. Don't even bother. It's voice-automated and can NEVER figure out what you're saying. I tried once for 15 minutes to get a restaurant phone number and it just couldn't figure out what I was saying at all.Overall, though, this phone is really perfect. It's got the modern flat screen slider, so I don't feel like a freaking dinosaur around everyone else when I whip it out. It's easy to use and it's a great basic phone.And the price can't be beat.

Just remember to use the car's pairing instructions to match to the phone, not the phone's instructions.  I nearly went nuts until I figured that out.  This phone is made exclusively for TracFone incidentally, so do not bother going to any other carriers site to find the manual.  Amazon's price for this phone (or any phone, for that matter) is much better than TracFone's prices.

If you're a browser, pass on this & get a different phone & plan. For basic use, I love this. It's sturdy, reliable and gets excellent reception. Cheaper by about $20 than getting it from Tracfone. With the triple minutes deal, I end up paying less than 5-cents/minute (amd you can do even better if you talk a lot), and here's how.If you buy 200 minutes @ $39.95 (includes 90-days of talk time), it's tripled to 600 minutes with this phone. That comes out to just under 7-cents/minute. Before you check out, you are given the option to buy an additional 200 (600) mins, w/o talk-time, for just $20. Combine that with a bonus (usually offered - 40 minutes or so but NOT tripled) and you end up paying just $60 for 1200+ minutes; 5-cents or less per minute. I'm an average user (300 to 400 min/mo), so this works out great and I always have unused talk+time that's carried over. A pretty good deal.The phone works great (download a PDF manual for full instructions), includes a 2MP camera, takes good SD video (w/sound), voice recorder for notes, file manager, task manager and Wi-Fi along with the standard phone stuff. The speaker phone function is very good, or you can go Bluetooth, if you want. It also includes a pretty decent MP3 player.For the money, this is an excellent phone for someone who doesn't need a true \"Smart Phone\". While you can go on line, it burns up minutes as fast as a lit match disposes of rolling paper - fast! Texting is good and you are charge 0.3 minutes per 160-character text, so a very long text will use almost a minute of time: not bad when you buy your time at 5-cents a minute or less.I've had my 840G for about 1 1/2 yrs with no issues, and got one for my son almost a year ago. He's happy with his as I am with mine.

Huh?! I guessed 200 minutes (originally started at 100 but the agent told me to guess higher!) as I had no idea how many were left, since it was my daughter's phone. After the lengthy waiting period the agent came back and told me they would approve a transfer of that many (200) minutes to a new phone. I said what if I'd guessed higher and why can't they tell me exactly what's left? He said all they could do was approve/disapprove the guess.

Before this, I had one of the cheapest tracfones made- a Samsung and swore I would never get another Tracfone- too small and not enough volume. The LG 840G is very smart for a phone that is not being billed as 'smart'. With it, I can connect hands free to the BlueConnect system in my 2009 Hyundai, record videos, and watch certain youtube videos, and the best part is that I can connect to my home internet wirelessly and not have it deduct minutes for internet and email access. There is also plenty of volume and clarity for normal phone usage. The 1200 minute/1 year service/triple minutes for life make this a great deal for the price, but because of Mike-from-Minnesota's post, I was able to use a promo code to have 250 extra minutes and 2 more months of service added when I activated the phone. This makes a sweet deal even sweeter. I have 3 minor complaints: 1. I was not able to access my Google Voice account so that I could make free long distance phone calls without turning on my computer- something that I'd hoped I'd be able to do before I bought it. I got a message saying the page was too large to display. That might be remedied by downloading 3rd party browsers that I've been reading about.;2. The box said that a USB cable was included in the package, but it wasn't. If it had been, I'd have been able to transfer MP3 files from my computer, but now I have to wait 4 more days until the USB cable I ordered arrives. 3. If somebody I don't know sends me a text message and I don't want it, it seems that minutes get deducted even if I ignore the message- that's not fair. There may be a way to disable that, but I haven't figured it out yet. Those 3 complaints do not diminish my original 5 star rating. This phone deal is awesome for the price and the dealer whom I bought it off of got the phone to me very quickly. Since I posted this yesterday, I resolved 2 of my above complaints. The USB cable and chargers I ordered came yesterday and I was able to transfer mp3s to the tracfone. Very pleased that there is plenty of volume for playback of the mp3s- I like to listen to rock LOUD! I downloaded and installed Opera Mini 7.1 and was able to make phone calls via Google Voice. My only remaining complaint is that minutes get deducted when someone texts me- but I may still be doing something wrong. Now I have to change my rating to 6 stars!

I used up the minutes in about 6 months, but this was still a good savings off other options for light cell phone user who uses a Magicjack plus at home for longer conversations including the typical sitting on hold for customer service type calls.  I discovered the newer LG 840 online when I realized that just buying more minutes wasn't much cheaper than buying the phone/minutes packages.  As others have said, this includes some improvements over the 800 which was itself is a pretty decent phone for the money.After the new phone arrived, I tried to transfer my contacts via bluetooth between the phones as others suggested. I ended up doing it by swapping microsd cards between phones instead. After that, transferring my number and remaining minutes from the 800 to the 840 was pretty easy and quick using the tracfone website. Unfortunately I haven't found the 840 on Amazon with the kind of minutes package I got the 800 with. I did find it with 1400 minutes on HSN's website though. ( I wonder if they will delete this ?) I always look on Amazon first though. I only look elsewhere if what I want is sold out or otherwise unavailable here - which is fortunately pretty rare.But I recommended the phone and any accessories you may want here, and maybe they will get their turn to offer a phone plus minutes package on this one as they had with the 800 - once the other-guy's exclusive on that ends.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Oclaf", "ReviewID": "R1LGUPTJBFHIQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "has way more features than expected or needed, like how it seems to work better than old one, then again..it was old...", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone for home", "Author": "Racheralnoway", "ReviewID": "RZA3CU602J8NX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought it thinking it was going to triple my minutes...

It is a great phone for the price (mine was about $50 at Best Buy with 1200 minutes, which basically paid for the phone) and has many of the same features as a smart phone. Like some of the other reviewers, I also was upgrading from an LG800, which was OK for receiving and sending calls, but fell way short in terms of touch sensitivity for texting, scrolling or dialing and didn't have wifi.The 840's capacitive touch is very good (not quite as good as my wife's Nokia 822 Windows phone, but plenty good)and the wifi capability gives you many of the same connectivity features as a high-priced, contract smart phone. Call quality is good, the camera (2 megapixels) takes adequate photos and the memory is expandable up to a 32-GB micro-SD card, if you need that much.Transferring my number from my old phone to my new one only took a few minutes on the Tracfone website, and although my old SIM card was not transferable to the new 840, Bluetooth lets you easily move contacts from one phone to another without having to manually input each one (a great time-saver).If you don't want or need the higher functioning smart phones and the two-year contract that locks you in, then I would easily recommend this phone and Tracfone's service.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good option for cellular service", "Author": "Bichon Mom", "ReviewID": "R36AYTHA6A906Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My cellular contract expired this month and after 10 years with the same carrier, I finally decided to take a hard look at my usage.  Since I am rarely out of Wifi area, use Google Voice and choose actual phone calls only as a last resort communication option, my cellular usage was very low.I had not used any type of prepaid phone before and the Tracfone site and the Walmart site gave conflicting information about whether the LG840G would work in my zipcode.  Prior to ordering the phone, I sent an inquiry to the vendor (Shopcellsdeals) about service in my area and received a very quick response that it would work as well as which network would be used.I ordered the phone and was surprised and delighted by the rapid processing and receipt of the order.  Before setting the phone up, I did a search on line for promo codes and found an active one which gave me a bonus 250 minutes in addition the the 1200 minutes that came with the phone.  The bonus codes seem to be an ongoing thing so it probably would be worth taking the time to do a search before activating one.  Setup was very easy.In addition to making sure that reception was good in my area (it is equivalent to what I received with my contract provider), I wanted to be sure that there was no problem with using Google Voice.  On the Google voice site, there is the option to make Google Voice the default voice mail.  By putting in the Tracfone number, it automatically recognizes the network and sends a code to the phone that allows one to activate Google voicemail.Since this phone met my expectations, I immediately ordered a second for my husband and it too arrived very quickly.

I wish it would ring longer before going to voice mail, but that's about my only complaint.  You can lock it before you put it in your pocket, and I have not made any accidental calls.  I like the interface, and it was easy to set up for WIFI and Bluetooth.  I'm not into apps, but I understand there are some you can get, but it is not a smart phone.  Android apps will not work.  That's ok with me for now.  I have had a bit of trouble getting my yahoo account to work, but I still prefer a computer for e-mail.

If you run into problems when you call the company directly I highly recommend that you go to the website and try to get your issue resolved there.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I received my phone and minutes yesterday.  After getting the phone activated I had the representative add the minutes to my phone.  They confirmed that the minutes were added to my account but I didn't see it reflect on my phone.  I was told to wait an hour and check again.  By that time nothing had changed and my phone still only reflected 1 minute and 40 seconds which is what was left from the free 10 minutes the phone starts out with.  I tried calling them to find out what went wrong but at this point they were closed.  I also kept getting text messages from them all night long telling me to call customer service to complete the transaction.  This morning I called them and told them about the text messages.  She asked what I was trying to do and I explained that the phone was working properly but my minutes haven't been updated.  She checked and said that she shows the minutes were added to the phone and that I must have used them all up.  At this point I'm in shock.  How in the world did I use up 24+ hours of minutes (440 x 3 + 250 bonus minutes) in less than a 24 hour time frame?  Keep in mind I didn't call anyone except Tracfone to activate the phone.  I also didn't use any browser or anything else for that matter.  So basically I'm out $100 for nothing!  I asked them to show me what used up the minutes and I was told to call back in 72 hours because they won't have that information until then.  So far no good.

One of neighbors had Tracfones for their family and we lovingly teased them about their lowbrow taste in phones. But they had no complaints and were spending hundreds less each year than we were. So we decided to take a harder look. In the end, we decided it was worth a try and if we didn't like it we could go back to a big carrier and wouldn't have lost anything. The big upside to these phones is price. We have saved a lot of money. These phones have lots of great features and we like to call them our \"almost smart phones\" or our \"not really dumb\" phones. There are a lot of things right about these phones but you can read them on a positive review. And I have to give Tracfone credit, they got all of our phone numbers ported when none of the big carriers were ever able to get that done when we changed. On the downside, my phone has never worked properly. It started off with a \"can't read SIMM card\" or something like that. It took HOURS over DAYS to work with customer service on the phone about the issue and they kept telling me I had tried to alter the phone which I had not. I didn't even know what they were talking about, so I was insulted and annoyed that it was taking so long to get my phone working. Finally, they sent me a new simm card and the phone worked. But I was without a phone for DAYS. I was not happy. Even now, if I drop the phone I get the same message. And I just turn it on and off until it starts working again. I put piece of tape over the simm to keep it from shifting. It is just a mild annoyance now. The other thing that happened is that my phone would never send or receive a picture. At first, I thought I just had a bad signal and should try later. Then I thought the file size was too big. After all of the time I had already spent getting my phone working,  I was not looking forward to calling customer service again. I waited too long and they said that I couldn't get a new phone to replace my phone but they would send me a refurb phone. I had just bought a \"nice, new phone\" and now they wanted to send me a reject from someone else to have trouble with. Again they spent hours on the phone trying to fix the problem remotely. In the end,  I decided I didn't need to send a picture that often. And I kept my shiny, new phone. Things changed and now people want to send me pictures all of the time. The problem is that the phone doesn't tell me who the picture message is from since I can't download it (but I do get time deducted!), so I don't even know who I am ignoring and it has hurt some friend's feelings that I didn't respond...Ok... a few more things. You don't see a name when you get a text, just the phone number (until you go back to the list - then it gives you the name) - I know so few numbers now that my phone stores all of that - that it is a confusing way to get a text.  There are some typing/input issues that bug me but I hear you can download a patch or app or something to fix those. So my phone has been a bust.My husband has found that his work has started calling/texting his cell exclusively over the past year and it is really eating his minutes. This type a plan is no longer going to work for him. So he will change when he runs out of minutes. But had his need for minutes not increased, he would be happy with his phone and his plan.And my teenage daughter thinks the phone is just not current enough for her. --- But she is not paying the phone bill.

I have it turned up full blast and can barely hear it ring. I'm still trying to figure it all out but I guess I'll have to use the viberate function.But I do love the WiFi and triple minutes. Was easy to have tracphone help transfure my stuff from one number to the next.EDIT AUGUST 7,2013These phones are a joke, Every since I got it, there has been nothing but issues with it. I upgraded to this phone for triple minutes and because I thought there was something wrong with my other phone.IT'S NOT ONLY THE PHONES, IT\"S TRACFONE IT'S SELF....I noticed that with my other tracfone, suddenly it was double charging and triple charging me for texts. And these were one word texts or even one sentence, not five pages. When I called, they said I was being charged correctly. My charges..When I would accept the text, it would charge me. When I would open the text, again a charge. Correct me if I am wrong but wouldn't accepting the text onto my phone be the only charge?Sending texts, again, when I hit enter, it would charge me and when it would fully send, again a charge.thinSo me, thinking the phone was out of date, went to a newer phone.I noticed last week, the phone was charging me six and seven minutes for a picture. After recieving a text from my husband on my kindle, asking why I sent a video to him, it was then I called tracfone.Bad bad bad customer service... even the supervisor was rude.I was on my landline with them for over an hour and forty five minutes. When I started troubleshooting with this CSR, I had over 200 minutes on my phone. She had me sending numerous pictures (that continued to show up as video) to my phone. She didn't stop after the first, even after I calmly explained it was still showing as video.... six messages later on my phone for a total of well over 40 minutes extracted from my account, she then told me it was the phone and they would send me a replacement. The first question I asked her was..will this current phone remain active until the other arrives? I explained with my health issues, I can  not be without a cell phone. (We don't have cordless phones in our house so if I am outside, I need a phone) She said YES it would remain active and then she started trying to talk me through shutting off my phone to activate the one they were going to send me.I then asked to talk to the supervisor and was very rudely troubleshoot again (Again another 20 minutes from my phone)(after explaining what we had done)when he got on the phone 20 minutes after being on hold. I was then told that I had to shut off my current tracfone so that the minutes would match up on the new one.Excuse me? Um, no. When I called to activate the new one, they just transfured all minutes to the new one from the old one. He told me that unless I shut off the phone in my possession, they wouldn't send me a new one and that it was my phone that was messed up sending video for pictures. When I refused to shut off the current phone, he told me \"Well you won't get your new phone until you do\".....I'm so over it. In a nut shell, keep a close eye on your time when sending pictures or text..tracfone is a rip off. This phone is a rip off. For those who are having no issues, great... I'll never purchase another tracfone again.Oh and for the hour (sixty minutes) they used up to troubleshoot my phone, I only recieved 30 minutes in return.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine for area with good reception, poor customer service", "Author": "William D Saint Amour", "ReviewID": "R3297T52JISM55", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I live in a somewhat rural area, and the default carrier provides poor reception in this area.

The big reason, to me anyway is this phone is wifi capable. That's a big plus especially if you're in a coffee shop with no one to talk to. However the touch screen leaves much to be desired. You can touch it several times and nothing happens and touch it once again all all the sudden several things happen at once. You can enlarge the screen to get a better target  but this doesn't work all the time either. Its a VERY TEMPERMENTAL screen. I wish Tracfone offered a D-ring like it did on the lg500 so I could navigate to my sites. As it is going online and getting news can be a real chore.Also CNN and Netflix don't play in this tracfone. That's a big negative too.I'm going to take mine back and save 65 bucks. I can always get the newspaper and wait for the next upgrade.

I read many great reviews before buying this, don't know why anybody would rave about it, it works as a phone nothing more. You can check email so long as the email is basic, you can't access work email no way to configure that.It has several features I really like, among them the voice recorder and wi-fi.It has one mayor design flaw, when entering data into the contacts list, one must touch the same key for 'A', 'B' and 'C' this goes on with each letter, so if you want to type 'Charles' instead of six (as it should be) it requires eighteen key strokes.The phone turns itself off almost immediately, you can't pause to do anything, you must be working with the phone or it will turn itself off. They do this to conserve batteries and there is apparently no way to change this to a normal time like five minutes, it has one minute as the maximum.As far as the carrier Tracphone;-It has designed the system to extract every penny possible out of the user. Each text costs $0.30, IMO that is outrageous, there is no justification for this, at a minimum each time you receive a text it will be the one your received, your text acknowledging it and their response. So, each text exchange is $0.90 If you do text two people at once they charge for each text separately.-I had my number of over five years prior to switching to Tracphone, never, not once did I get a robocall of some sort. Two days after activating this number with Tracphone the robocalls begun, as of today, I have received more robocalls than calls from people in my contact list. These robocalls always leave messages and checking those messages will cost you money.-Tracphone eliminates the time bought, you have to call them to get the minutes you paid for reinstated. IMO this can't be a bug on their system, if it was, you would also get extra minutes added not just subtracted from your paid for minutes, that never happens.------------Is it worth buying? If you intend to have a phone to make calls and nothing else, yes. You must ignore all incoming calls from robocalls (folks not in your contact list), and never use the text option. If you will be browsing the net, sending/receiving text messages, playing on-line etc. then absolutely not.
