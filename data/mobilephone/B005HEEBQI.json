I bought it because I wanted a smart phone, but I did not want to pay AT&T; for a Data plan I did not need.  I also did not want to spend a lot of money, only to find out the AT&T; will find out I have a smart phone and automattically add a data plan.  I have had it for a few months now and have only seen one $2 charge for some data.  Not sure where that came from since I thought that the data settings had all been disabled on the phone, but so far that is all I have seen.  No other data charges yet.  As for the functionality of the phone, sometimes the screen seems a little slow to refresh, possibly due to the slow 600MHz processor.  Also the camera does not autofocus which can make it difficult to scan bar codes if they are too small.  Memory space is limited, so if you like to play with apps, you will need to move them to the SD card (2GB was included).  Voice quality is fine and battery life seems good.  I leave Wifi, Bluetooth and GPS enabled all the time, but I don't talk alot on it and I have to charge it about every 3 days.  Seems to be a decent starter phone for the money.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Bad at All...", "Author": "Guy", "ReviewID": "R1LACXYF2CADZZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received phone unlocked as purchased.  Plugged in a pay as you go SIM card from Cyprus (the island) and it worked just fine.  GPS, Wi-Fi, etc all worked fine with no issues.  Yes, as some have pointed out when messaging if you have big fingers it can be an issue.  I just found a way to touch the keys so that I wasn't making mis-types.  I guess if there was any issue I have with the phone it would be with the LG app advisor as it doesn't work but really I don't need it or miss it.  Nice phone, not too big and very capable.  I am very satisfied with the phone and all it has to offer.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG P350 Unlocked Phone", "Author": "Hyacinth", "ReviewID": "R97GY21MRIQQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my cousin who lives in Jamaica.

At first, I wanted a iPhone, but decided against if because of the price.I am very skeptical about getting another Android phone.  My experience with my Nexus One is horrible.  The touch screen constantly register the wrong signal or wouldn't response unless I power it on/off.  But I don't want to spend too much on an smart phone, so, I decided to go for a least expensive Android phone.The phone has two cons, for me, it is 2.2.2, some of my app need later version Android.  Another complaint is slow CPU, the menu would froze for a few second from time to time.  But no reset require, just the CPU is catching up.For the many pros.  It is small, yes 3.5 inch screen, but I only use it for tethering with T-Mobile $2/day prepaid.  So, you won't get any complaint from me about its screen.  Its touch screen is very accurate, and compare from Nexus One, it is like day and night.  I haven't try to stress test the battery, but it seems to last 6-7 hrs on WiFi mode alone.  The multi-touch is a bit slow, but it could be the CPU slow.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Screen is small not enough to type the characters or words properly.", "Author": "Swamy", "ReviewID": "R31BV6VPV09RUY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not the latest Android version available hence all the latest features are not available.3G phone.

When I first got the product it started off in Spanish, but it easy to change when starting up the phone since it gives that option for the language. Only thing is that the phone is quite small, because of that it is hard for mother to see the letters sometimes. However, she loves that it is tiny because it is very light and doesn't take up space, plus has all the basic apps she needs. Such as alarm, calendar, 3.5mm jack, accepts mini SD to store all her music, pictures and apps, and is the same size charger as her kindle (which makes it a lot easier for her).", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "lg p350 phone", "Author": "shirley", "ReviewID": "R353MX1NV7I66O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "well, i really like the description of the item...i thought the only thing that was missing was the information about the 3G internet.

Bought to replace a dying AT&T; GO phone I just popped in the sim chip after charging and it works. I turned off the data option in phone and use the wifi only. With my Go Phone  account I add money when needed and can buy data or texting on month to month basis. I have never purchased either data or text with my old phone. The LG p350 has a quick enough interface for me. It came with a 2gb micro card but I am replacing that with 8gb. The manual came in German and I downloaded an english pdf version with a Google search. Really have not used it much yet since only owned for three days. Will add to review after more experience with it, but so far delighted with purchase.Can't really speak of battery charge, I have been playing around too much to determine battery usage. Phone comes with a LG sync program to load on a pc, its on the LG sim chip. After loading it the sync process became available but It would not sync contacts or messages with my Thunderbird email client, seems to want Outlook. This is not a deal breaker for me as long as I can back up the contacts on my pc.Upon first turn up I did do a software upgrade on my wifi, this can also be done with LG pc interface program. I did take a photo and is better than my precious phone but not near pocket camera quality.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Unlocked at Amazon", "Author": "Blanca Aviles", "ReviewID": "R2AGV7V1KC1A9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone and excellent customer service.

But I eventually wanted to switch its use from AT&T; to Verizon. Oops. If I'd done my homework better, I'd have known Verizon doesn't currently use a removable sim card.

If you'r over 40 you might want to find a 14 year old to help you program it. I had to download the directions for use (thicker than the phone). Remember, a smart phone is only as smart as the user.
