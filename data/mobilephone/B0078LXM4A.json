Excellent hardware as long as you don't count battery as part of the hardware!On very basic usage like talking, texting and moderate browsing and with the screen brightness set to auto, you can probably get about 8 hours of battery life out of this.But with about 45 mins of Pandora, push email, games and basically the things the phone is actually meant to be used for, you will find yourself charging it twice in 8 hours. My average battery life on fair amount of phone usage come to about 6 hours. This includes about an hour of actual phone calls, some online chatting, about an hour of pandora and few games in between to kill time.But enough about the problems. The phone has lots of good stuff going for it.The screen is just brilliant. I will not get into the tech specs of it, but as an end user, I like what I see when it is displayed on this screen.The camera is fast as promised though I still feel it takes a little longer to launch than I would have liked it to. Once launched, the picture clicking is fast and smooth. As you may have read elsewhere, the camera is good, but don't throw away your SLRs or point & shoots just yet.The phone is fast and there is no doubt about it. I have done fair amount of multi-tasking on it and it did not seem to have an adverse effect on the performance. But I do like the ability to be able to actually close each app unlike earlier versions of Android.My one gripe with the design is the elimination of the dedicated search button at the bottom. I don't know why it was done away with as it was really useful and I am not saying that just because I had gotten used to it on my HTC Desire HD.I like the uni-body design except for the fact that now I dont even have the choice to replace the battery. Not that I did so with my old phone, but that was mainly due to lack of tech support from HTC while trying to get the right battery.I know people have been complaining about the 'limited' 32 GB of which only 26 GB is actually available with no option to expand. Personally, it is enough space for me. I do not intend to store and watch HD movies on a phone, even if it has a 4.7 inch screen.I also like that the phone came with a 25 GB dropbox account. It seamlessly connected with my existing dropbox account and simply added the additional space to my existing account. HTC Sense has a lot of integration with drop box, such as the ability to attach files in an email from your dropbox folder by sending a short url in the mail (mind you this is different then the standard option of 'Sharing' your dropbox file via email). However, this drop box integration exists only when you use the native Email app and not the Gmail app (whats up with that google?). Frankly, while google is doing a lot of great things, it needs to get its act together on integration and support of its own products. I have seen a trend that new google products are better supported by third party apps than google itself (for the longest time google docs worked much better on IE than google chrome!).Face unlock is cool but a novelty and not so much of a utility. I would have called it a utility if I did not need to press the power on button to first wake up the phone, then slide the HTC Sense lock screen to unlock the phone before even reaching the face unlock screen. There is a reason it is featured under the security tab.I am still playing with the phone and will update this review at a later date with more information.Update1: HTC released an OTA update yesterday which is said to improve the battery life along with other minor bug fixes. Today was the first day of use with the new update. The phone shows a remaining batter life of little over 50% where as in the past it would be between 30-40% by this time of the day. I will post an update after playing with it over the weekend.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "The King of Android (for now)", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3AGCT2FJSGUCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: GORGEOUS screen, fast, beautiful design, Ice Cream Sandwich, HTC Sense, Camera.CONS: Battery duration, and that it is non-removable (unibody).So yes, as most people mentioned already, the only disadvantage I see on this phone is battery duration... a lot of people already reviewed the phone quite well here, so I'll just focus on this matter. Until a few days ago, I would've rated the phone 4 stars, but I downloaded a couple of apps: Advance Task Killer and Green Power PRO. Once you tweek Green Power Pro and use ATK often enough, your battery duration will dramatically increase about 40%. And now I can go through a day of normal use (social networks, e-mails, calls, listening to music) and by night I still have around 40% of charge, which is awesome. So if you're discouraged about the battery duration, know that there's a way around it. And now the phone is absolutely 5 stars for me.NOTE: People from Mexico: YES, you can use this phone with ANY carrier (Telcel, Movistar, Iusacell), as long as it is this version, the international one. It won't work with the LTE one (AT&T;).Hope this info helps to all undecided, cheers.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unlocked phone with T-Mobile branding??", "Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "R2TX6PANPGTAFW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered up and paid a hefty fee for what was advertised as an unlocked international version of the HTC One X.

Pustule \"PhD: Doctor of Phunkology\"", "ReviewID": "RKXP2XIKM9FXD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I owned my HOX for about three months.  Prior to that I used an iPhone 3gs for two years, and a Droid Bionic for about 6 months.  (It was a company phone.)First off, the positives.  How could I start anywhere but the display.  Even after owning one for three months, on a recent visit to the phone store, I picked up an HOX and tried to play with it, getting myself frustrated that I couldn't get the screen to respond to my touches.  It took me several seconds to realize I was looking at a dummy phone with a printed screen image.  That's how good the HTC One X display is: it's difficult to distinguish it from quality printed material.  Other phones, you look at them and you may not consciously register them, but you can see the pixel effect. What I liked most about the screen was that it is one of the largest screens that was available when I bought it, but the device itself was not the largest: the bezel is so narrow that almost all the front side is display.  And the photos I could take with this baby!  Significantly better than my Bionic, even though the Bionic had good numbers for the camera.  Just, apparently, not great optics to match the big megapixels.  The touch screen interface was smooth and responsive.  So sensitive that occasionally, it would trigger just from my finger being close to the screen, not actually touching.  No biggy, though, because being so responsive, you could recover from a misfire by a really quick stab at the back button.I worked in a power plant for a few summers, and play in a rock band on occasion, so my ears aren't the best.  I'm told the Beats Audio is great; I can only say that it pumped out enough sound through the 3.5\" jack to be able to drive my car's Aux input with no trouble.  Couple that great playback with Play Music or Pandora, and you're good to go.  Battery life is about what you'd expect from a smartphone with a huge, detailed display.  Since I have a desk job, it's no problem to plug in whenever I need to.  I think I've only run out of juice in that device once in the three months.And that brings me to the cons.  Only a few, but they're serious.  First, this device has a plethora of holes in the case.  It has to, to let the sound out, to let your voice in, to allow the insertion of a microSIM, a microUSB, and headphones.  I had the phone in the pockets of my shorts when I went out for a walk a couple months ago.  While still a couple miles from home, it started to rain lightly.  I should have sought shelter immediately, but as soon as I decided where I could go, it stopped raining.  So I continued walking instead.  And walked into an incredibly strong rainstorm.  I kept the phone in my pocket to keep as much water away from it as possible, but to no avail--moisture got inside the phone anyway.  But I wasn't aware it had, since the phone never stopped working, and there was no fog inside the display or anything.  My only indication was three days ago, when I picked up my phone and noticed a decidedly bluish tint covering the display.  The problem grew progressively worse as the week progressed, to the point that tomorrow I'm going to burn an upgrade and get a new phone.Now, yes, moisture and electronics are not a good mix, and it's not the device's fault that I had it with me in the rain.  But I've owned a smartphone for nearly three years, and regular cellphones for another 7, and I have never had a device fail on me like that.  I think most phones don't have nearly as many openings in the case for water to get in.  And I know that the Atrix HD comes with some sort of water resistant coating on the electronics, which makes me unhappy that HTC didn't do that with the One X.As responsive as the touch display is, I frequently had to fight with it to get the notification panel to pull down.  Maybe it's just because I have big fingers, but it was a repeating source of irritation.  Another frequent annoyance was the phone's penchant for rebooting itself in my pocket.  And finally, I mentioned the phone's audio.  I would be remiss if I didn't add that, when plugged into my car's Aux, if the music track got really quiet, the HOX was anything but!  It would squeal and sputter, and otherwise annoy the heck outta my son, who has pretty sensitive hearing.Now, all these cons might be directly attributable to the moisture damage I inflicted on the phone, so take them with a grain of salt but when I finally decided that trying to get my HOX repaired was a losing strategy, I went to my local phone store to replace it, and just couldn't bring myself to plunk down another $150 for a device that only lasted me 3 months on my first try.  I asked the clerk if he could advise me, and he sympathized with me, but ultimately sold me on a different phone for half the price.  I'm going to miss that One X--it was truly a Klassy Phone.  But when push came to shove, I had to push back.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "One x review", "Author": "Fabricio", "ReviewID": "R2H0J2PBQ9IRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Real nice phone, only the battery could be better.I wouldn't mind not to replace the batery if it had better life.The screen is amazing, real sharp and good colors.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "A beautiful phone", "Author": "Objective", "ReviewID": "R3P2A47PN3ZFP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my one x yesterday. Been looking for a new phone since April. I considered the Sony Xperia S - has the best camera and a great screen but still no ics, thick, buttons are hard to press.  I also waited for the Samsung s 3 which is also a great phone but it was a lot pricier and certainly looked cheaper!  This is my first htc phone.  I have used Sony, Samsung, Nokia and blackberry.So, initial impressions were not great.  Unboxing is part of the experience and the one x comes in a cheap box with cheap earphones.  It also took some time to get wifi to work - not exactly idiot proof.  Software had to be updated twice and one trap many owners fall into (including myself!) is doing the update with the phone attached to a charger - the phone never reboots! Again, I thought htc could have done a better job ensuring a smoother experience.After that it did get better.  First, the phone just feels very very good in the hand.  The polycarbonate material just feels GOOD.  the weight is also just nice - surprisingly light for a phone this size, yet not too light.  The screen is as beautiful as the reviewers claim.  I use the new iPad (am writing this review on it) so I've gotten used to a super sharp screen.  The one x doesn't disappoint - really nice, sharp, natural colors. The curve of the screen also adds to the immersiveness of whole experience. The other thing that stands out is the sheer speed of this phone.  Everything works instantly and smoothly - apps, web pages, videos - EVERYTHING. that tegra 3 chip does live up to its reputation.  Finally, I love the 32 gb of phone memory - more than enough for lots and lots of apps and music.The keyboard is excellent too.  I am a big fan of gesture input -  the version on this is easy to use. Typing is faster on this than on the Blackberry 9900 (which to me, is the gold standard).  Sound quality is decent but not fantastic (am referring to voice - I haven't played any music on it yet). Battery is probably its biggest weakness. The battery drains quickly, even with brightness set at 30-40% and not very intensive usage.  I've done all the software updates but it hasnt improved.  It isn't a big issue for me since I'm used to carrying portable chargers with me (if you own a blackberry 9900, you will understand why!) but I'm guessing it could be unpleasant for the phone to die in the middle of dinner at a nice restaurant.Finally, the camera is fast and the big screen makes for easy composition.  In terms of quality, it seems consistent with other 8 megapixel cameras from the previous generation.Overall, it is a fast and beautiful phone at an attractive price. It could come in a nicer package and the battery will not last through some days but hey, beauty never comes without some flaws!", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC One X - International", "Author": "Squirreliez", "ReviewID": "R30152NMI838IV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Beautiful display, fast performance after installing 1.29 firmware and setting force 2g gpu rendering, very nice camera, good battery life.Cons: Phone heats up to 45-50c under load with some reports going as high as 55-60c on suspected defective units.

The screen is a high resolution beauty and the screen seems to be tough as nails.  I've carried the phone in my pocket for six months and not a scratch. A few weeks ago ATT finally rolled out the Jelly Bean update that the phone is even better with the UI becoming much smoother and the few problems with HTC Sense crashing seem to have been fixed. All the apps I've installed run great.  The camera is decent in lighted spaces and the built in flash is handy. The touch buttons at the bottom of the screen are easier to use than physical buttons like the iPhones have.Some things I would like to see improved:  Camera low-light performance is horrible.  In warm-lighted rooms everything becomes orange and the built-in lighting correction does very little. The battery life is poor compared to an iPhone. The external speaker is hard to hear and the Beats audio seems little more than a branding gimmick. The Beats audio on my HP notebook is a noticeable improvement.  On this phone it seems less than worthless.Overall I've been very impressed with this phone.

I must say that when I first bought it has some little issues of screen flickering and short battery life but htc worked well and distributed updates that made phone very stable.First of all, it has an amazing screen that colors are beautiful and real (if you compare to amoled you can understand what a real color is).it has a classy look compared to galaxy s3 but this is my opinion only, I have read in some reviews that somebody complained about unibody design and no sd card slot. First of all unibody design is a plus for me, remember that Iphone was appreciated when they first introduced unibody design because this kind of phones fell more solid and actually they are. Only problem is to change the battery when it died but htc used a high quality lithium-polymer battery (like iphone and sony)instead of lithium -ion  so it won't need a replacement for long years. People complained that they can't replace the battery with the backup battery in daily usage but i must say that there is no difference between carrying a backup battery or external charger. I am ok with the battery life after updates, if you make the correct settings you can reach 18 hours with little heavy usage. Some examples of battery saving setting are; auto brightness, and wifi enabling options (you should choose \"wifi enable when screen sleeps\" option to \"only when charging\" so wifi will be of when the screen is off and it will be on when you wake up the screen automatically). people with less experience can download a free application such as Easy Battery and reach a better performance.32 gb storage is enough for me to keep 8000 mp3 song, 190 videos ( most of them 720p hd), big sized games, lots of applications and still have 10.5 gb free space. Also ' have experienced that sd cards are always slow than the internal disk of the phone and if they are full with data you will experience lag problems. so i am more happy with 32 gb internal storage than 16 + some sd.Screen is very durable indeed, you can watch the video of someone used it as a hammer :) link: [...]Camera performance is great in daylight and good compared to most of the phones including gs3 at night time. But you should remember that it is a phone camera only and not expect a real camera performance at 8mp.Sense interface has no problems and they make it very close to stock android ics interface. I saw no problems with the interface it is smooth, usable and fast enough.this phone and gs3 are the kings of all smartphones for now and it will be a great upgrade from any version of iphone or other smart phones in the market.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT buy from Global Mobiles-SCAM!", "Author": "SD", "ReviewID": "RILOP0AX6HCGV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was still with T-Mobile when I bought the phone; as other reviewers noted it doesn't \"like\" TM :).I had voice service but no web service  at all( I already knew I'm not going to have 3G with T-Mobile because of treir 1700/2100 bands).Again, as mentioned in other posts you need to find a special version micro sim card in order to have a data service on TM.Thanks for readingEdit(12/29/2012)a week or so ago it was time for a wireless upgrade for my UNLOCKED!!!!!

My daughter has a Galaxy 4 and steals my phone to take pictures when we are together!I really liked this phone when I first got it, but 6 months later, I find myself in search of a new one. Have had nothing but problems from the start and was going to send it back, but chose to keep it because of the camera. I have repeatedly had problems receiving pictures and group texts from friends. I was able to fix this in the past by changing the APN settings, but now it doesn't do any good. The phone I got is branded ATT. I use it with T-Mobile, so perhaps that is the problem. But they should not advertize it as being unlocked if you can't use ALL features on other networks. Also, they should not have a picture of a true unlocked phone in their ad, only to send you one branded ATT. I am out $370 and will never buy a phone off Amazon again because of this deal. I honestly don't know how many of my problems are due to using T-Mobile and how many are the phone itself, but now the battery lasts half a day, so that is definitely the phone.Shutting it off is another problem. Well, not so much shutting it off. It's actually turning it back on! Half the time, it won't turn back on! I have read other reviews saying there seems to be a problem with the power button and people have had to have theirs replaced.Display settings are terrible also. you don't have an option of having your screen stay on all the time, so if you are doing something with your phone such as playing a game and not using it for 30 seconds, it turns off,then you have to swipe it back on, and my game freezes every time I do so. I gave this phone 5 stars when I first got it, because it seemed like a great one. Over the months, I realized it wasn't as it seemed.Blue tooth- I have onboard blue tooth in my car- or should I say cars. I had one car when I bought this phone. The dealer paired my phone with it for me and I loved it versus having the thing hanging off my ear. I took my car back the dealer several times because the blue tooth would connect all right one time, but not the next. I swore it was the car's blue tooth malfunctioning! Well, 2 weeks ago, I traded that car in for a brand new one, and low and behold, the blue tooth is doing the same thing! These are 2 different makes of cars, so i doubt very much it is the cars! Just one more malfunction I have found with this phone. VERY DISAPPOINTED!I am very easy on my phones by the way. I have a very good protective case and screen protector on it, and have always been very careful not to drop it. Seeing how many people treat their phones, I don't know how it would last those people! BEWARE! Don't buy it!", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone Poor Misleeding Advertising", "Author": "Chanda Punabantu", "ReviewID": "R11YVXUNW7MVS6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a very good phone.

The people who are complaining about they didnt get the international version... cmon you should make your whole research and see that it clearly states that this Phone has a DUAL CORE 1.5 ghz proccessor which means that it is not the international version and believe me you wont notice the difference although the games run a little bit clearly talking about the screen resolution with the quad core version but for me that is not so important since the games run perfectly and smoothly on this one.

I compared it with the Galaxy s3 and the Galaxy Note and decided that this was the best for my money as it is a better value than the s3 and I chose this over the Note due to the quad core proceser, with the idea that it will probably have a longer useful life when it comes time to upgrade to future versions of Android.However, the  reason for the poor rating is that the wifi reception is so weak that it is practically unusable. While my iPad can catch the wifi signal all around the house, the One X can only seem to hold a connection when I am actually in my office, which is a deal breaker for me since I have a fairly low cap on my data plan (I don't live in the U.S. - hence the international unlocked phone) and so I had planned to take advantage of wifi whenever possible.I have sent mine back for an exchange and will update my score after I have a chance to review the new one.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "This device is amazing.", "Author": "W.

I've always bought refurbished items and never received one with scratches, but from what i read, some manufacturers/vendors qualify devices with \"low usage\" as refurbished as long as everything is checked to work properly. Mine works flawlessly and the scratches don't bug me that much.Another annoyance is the collection of applications bundled with it. I'm not sure if they are user-installed or came from AT&T; (it's the unlocked version, if that matters) . It comes with 100+ applications, mostly games. The most annoying part is that  lots of them aren't even compatible with the phone, crashing as soon as you open them.The biggest problem is the power/data cable. The micro USB end feels completely loose when connected to the phone. It remains connected only if forced diagonally, and any small movement disconnects it. Feels very very cheap!While charging and specially transferring data, DON'T TOUCH THE PHONE!Other than these, a very nice device, comparable to Samsung's Galaxy S3, but without the card slot and removable battery.
