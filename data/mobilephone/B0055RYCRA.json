I knew what I wanted and this phone was perfect for me.. the QWERTY keyboard is nice big and spacy... The touch screen funcionalities are decent... With it 800GHz processador this phone is pretty decent and can handle anything as of now... I would only recommend this phone to ppl who like to txt, chat, of the like... Not a gamin phone at all... The down side which is a given or trade for the amazing QWERTY is the small size 2.4\" screen i believe it is... However the pixels this small size screen contains is beyond imagination packs the same pixels as high end phones...  Due to it  being a white phone... I recomend this to a clean freak type of guy... As well... Or else get a case for it... The other down side is that due it supporting such impressive screen, 3G, all means of chat and social networks... Drains the batteryyy very very hastely... So b ware of it.. it is a given that it will need to b charged every night... But if u use it more than avg it might require some charging durin the day...As of the supplier.. it was excellent... Got it in the time frame no much hassle", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "How to unlock this phone", "Author": "HTC STATUS", "ReviewID": "R3EKG38PF8XOEY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have inserted my simple mobile sim card but the phone is asking me to enter 8 digit sim unlock pin.

The apps are compatible with the android version of the phone, but the internal me memory is low so you can not install that many apps.
