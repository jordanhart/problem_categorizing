{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not necessarily as the description explicitly states", "Author": "jasonmichael75", "ReviewID": "R2A3QGXNNEURUK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be careful of the dealer you purchase this phone from. Many of them are actually delivering the A6366 AT&T; branded model of the phone, claiming that the unlocked AT&T; version is identical to the international version. This is an inaccurate statement, as their hardware specs, specifically the frequencies the radios use for 3G, differ in such way that the international version is unable to utilize 3G in the U.S. and the AT&T; model is unable to utilize 3G in many places overseas. Ross Cellular shipped the AT&T; version (but was fantastic about having it returned) and abe-123 emailed this:This is the att model.  The photos shows att model.  When unlocked ATT model becomes the same phone as the international version.  Roms can be flashed to any version you want.>> Best regards,> AbeTo which I replied:Sorry, Abe. Your knowledge of this product is lacking. The picture is inaccurate based on the phone model and description (or, looking at it from your point of view, the model and description are inaccurate based on the picture). If you had any concern for the quality of the service and products you are offering, you would know that the A6380 international version of this phone features a different set of frequencies from the AT&T; model (A6366). In other words, the AT&T; model won't have access to the 3G network in the U.K., which is the phones intended destination. Therefore, as you are offering the \"unlocked, unbranded international version (NOT the AT&T; model)\", you should either change the picture or change the description. As you don't actually have the international version of the phone, I recommend the latter. Either way, don't try to pull the slick salesman (which equates to the ignorant salesman) act by trying to tell me that the two phones are equivalent, when their hardware dictates that they are not. Unlocking a device and flashing the rom to \"any version you want\" doesn't affect the base hardware specs. I will be reporting this issue to Amazon as well as posting feedback in the comments on the product page as this is just a negative buying experience waiting to happen.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sold the wrong phone only works on Edge", "Author": "J. Furner \"JMF\"", "ReviewID": "R283SS5DKUX7C9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was also disappointed, I love the phone, but it only works on Edge not 3G. They sent me the 6366a not the A6380 unlocked international phone, so I was duped here, I think Amazon should not allow people to do this to us.  I wanted a phone that has 3G, this was an AT&T; phone not an international phone and is not running on 3G, much slower, since using it with Simpel Mobile who works with T-Mobile. Still thinking about whether I should return the phone as it wasn't what I thought it should be, or able to do the 3G speed. Maybe I should ask for a partial refund???  I agree, you need to be careful of the sellers on here.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Doesnt look new", "Author": "thamps", "ReviewID": "R1SAVOW7GT73TF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the new one but the back cover had lot of scratches and looks like someone had used it.

Also it came with an AT&T; branded 2.2.2 ROM. That is the only complaint I have about the seller advertisement.I switched from an iphone so, things I don't like about Android:There is no screenshot for unrooted phones.App manager is worse than just holding down to uninstall.Wish I could change the movie recording format to not be 3gp.Other than that, really loving it!  The HTC Sense interface is advertised as \"incredible\" and it really is incredible.

I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I took the phone to the A T & T store and the store associate said that it's not the sim card, it's the phone.
