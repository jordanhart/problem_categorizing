However, it does not work with any of the data services it comes preinstalled with, such as Facebook. If you click on the facebook icon or the Blu club icon, it just takes you to a blank screen or a screen with writing on it that has nothing to do with facebook.Battery life is good for what it can be used for. Music player is functional with an added micro SD card, but navigation is pretty tricky and not user friendly.All in all it would be a great value if the data function worked properly. As it is, it's just another semi-decent phone that makes calls and texts.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great second ie emergency phone", "Author": "Mr. Granty", "ReviewID": "R259NT9AFZCL64", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is very basic and although it has configurations for WAP,  I am yet to have it configured correctly and connected.

I have AT&T; and the phone worked right away after putting in the SIM card without any issues. The phone does not auto sync the date and time with the network. I had to set the date/time myself.Positives1. This phone is the smallest lightest phone I have ever used. I hate large items in my pocket and love the small size. I have average sized hands (8\" span) and haven't had any issues with the small keys. The keys have enough of a gap between them that I can hit the correct key without any issues every time.2. For a price of under $25 this is ideal to cover the rest of your contract period or if you are looking for a cheap functional phone.3. Having a functional keyboard on a phone smaller and lighter than my previous flip phone is a big plus. I can communicate by text almost as easily as someone with a smart phone.4. The battery life is good. I can go 3-4 days between charging, but I use the phone for mostly texting and minimal calling.5. Two sims feature. I've never used the two sims option, but this is hard to find and can be very useful if you are traveling or want to stop carrying two phones around.Negatives1. This phone works fine in a highly populated area.  When I am in the country in areas where my previous phone worked fine it struggles with reception.  The person talking to me breaks in and out or the call is dropped entirely.  And this is where there are 3 to 4 bars of reception.2. This phone only lets me store 50 contacts on the SIM card and only 100 on the phone. I'm not 100% sure, but I thought I could store more contacts on my SIM with my previous phone.3. This phone only lets contacts have a name and one phone number. Everyone I had an address stored previously is gone and anyone with multiple phone numbers I had to re-enter the second phone number as a separate contact.4. There is no easy way to backup contacts from the phone to the SIM and vice versa. You have to pick one place to store each.5. When you run out of space on the phone to store texts and they go over to the sim card all sent text messages will show up as 1/1/1970.  Received texts will still show up under the correct day.6. The phone only holds 50 texts and it restricts the SIM to 30. My previous basic flip phone held up to 256. When you run out of space you can send texts, but they won't be saved in the phone. For received texts the phone tells you there is a new text, but it won't let you see it.7. It takes 4 clicks to delete a text or you can delete all of them at once. Prior flip phones allowed me to select and delete many texts at once without deleting all of the texts in one go. This means every few weeks when I run out of space I need to either spend a lot of time deleting the oldest texts or just go and delete them all.8. There are two shift keys on the keyboard, but only one of them works. This is minor as I just use the other key.A couple of other notes about this phone1. The way to get to the main menu is completely illogical. It is they key between left arrow and call. Apart from that all the menus are self-explanatory.2. When using the phone with one SIM the message \"Insert SIM\" will be on the screen. This is normal and the phone will work fine.EDIT: After owning this phone for 4 months I'm changing to a 2 star because this phone can't make/receive calls in so many areas.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price", "Author": "Maria \"Maria\"", "ReviewID": "R3778O56Q8YP0M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my son and he thought it was too small but my husband like it. the only problem with it is that there doesn't seem to be a way to lock the keyboard.
