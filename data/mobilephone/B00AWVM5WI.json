It is a great basic phone. Bright screen, crsip call and sound voulme, good sized buttons. Basic text,talk, and camera / picture options works well. Screen is too small from some photos but all and all it is good quailty. Does have an SD card slot for bringing photos, contact, and music from phone to phone. You can play you music on the phone and the speaker quality is okay. Does bring over all your files from the sd card in long form files. To find a song you have to scroll all the way to the end of the file name to find out the song title, but other than that great phone. Very rugged and durable just as the name says, outside screen rugged and hard to scratch or break. Just becareful of the inside screen, dont slam the phone shut! The inside screen is somewhat prone to dings and scratches. Gets better service (bars) then my smart phone did, drops calls a lot less. Just a warning if you have an air-rave device like I do in my home to get service, and you find that you can not send or recived texts call air-rave support frist. The air-rave can only understand a few phone numbers/ signals at a time, and air-rave support will have to reset our phone allowance to your new phone from your old. That fixes the issue! I spent hours with sprint customer service figureing that one out!", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for long battery life and calling", "Author": "B.

Downgraded his plan to the Talk 450 and I figure I can haggle with Sprint if he gets close to his allotment of minutes but I dont think he will.Overall, this phone is very nice and while I sport the likes of a Note II (that I love), this phone is great for the use of being an actual phone!", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "Whit", "ReviewID": "RJ0NCWHIOYDBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't need all the bells and whistles, just something to talk and text with.

(you now know why i dont have a smart phone) if you open up the battery slot and take out the battery there is a thin metal square that can be opened up to put the sd card under. i always thought it was a heatsink or some other electro gizmo on the phone. the phones internal memory is too small to directly transfer music to so that got me really excited. the music player is basic, but it will play even when the phone is closed (something a surprising number of phones wont do)the camera doesn't compare to smartphones at all but it is the best camera i have seen on a dumb phone. it takes clear pictures when you need it and doesent get a lot of \"noise\"the battery life is amazing, i can easily go 2 or 3 weeks without charging if i just have the thing in my pocket at work and make a few calls per day (on battery saver mode) even if you have music going on you phone it will last you all day. i remember our old (old old )moterola razors and you just barely made it through the day before your phone died every single day.the phone itself just looks... durable. actually it looks like a juggernaught or optimus prime compared to all the other phones out there. its a bit thick in the back pocket, but you wont ever have to worry about replacing it. you can buy it used used for under 25$, something i would NEVER do with any other phone. we all had sliders before we got these phones and i think we averaged three or four broken phones in two years. those were 50-75$ a pop, and the last slider had the battery compartment held together by scotch tape.personally we never use the direct connect feature but i know a company that has them all for their employees and they say its pretty much unusable.if you do a lot of texting the 9 key pad is going to get annoying, but for normal calling it works great, and has plenty of space between buttons so your fingers dont feel cramped.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for less expensive plan", "Author": "mhs", "ReviewID": "R2NA990F2W04V1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to read, Fast charging in less of 5 minutes.

I am in Miami and they started turning off the Nextel towers here as they say they will do by mid 2013 it would completely  off. .  My Motorola Nextel's were awesome radio worked every time.  I would of kept them forever except I was getting no service even inside the Sprint store. Shutting off towers in Miami.  The new Sprint phones I received the radio doesn't work.  99 out of 100 it may go through.  I called customer service they said that's the way it works we know about the problem and are working on it.  Error 300 error 3000 error error error bla bla bla and it's not your phone.  The only reason I stayed with Sprint was cause of the radio. I have read before also on reviews and the worse thing is the PTT  Push to talk button is THE WORST!  It's so so light to the touch it engages it constantly just by holding the phone. Kyrocera is no MOTOROLA they know how to make a two way radio.  All my other Motorola Nextel you had to mash the button somewhat.  This one you just brush it and your on the radio mode doesn't matter it doesn't work anyway did I say the radio doesn't work yet? The only good thing about the phone is how loud the speaker is other then that nothing. The radio is useless did did I say they already? Basically SUCKS!  As for the phone I don't really have and complaints.  For a phone it's ok as for a radio its crap.  ATT is supposed to have some type of radio also. I have never seen one. Of course it all cost more. As for the Sprint phone service in Miami is works well.  When I speak to my wife who is on ATT I get that digital fade on her end. Florida is a very hi tech state when it come to phone service with many choices and decent coverage. My Sprint phone is costing me $50 per mo unlimited phone and text no data.  I am thinking of going with Simple Talk/ Net10  for $45 per mo with $2.50 discount per mo if you go with auto pay.  That makes it $42.50 per mo. That's unlimited phone, text, data/web.  No contracts and I am going to pick a phone that works on Verizon for like half the cost. I think they limit your speed on data but that's fine with me  I just have to buy a phone no contract it cost more up front.
