This is now considered an older model (at present the S4 is the current model) and I couldn't see paying hundreds for an old model so I found a deal elsewhere.That said, it's really a great phone but there are a few things I wish I had known about up front. Maybe they'll help you.I wish I had known that...... not all S2s are alike. As the product title indicates, this is specifically a SGH-T989 and this model is designed especially for T-Mobile.... when you're searching for a case, be sure to search for one that works with the SGH-T989 instead of just an S2 because the cases will fit differently.... smart phone batteries never last very long, especially if you stay signed in to everything. It's not a bad idea to purchase extra batteries (again, designed for the SGH-T989). I bought three of these but I can't really comment further on them because I've not received them yet. Look for my review there though, because after I use them I WILL review them.Now for the pros and cons.I like that...... it's fast and has good resolution, though I cannot compare it to much else.... it's fairly easy to use.... the camera is amazing and has a flash (but on the back only).... it has a front facing camera, but see what I don't like below too.... the video looks great.... it has voice search.... it has Google services integrated, to include backup and restore.I don't like that...... for some oddball reason, Android (the operating system this phone has) insists on installing apps on the phone, rather than a removable microSD card. I cannot fathom why this is the case. Granted, that's an OS issue, but it still affects the phone.... the front facing camera doesn't have a flash.... mine (not all, because this doesn't happen to my son's nor my daughter's) does not shut off, ever. I don't know what has caused this, but mine began all of a sudden. The reason I add it here is because NO app should ever power it back on immediately. Clearly there is a serious security flaw here. I plan on resetting it today, which I dread.Apps that make it even better are...... Swiftkey (paid, but there is a free version too, but paid is much better). I don't like Android's native keyboard and this one is great for predictive text.... Go SMS Pro (free) because for some inexplicable reason, Android does not let you customize the notification tone for each contact's incoming text message. That is, if I want a certain tone for my daughter, I cannot make hers different from everyone else's and I've no idea why Android does this, either. With this app, I can do that, but it only works if its still running.... Juice Defender Ultimate (paid; there is non-Ultimate free version too).All in all, for a smart phone I'm very pleased.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME phone!!!", "Author": "ebonae", "ReviewID": "RJVY3Q4MB9B1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My boyfriend ordered this for me and ended it keeping it for himself because I got a white one before this one arrived in the mail. We absolutely LOVE this phone! I don't think I will ever need an upgrade, lol. I love all of the features, the speed, the camera, everything about this phone makes me fall in love with it! Definitely worth the money if you want a good high-end android smartphone for less than $250 bucks.
