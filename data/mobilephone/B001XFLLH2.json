The phone has never given me any trouble even after I dropped it a few times.  I prefer reading web items from my easy chair so I do not have web service from Sprint with this phone but it is available.  It has a manual touch keyboard on the front and an on-screen keyboard. The camera is very good and the battery last very nicely. My appointments and memos with alarm are always correct. Contacts are easy to use with automatic features. I am just now having to replace the battery which never got sluggish.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Favorite PDA Ever", "Author": "DARYL HAYNES", "ReviewID": "R33LH957HQHOOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even when my cell phone company quit servicing this unit as a phone, I continue to use it as a PDA for calendar, contact information (over 250 names, addresses, birthdates, names of family members, etc), memos, task lists, and on and on.I fell on some ice recently and landed on my big purse, breaking my TREO unit, so I ordered a new one from Amazon and transferred ALL of my information including photos from my computer backup files.
