{"Reviews": [{"Title": "no contract is nice, but...", "Author": "1Life \"\"Live life with no regrets\" ~ ...", "ReviewID": "R6YCQDWFW4OJ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i've been a person who has signed alot of contracts for phone service w/ all kinds of carriers (Alltel, Cingular, CellOne, Verizon, T-Mobile). I wanted to get away from contracts, let's face it, they suck, as do early termination fees. I wasn't thrilled about buying another cellphone just so i could have pre-paid service - that is the downside. Not to mention i bought a Samsung Gravity 2 - used it for 6 months and upgraded/bought the Gravity 3. Used the G3 for a few months before switching to Net10 - Samsung T401g. Luckily i found a refurb model selling for $40 on amazon. Let me list the pro's & con's for you ppl thinking about going over to this service:PRO's:- no contract, no credit check (pretty much everything the website tells you - [\u2026] )- slight variety of phones (flip, slider, imitation blackberry model, regular no flip/no slider models). The less fancy the phone, the cheaper the cost of the phone - i.e. flips and non-flip models should be under $20 (and on amazon, some selling for as low as $4!!)- pretty easy to use service- pretty easy to use phone (if you are used to Samsung Gravity models - t401g is almost exact - only diff color and thicker)- easy to add airtime (can buy the cards at various locations - gas stations, best buy, etc - or buy them from the net10 website, or even from your phone)- accessory kit is cheap (usually $14.99) and comes with alot of stuff - car charger, earpiece (handsfree), wall charger, different adapters- texting is cheaper - .30 a text to send and recieve- activation can be done online thru net10 website- you can keep an existing number from one of your other cellphones, but you do have to keep that other cellphone service active in order to keep that numberCON's:- REFURB MODELS: DON'T BUY A REFURB unless you are very tech savvy and have some patience to deal with various issues that may pop up- CUSTOMER SERVICE: Net10's ONLINE customer service is a complete joke and waste of time! Trust me when i say --> call the customer service number, and you will have your problem(s) solved within 20-45 min (depending on the problem) other then waiting days and weeks for online tech's to help you. if you have a facebook account - don't even bother with Net10 online tech's there for help - they are UBER SLOW!- T401G PHONE: the t401g phone is kinda flimsy - you can tell that this is a cheap made phone. (i'm just comparing it to the other phones i've had over the yrs - Samsung Gravity 2 & 3, LG models, Motorola RAZR, etc)- TEXTING: be aware that while it costs .30 to send and recieve - if you don't delete your message after you read it, and say you delete the next day - it will charge you another .30 just to delete it... it only does that cuz it thinks you are reading it again. Unlike features on the Gravity 2 & 3 and most phones where you can just go to inbox, see your list of msg's and click delete on them - the t401g does not let you do that.. in order to delete a msg you have to go back to it, and then you can delete it. Hence the repeat .30 charge. So if you want to avoid a repeat charge, just delete them as soon as you read them.Also be advised that you may have to speak to customer service in order to activate the .30 charge rate for texting - not all of them do it automatically.- PICTURE MESSAGING: major downer for this phone - i know it's not the signal where i was - i had good signal - but it took forever for a pic msg to come thru - i retrieved about 4-5 times - each time you retrieve it costs like .50 - but as it does the process and is downloading or retrieving - it keeps hitting you every so often w/ repeat .50 charges, and then you never get the pic. maybe the pic my friend was sending was too big of a file - i'm not sure. i had one pic get thru just fine and only got charged .30, this other one - i lost patience and just deleted it. if i had to pay more then 5.00 in charges to see it, not worth it. pic retrieving time varies - can be slow and sometimes can be fast- PORTING NUMBERS: keeping a number from another cellphone you may have w/ another carrier - i.e. t-mobile, at&t;, etc... yes you can port the number to your net10 phone, but that # will only be able to be ported and remain as your net10 number so long as the other service stays active. so if you got at&t; or what not and 678-093-1124 as a number and you port it to your net10 phone, it will port. but if you cancel your at&t; service, you will lose that # as your net10 number and have to change to a diff one. (May work well if you have other tracfones or net10 phones for porting - i wouldn't reccommend using a contract service number to your pre-paid - for obvious reasons - you're probaly wanting to terminate your contract so you can go pre-paid and pay less, so why port the contract # and pay for 2 phones. that's just stupid and ridiculous.)Additional comments: I'm not really too disappointed with the net10 service or the phone - i am paying cheaper then what i was w/ contract carriers. My biggest peeve was getting it activated and the zillions of codes i had to enter into the phone from cust. service in order to troubleshoot all the issues i was having. That's why i gave it a 4 star rating.Suggestions: If you don't use your phone much and you do want to keep the cost low - i suggest buying the airtime cards that give you more days then minutes. a 300 min card gives you like 60 days i think. while a 750 min card gives you only 30 days, and you have to buy a card each month to keep the service active if you buy the monthly cards. you can switch over anytime to the other cards - the pay as you go ones- but if you do that, it will erase whatever monthly min you have from the monthly cards.The only way you get the rollover minutes from Net10 (and yes they do rollover) - are if you buy the Pay As You Go Cards - these are the ones that cost as low as $15. These are the ones that are your 150 min, 300 min, 1000 min, etc... and you can keep buying these and entering in the code and it will rollover any unused so long as it is pay as you go cards.However if you buy the monthly cards - 750 min $25/unlimited $50 - you have to reload either w/ another monthly, or you can delete any remaining monthly min if you buy a Pay As You Go card and reload with that.I made the mistake of buying the 750min card - i'm a huge texter, but not a huge talker - so i am going to switch over to the pay as you go so i can get more service days out of my phone. buying the monthly cards is like being on a contract almost - got to reload every month. i'd rather reload every couple months or more, or not have to worry about if i buy the 1000 min card for example.hope that helps ( i will also upload images of the phone and accessory kit)", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Angela p", "ReviewID": "RCPQWURT0OIAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Basically, the only things that annoy me about this phone is that Java apps can't access the internet, so stuff like Google Maps is downloadable, but doesn't work.Also if you are already a Net10 member with a 5cent per text plan, when you switch to this phone it's still going to be that amount.Everything else is great, I love the keyboard if I use the web and I can fill out stuff quickly. I don't text much, but I see how handy that would be for texters.I love the customizable wallpaper and ringtone. To save money, instead of using Net 10's service, try grabbing a MicroSD card with and adapter and something you can use to plug an SD card into a computer with, you don't need a data cable. Find free wallpapers and ringtones on the net or even make them yourself (wallpapers are images 176x220, MP3 ringtones have to be under 300kb in file size).

Advertised as getting 3 cents per text message (or .30 minutes) per text. Minutes were running out fast until I noticed I was getting charged .15-.25 cents (1.5-2.5 minutes) per text for each of the texts that I had sent.After spending about 25 minutes on my Tracfone phone with Net10, who is owned by Tracfone, and have them tell me that because of the Code Entry Mode numbers on the phone being correct, I was getting charged the correct amount per text. I had to argue with them that my phone was overcharging me, then all of a sudden, they wanted me to key in some code numbers, and then go figure, I was getting charged (.30 minutes) per text. I am still getting charged (.90 minutes) per text when its from an actual email address. When it's from a phone, it's (.30 minutes).Last Friday, when I turned the phone on, the screen read, \"Insert SIM\". It had never been touched since I've had the phone, and all of a sudden that screen appeared. I removed the SIM card, and re-installed it a few times, still the same results. I called Net10/Tracfone's Customer \"Care\" representatives who told me to remove the card and re-insert the card. After I did it for them, they were talking to me like I was some kind of idiot. \"Did you install it correctly?\", \"Is it seated corrected?\", \"Is it loose?\" \"Do you have it in upside down?\", and on, and on, and on. The SIM Card is notched in the corner, and down in an indentation where it can only go in one way. This took about 15 minutes, and then I sat on the phone for another 10-15 minutes while they talked to their supervisor. I asked to talk to a manager, and then was put on hold, where I was disconnected from.I called back again, went through the above again, asked to talk to a manager, and was told this time that the managers did not take phone calls, and I could speak to a supervisor, so they put a supervisor on the phone, went through the above mentioned fiasco AGAIN, and then 39 minutes later I was told they would send me another SIM card. With roughly 70 minutes gone off of my other phone they said minutes spent on customer care calls would not be reimbursed, and I should have called from a LAN line. If I had a LAN line, I wouldn't need them. The little that I have used the Samsung phone so far, seems like a nice phone when it works, but since the customer care is Tracfone/Net10 gets a 1 rating, and that's only because there are no zeros.My sister has since bought one of these Net10 Samsungs, and has also had to make the call to them to enter the codes for the 3 cents a minute text.If you buy some Net10 minutes, be sure to budget in minutes for poor customer care calls.Hello Verizon.UPDATE: September 27th 2010The phone that I went through the above mess with worked for a couple of weeks with the new SIM card, now displays the 'Insert SIM' message AGAIN. This phone was used very little and was never opened up before getting the 'Insert SIM' message again. I went to ShopKo to get a refund, and it is now ShopKo's policy that all cell phone sales, and cell phone minutes sales are NONREFUNDABLE. Contact manufacturer for problems with the cell phone. That way, you can go through the above mentioned circus. Thank you ShopKo, I hope you enjoyed my money. The ShopKo that I speak of is located at: 4801 Washington Avenue in Racine, WI.,  Tel: 262-637-3733.

Kudos Samsung.It has held up - I've had it several months.Battery lasts a long time and recharges quickly.Longest conversation was about 45 minutes - phone did not get hot - clarity stayed good - battery held up.The keyboard is classic - I can type very fast - my texts are much better structured English - and I can type them quick.It's a phone - and if you think of it as 'phone first' - then - it works very very well.

Great high volume, especially on speaker phone, the drop down keyboard in the back is great, and just overall the whole phone is great. One thing i will nit pick about is the sliding back panel on the phone which will not stay on to save its life, i noticed i couldnt get it on(thinking it was me) back when i bought it. So it may be that, but i've lived with it all this time, so small potatoes. This phone has everything i need without all the extra crap. No fancy net or chat, just good texting, pic and other features to use. Net 10 service is ok if you don't TALK a lot, which i don't, just not a phone guy. Texts equal out about 5 cents which isn't bad at all, but if your not careful you can go over pretty quick. The only bad thing is when people call you(not knowing you have a prepaid phone) or you have something major to do like a service, or someone who puts you on hold, that will burn up your minutes faster than fire and dried leaves. On the plus side the minutes aren't that expensive, but then again you'd probably be better to get into some sort of contract deal if your a major texter or talker. I just refuse to though because of all the additional fees, and garbage you have to put up with in a contract, so i just pay what i pay, with no extra hassle. So this is the best of the Net 10 phones, who cares about androids, and Iphones etc, its a phone, i use it for talking or text. I already own two computers for everything else.

The interface is easy and it's more customizable than other prepaid phones that I have used, both from Net10 and otherwise.  But as others have warned in their reviews, you may need to contact Net10 tech support to get the rate charged for texting corrected, as sometimes the texting phones are programmed correctly and sometimes they are not.  My mother's was, mine was not.  I had to call the tech support 3 times to get the problem fixed, the first two reps I talked to insisting that the rate was not different for text messaging for a texting phone, while the box I held before myself said otherwise.

Overall it has been good for the price I paid for it.As for the service, I will get random texts from people I know from several months back out of the blue. I get texts and calls from people selling things even though it doesn't happen as often as when I first got the phone. Then again I have blocked most of those numbers. As for signal, a lot of times I will have one. But I will go to some areas in the same town and have no signal at all. I have traveled to a few places out of town and not have any kind of signal. But then again a couple of those places were in the middle of nowhere. Still it would be nice to have some type of signal especially in those places and if something were to happen.

This phone itself lists at $49.99 on the Net10 site.This is a refurb and I have no problem with that. I have bought various refurb items and never had an issue.Some of the features that I like on this phone:+ The LCD screen is noticeably bigger than the screen on the Samsung T201G that I had.+ The keypad keys are raised and easy to use.+ The slide-out qwerty keyboard has small keys that work better than I expected. I can press the keys with my index finger.+ Strong signal. No dropped calls.+ Charging port. I can use the car charger and wall charger from the Samsung T201G on this phone. No need to buy a specific charger for this model.+ Owners manual. The manual that accompanied this phone is concise, organized, and most importantly; it's helpful.+ Ease of use. This phone is very easy to navigate and locate features. If you are familiar with Samsung models, they have a very similar menu.+ Texting is very easy! That's a new task for me. I found that a brief consultation with the manual made for easy texting.Every feature on the T401G works when I try it. Dependable phone.The only cons I can think of was the lack of a phone case.

This phone has been out about a year now and it got great reviews. I went with this phone as it has a larger keyboard and slides open for a horizontal view. The phone book has nice big characters so you shouldn't need your reading glasses as much as other phones.It does have Mobile Web so you can browse the web, but it is not as good as a Droid or iPhone. However, it rules when it comes to texting and is excellent as a regular phone.It took the customer service rep awhile to get my phone turned on and so I asked for her supervisor and we tracked down the problem to the serial number which I gave them off my cell phone label, when in fact, what they needed was the one that shows on the display in the settings function. After we got that cleared up, then the setup was easy. When I lost my old phone, I had about 300 minutes left on my prepaid Net10 service but only about 4-5 days left, so they were kind enough to give me my 300 minutes, but extend it for 60 days! SCORE!!!I don't use my cell phone too much, but I recommend that when you first buy this phone, get the $50 unlimited plan for the first month or the $25/750 minutes plan, so you can download apps, check out and test all the features, text all your friends and get your phone book setup and then after the first 30 days, if you are a low minutes user like me, you can switch to their plans that are as cheap as $30 for 60 days which equals $15/month which is the lowest monthly fee anywhere and there is ZERO JUNK FEES! If you are a heavy user, the $25/mo 750min is a great plan as well.But for me, I was mostly interested in the large QWERTY keyboard and the low monthly service fees. Oh, I just ordered an 8gb Class 10 microSD card for my phone from Amazon and ordered a headphone adapter to convert the 20pin interface to a standard 3.5mm adapter that takes all the standardized earbuds. I found the adapter for a couple bucks (free s/h) on the auction site. With this phone, it takes pics, video and plays music.
