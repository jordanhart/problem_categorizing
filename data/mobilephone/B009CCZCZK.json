Hodill \"GCrews\"", "ReviewID": "R37FI1FFDPSSBH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the screen is indeed responsive, the phone itself does not respond as fast as I would like, but it is certainly not slow or anything, the only complaint I have is there is a slight delay when turning the phone to use the qwerty keyboard.  The Nokia operating system is new to me, was a little  hard to get used to but I really like it.  The on board software is easy to use.The only reason I don't give five stars is the MMS configuration.  I managed to do it wrong and caused the phone to crash continuously.  This was resolved by removing the sim card and resetting to factory default.  Also the reason for the problem might be because of the Simple Mobile network.  I chose this phone mainly for the reason that it has the 1700 mhz bandwidth to handle SimpleMobile's 3G network.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly OK", "Author": "Oleg Margulis", "ReviewID": "RBAYCRG1LDF27", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here are the points I considered while shopping my next unlocked cell phone:1. Form factor2. Price3. GSM quad-band4. 3G which works on US T-Mobile5. WiFi (which is purely optional because of #4)No Android phone matched my criteria, so I decided to give Nokia a try.Asha 311 generally did not disappoint me. It's pretty nice phone with responsive touch screen, and it is perfectly combines all five unmentioned points in functioning order.The dark side of this phone is {as usual with Nokia} software. I would rate this phone with 7 stars If they would dare to put Android inside, but unfortunately that is not the case.Application availability is also not a Nokia's strongest side, but that is not in my wish list, so I'm perfectly fine with what Nokia appstore offers.To me, the most annoying is the phonebook, especially how does it present a caller. I've subscribed on T-Mobile name service which supposed to present caller name if it is disclosed to network. Everything works fine, except of that if name is NOT known to network then phone displays \"UNKNOWN NAME\" even if this number is in my local phonebook !! And there is no damned way to override that in settings !! I'm always curious what are software architects thinking about when deciding to do such things ..Also, these endless S40-specific popup windows, confirmations and dialogs are real sucks. I don't understand why do they need to warn me with \"battery low\" popup every few minutes ?? I can now disclose one of the top secrets of mobile CPU industry - such pop-up windows are causing battery to die sooner !!!! Hey Nokia architects - don't you want to make your phone more power-efficient ?? PLEASE REMOVE ALL YOUR POPUPS ASAP !!!But again - overall Asha 311 is nice phone, that's why I rated it 4 stars.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Good!", "Author": "Jadedone", "ReviewID": "R2AHDC458IXL7S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got rip-off with this phone, it was really the company or person who sold it to me not Amazon.
