{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Greatest phone I've ever owned", "Author": "BG", "ReviewID": "R20DBA40X8YYD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this particular phone for just over 5 years. I got it my freshman year of college and it went EVERYWHERE with me. I have kicked it around the floors of multiple clubs, dropped it on sidewalks, dormroom floors, cement basement floors, everywhere.  This phone is a tank.  Only recently did the hinge begin to not work. The phone still makes calls/texts but if you are holding it open vertically, it will close itself because, from what I am assuming, the spring in the hinge has been unhooked.  The camera on it works really well.  The few cons of this phone are: after a few years it occassionally turns itself off; it doesn't get service in some buildings where other phones will; it uses up battery after about 2-2.5 days and you can't use recordings for ringtones.Overall, I love this phone. The only reason I am looking for a new one is because it doesn't now stay open on it's own.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simple is better...", "Author": "C.
