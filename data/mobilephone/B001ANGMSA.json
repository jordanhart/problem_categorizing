The function was pretty slow, since it was jail broken. Other than that it was ok for the time I have used it. The shipping was pretty good and other than one system crash and the lagging I'm satisfied. I'm going to the apple store to fix up any bugs and get it to function good again. Otherwise I'm greatful for the service the phone gave me.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unable to do anything with the new apps that are out.", "Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "R17FU2ACYE7DBI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This I phone cannot be updated to use any of the current apps that are online.
