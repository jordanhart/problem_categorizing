I've had it for 6 months and its still as fast and as responsive as when I first got it, unlike my android phones which after a year always seemed to slow down to the point of being unusable. Wish this thing had an external memory slot or at least some way to get more memory on the phone, Oh and I really miss swype from my android days, other than that I got no complaints: Call quality good, reception and data speeds good, responsive touch screen and tiles, the front and rear cameras are good, not great, but good.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worthless", "Author": "kuri", "ReviewID": "R158L97WBV30CR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone about six months ago and have nothing but problems with it, which seems to be a symptom of HTC. This being my second phone from them, I should have learned the first time around that a pretty design is hardly worth the infuriating software.To begin, my camera went green the SECOND day after it came out of the box. I took it to an ATT store (the provider) and they gave me lackluster feedback, claiming I was just being silly; after all, when it goes green you just have to restart your entire phone! Picture moment=gone.Thinking it may be a one time issue, I relied on the HTC warranty in case of future issues. Can you see how gullible I am? Of course, the issue happened again, and is currently happening more often.Not only that, but I am now having an issue simply trying to unlock the screen. When I type the password in, it opens to a black screen that states \"resuming...\" This screen appears for a good five minutes, rendering the phone completely useless. The only option to stop this is to take out the battery, which hasn't been an easy (or fun) thing to accomplish.Like I said before, I hoped to rely on HTC's warranty, at least some decent customer service. Mistake twenty three! They are awful. I could hardly get my point across without the lady insisting there was nothing they could do.Needless to say, I am completely frustrated. Look it up online and you'll see I'm not the only one with these issues, either.This isn't even touching on the fact that the interface isn't as nice after owning it for a while and just about any app you want is NOT going to be available.Fair warning: Skip the sparkles and glitzy design, they're all this phone has to offer. I promise you, I would gladly crush this thing to pieces and feed it to rabid monkeys if it weren't my most important form of communication. This phone has proven to be absolutely worthless to me and I will never in my life recommend or purchase another HTC phone.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great case", "Author": "Barbara L.
