If you're looking for iPhone/Android type features and apps, this is not the phone for you. This is a neat little \"gadget.\" I certainly am not planning on using this as my main phone, but I bought it for the geek factor. I thought it'd be neat to wear once in a while so I can get my James Bond on and have people be all \"Oh that's neat!\"Now that we got that out of the way I'll go on the watch itself. The manual is obviously written by a non native English speaker. No big deal to me as most of it is pretty self explanatory. The watch is big! I don't really mind as I prefer larger watches but this is cutting it close size wise. It came partially charged and I did not want to wait to charge it so I played with it right away. I placed my SIM in the back of the phone and it immediately recognized it. I had to manually update the time/date. I placed a test call and it worked perfectly. The phone itself has a speaker and it also comes with a set of headphones. The headphones plug into the USB jack (it's not the standard Mini/Micro USB jack.)Incoming calls worked fine as well. The screen and the ringtones remind me of Nokia type technology from the early 2000's so don't expect much. The camera worked but to be honest it's probably not of much use to anybody. Texting was a bit of a pain. the screen is very small for texting and even with the included stylus it's a chore. It does have the ability to handwrite on the screen, but writing one letter at a time will wear you out.Didn't even bother with the video recorder/player or the MP3 player.Couldn't figure out the internet. It didn't automatically configure itself. Even if I could figure it out I'm not sure I'd ever use it. Maybe this weekend I'll mess around with the settings because I would like to be able to receive my email on it as well.All that being said. If you're looking for a neat little gadget to wear once in a while and are fine with the early 2000's cell phone screen/menus then you'll like this.Edited to add: I wore this out for lunch this past weekend and the waitress loved the look of it. When I told her it was a phone she about flipped. Lol. YMMV.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "1 star review?

I honesty expected it to be broken by now(update-charging port seems to have a short) for what I paid for it. But even after a few bumps and bruises it's holding up like a champ.  The screen shows up well in almost all lights and the battery really has not been a problem. The speaker during phone calls is a little low but oddly enough is louder then most hand held cell's playing music. The camera is not good but its still cool and in the right light you can get a fair low res pic/video.  Navigation of the screen as you may expect is a little ruff. Answering calls or scrolling thru saved contact and or playing music from your list can be done fairly easy with the edge of your finger but when it comes to texting you will be breaking out the handy built in stylus... And yes its a bit of a pain. Why no custom templates or voice text is a loss but remember what you paid. Still a larger more handset modern style layout would have been nice for texting and while the draw on feature is great it still required the stylus. You can also drag the stylus over the screen stopping on the letter you want to select but you can't write entire words like swype texting.  Phone calls are clear and I have had no complaints on quality while using the speaker or bluetooth.  The menus are poorly set up but you get use to them just remember to save all numbers to sim and media to SD or you will be out of memory quickly. It was delivered in one day but nothing came with it but the watch and charger and I don't know if it was for testing but I could tell it had been used even though the wrist band  and conditions of the watch did not reflect use.. But there were actually photos in the phone. Only one or two and they looked like test shots. But as I said no issues more then I can say for the latest tablet I bought. Look its cutting edge and it works. With the right Bluetooth ear piece you will love the freedom of it. not looking for or leaving behind your phone or digging it out your pocket just feels right. And it don't have to be connected to one in your pocket freeing up pocket space. If you like to play games text heavy and use a lot of apps then move on. But if you just need the basics or a second phone this is the one. Nobody cares its off brand because the idea is still fairly new people will be impressed with your go go gadget watch and it will work for you. If you only use it now and then via switching your sim card from phone to phone or prepaid service  its a great buy and a must have for tech-ies (have not tried web yet will update) also remember At&t; and Tmobile are two major carriers who use gsm.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "It works great", "Author": "Soumen Das", "ReviewID": "R20SAWM455NCML", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first mobile watch.Pros: Mobile watch, no chance to lose as it tie in wrist;-), Stylish, Compatile with bluetooth(main advantage), Music,  Video, camera, work with memory cards, hands free, touch screen, Manual included.

I don't have a data plan so can't get on the internet with it, but as small as the face is a lot of what I would find on the internet would be too small or chopped up to read. It is so easy to use, installing contacts and phone numbers and I even mastered taking a picture. Haven't tried the video yet.I am in my 80's and got this for safety's sake and really do feel safe with the ability to call 911 if I needed help. Don't have to carry my big smart phone that is smarter than me, so I don't feel inadequate now.If it doesn't work when you get it work with the CS folks. They will figure out what you are trying to question them about and help. I returned one that didn't seem to work, they mailed another that got lost in the Christmas rush, then sent me another and it works well, I even understand how to use it. Just what I needed. And so glad I persisted and so did their Customer Service folks.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super Cool Watch", "Author": "James J.", "ReviewID": "R1RB07M6N4YDNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really did my research before making this purchase. I felt very confident that I knew what I was going to get for my investment, and I was right. I expected to get a fairly bulky, aesthetically challenged watch with a 90's looking interface, staticky radio, bad MP3 player and poor quality still and video camera. And that's exactly what I got. To be clear, none of those features were important to me, I merely wanted a cellphone watch with Bluetooth connectivity. So, I wasn't completely disappointed when I confirmed just how crappy those superfluous features were, especially the radio. I don't know why they bothered to include it in the first place. Anyway, I popped in an AT&T; prepaid SIM card and immediately started making and receiving calls. The cellphone feature works like a charm! The cell's sound quality is surprisingly good. Like other reviewers have said, texting is sort of cumbersome because you have to use the stylus, which by the way, greatly diminishes the watch's cool factor. But I'm convinced that in time I'll become adapt at writing short texts with just the tips  of my fingernails. The watch's battery life is also very good considering how much I use it during the day. I'm well into day three of ownership and I haven't recharged it yet. The headphones and charger are adequate, but it is clear to me that they were not made to last. Suffice to say, I'm already canvassing for replacement peripherals. That said, I had hoped that the Bluetooth feature on the watch would work so that I could pair it with my iPhone. Alas, this wasn't meant to be. Each attempt to pair with my iPhone was met with a message stating that \"THIS DEVICE IS NOT SUPPORTED\". I guess Bluetooth connectivity was just too much to ask for. By the way, that's the only reason why I didn't give this super cool cell phone watch a 5 star rating. Seriously, if the cell feature isn't that important to you then you should REALLY AVOID this purchase. On the other hand, if the cell feature is the MOST important feature to you then I wholeheartedly encourage you to make this purchase. But be sure to do your homework first!

On my 'Super Cool Quad Band Touch Screen Watch' it only had 6 icons on the screen instead of 9 like it's advertised, that being said...i guess i didn't get all the features advertised in the ad i saw. The ad i saw advertised internet, java games, mp3/4, fm, and more (i have the other features).When i got it i purchased a prepaid tmobile sim and micro sd card and it worked right away. When i got homme i loaded the sd card with music and that worked as well ( i think you have to load music to both phone and sd card for it to work). I charged my bluetooth and it connect right away. The camera and video camera works surprisingly well. The texting is okay, only because you have to use a tiny stylus, but i think the size would be perfect for a kid.(Side Note: I am not for young kids having cell phones, but this is DEFINITELY something i would give to my 12 and 9 years old kids! It's discreet enough that a school official wouldn't take it based on looks, it doesn't have games on it to distract them. It has just enough to keep them entertained, and you as a parent can contact them in case of an emergency!...talk, text, and mp3/4 with bluetooth accessibility.So...all that being said i'd recommend this product to the person that wants the freedom to take their phone anywhere without the feeling of lugging around a bulky phone, that may or may not want to use bluetooth, that enjoys music, and doesn't mind texting with a tiny stylus!Note: If I find anything else that i like or dislike i will definitely add to this post if possible or create another.

Not giving it 5 stars because the only drawback that I see is the bulkiness - the battery adds 3-4 mm to the thickness. If that could be overcome then I'd give it 5 stars. That said you should understand that it makes sense only to use this for phone calls, which was my need, though it can do everything a smart phone can do including pictures, email, browse, etc. There is a stylus included that squirrels away nicely into the strap but using that on such a small screen is not fun.

It spent almost 4 minutes in the water, getting washed. I fished it out, took out the sim sd cardand used the Rice and Sun on the window shelf method for 24 hours.

Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research.  Well, maybe I should have.  But I don't know, I'm a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read \"Super Cool Quad Band Watch\".  And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most  would probably buy it.  I mean I'm not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means?  If the Verizon guy couldn't figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work.  Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I'll upgrade my rating because I can't speak on how it works.  But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch.  If you are getting it for your kid like I did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband.  JUST MY OPINION.
