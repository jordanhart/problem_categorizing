{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The smallest, lightest, and best Blackberry around.", "Author": "Tarun Chachra \"Tarun Chachra\"", "ReviewID": "R2QUN8U41YKLZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HI All.I have used a blackberry for over 10 years now...give or take. I have always been impressed by the devices they have created in the past and the current line of devices. Since I like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I just had to get a 8900.Most of you know by now what the new feature sets are of blackberries that are out today. The bold, the storm, and now this one The JAVELIN.I wont go into too much detail but I will give you my quick run down.The Javelin is perhaps the thinnest, lightest, small footprint blackberry that I have ever used. It sports a great look and the feel to the hands is awesome. It is after all the curve II. Screen comparison to the bold is that this unit has a higher resolution then the bold but a smaller physical screen. The higher resolution definitely adds some clarity to the screen...but it should be duly noted that the BOLD's screen is also beautiful. Yes I own both.The Javelin is a EDGE/Wi-FI device...it does not have 3G capabilities. Technically you only need 3G if you want to be on the phone and receive/send emails at the same time when using your mobile connections...I personally have never needed that functionality. However, please note that if you are connected to WI-FI you are able to be on a telephone call and receive/send email etc over wi-fi....works perfectly.The Javelin has a new processor which makes the device FLY. Yes the processor is slower then the one in the Bold, but one can hardly tell the difference....I have used both for weeks...and I can honestly say you will not notice the speed difference.I have a 8gb MicroSD card installed in the device and use the software available from blackberry to synchronize all of my DRM free music from iTunes to the Blackberry. A must buy if you want to carry one device that does it all. Amazon has great prices on micro-sd cards.....Here are what I consider to be the best features on the Javelin:1. AUTOFOCUS 3.2mp Camera - It is AWESOME. Picture taking, due to focus, is a bit slower....however, the clarity and quality of the picture make it all worthwhile.2. FOOTPRINT - Great looking device with a great size.3. High Resolution screen - Awesome clarity....4. The functionality of a blackberry has always been a pro..and this one makes it better with a faster processor and more zippy feel.The three BAD things:1. The speaker on this thing is so TINNY....that it hurts my ears with certain tones.....there is NO bass what so ever. That is to be expected in a device this small....so maybe some new tones need to be tested out.2. Micro-USB - Why take something like mini-usb and replace it with something new. Now I have to get all new chargers, travel chargers, etc.... Upsetting but bareable.3. The holster in the BOX is simply a pleather pouch of sorts...no belt clip etc... You will need to buy an aftermarket leather/plastic holster if you wish to attach to your belt. Not a deal breaker...but should be mentioned.I am posting some images for your review also.Overall this is a great 5 Star Device.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Big fail with this device by Amazon, be aware, keep away from him", "Author": "Jean Carlos Carrasquel", "ReviewID": "R2LG5342UII21A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I Bought this item directly from Amazon LLC (Blackberry Curve 8900 Javelin) and not from third party seller. I asked to Amazon customer service if this item is new or refurbished, original or generic before buy it and the answer was that Amazon not sell refurbished items.For my big suprise, when I open the box and turn on the device I watch the operator logo of TELEFONICA MOVISTAR and the device is branded (printed) with operator logo TELFONICA MOVISTAR which appear between camera len and flash. Beyond that the accesories that come with the device (Home charger, USB data cable) are not original because there's not blackberry logo printed on. And more... some accesories are missing like carrying pouch and stereo headset.How this is possible? Can you explain to me?At this moment I'm really disappointed and angry at the same time.So, everyone be careful about buying unlocked cell phones by amazon!!!Regards", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 8900", "Author": "Manuel Escobar \"Latnair\"", "ReviewID": "RM1QFCAI3IYTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my 8900 in February when it first came out and I am so delighted with it.  Never before have I been so happy with a phone because it can do so much.  I used to carry a palm and a cell.... no longer!  The 8900 has everything I need: Internet, instant email, text messages, phone, games, camera, documents, etc, etc, it is wonderful!  Very happy and still excited about it.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great PDA, messager, and best of all a great phone", "Author": "L. Witherill", "ReviewID": "R32F3AKTBNKEPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Reception and call quality!, interface, beautiful screen, syncs with Mac, keyboard, terrific sound on media player, decent camera, and intuitive user interface.Cons: Battery life could be better, can be slow at times with multiple applications open, the Mac syncing software from Blackberry is finicky though it eventually works, no 3G network support :(Summary: This phone is wonderful. My last two smartphones were Windows Mobile and this Blackberry completely blows them out of the water. The interface is wonderful and the OS is really reliable. I put battery life under cons, though it gets about forty hours with one charge on heavy text, email, internet, and phone usage, so this is really a minor complaint.All in all I love this device. Compared to my girlfriend's previous gen Blackberry, this little gadget is a beauty and a top performer. Keyboard is about the same, but the 8900 wins in just about every other category: build, reception, screen, interface, camera.Versus the BoldI ultimately chose this over the Bold for a few reasons: keyboard, form factor, price tag, and screen. The Bold's edge over the Curve 8900 is its support for 3G, though I find browsing the internet on a phone painful so it had no impact on my decision. I prefer the smaller size of the Curve 8900 too, and it feels like it's built better than the Bold.Versus the iPhoneI'm a Mac user, though I chose a Blackberry. Why? First of all, I already own an iPod Touch so I'm familiar with the interface of the iPhone and I can tell you how frustrating it is to type on the screen! I wanted the full physical keyboard interface, and with the growing Blackberry app store it is quickly gaining ground on the iPhones flexibility. I find the trackball quick and I make less errors with it than on the touch interface. Of course, the touchscreen has its perks, but I find that I don't miss it here. I also wanted to avoid the iPhone's lackluster battery, and I'm happy I did because the Blackberry easily lasts a full day and the next without a charge. I also know that iPhone's don't get the greatest reception, and this 8900 gets the best reception of any cell phone I've owned (which is probably at about ten total phones over the years).Conclusion:This is a great phone. I highly recommend it. I did a lot of research before making this decision and am very happy I settled on the Curve 8900.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "T-Mobile 8900 Review--Mediocre Voice Quality Mars Otherwise Good Performance", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R6QB4AT5AZLLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have now had a few days to check out the new T-Mobile Blackberry 8900.  I will be comparing my most recent Blackberry, a T-Mobile 8800.Good Points:1.  Nice screen; very good resolution; and good readability. Good for viewing attached documents.2.  Nice industrial design and small form factor.3.  Wifi (but it seems much slower than the Iphone or an old T-Mobile Dash I have around the house).4.  Pretty good camera.  There is considerable shutter lag; but the photos are fair.  Note that I cannot seem to be figure out how to turn off the annoying shutter sound.  I tend to use a camera phone for reminders of a product or article that interested me.  The shutter may be required by law in some locations; but I don't think it's required where I live.5.  Audible works a bit better.  I am an Audible fan. (I also download audio books from Net Library, but they require a protected WMA format, which the 8900 does not support).  I finally can downloads audio books directly to the device.  There are still glitches, such as updating the My Library list, but it improved from essentially \"non-functional\" to \"somewhat usable\".6.  UMA--T-Mobile's voip option, worked quite well.  Voice quality was so so (probably device limited) but setup was simple and it seems to work at various wifi sites without use of minutes or special hardware.  I am excited to try this in Japan and on other international trips.7.  3.5 mm headphone jack, started with the original Curve.  Quite good sound though my headphones.Not So Good Points:1.  Mediocre voice quality.  My 8800 had exceptional voice quality.  It was better than my Cisco Voip phone at work.  The voice quality of the internal speaker for the 8900 is not nearly so good.  I found myself continuously re-positioning the phone vis-a-vis my ear to try and hear better.  This is a big problem; and makes me think about returning it rather than suffering through a year of poor voice calls.  I have been with T-Mobile for seven years or so in the Chicago area (from right after Voicestream came to town).  I find their service much better than AT&T; and Verizon and rivaled only by Sprint (this may sound funny, but it is my experience).  Anyway, this  is probably the worst voice quality I have had on any of several Blackberry phones.2.  No 3G.  May not mean so much for routine Blackberry functions, which are highly compressed, but for web browsing or downloads, lack of 3G is a big minus.3.  Annoying change from mini-usb to micro usb for device connections.  I have several devices, such as M3P players and another phone that use mini-usb; now I need to have another cord just for the 8900 and buy some extra chargers and cords for when I travel.  I note that the media-sync was much faster on the 8900 than my 8800.  I don't know if this is because of better software, drivers or the micro usb (versus mini usb).4.  Annoying, audible phone dialing sound.  In normal and other non-silent profiles, there is an annoying and very audible rapid dial sound that everyone around you can hear.  My convoluted work around, found on line, is to use vibrate mode, and then have it ring. This is silly and annoying.  It is representative of the settings limits for this phone that seriously detract from individual usability and customization.5.  The included case is a definite letdown.  It is too small, leaving the top 1/2 inch of the device uncovered.  It is too tight, making the phone tough to extract when answering a call, and there is not a belt clip.6.  Web browser--still bad.  Bookmarks are a pain, locked in to useless T-Mobile sites, and browsing is not so good.  I loaded Opera Mini but it doesn't seem to be well integrated. This may be the side effect of using an Iphone; by comparison the 8900 browser, even tough introduced more than a year after the Iphone, is so poor.7.  Reception seems to be worse than the 8800.  It is difficult to compare exactly, but it seems that reception at home and work is a notch worse than my 8800.  Not as bad as an Iphone, though, on AT&T.;", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "REFURBISHED!!!", "Author": "KB", "ReviewID": "R17DJ6Y9ZDOY1B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BlackBerry Curve 8900 Javelin Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, gps navigation, Stereo Bluetooth and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Black)Ordered this so called \"brand new\" phone.

I do love the Bold's keyboard better and I do find myself wishing I had some 3G love at times, but that's about it.  I experimented with a G1 for a week but I returned it for many reasons, with one being that T-Mobile's 3G was just not quick enough in my area.  I've got Wi-Fi at work, home, and school so 90% of the time I'm happy with browser speed.You've surely heard about the 8900's beautiful screen, and they're not lying.  It's packing a 480x360 resolution and is definitely the best screen I've ever seen on a phone.  It's like a plasma screen with pictures showing up in HD.  The camera is also sharp, and better than the Bold's, and BlackBerry in general has done a great job of making it possible for their devices to be complete multimedia devices.  I've got a 4GB MicroSD card in here that holds my most necessary songs for when I don't feel like bringing along the iPod.Cons: loose keyboard, sometimes loose trackball, no Pandora support.  In the end, T-Mobile's great coverage and excellent customer support put this device over the top for me.  I renewed my contract for just 1 year because I know in a year 3G support will be a lot better and EDGE is going to be completely obsolete..so that's when I'll pick up a 3G device.

Arizaga \"jc\"", "ReviewID": "RP94NC5DFVPNG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "* (This review is for the Unlocked Javelin) *I will try to give a review that will help you decide if the phone will work for you, maybe you can relate from my experience or needs. First of all ask yourself what other options you currently have on the Blackberry market. Bold has a pricey tag and its not that great, the Storm has received so many negative reviews that is hard to think of a reason why to get it, and now, the Javelin.I've been using a Blackberry Pearl for over a year now, and even though I found the user interface a bit confusing, I enjoyed the fact of having so much connectivity in such a small package. I'm not an enterprise user, just a guy who wanted to have Blackberry messenger available to chat with my friends worldwide, facebook, msn, etc. Some of my frustrations with the Pearl were software speed, lack of internal memory (by now you know that adding external memory doesn't help at all, for all major apps are installed in the BB's main memory) and the built in web browser.I've had the Javelin for two weeks now, and I'm absolutely pleased. I'm not going to go into details of how it looks, chances are that if you are reading this is because you think is a nice looking phone, and you'd be right. This processor makes the phone perform really fast, most apps run smoothly. User interface is improved, although I still believe that in could be much more user friendly. The 3.2 MP camera is actually pretty decent, not the best, but just right. All this plus the fact that it has a bright and crisp screen compared to other smartphones out there.I'm not going to say anything about the lack of 3G, if you buy this phone you should know that, and there is no reason to give it a negative review because of it. I've been reading issues about the speaker, but personally I've had no problems with that nor reception.Heres a major flaw though... Let's face it; if you use your Blackberry as much as I do, you probably know that the battery doesn't last an entire day. Especially when you're hooked on on IM. One of the nice features I loved on my Pearl was the fact that the Usb charger was very popular, so even if I lost my wall charger I could always find a Motorola charger to plug it in to, buy one for 3 bucks, or just grab any of the supplied USB cables from an external hard disk, PS3 controller, mp3 player, etc, and just recharge it using my computer. So battery life was never really an issue for me. RIM has introduced a new plug that killed that convenience. It might not look like a big deal, but now I realize how important it is for me. It doesn't change the fact that is a great phone though.Bottom line, if you're making the switch ask yourself if you are in desperate need of 3G network. If so, don't even bother getting this one. If not, you will find yourself pleased with a blackberry that look so over the edge, and with great performance. I would strongly suggest buying a car charger and an extra wall or PC charger. Does it deserve 5 stars? No. Its not just about the phone, it's the software itself, and I know RIM can do so much better and add more features, better looking menus, address book, calendar, etc. Why is the iPhone so successful? Its cool and its easy to use. The blackberry market is changing, and there is a growing market of conventional users wanting a cool phone with great features, all supported by the Blackberry Platform.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best BB ever", "Author": "G.

Email delivery was delayed and not exactly what I expected from a device that people said was the best for email on the go. This phone is not 3G capable which is not good at all. Web browsing via WIFI is a bit better, but the Blackberry browser is a bit cumbersome and slow. In addition, it does not support flash. If I wanted to do something simple like watch a you tube video, it made me download the video first, then watch it. WHY?! I have yet to run into anything on a web site that Safari cannot open on the iPhone. I even tried the blot web browser for BlackBerry, and though it was a bit quicker, it still didn't support many web pages.Finally, the applications. They are lacking horribly! BlackBerry is hurting here! The BlackBerry App Store is pretty much a joke. It doesn't have nearly the amount of apps, and more importantly, reliable and working apps that Apple has. The apps that I used (Bolt, Facebook, TSN and iheartradio) were very, very unreliable. At times they would not connect or not even open at all, even with full bars on EDGE or on WIFI.The web experience on the BlackBerry compared to the iPhone is night and day. If you're looking for a smartphone with limited options, good talk and text quality, a joke of a browser and an even bigger joke as far as applications...BlackBerry is for you. For the rest of us paying to use a data plan, there's the iPhone.Good luck BlackBerry, but you have a lot of work to do! Kinda embarrassing for a company that has been in the wireless business years before Apple!Rating: 2/5 stars. It gets the job done, but not any better than a normal QWERTY phone would.

I'm happy with its QWERTY keyboard: no touchscreen can replace a sensation to press a button...Hardware: so far so good. everything seems to be just fine: GPS works fine, Camera: I was expecting a bit more... the picture quality isn't very good under low light conditions... but it is acceptable.Software: a lot, from BB Apps World, but mostly useless, in addition, RIM pretends to authorize them \"up to USD1500\" when you open you BB Apps World account... I think it is unacceptable... hehehehe I remember what happened to Lisa Simpson, when she got her iPod... so I better keep the distance.If you mean to use your BB for business, it has enough, maybe, you will need a pdf reader. the rest depends on your pesonal preferences.BB Messenger: deserves a couple of words. it is good, but has some serious, even fatal issues: it is impossible to block a contact: only remove, so the person will realize, at once if you do so... I think it is unconfortable...Messenger notifies the sender when the message is delivered and read by the user.... so no excuse to no answer... very awful detail. They should think about it...BB Maps: completely useless in my country (Colombia), the solution was the google maps.One thing that really disappointed me, was impossibility to use Skype... really bad trick. I'm going to purchase 3rd part application, in order to fix this (about usd40).Performance: mostly works perfectly. at some moments it may become a bit slow, \"thinking about something...\", it could take a couple of seconds... nothing serious. (I remember when i had an ETEN smartphone, which I had to restart 2 times a day, in order to be able to use it)... the rest is just fine: no lockups, or any type of glitches...In order to resume all this: I consider that 8900 is a good mid-range BB, equipped with good features (GPS, Bluetooth, 3MP camera with flash), with very few flaws (at least in my case), so I think it was a good choice.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blackberry 8900 Javelin", "Author": "Jorge Marquet", "ReviewID": "R3CJIONLDSKEO3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello, i write because the product buyed seems refurbished, This blackberry isnt news, the keyboard has sunk key and the headset seems stuck.

I had read one review that talked about finding a hair inside their \"new\" unit, and a few other negative comments but figured these were isolated problems.When I received the unit, there was some fuzz around a screw inside the back cover when I went to put the battery in.  I was surprised at the strange, minimal documentation that arrived with the phone.  The manual had almost no information in it, and lacked any copyright or publishing info on it - it must have been made in China.  Thankfully, Amazon has a link to the real .pdf manual on the product listing itself, as I later discovered.In any event, it was purchased in November and by late March I had sudden onset of a few problems.  My baseline usage of this unit is pretty minimal: talk less than 200 hours a month, only text 3-4 times in a month, etc.Problems are as follows:1) will not leave sleep mode, as does not register that any keys are being pushed.2) Trackball pressing does not register, although scrolling works3) Sometimes trackball AND scrolling don't work4) Back key and main menu key do not work, and pressing them puts me into Contacts, and then pressing ANY key on the keyboard repeatedly produces the letter \"Y\" on the screen.5) Random keyboard lock-ups that leave me unable to answer a call, place a call, or text.To fix this I have taken the battery out to reset it (doesn't work) and went to YouTube to learn how to soft-reset (worked once, but when the keyboard locks you cannot perform this fix). At random times I pull the phone out of my pocket and it works again normally, then after a call malfunctions again.So looks like this will be a warranty issue for me.  I'd like to warn others about this phone, others had commented that they thought Amazon's Curve is some kind of chinese Refurb - I have no reason to believe it's not at this point.

Its wi-fi and Bluetooth capabilities are great but I am impressed with its gps, using google maps apps it gives your location within a few meters and having the satellite map view it helps you locate reference points easily (though this only works if you have data service available as the maps are not store on the phone as a regular gps does so it needs to download them for the web every time you use the application). It's a great working tool as well as entertaining with Apps World from BB I have downloaded tons of games as well as applications like twitter, msm messenger, amazon, and news services. Multimedia usage never been easier and sharing is a breeze through the BB messenger, most importantly let me keep in touch with my sister and love ones that live abroad through BB messenger giving you the feeling as they were close because you can reach them with the touch of a button.

I wasn't sure I'd even really like the BlackBerry, as it's a bar phone and I always chose flip models, but I love it.  Sure, the Javelin doesn't have 3G, but for most things, the EDGE network is perfectly fast and 3G isn't so much faster that I miss it for web browsing.Call Quality - in all honesty, I don't call much on the phone, but it gets plenty loud and I can usually hear calls just fine.  It doesn't drop calls unless my service sputters (ATT), but overall I have no complaints.Keypad - On this, I'm much pickier.  I love the QWERTY keyboard on this model.  My work phone is a BlackBerry World Edition 8830, whose keys are much more similar to the Bold and Tour.  I don't like those keypads as much.  There was, of course, a slight learning curve on the Javelin in typing time, but now typing is a breeze.  I type an awful lot on Gchat, via SMS, and via BlackBerry messenger, and I have no problem with the keys.  They're great, they're separated, and I don't often make a mistake on them.Trackball - I cannot praise this trackball enough.  RIM finally did away with the old recessed trackballs and created one that feels smooth and effortless.  I love it.Media player - I didn't actually expect to use this, but I lost my mp3 player.  I popped in an 8 gb microSDHC card (didn't have to remove the battery - nice feature), loaded up some music, and popped in earbuds.  Music doesn't sound so phenomenal that audiophiles would be happy with it, but to me it sounded perfectly acceptable.  Videos and pictures look spectacular on the display, and there's a playlist option for music.  All in all, pretty impressive for a phone meant for email.Display - Gorgeous.  Absolutely flawless.  Pictures look amazing, it's a pleasure to look at the screen.Connectivity - Again, no 3G on this device.  Unless you need to use data while talking on the phone, you won't miss it.Speaker - LOUD.  Not awesome sounding, but better than most mp3 players' built in speakers.Reasons why it gets 4 starts instead of 5 - MicroUSB, why?  Why remove the miniUSB that SO much of my other electronics have?  I hope I don't lose the charger . . . It can be a little laggy occasionally.  It's tough to find good accessories for this particular model.  It was $150 with a contract, why no accessories?  It should be much easier to find a good skin and screen protectors.All in all, the device is fantastic.  It's smaller than the Bold and the Tour, the screen is outrageously good, and it's a pleasure to type on.  I'd highly recommend it.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Blackberry i have owned", "Author": "Kavey M.

I'd been puzzled for a couple of weeks on how the call quality deteriorated over a call, till I actually noticed the bars go down while I was texting.  It hit me like a light bulb.  I tried different holding positions and angles, and figured out it happens when the lower half of the phone is covered by my hands.  Which doesn't make sense.I know its not my network, because I've been with the same network for 7 years and used several phones by different companies.  My previous, a Nokia 5300, got signals EASILY at places that this BB struggles with.  Just my experience, I'm not a brand person and would dump any phone of any brand if I didn't like it.So... it doesn't matter how many bells and whistles its got, and if it looks like a cellular version of brangelina.  If it doesn't work as a phone, can't give it more than 3 stars.However, 3 stars BECAUSE of its form factor, looks, and just how good it feels, plus no other major hardware or software concerns.  The battery life is awesome compared to other phones and brands I've used.  I'm finding it extremely hard to give this phone up.
