{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The BEST Android phone currently available for Cricket!", "Author": "Discerning Shopper \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R2BU3BZS6NH0A8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In my opinion, the Huawei Ascend 2 is currently the best Android phone available for Cricket.  This phone is slim, lightweight, packs a 5MP camera/camcorder, has a fast processor, notification LED (not all phones have this handy feature), and has an excellent bluetooth transmitter, meaning that if you use it with bluetooth headsets, the range is incredible!  Minuses for this phone are that it lacks a flash/video light (but most pictures come out clearly).  I really can't think of any other minuses.  On the plus side, it runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread, the latest (and greatest) version of Android currently available for smartphones.  It's the right combination of inexpensive, lots of features, and works with Cricket ($55/month unlimited everything).

I got rid of it in July 2012. Short: this phone SUCKS. I have NO idea how bad the first Ascend was, but this one is awful. There are apps on the phone that you cannot delete, which is a problem considering there's only 160MB of app storage on the phone to start with. Sure, it does a myriad of the most BASIC and simple apps, but there WILL come a time, in a month or less, where you will be completely devoid of space. So many games you can't play because it only has a 600mgz processor. Such slow screen scrolling. Takes like 5 minutes to get to max speed after turning\ufeff on. Just not anything exceptional. This phone runs smoothly at first, but after that it's absolute garbage. I can't update an app that isn't on my SD Card. Everytime, without fail it says \"insufficent\ufeff storage\" and I basically want to throw it at the wall until the cheap plastic shatters. I'd suggest sticking to your current phone then getting this junky thing. Now with the new releases of the Huawei Mercury and the ZTE Engage, this phone no longer deserves the title as \"best Android Smart Phone for Cricket\", it was surpassed of that honor a LONG time ago.Trust me, I own this phone, and it's a real pain in the a**.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dosnt work no more", "Author": "Selena", "ReviewID": "R31W372FB5JWRW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas present to my mom and by month three it wasnt working no more now i dnt even know what to do with it it just stays in the start up setting and nothing else :l", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone!", "Author": "debaum2", "ReviewID": "R3MBA8NBWKGM3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved my cricket ascend 2!

I thought,finally,I'm gonna get an Android phone,be able to do whatever I want without any problems BUT NOOOOOOOOOO!!!  I got sucked into a deal for an Android phone from Cricket for $60.00 then had to add a $70 plan and All for NOTHING>>>The  wireless never worked with my laptop.The phone acts like it has a ghost inside of it that calls whoever it wants at will.20 TIMES IN A ROW???????? I'm dialing my man and see the number on the phone,put it to my ear and lo and behold it's my mother??WTH???It freezes up.I can't go online.I try and text people and it goes to my alarm clock.Granted this is a replacement for the first piece of crap that they sold me.It lost all my contacts when switching to the new phone cuz the SIM does not save your contacts unless you stay in the $70 plan for what I have no clue.Then when I got the new DEFECTIVE phone it deleted ALL my Gmail contacts from the past 4 years?Now I have no contacts. Neither phone nor email......... RRRRRRRRRRRR  It tells me I don't have an SD card when I clearly do so it locked up my camera..No birthday pictures of my daughter at Navy Pier in Chicago this year and I lost about $300 in work because I could not take pictures and upload for my reports..Save your money.The rep at Cricket told me there had been complaints and they know these phones are crap but keep selling them.All I got was a $5 dollar credit for my inconvenience and a new DEFECTIVE phone I had to pay $10 dollars shipping for..What nerve!!!!!!!!!!  Stay as far away from this phone as you can!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have had this phone since 2011", "Author": "Jeanette Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R2ICPUEXRFZLAK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After I got rid of my Android Ascend I, I got this particular phone.
