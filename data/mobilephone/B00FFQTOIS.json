The only thing i would change is the accuracy of the double tap feature. Although this feature is very convenient, it doesn't always work the way it should. I wish the double tap worked 100% of the time. For as much as this phone costs, it should work all the time.Also, the settings can be changed so don't let the \"international\" part of this phone scare you. I highly reccomend this phone! If you like new amd improved androids, you'll love this!", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone but bad experience with the seller", "Author": "GR", "ReviewID": "ROT2MNPCBFS70", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The box was not factory sealed and as I head to travel and use the phone didn't have time to return the phone, etc...Btw, one of the speakers is not working on a brand new phone so even though they said it is not a refurbished phone I personally don't believe that.The phone it self is great piece of technology accept of the speaker stuff.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "Rashad A.", "ReviewID": "R18EP6OWCGA3JG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelent thank you my friend from venezuela. this product is very good and i am so happy of i have", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "BEST LOOKING PHONE EVER A LOT BETTER THAN GALAXY S4", "Author": "orlando", "ReviewID": "R3IGHFYFWD5JE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the galaxy s4 and have nothing to do against this G2 the quality of the materials and the look is perfect... buy this one best phone in the market not !!!!", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Sanhu Li", "ReviewID": "R2E8DQ7G4YAVRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

It displays a merchant's logo upon startup. It also has some silly wallpaper and graphics that seem like they're designed for 12-year-old girls who like pink. Like the big 5.2 inch screen. Lots of the settings and nested menus are non-standard and take a while to get used to. Looks like a cross between the Samsung Galaxy 4 and the HTC One. Hate the buttons on the back....also non-standard and hard to get used to. I suggest you wait for Google and Samsung to come out with their next gen. phones.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone ever", "Author": "Cesar Naveda", "ReviewID": "R1P9DEJF7WLSJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best cell phone ever,  faster,  great quality pictures and video, the battery last the whole day. ++++ excellent phone, lg", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "SHOPEBEST SUCKS", "Author": "Raul Castillo", "ReviewID": "R2JA2RRWF236KF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.
