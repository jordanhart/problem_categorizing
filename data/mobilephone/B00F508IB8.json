I was very disappointed with this purchase: It is advertised as an unlocked, GSM phone, but,  on the drop down screen,  it said \"NO SIM CARD\", even with my US T-Mobile, 4g card installed. I don't understand that. Although, I could make a call, but, could hardly hear person talking, unless set on speaker or use Bluetooth. Not good. Tried to install apps from Play Store, or a You Tube update, but, it wouldn't respond, or it would take over 15 minutes and still would not completely download, and used a lot of battery to do it. It used up the battery too quickly, and took a long time to recharge. It did say \"Galaxy S 4 Mini\", but it appears to be a bit larger and different design than the mini S 3&4,s  I've seen on Amazon, lately. Possibly an Samsung Ace? Due to the poor performance of this cell phone, I am requesting a return w/refund.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "waste of money", "Author": "dante johnson", "ReviewID": "R2XLHSCK088R2D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Only had the phone a few weeks and suddenly the screen went white and also it was hard to hear while on the phone", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "works like a galaxy", "Author": "ABU KOROMA", "ReviewID": "R2C70WL1KK7C1T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone operates similar things that an iphone or galaxy does. It downloads a variety of apps like facebook, skype, weather, whatsapp, viber, and so on. Most important, it works international. You just need to buy a sim card for a particular country and you can communicate with the rest of the world. The camera is superb, can video a whole two-hours event. It also has dual ports for two sims.
