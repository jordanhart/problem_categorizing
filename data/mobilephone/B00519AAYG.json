{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally, Sony Ericsson gets it right.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"apartoflife\"", "ReviewID": "R703WPMJC5TM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned an Experia X10 which I was content with as my first smart phone venture but after purchasing the Experia Arc, I can clearly see how flawed the X10 is. I won't go into the X10's problems since this is a review for the Arc. So that being said, will break down the review in categories. Looks, Software and Performance.Looks- One sexy sleek phone hands down and one of the best looking phones on the market. The phone is super slim and the arc in the back actually adds to the sleekness. The back of the phone looks black but looking closely at it you can see it goes from a dark blue to a dark grey silver tone. But you have to look very close. The screen is beautiful at 4.2 inches and the sides of the phone are a chrome color which makes this phone look very classy and heavy, yet it's not heavy at all and pretty light.Software- A huge flaw of the x10 was the lack of updates and an ancient android operating system. I am happy to say this phone comes with the latest 2.3 gingerbread operating system which includes flash for pc like web surfing, more stability, pinch zoom and the ability to download the latest apps requiring the latest operating system. Sony Ericsson has also perfected their skins and proprietary merged os. The system is much more responsive as well.Performance- As stated before, this phone is stable, smooth and pretty quick. Sony is touting it's display as a display infused with their bravia engine technology which in short is just a gimick in terms of the home screen but does improve the picture in the camera and video departments. I compared the x10 with this and found very little difference in the home screen but the camera function is clearly better on this set and better than other phones I have compared. Still the samsung oled and iphone retina displays are still the best in the business. Even so the camera display comes pretty close to those phones.On a side note, the recharging on this phone is super fast! about half an hour to an hour and it's fully recharged. 15 minutes and it's and it's 30 percent recharged. The standby time is also really good and impressed with the life of the batter during constant internet use.I bought this phone unlocked and it only works on AT&T;'s network but definitely worth the price and piece of mind knowing i'm not held on contract anymore. Wonderful phone and kind of like that this phone isn't offered widely in the US as it's very unique and gets lots of looks. It seems like the whole world has an iphone these days and I feel like I have something most people don't, and I do. :)Quick Update: As of 11/7/11 my phone still working like a champ. I just wanted to update everyone on a recent update for the phone. The update provides slight improvements such as advanced face book integration, screen capture, Zoom in HD camera 3D capability, new themes, icon pics in created files, better recording sound and speaker volume. The only updates I found any interest in was the screen capture which is a great feature to have and the zoom on HD camera. Otherwise all other updates just okay. The 3D capability sucks, All it does is allow you to take 3D pics in panorama view but in order to view it in 3d you need a 3D capable tv along with the 100 dollar glasses! Either way, it's nice to get some updates as giving it's unlocked status I thought I would'nt get any updates.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible Stock Firmware/Apps, Terrific Phone", "Author": "WookieInHeat", "ReviewID": "R1JO7252T04235", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LT15A Xperia Arc (Anzu) is simply amazing, this 1GHz single core processor holds its own against many of the current dual cores out there, even beating the SG SII in some areas. Its construction feels rock solid, and there are plenty of after market cases, accessories and mods on the internet for very cheap.There is however some bad news, the stock Sony apps and Sony bloatware weigh the handset down immensely. Your apps, the ones you actually want to run, are constantly competing for system resources with the stock Sony apps which are constantly running in the background, needlessly hogging resources and gobbling up precious battery life. The Sony apps for the most part are not removable, and insist on residing in the tiny phone memory as opposed to the massive SD card, making life a constant battle to keep enough room free for daily operations.Luckily there is also some good news, there is a replacement Android firmware called Cyanogenmod that is offered for free. Cyanogenmod replaces the stock Sony Android system, allowing you total control over the apps and many other previously restricted customization features. The catch is that you must unlock the handset's bootloader, thus voiding the warranty from the manufacturer. If you plan to do this, it is a good idea to wait a few months at least until you're reasonable satisfied you didn't receive a lemon. It is also recommended that you have a moderate level of technical expertise to perform this operation, as if not you may end up rendering your handset inoperable while in the process of voiding your warranty.I literally hated this handset until I removed the Sony software, the Sony apps were so intrusive, obnoxious and persistent, it made me want to chuck it out the window on more than one occasion. After installing Cyanogenmod, the Arc went from being a mediocre and mildly frustrating smartphone to full fledged superphone. Apps that used to take thirty seconds to open now take ten. There is so much space on the internal handset memory I can load it up with all my most frequently used programs for faster access. The battery lasts many hours longer on standby, and can now sustain heavy internet use all day instead of just half a day as it did before.To sum it all up, if you're someone who isn't interested in heavy customization and just wants a smartphone that works smoothly out of the box, buy an iPhone or a BB. However if you are someone who is interested in a pocket sized supercomputer and doesn't mind a bit of hassle to get it up and running properly, the Xperia Arc is an excellent choice.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent deal", "Author": "Esteban Burneo", "ReviewID": "R24Y186JECYHOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No way this product can be better, it is lightweighted, functional, fast, durable battery and way too good to be true, keep doing this Sony", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc", "Author": "Feder", "ReviewID": "R32BDGK7WAIYGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good: Easy to use, fast, big screen, high quality videos and photosThe bad: time battery life is very short, this disadventage by far all the virtues of this cell.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone", "Author": "id", "ReviewID": "R1Y9H78WZ8ZPCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because I've always been a fan of Ericsson phone. I previously had the Xperia X10a and when it broke (to no fault of the phone) I decided to upgrade to the Arc. This phone is slick and gorgeous to look at and the high-definition screen is crisp and clear. The display is far more responsive than most of the phones I've used, too. As usual, Sony Ericsson's efforts show in their heavily modified version of Gingerbread (and the available Honeycomb update). The music player, video player and camera are greatly improved over the default Android programs stylistically and functionally. The high resolution camera makes this phone better than the stand-alone camera I already had. This phone also includes programs that noticeably boost the sound and image capabilities. Everything else has been aesthetically improved and additional Ericsson created apps turn the phone into a wholly integrated social device. Yet, all of the modifications do not interfere with the capabilities of the phone. You are still free to modify and fiddle with it to your hearts content. Receiving it unlocked ensured I'd be getting the complete functionality of the device (e.g. tethering and compatibility with my provider).", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost a year and still the best looking Android phone", "Author": "Krishna Polina", "ReviewID": "R3VNVPTBCFWVKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been using it from almost the first week the phone was released in Japan and I still don't feel like upgrading to the crazy new phones with monster specs like gigantic screens, cores that are sitting idle in the phone. Mostly because they all look ugly PLUS Arc simple does what it should do all very smoothly and in style.SE stock launcher is buttery smooth and has lot of nice little features which most users may not figure. For example, you can drop apps on an app already on launcher dock and it will create a folder with a small icon of the app. It even lets you name that. You can pinch your home screen to bring all widgets on to one screen. In the apps folder it's now how it gives option to sort apps in different order. I prefer to have them sorted in the order they are installed.Pros1. Style2. Screen3. Onyx theme makes the phone UI feel very classy and rich4. SE widgets like weather, music, toggle widgets, etc go very well with the themes.5. Having nice big photos display for contacts is one of the excellent feature of SE android phones. They display in a unique aspect ration with stylish fading. (Please note that if you sync with Google for contacts the pictures show blurry as they are low resolution. The trick is to add the same contact again and save as Phone contact and assign high quality photo. This will automatically link the user with Google user and you can choose the picture from Phone contact)6. Camera performance in low light. Simple amazing.7. Sound quality of SE music player is far far better than any phone player I tried. I like the \"Mettalic\" equalizer mode.8. USB port on the opposite side of 3.5mm audio jack. Initially, I didn't like it there and thought it should have been at the bottom like iPhone. But, once you get SE Livedock you will know why SE designed it that way. The phone looks gorgeous when docked in landscape more. 3.5mm jack is not on top and you can hook it to speaker system while phone is dock. Perfect bedside alarm clock.9. Comes with factory installed screen protector. I wish more phones come this way.Cons1. A little too much over design on the sides of the phone and cheap plastic feel of the silver edge. They should have used real metal for the silver strap and also should have used a more simplistic volume rocker and camera button.2. The batter cover feels creeky. I had to buy softer feel version from ebay for just few bucks and the phone feels much better.3. SE laucher still feels very under developed and lacks widgets for calendar, facebook, etc that are more customized for the SE themes. You just have to use stock widgets which all have white background and ruin the classy look of SE theme. Well, you can always buy apps for this but it would have been a nice touch if SE included them.4. Power button feels too tiny.5. Bezel feels too big at the top of the phone. I guess it makes up by having it smaller at the bottom and hence making the phone more finger friendly.All in all, this is still a fantastic phone and probably the best for anyone who like to take lot of pictures and listen to lot of music. At current price which sometimes is touching a penny less than $300, it can't be beaten.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "kadena_perpetua", "ReviewID": "R2C69WBWRUW6X2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're a fan of indestructibles,  PLEASE don't buy this... if you're a fan of fashion and design, then it's a perfect choice...I find the HD screen simply georgeous.. it's as wide as an iPhone 4, and as long as a galaxy S2, I find the second much like a giant copy of the prior...

Secondly and even worse is that the phone has an extremely slow processor and you have to wait for eternity after pressing any function. Thirdly the phone freezes for no apparent reasons and you have to take out the battery and restart the phone, which is extremely irritating if you are trying to make a phone call in a hurry.
