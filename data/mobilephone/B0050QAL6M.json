{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Still A Relevant Device", "Author": "Zack", "ReviewID": "R2KITPKFYG90LX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When iPhone and Android OS came out in 2008, RIM's grip on the smartphone market was broken and their days were effectively numbered, unless they could adapt. Unfortunately, they didn't, and they continued releasing the same tired OS that hadn't changed much since early 2000. That being said, the Curve 3g is still a powerhouse when it comes to mobile devices. I've gone from a Moto Droid(1st gen), to an HTC Incredible 2, to the Nokia Lumia 900, and now to the Blackberry Curve 3g through Alltel. As my friends have told me, I'm going all underdog on this one, and I have to agree. However, for my needs, this is the perfect device. I own a Nexus 7 tablet and have a powerful PC. I don't need a miniaturized version of my tablet, nor do I need a 4\" PC in my pocket. The Blackberry is made for a time when phone's were phone's, and they did their job well. My email syncs, the calendar syncs, all my contacts sync, and all my feeds sync. The notifications bar is wonderfully designed, and the trackpad is superior. I shouldn't even have to mention the outstanding battery life, but this phone makes the energizer bunny look inadequate. I love the physical keyboard, and didn't really know how much I missed it until I started typing. In short, if you want a phone with 7 useless homescreens to play Angry Birds with, then go with the Galaxy S3. But if you want a well-designed phone specifically for business and practical uses, then here is your winner.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Curve 9330 3G for Sprint", "Author": "Christopher R. Cole", "ReviewID": "RX79BNQ5MDBOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone now for a little bit over a year. What I can tell you about it is, though it isn't the newest smartphone on the market, and in many ways is an entry level smartphone, it is a fantastic phone. My wife and I live in the country, in a valley, and cell signals come and go fairly easily. While she has a Samsung Galaxy S, with it's larger screen and 4G capabilities, it is my \"lowly\" Curve that she usually ends up using to look something up, as she even admits that it doesn't drop signal and works better than her phone most times. Even in areas where her phone should have the advantage, mine will still outperform hers. This is most clearly seen in internet and video playback.The call quality is excellent. The speakerphone is a real strength, especially if I am driving and don't have my hands free set with me. While BlackBerry did take a step back with the camera (not including a flash and keeping it at 2 megapixels), it works well enough for quick pictures. The internet loads quickly, navigation works very well on it, and the music player is easy to navigate. This is another area where I believe BlackBerry has simplified things nicely whereas Android has made it cumbersome, as when we're in the car my wife will listen to music off my phone.At the end of the day though, the Curve doesn't forget that it's a phone first, and a media device second. As I mentioned earlier, my Curve simply works better as a phone than my wife's phone, particularly in the area where we live. I consider it a bonus that it does better at almost everything else too.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Curve", "Author": "Cyntress", "ReviewID": "R22CQLJWGNQKMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item for my son who had this same Blackberry he dropped his in water so of course stop working.

This made it impossible to do any action that requires scrolling (which is almost everything on a smartphone). By searching online, I discovered that this is a known problem with this model. The supposed correction is to upgrade to the latest version of the software but this only fixed the problem temporarily. After a while, even reloading the software didn't correct the problem. It is possible that there is also something physically wrong with this particular phone because my spouse also has one and it doesn't seem to be experiencing the same issue. OTOH, as with any electronic device, there is also the possiblity that there is a negative interaction between the hardware and software that is causing the problem that this phone is having because this phone is not identical to the one that my spouse has. (They are the same model but they were purchased from Amazon sellers and not directly from Verizon. They are slightly different in appearance and are quite likely to have different electronics inside them.)
