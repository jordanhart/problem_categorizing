{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Want a simple, dependable, no-frills phone? This is it.", "Author": "N. Cartagena \"A customer\"", "ReviewID": "R34A2NYDPTYZZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed something simple, to the point, and economical (as in \"doesn't require a data plan.\") I looked at a lot of the options out there--particularly the LG Cosmos 2 and the LG Revere. In the end my decision came down to three things: 1) Battery life (which both had in spades), 2) Simplicity, and 3) idiot-proofness. Those last two were why I decided on the LG Revere.Why was battery so important? Having lived through more hurricanes than I care to count (and their aftermath, which usually leaves you without power for a few days), I needed something that I knew could last me at least a week without charging. Considering an almost 7hr talk time/3 week standby rating, both the LG Cosmos 2 and LG Revere were phenomenal options. I would feel perfectly safe taking this phone with me while on a week-long hike in the mountains (provided there was coverage, of course, but that's a carrier issue, not a phone issue), or during a time of disaster where cell phones were the only method of long-range communication.Why was simplicity so important? I don't need or want a multi-media machine (I'll use my iPod Nano/Watch for that). I only want the web in small doses (a tweet here, an email there, checking sports scores or reading the news). I just needed something with which I could send/receive calls dependably and text simple messages. Nothing more. If you're looking for something more, there are many other much better phones, like again, the LG Cosmos 2, which has expandable memory, or maybe the LG Cosmos Touch, which has a full HTML browser.Why was idiot-proof so important? If I want something simple, isn't it obvious? But more specifically, one of the things I wanted to avoid was giving my pocket the ability to make calls without my explicit permissions. Candy bar phones, despite their lock features, tend to have an issue with this. Flip phones hardly do. While I prefer a phone without moving parts (they last longer), flip phones usually have a pretty good track record for sustainability. Better, in my experience at least, than sliders. Besides, I don't TOTALLY abuse my phones. Just, you know, a little. More than most. (Yeah, I need a case.)LG comes with some interesting additions, including one where the phone will announce who's calling, and another where it reads your text messages to you. Useful features if you're on the road a lot, or work somewhere where looking at your phone is a problem. In fact, the software system is pretty intelligently built, although it could use some fine-tuning in some places (there are too many menus nested within other menus, making it difficult to find things at first). I haven't yet used the voice commands feature, so that might come during an update.Call quality is good. Reception seems to be fairly good, though it consistently shows fewer bars than my iPhone 4. (I've had fewer dropped calls on the LG than on the iPhone, so take the bars with a grain of salt.) The speakerphone is good. And Bluetooth functionality is an excellent addition.Speaking of iPhone, size-wise, the LG Revere, when folded, is about as thick as 1.75 iPhone 4s, though it weighs somewhat less. (In fact, it's about as thick as the original Verizon Motorola Droid, though it weighs considerably less.) The keys are easy to press, and very distinctive, so it's easy to dial without looking. (Note: I don't have especially thick fingers, but I do have large hands, and fat, squishy thumbs.)Anyway, I've probably rambled a bit too much. In short: It's if you need something simple, this is worth your consideration, and I'm glad I picked one up.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Phone, Long Battery Life, Small Enough for my Pocket", "Author": "Arizonian", "ReviewID": "R4UVMVWYSX369", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone as \"New Every Two Years\" upgrade of Verizon Wireless.All my cell phones since 2004 are LG branded only. I wanted a new basic LG cell phone with long battery life, small enough for my pocket, low radio-frequency emission and blocked from self-activating camera button (my previous LG Accolade camera button was always self-activated in the pocket).

Both in the same price range, the Moto had an MP3 player/FM radio, 2MP cam, GIGs of removable memory expansion, and easy USB-PC connectivity...BUT the Revere has better reception, a larger screen/more colors, a great selection of downloadable games (and a calculator that actually works).The worst on the Revere is no MP3 player.  You can put songs on its memory, but they'll be in mono (sound only comes out one earpiece) and won't automatically play in sequence (other than a complete mix in one big file).Getting pictures / music on and off via USB cable to PC is a mess.  Verizon has gone out of their way trying to make you only use their crappy online photo album and monthly web music subscription (the workaround involves a sketchy freeware program and .dll downloads).  Granted, Verizon has a couple of good games that'll work on this phone, but I don't think the compromise evens out.The Revere also doesn't have expandable memory.  It has about 80 MB usable on-board memory which, although more than most cheap phones, is minimal when dealing with multiple games, several quality pics and sound files.On a positive note, sound quality is good.  In the closed position, the screen is raised enough so no oils transfer from keypad to screen.  Plenty of protective covers from which to choose.PROS:  * Relatively large screen (higher res & more colors)  * Cost me only $30 at K-mart  * 99\u00a2 daily mobile web (charged only on days used)  * Voice memo/sound recording  * Easy to use calculator  * Solid, quality construction / not too small (the moto W409G was tiny)CONS:  * Thin/plasticy keypad  * No MP3 player / PC connectivity a hassle  * Laggy web  * Web bookmarks/favorites easy to enter but difficult to access  * No user guide included (online user guide useless)", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good and plenty simple", "Author": "Kris Marker", "ReviewID": "RKG4X68LFIWKM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this cell phone to replace Samsung T259 Phone, Blue (T-Mobile) (cf my review). It's a worthy successor; it does the job. The prior review by M. Cartagena is a very good description of what you get in this phone. I will second his comment about a few menus that might be better designed. One thing I couldn't find was a way to shut off the audible \"Call from X\", but somehow it went away, thankfully. The only other thing I'd add is that once or twice I did miss video capability. Alas. It does take an ok photo, however.

It is a great little phone. Very sturdy. Long battery life. Top notch reception in all areas. For the price, you can't beat this phone. It even browses the web. It's not lightning fast, and locks up occasionally on the web, but if you pull the battery out for 5 minutes and restart the phone (*228) it comes back. The phone came with a $10.00 credit, therefore the $4.88 for the phone was well spent. If you buy it accepting that it will have capabilities comparative to price, you will be highly satisfied. If you buy it thinking you will be sitting on your lunch break watching YouTube every day, you will be disappointed. Speakerphone works great too, but will not work with phone closed.

McGee \"KayJay\"", "ReviewID": "RB7RNRO2J6GI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had 3 cell phones in my entire life. The first was a Razr, the second was a Blackberry which I replaced with this phone.I got it for less than $40 and it costs me an average of 20.00 a month to maintain. I don't text often and mostly use it to make phone calls. We also have an SMR phone in one of our vehicles and a land line at home and since I work from home, I only make/receive an average of 10 phone calls or so a month on this phone.I've got other gadgets to surf the internet and check my email so I didn't really care about having a phone that could do those things. I also have a fabulous digital camera that I never leave home without so I've not tried the picture taking feature with this phone.My husband has some hearing loss and he could never hear very well on the Blackberry but this one works great for him plus with this flip phone, there's no butt dialing or making phone calls from inside my handbag.It's extremely easy to go to the Verizon website and add minutes plus my unused minutes carry over to the next month and that is a must for me. I don't like paying for something and then having it go to waste and not being able to use what I paid for because the month ended.I must admit, it's a bit less intuitive than the Blackberry (which was costing me over 100.00 a month) but overall, I'd say it is easier to use.I live in Idaho and everything here is very spread out and where I live there's not a lot of cell towers but I've never had a problem with poor reception or dropped calls.Bottom line: This is a fantastic basic phone, works great for my husband who has some hearing loss and for us, is super inexpensive to maintain. It's also a great size.***ADDENDUM** 8-15-2012Yesterday I drove to the city from where I live. It's over a hundred miles away and there is a canyon that I have to drive through to get there. On my way home my vehicle broke down! Of course it broke down while I was going up the hill through that canyon. My cell phone would not work!! I literally was at least 5 miles from the nearest house/town and it was 105 degrees where I broke down on the grade.I finally had to dial 911 on the cell and Thank You GOD!, it worked although I kept cutting in and out so it took the dispatcher a bit to figure out where I was and what the problem was. I noted that when I dialed 911 my phone went into an \"emergency mode\" which must boost the signal or something.Anyway, an officer showed up with some water for me to stay hydrated and called me a tow. Note that he had a top-of-the-line smart phone and his phone wouldn't work either. He had to use his police radio to call the dispatcher so they could call for a tow truck.I had to wait another hour for the tow truck to reach me and while I was waiting and terribly hot and bored (I won't leave home without a book or my Kindle ever again), to amuse myself I sent my sister a couple of texts. She lives about an hour from where I broke down. I didn't have much hope that they would reach her but as I said, I didn't have anything better to do. It turns out that the texts went through even though phone calls wouldn't. Food for thought. If, like me, you live or are traveling through sparsely populated areas, even if your phone won't work, try texting.In closing: When the phone wouldn't initially work I was set to get rid of it and go back to paying way more for my service but now I know that even the high tech phones won't always work. That was an eye opener and made me decide to stick with this one. It (eventually) got the job done.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "a good product.", "Author": "veneziano", "ReviewID": "R18BSJ8048Y9DJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My phone was damaged and this was cheaper than buying a new phone.

HOWEVER, Verizon customer service stinks, and reception is not stellar.  I was spoiled by customer service when I had US Cellular back in Chicago.  I was told by a clerk in a Verizon store that a PREPAID phone actually accesses fewer cellular towers, hence explaining the (sometimes) poor reception.  This is my first experience with Verizon, and it's hard for me to tell if it's Verizon, or the phone/ prepaid experience that is not reliable and extremely annoying. I have not been able to place or receive calls a few times around the time my automatic payment is going through for the next month.

I'm on the computer a lot, so I don't really have a desire for a smart phone as well, I wanted something simple that works well.  This got a lot of good reviews, so I got it, but there are so many annoyances with this phone that I have to speak up about it.  I thought it would be easiest to make a list of pros and cons.I bought this with a Verizon plan, not prepaid like in this specific model.Pros:Long battery life.  I don't talk on my phone frequently, but I only have to charge this phone once a week.Easy to use.  I wasn't able to transfer my contacts directly from my old phone, so I entered them manually.  That was easy to do.  My one complaint here is that it doesn't automatically assign speed dial numbers like my old phone did.Good reception.  I haven't had any dropped calls - yet.  I've only had this phone for about six months, but I haven't had any dropped calls yet.  Family that I talk to regularly say that I'm easier to hear on this phone than my old cell, a Samsung SCH-A650.Cons:Daily Scoop.  This was my biggest complaint for quite a while, and if I weren't as persistent as I am, I probably wouldn't have figured out how to get rid of it.  This application was pre-installed, and there's no way to remove it.  To make matters worse, I turned off its notifications once, and then Verizon later on pushed a software update to my phone, which turned the notifications back on.  When I tried to turn them back on, I discovered that the menu had changed completely and had to fiddle around quite a bit to figure out how to turn it off again.  I don't mind ads in things that are free online, but I get really annoyed when I'm advertised to on my phone.If you're using this pre-paid model, this app may not be pre-installed, that may be a Verizon specific \"feature\".Volume buttons are too sensitive.  I keep my cell in my pocket, like I would assume many other people do.  About 50+ or so times a day, I hear the button beeping in my pocket.The battery cover comes off too easily.  I've had the battery cover come off accidentally on multiple occasions.  My last phone had a battery lock that you had to undo to take the battery cover off, it'd be a simple fix if that were in this phone as well.Also, a serious design flaw in the phone, if you have it open and a call comes in - you can't answer the call.  I think the choices I was given when this happened were \"Quiet call\" and \"Go to voicemail\", but I'm not positive.
