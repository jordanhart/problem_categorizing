{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Greatest Phone I've Ever Owned...", "Author": "Billy E. White", "ReviewID": "R2CX9BI90YZJ62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone for two reasons. First, I needed a phone because I couldn't keep a good case on my Motorola Razor. And second, my wife needed a new phone badly. My razor was about a year old, so I would buy me what I was looking for (no flipper or slider; but had full key board). This is what I came up with. My Wife keeps the Razor in her pocket without a case anyways. She was happy. I was really, really happy. This phone performs so well and looks so professional, I want it's premium model when It's upgrade time, even if I have to pay some. It does have a bug here and there but MOST of those can be worked out - seriously. I have AT&T;, you HAVE to call and get your ring time extended from 20 to 30. Seriously, to have plenty of time, that has to be done. And the phone itself is awesome. All I can say is keep your upgrades up. Keep it updated.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great palm smartphone!!!", "Author": "Rolando Martinez \"Scifi fan\"", "ReviewID": "R38SWSYUWS9YB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this Palm Centro a week ago. For now I am impressed with the versatility the phones gives me for making calls, handling contacts and appointments.  And cause it's based on palm OS I installed a couple of apps I used to had in my TX.  They work just fine.I read a couple of reviews where the guys were complaining about locking a freezing.  I experienced it a couple of times receiving calls, but cause of my expertise with palm devices, I decided to make a hard reset and voil\u00e1!! everything is working just fine for now.  I installed callrec (wonderful app that records every call you make), Agendus Pre, BTToggle and a coulpe of games and everything is wonderful.Pros:- Very versatile device- Sound is good- Good speaker- Handful of useful apps on the market- Basic apps very useful for starters (agenda, contacts, voice dial, Calc, Documents to Go, Pocket tunes, voice recorder)- Voice command that lets you make a lot of things like calling contacts (you say the name of the contact and it understands it very good), opening apps.  Very cool feature.- Qwerty keyboard feels fine, but not for big hands, my hands are a little big and I can use it just fine.- Bluetooth- micro sd slot- Good stuff for your moneyCons:- Plastic pen, feels a little fragile (I already ordered a metal pen for 1$)- Back cover feels little loose when holding the phone.  Makes a little noise when you press it too hard. This factor does not interfere with phone functions.- Battery life not so good, I can estimate a 4-5 day in standby mode.  In constant use, two days top.- No wifi (should this be a con?)That's what I can say.  So far I am satisfied with this smartphone (really smart I think).  I give it 4 stars.", "Date": "August 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "one crazy annoying glitch that was solved by palm.com after 7+ calls", "Author": "sine quinn non \"saq\"", "ReviewID": "R21FDUUXXGLE9Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i kept getting alerts every 3 or 4 minutes saying that there was some error with my mail system,  and i did not have email on my plan .. it took many calls but the folks at [....] were patient ... i did a hard reset and they helped me do it without losing my info .. so all's well that ends well...", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far, still good!", "Author": "P.

Even after the second one broke I bought another one. I would buy this at At&t; rather then other companies. Also i just wanted to mention the fact the Palm Centro has a touchsreen keyboard too.

Freezes when I need to make a call, calls are coming in and you can't answer them, even when I added additional memory card.  Palm has helped me reset this phone over 11 times and it still freezes.  Then Palm recommended renaming the back-up folder. It still freezes.  Then Palm tried to trade my new Centro for a refurbished Centro, but at the $300.00-new-Centro-price.  I refused.  Google \"Centro Freezes\" and you will find a lot of sites and blogs about this unsolvable, unfixable freezing problem with the Centro. When I call Palm, no one answers the phone except an answering machine;  voicemails do not result in returned calls.  I will never buy another Palm product again.  By the way, everyone I know who has a Blackberry is infinitely satisfied and happy with it.

I am used to it; it manages my life effectively.  My wife concurs.  We liked our Treos, but it was time to switch, and the Centro fits well in my wife's hand, particularly.  We both use text-messaging, and a Real Keyboard is a must-have; onscreen virtual keyboards just don't work for us.  The Centro keyboard, though smaller than that of our Treos, is perfectly adequate and easy to use.  In short this is an excellent phone at an unbeatable price.  I now own the successor Pre 2; I like it, but the Centro is my home-phone and I don't see that changing.I note in passing, this was a case of a company using the full range of Amazon order-execution and -fulfillment capabilities.
