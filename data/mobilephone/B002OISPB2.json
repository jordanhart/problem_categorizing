This phone is a very stylish piece of junk, so I'll begin with listing the cons: 1) Very slow and unresponsive(very irritating) - sometimes you force yourself to tap things multiple time before it reacts, nor do you get a sense of whether it's thinking or doing anything. 2) Battery life is very poor despite the rating and the numbers shown in the spec. 3) Camera just died on me a few weeks after the purchase and now displays an error when i try to initialize a photo software, it starts working occasionally when i tap on the back of the phone (some quality there, huh?). 4) Navigation flow is deeply flawed by inconsistent navigation patterns and abilities to jump from screen to screen when you rotate the phone. 5)Internet browser sucks, it doesn't anti-alias text so it looks like cr@p. 6)There is no way to find any good software for it, no marketplace for it on the phone itself. These 6 items should be sufficient reasons not to get the phone, but I'll list what it does good anyway: 1) Video Playback is awesome. 2) Ring tones are not bad. 3)Phone Speaker is loud.I only wish that LG could realize the flaws of it's proprietary OS and ported Android over for this otherwise capable device.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stylish, but useless", "Author": "BuyerfromNHY", "ReviewID": "R16R3PPNW82DPR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:- very stylish phone- good battery looking life (at least compared to my previous phones)- loud speaker- good quality touchsreen LCDCons:- VERY buggy software (irresponsive specially when you type a text message / have to click the same button many times for it to work/ some time freezes and has to be restarted)- low memory (with only about 150 text messages it says \"memory 90% full, are you serious?? this is 2011)- TOO MANY buttons on the phone that unlock it (if you touch power button it will unlock the phone / if you touch ring volume button for longer than 1 sec, it will unlock the phone, if you touch the screen in a specific manner, it will unlock the phone. I CONSTANTLY find myself calling or changing phone settings when I put the phone in a front jeans pocket)I would NOT recommend buying this phone to any one.
