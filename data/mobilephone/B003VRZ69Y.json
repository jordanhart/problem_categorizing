{"Reviews": [{"Title": "nice phone, old OS", "Author": "koku", "ReviewID": "R1ZCPFXEG6M14Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this phone for two weeks now. I like it, but it was running on Android 1.5, which is really old. Many newer android apps may not be compatible to 1.5. Yes, there is a freeware on openetna.com, and I actually pushed 2.2 on it, but got mightily disappointed with 2.2: buggy, some features not working, the main problem was USB connection (or lack of such) to the PC as couldn't mounted SD card. Anyways, you get what you paid for, and in case of open freeware, it's nothing, so you shouldn't complain. I ended up pushing back a Korean LG version of OS which is 1.6. Now the phone runs better than on the original 1.5. Now, back to the phone. It's solidly built, somewhat small, but like it better than larger balkier phones. Battery life is good. Overall, it's all I was looking for: a smaller functional smartphone with WIFI, GPS, a media player capable of playing full MP4 movies, slider keyboard (I hate onscreen ones). I am giving it only 3 starts because of the old OS. Hopefully, LG will push an upgrade some fine day. I won't be \"monkeying\" with the open source firmware, unless I absolutely have to. In summary, I recommend this phone if you manage to upgrade it to 1.6", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "WARRANTY", "Author": "ruben dionisio", "ReviewID": "R2GRTJK731MLM1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered my LG GW620 unlock phone from worldwide distributors...I received the product on time but after a week, a problem arises...according to the website when I ordered it, it comes with a warranty.

It's my first smart phone so I haven't figured everything out yet but I love it. I use to have an LG Xenon and I thought that was good but this is far better. Everything just seems to just run faster, easier, smarter. Smarter the most important thing there. Android just makes sense. For example: I was texting someone and had the thread open. They didn't know what they said, so I was going to forward their message back to them. Being brand new to me, I wasn't sure how to forward a message. There was no option on the screen that said \"Forward\" like every other type of phone I had. So I said, \"why don't i just try holding down my finger on his message and see what happens. Boom. There the option was. Just makes sense.  Idk, maybe that's just me. But I like it.  My only little problem is the oddness of the screen sensitivity. I put my thumb on the button to select and it doesn't even register sometimes. That's my only problem...for now. It's still too early to see the rest of the phone, to find my niche with it, which is usually what it takes to be able to say what's really wrong with it.Overall, love this phone.Emphasis on the fast processor, nice camera, fast internet, and emphasis on how it makes me happy", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelent Cell phone", "Author": "Renato Mayorga", "ReviewID": "R3K8D90GFJI4T4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone, and I am very happy with it.With Android OS I can download a lot applications and games free.The WiFi works very fine and the camera take picture very good.To update the OS to Android 2.2 you can visit the following web site: OPENETNA.COM", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "good old phone for its time 2010", "Author": "Jorge Polanco \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "RGBYL7F7NNZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this phone aroung 2010 dec it has work great and was good eough for using but the touch screen was the main issue that i resold it because of the resistive feel and always having to apply pressure on the screen to use it. i did sold it to a co worker in 2011. who i am very surprise still has the phone and likes it very much. phone still work as for os i did change it at the time to cyaogen version 6 andriod os that greatly improve and help the phone to respond very fast and easier to use. since i hated the original os. at the time is did only pay 198 for it now it has a hi price,,,hmmmm at this time and age recommend getting a better phone than paying  a 256 price....", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "too many problems with this phone, android 1.5 is bad, you get what you pay for :(", "Author": "Jean C. \"Jean C.\"", "ReviewID": "RSNSRQXI161QY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i wrote a review with little time using the cellphone, now i change my mind about LG GW620 ETNA Unlocked Cell Phone, i have to say im disapointed with it, there is a lot of problems and issues reported on the internet and forums, should read it more before buying it, here is a list:  all them i suffered too)CONs- memory unmounts itselfs randomly- can not \"oficially\" update- LG customer service SUCKS (for real)- WIFI turns off itself when screen shuts down, (cant modify this setting, problem solved in android OS 2.1 or above)- screen gets eventually gets crazy, no response, and marks out of the target you want,(you will have to factory reset periodically)- USB drivers wont work propertly in almost ALL computers and OS- this is very important: HOME & return button are \"touch\", then you will ALWAYS acidentaly get out of the app or opened window at the minimum finger presure.

This phone is a major headache, yes it has a lots of cool features but it freezes and suddenly becomes very slow. Just when it is ringing it will freeze, or become unresponsive, it is almost like if you are in a hidden camera show: screen will turn black every time you try to push answer. I took it to technical service and they reloaded the software, it was better for a while, but just a little better for little time. As you can read in other reviews it uses an old 1.5 android OS, you wont be able to use most new aplication since they require android 2.0 and yes there are some unofficial upgrades, I spend a lot of time trying to update and it was imposible.THIS PHONE HAS PRODUCE ON ME A LOT OF FRUSTATION AN ANGER BECAUSE IT FAILS A LOT WHEN I TRY TO ANSWER AND MAKE CALLS, yet it is well contructed still work after a lots of angry punchs and drops.Yes I must change phone, but the carrier I bought it from did'nt refund or allow exchange.
