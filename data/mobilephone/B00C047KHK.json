After A LOT of research on different phones (and realizing how broke I was), I figured I would look into the off brand phones that I see a lot of on ebay and amazon all the time. After realizing that it's pretty much the same phone, just without a brand name, I decided to jump in and give it a try. I'm so glad I did! Not only did this phone cost my about 1/3 of the price of the brand name one, but it works just the same. I love it!!!! My only problem is that my front facing camera seems to be a little funny. The picture isn't as clear and doesn't focus. But the camera on the back of the phone works great! I have all the same apps as I had on my previous phone and they work perfectly. I am a t-mobile user and I inserted my sim card and it recognized it instantly. I have my google account set up to this phone as well. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who, like myself, is short on cash but in the market for a new phone. The brand name isn't always better. I love my phone so much it works great!!", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "It worked at first then died", "Author": "Tara M.
