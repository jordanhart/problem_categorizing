An unlocked cell phone seemed to fit our requirements, but I was skeptical. However, based on the prior reviews, and on other information I found on the web about this particular phone, I decided to try it. The vendor confirmed that this model would work with the T-Mobile SIM card. Sure enough, it does! Sound quality is really good, and it has pretty much every feature you'd find in similar phones (the Blackberry Curve comes to mind). Calendar, messaging, web capable, this phone is a virtual office in the palm of his hand.The phone is also aesthetically pleasing and distinctive. So far, the hubby is extremely pleased with it - and that's saying something.If you need a quality phone, but don't want to be slave to a cell contract, or shell out hundreds of dollars, seriously consider this one. The price is right, and the phone, at least for us, was even better.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gives you exactly what you're looking for", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R3D8OE6LGHCY46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a cool phone.

After reading a few reviews I thought this would be a good choice. The phone is light weight with a good sized screen, but the amenities stop there. The keys are extremely small and hard to use at an adequate speed when texting or dialing a number. The camera gives you a grainy picture at best and in order to send a text I can honestly say that if you don't happen to know the persons cell number by memory, this phone requires a ridiculous amount of steps before you hit the Send button not to mention that hardly any of us remembers numbers anymore since contact numbers are programmed into every cell phone. If you need to send a text to a contact in your phone here are the steps that are required: Choose (1) Create Message, (2) type your message, (3) choose Send To, (4) choose Options, (5) select Add Recipients, (6) choose Address Book, (7) pick the contact you want your message to go to, (8)choose the checked box, (9) push the Add button, (10) go back up the recipients name and (11) highlight it and (12) then press Send.  This phone is adequate at best. It would probably be great for a kid in grade school who needs to keep in contact with his or her parents.

Let me give you some background information before I write this review to tell you what use this phone had...I am a pretty heavy texter, about 400 a day so I could easily fill 2 of the phones inboxes and I talk about 250-300 minutes a month and occasionally use the internet on the phone.  It was all good with the phone for about 9 months. The speaker worked great, the camera is tolerable for what you pay, holds contacts, buttons are small but you get used to them, ringer is loud and vibrate is quiet, you can have animated wallpapers which I like a lot, and overall it is a tolerable cell phone. Now to the bad, well for starters to turn off vibrate and make it completely silent you need to navigate the menus to find out where the sound menu is. Also, where the directional buttons are around the center button the one that goes right is programmed to go to the internet to refill account, well every time you hit the button by accident because the phone is not as fast as you would like it literally nickel and dimes you, this same thing happens with the center button. Also, I downloaded this FACEBOOK CHAT app which cost 5 bucks and I carefully read the directions and it will not work, this is also an annoyance because loaded FACEBOOK takes FOREVER so I thought hey this chat thing may be good-nope! If you want an internet phone, this is not for you! It is very slow and holds like 15 favorites and has pretty bad graphics so you can't see what you're doing. Not to mention the amount of money the internet will cost on this thing. It seems like 2 dollars a minute on the internet and the data packages aren't very good either. The casing on the phone looks acceptable but every time you drop the stupid thing the battery covers flies off along with the battery. Also, the finish scratches very easily and the paint off the battery cover will chip. Also, me being a teenager I have texted in school, the only problem is trying to be quiet because these buttons make so much noise and when the room is quiet the buttons sound so loud. A few weeks ago I had this phone in my backpack on the last day of school and my backpack I believe is an average weight and I had my phone in one of the pockets and my iPOD and the screen on the phone cracked and it is so hard to read the time and text now, and the crack isn't in the middle of the screen like you'd think its on the stronger edge of it which makes me question its strength. Also, on the day it turned 1 year old vibrate just stopped working and the screen has been freezing, its been dropping calls, not sending texts, and NO web access.All in all for a short time, this phone will do but if you want a long term one than go with something else.

I found the Samsung A177, and I liked the idea that I did not have to change my phone plan with T-Mobile (because I was not adding internet access to it).  I didn't even have to contact T-Mobile at all since it was UNlocked....I just took my SIM card from my old phone and put it in this one.  One thing I did notice is when I chose \"copy contacts\" from my SIM card to the new phone, a few contacts did not copy over.  So, you might want to make sure you have your contacts written down somewhere so you have that info. if you need to input it again.  The other thing I had a small issue with is the very limited number of ring tones if you do NOT have internet access on your phone.  But, it's a phone, and it rings and it works.  I like the keyboard much better for texting, altho you need to have fingernails and/or a stylus.  It takes great pictures.  Oh, one last thing I don't like is the instruction manual.....could they get the print any smaller?!?!?!?!

The ring tones that come with the phone leave a lot to be desired--to add new you have to buy them and you can't change the tone for text msgs--which I never hear and until I bought a ring tone, I had not been able to hear that ring tone either--it now drops calls constantly unless you sit very still and don't dare move your head. The good thing is the keyboard but the numbers are impossible to see in certain light--so sometimes dialing a number can be an adventure.

The only way they \"might\" honor the warranty is if I sent it to them postage pre-paid with dated proof of purchase (no problem, so far) but the proof had to include the IMEI number.  That killed it.Plan B was a non-starter...send it back to Samsung & they'll charge me for a repair.It was so much easier to simply return it to Amazon (they paid transport) for a full refund, which I did.  Amazon is so good about this.  Buying from Amazon is the only way to go for electronic products.My foray into replacement phones did have a happy ending.

Mills", "ReviewID": "R18CY93XS9W8HP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When my trusty Nokia clamshell slipped off my belt and threw itself into the rocks of a jetty, I decided to take a plunge on a Blackberry form factor.  This phone is so limited in standard capabilities (AT&T;/Consumer Cellular), I'd call it the worst choice I've ever made in mobile phones:-No microSD.  Therefore, storing anything like music or pictures on anything but it's limited internal memory is out of the question.-Proprietary connections.  No standard 3.5mm jack.  No standard USB port.-As a consequence of the two points above, you're stuck with Samsung's single earbud/mic combination.-Many basic Java third-party applications aren't supported.  Most obvious for me was Google Maps.  Search various forums and you'll find the same problem:  it downloads, but freezes halfway through the booting process.-Paltry .2MP (that's POINT 2MP) camera.  I'd like to have seen at least a standard 2MP.-No video capture.I suppose on the positive side, the rocker key and softkeys have firm tactile response.  The BB-size keyboard may be an issue for some, but that's the form factor.  If you're committed to the Blackberry style without the additional hardware and subscription costs, the Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Slate) is a much better choice for only a few more bucks via Consumer Cellular.If nothing else, the experience helped me reset my priorities on a text/smarter/web  phone.

They both direct you to the web browser on the phone which charges you money from your balance, and when you go into phone settings you can change what every other button does, but you cannot change those 2 buttons! and the big one is constantly accidentally pressed because it sticks out so I will pull my phone out of my pocket and see that it's on the web browser when I don't want it to be!

I bought this phone a year ago and I have to confirm that the battery life is still pretty good.  It lasts me TWO full days on a single charge.  It used to be 3-4 when the phone was new, but aging has taken it's toll.  The phone is OK for texting if you have longer thumb fingernails since the QUWERTY keyboard seems to be compressed.  It's very easy to hit the wrong letters.  The phone itself is pretty easy to navigate through, but there isn't really that many features to brag about.  It does give you the ability to set multiple alarms which is nice for my busy schedule.  I may have a bias view on the reception since I live in the mountains of West Virginia, but this phone has not proven itself to be very sufficient at acquiring a signal.  I recieve dropped calls, moments of silence, missed calls, etc.  I have AT&T; and my other phones had good cell service but I've been told that many AT&T; phones around here are having trouble.  The camera is nothing special, it does take pictures but the quality is poor in comparison to other phones.  All in all, I'd have to say that this is a good phone for people who do not spend a lot of time using cellular phones or are less dependent on the new cell phone phenomenon (texting, internet data plans, ringtones, pictures, etc..)  The phone does not record videos either.  I probably wouldn't buy one here just because I believe that we'll be sweeping them off the sidewalks in 5 years.
