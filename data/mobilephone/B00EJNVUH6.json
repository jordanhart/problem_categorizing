{"Reviews": [{"Title": "New Pony, More Tricks!", "Author": "Barrett Benton", "ReviewID": "R2522K5HQYO3QE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned the original Hydro for just about a year, I've watched and waited to see how the rest of the industry would react to Kyocera's wild-card entre\u00e9 into the smartphone field. Not exactly a high-end phone (see my review elsewhere on Amazon), I found the phone a mostly-good combination of size/weight, features (most prominent being a mostly-unmolested offering of Android 4.0/ICS), and reasonable if not exactly peppy performance.That last bit became a little more irksome with time and additional apps added to the phone: a few buggy apps, which would be merely annoying on a phone with a faster processor, could hobble the Hydro unnecessarily; a few apps stopped the poor thing in its tracks. These apps, thankfully, fall into the cool-but-hardly-essential category for me, and a quick uninstall brought things back to normal. And, up until a month or two ago, the Hydro's chief calling-card - bonafide waterproof-ness - had no known competition.That, of course, changed, first by Sony, then more recently by Samsung with their \"ruggedized\" version of their Galaxy S4. Interesting, I thought, but besides the cost of owning either phone being too high for my budget and sensibilities, neither phone was available for my carrier of choice (Boost, of course). Kyocera does offer the Torque, but I felt that number was too big, too over-the-top in the styling department, and was only available, via contract, on Sprint. I decided I'd just have to wait until Kyocera decided to do a refresh of the Hydro.I didn't have to wait long: the Hydro EDGE isn't a refresh of the original Hydro so much as it is a total rethinking: if you regard the original Hydro as something of a proof-of-concept first-offering (and not a shabby one, I'd add), the EDGE is a confident redesign that rises above middle-of-the-road status with serious el\u00e1n.Improvements? Other than 4G LTE (nope, still not there, but 3G performance is solid enough to largely ignore this), just about everything is improved: the single-core 1GHz Snapdragon processor of the original Hydro is replaced by a dual-core version, with a serious kick in performance resulting; the pan-focus 3.5 megapixel camera is replaced with a 5MP version with autofocus and 720p video capability; the screen has been enlarged to four inches and is now protected with impact-resistant glass (Dragontrail, Asahi Glass' answer to Corning's Gorilla Glass); and something Kyocera calls Smart Sonic Receiver technology, which allows one to better hear a caller even in seriously noisy environments. Battery life has also been improved, with Kyocera claiming upwards of 13 hours talk time and 180 hours standby time.And they wrapped it up in what I consider a quite attractive package: about the same width as the original Hydro, a bit taller (to accommodate the half-inch-larger screen), but roughly two-thirds the thickness, the EDGE subjectively exudes a solidity in the hand that the original, good as it is, doesn't quite pull off. One-handed operation is pretty much up there with the first Hydro, although you'll need to get used to the relocated Power button should you choose to switch to the new model. One interesting change - an improvement, in my book - is the battery cover on the back, which in the case of both old and new Hydro is a crucial part of the phones' \"waterproofiness\": the original model had a hard-plastic cover which, once removed, exposed nearly the entire back of the phone, and whose relatively-fragile silicone sealing \"band\" hugged the very edge. This band could be damaged if the cover was handled roughly during removal or replacement, obviously compromising the phone's watertightness. The new Hydro's battery cover is of a thinner, more membrane-like flexible construction, covering two-thirds of the phone's back. The silicone-rubber band that does the serious waterproofing work here is wider, more physically robust, and placed farther inboard of the cover, making it less prone to damage from multiple removings/replacements.Not that you'll be doing much of that: While I have had to do the odd battery-pull to do a hard-reset on the original Hydro (though nowhere nearly as much as I've suffered with other phones in my past), I've yet to yank the cover from the Edge in the two months I've used it, loaded with apps and used quite heavily. The one time I pulled the cover off was to install the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro-SD card from my original Hydro. And even here there's a major improvement: instead of the flimsy (and, for some, confusing) flick-and-lift mechanism, you now have a simple slot for card installation and removal. Yes, nearly all of us, phone geeks included, will likely have to deal with this twice at most, but  I like this change a lot.The OS: Android Ice Cream Sandwich (shipping on the first Hydro) was, and is, fantastic. It was my personal point of entry into what the funky green `bot had to offer. But, Jelly Bean...the coolest differences are in the small details, the kind of fine-grained subtleties that once seemed the sole province of Apple. (Not hating on Cupertino here: I'm a Mac guy going way back, and not about to change my stripes, especially with that debacle called Windows 8.) There are bigger surprises here as well: being a freelancer who gets around my fair city by bike and public transportation, Google not only helps me schedule my appointments and map the most efficient way to get where I want/need to go, but also prompts me ahead of time how long it will take me to reach my destination, as well as how long it'll take to get home (or to my next gig) once I'm done. Glad I lived long enough to get to use this stuff!(The added processor muscle also means turn-by-turn voice-navigation is *much* smoother.)I mentioned, in passing, the new 5MP camera, now with autofocus, as well as 720p hi-def video capability: as a photographer, I'm still mostly about still-picture stuff (and mostly on film, at that!), but the bit about autofocus IS a Big Deal for me, if for just one reason: once in a while, I'll come across a poster, or someone on the street shoves a handout to me, with one of those cute little things I have to scan to get more info. On the old Hydro, I'd *try* to scan this with the camera (and appropriate app), but the pan-focus lens, being designed to focus within a set parameter (like an old Kodak Instamatic...what's that? E-mail your folks, they'll know), can't do close-focus all that well, so it was hit-or-miss at best. On the Hydro EDGE, the camera simply takes a second or two to lock focus, and Bingo!, you have your information. Overall picture quality is also improved.Bluetooth performance with all my BT devices (BlueAnt Q2 and Motorola HX-1 headsets, Rocketfish stereo Bluetooth headphones) is excellent - no issues to report thus far.Other Small but Important changes: the flip-off cover protecting the micro-USB charging port on the original Hydro is gone from the EDGE: presumably, Kyocera figured out how to make the port water-friendly without the need for such a prophylactic.I suppose I could go into more \"nice stuff\" details (and I probably will...look for updates to this review soon), but hopefully you get the idea by now. I think Kyocera, having dipped its toes into the \"alternative\" mid-market smartphone market with the original Hydro (and the Rise, even though slider-type phone do absolutely nothing for me) have made a bold, confident step forward with the Hydro EDGE. Handling phones like the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S III/IV, nice as they are (and, yes, they are), I feel nothing lacking coming back to my Hydro EDGE. Fast, smooth, virtually seamless operation, for a lot less than these other high-end phones, I would say the EDGE offers much for those who have a good sense of what they need, and want, in a solid smartphone.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever had", "Author": "bicyclepunk", "ReviewID": "R200UR3U13GBFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Previously I owned a Kyocera Hydro and loved it's durability. After seeing the new Hydro Edge come out I decided to try it.Kyocera has done a wonderful job with the upgrade. The larger screen and impressive camera claiming only to be 5mp actually seems more like an 8mp. The already installed Panoramic camera! Not to mention texting could not get any easier! Yes it has the voice response but even better, when I text it can tell what phrases I'm going to use. Such as if I said, \"I hope you like it\" or something like that, I put in \"I\", then \"h\" and they automatically show the word \"hope\" as one of the choices but immediately after choosing the pretexted word 'hope' it shows you the word 'you' and other words that you might say after 'hope'. Almost guessing your next word. I just love it.Originally, when I had the Blackberry years ago, it was hard for me to switch original from a physical qwerty to touch screen. My first couple of touch screens aggravated me with how sloppy they were and how easy it was to press the wrong letter. With the bigger, easier to use screen on this Hydro Edge and all the additional features that I haven't even begun to mention, you will not be disappointed with this phone! I've never been so impressed. Not to mention it's only around $100. You'd be crazy to spend $200 on a phone with less. I've spent $300 on a phone previously and it didn't have nearly as many impressive functions as this Hydro Edge. I can't believe how sweet this phone is!", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone, especially for the price.", "Author": "DeadlyGalaxy", "ReviewID": "R3O5P13X0VDHPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i'm a bit of a newbie to the whole pay as you go plans.  was tired of paying almost $100/month with Verizon.did a fair amount of research and found boost mobile to be really good based off other's reviews.  decided to get the kyrocera hydro edge, primarily due to price ($100) and the fact it ran Android 4.1.  Didn't want to pay a bundle for a top of the line phone, as i have a IPad 4 that I use for most other on the go things.Quite pleased so far, phone is a good size, easy to use and is pretty clear on majority of calls placed so far.  also like the fact it is waterproof and rugged.  based on previous experiences, i wanted either a LG or Kyrocera branded phone preferably, since they tend to hold up well over time and aren't fragile like some other phones.The touch screen is decently sized and nice and responsive, making it easy to type and text on the virtual keyboard.  And it is nice the phone memory can be upgraded with a micro sd card up to 32 gigs extra.  The camera is also quite nice at 5MP and has a flash (which most other phones in this cost range do not have).  Also like how you can connect to a WiFi spot with the phone, instead of relying on using the data plan, which supposedly caps at 2.5 gigs/month and thus throttles the download speed down quite. bit until the next billing cycle.  Especially if you plan to stream Netflix or any type of video/music apps frequently.now there are a couple of minor cons. it isn't the fastest phone ever (as far as opening/running apps) in comparison with some of the more expensive models (Galaxy, HTC One, LG Venice/F7 models) due the amount of onboard RAM.  I don't know how well it would perform on high performance games or apps (as mentioned above, i use a tablet for those). I would imagine things like Youtube and Netflix would run fine with little/no problems. It does not utilize 4G or 4G LTE service, only 3G (which seems to be hit or miss around here, and i live in the suburbs and frequently go into the city).Overall though it's a nice phone and does what i need it to do.  Recommend if you are on a budget, but don't want to sacrifice a lot of the modern features. it's not perfect, but performs admirably well considering.  This will hold me until they have a nice sale of either the Samsung Galaxy S III or the LG Venice.  I would recommend buying a hybrid armor case (got one off here for $5), just because it adds a bit of bulk and a little more weight making it easier to hold in my opinion.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kyocera has HORRIFIC customer service!!!!

I sent the phone to Kyocera to be repaired again. They claimed it was fixed again and sent it back to me a month later. On 5/6/13 the SAME power button broke for the THIRD TIME. I sent the phone in again. I expected I would get a new phone at this point. Kyocera reps told me it had to break one more time before they would replace the phone with a new one. They claimed that the phone was fixed again and sent it back a month later. On 9/19/13 my Kycoera Hydro's power button broke for the FOURTH time after the last 3 supposed repairs.I called their horrible customer service center again fully expecting that finally I would be taken care of and they would \"no questions asked\" send me a new phone. I WAS SO WRONG. They wanted me to send my phone in once again to be \"Evaluated\".A month later I called wondering where is my replacement phone? I get the run around day after day. I was told once that Corporate has to approve it now... and another time It is still in the repair center being evaluated. No one knew where my phone was or cared. Finally, yesterday I get a package from Kyocera with a phone in it. This phone was NOT my phone (which I would have been furious to receive, because they odviously CAN'T fix it!) and NOT a new phone (which I was told I would receive numerous times by kyocera reps & supervisors)The phone I received was not only someone else's used phone, but it had blue paint on the back of it! It was marred and get this also connected to a previous owners service! I was getting someone else's private calls and text messages on a phone I should have never received!WOW is all I can say...

And I remember them being virtually indestructible back then, I would think they are probably still VERY reliable. This one actually does work under water, I put it in the tub, yes in hot water for like 5 minutes with music playing, something I would never do when I purchase any product. But I wanted to see if it's true, even though I'm not accident prone. Took it out worked like a beast. Try that Iphone HA.  Overall every thing is great, the screen looks good, just turn it up to full brightness, although at an angle it get lighter and a strange tint to it. Which really isn't a big deal. Says 720p Video which I have yet to do, being that I have a 300$ Panasonic Lumix with 1080p video i probably won't use much. So we'll see. Takes good clear pictures, love the flash, helps a great deal. I replaced a ZTE Merit which was a tough little phone basically because it started getting slower, and was/is outdated with Android 2.3. This one just takes some getting use to.  Netflix streams flawlessly, music sounds loud and clear. Not a lot of bass, but I mean do you really need a subwoofer on a phone. Calls are crystal clear, almost to loud, but I consider that good as opposed to going huh? What did you say, your cutting out. Good wireless, works quick with a dual core 1 ghz processor. Not sure how or why some reviewers say it's slow, not sure what their definition of \"fast\" is. It's getting like 0-60 with cars, does anyone really care? I haven't seen people gathered in circles at wal-mart parking lot or burger king taking bets on who's phone could bring up an app the fastest. Oh well.  At any rate if you've never heard of this brand don't be leary, it's one of the godfathers of cell phones. And after the water dunk I'm pretty convinced it will last a very long time. But then again technology changes every year on these things it seems. So it's a good priced smooth running very durable phone. Make sure you latch the back to seal it if you try to drop it in your toilet and then fish it out. HA. So I like it, simple as that. ;o) Good note to is I'm not sure why people don't use the speech to text feature on these phones instead of running people off the road finger texting. It works great.Great pics, with flash, great for the price, fast, YES it is. High volume, umm it's a phone. If you want someone to drop off your kids after school hire a nanny, not your phone.

With Android 2.2 on the first and 2.3 on the latter, anything built today would be a huge step up from these buggy, slow, frustrating phones. Hence, the bar was low -- I really wanted something with a keyboard, but my main requirements were that the phone was inexpensive, had a quick processor, and a version of Android newer than 4.0 since 4.0 came out over two years ago and 4.1+ includes many improvements. Resigning myself to the fact that prepaid phones with a recent OS (Android 4.1/\"Jelly Bean\" or above) and a keyboard are almost non-existent these days, i decided to go with this phone because it met my requirements *and* was waterproof up to 3 feet -- I'm always worried about getting my phone wet.This phone really surprised me in terms of what you actually get for your money. However, its biggest flaw is its lack of internal storage -- the standard, and uninstallable, Google apps like Chrome (I prefer Firefox), Google+, Hangouts, Play Games, Play Movies & TV, and Play Newsstand take up a huge chunk of storage and cannot be moved to the SD card. You're left with a small amount of space to install apps, and many apps in the play store won't let you move them to the SD card either. So, what does that leave you with? A phone that constantly tells you that there's \"insufficient storage space available\" whenever you try to do app updates.This, in conjunction with developers (including Google) constantly updating apps to stay competitive, means that you really have to be selective about which apps you want on your phone. I've had to uninstall some of my favorite apps, and abstain from installing others, simply because there isn't enough storage space for them. Very frustrating!Note, even if you buy a massive SD card, this problem cannot be rectified. The apps you install -- this is IF they can be moved to the SD card -- still leave a footprint on internal storage. This footprint is much smaller than the app would be if installed completely on internal storage, but 5-10 megabytes is still significant with this phone.Storage issues aside, I really do like this phone. It runs apps smoothly, virtually never crashes, and can be used in the middle of a torrential downpour without issue. How cool is that! It runs Android 4.1.2, which means it has Google Now -- an amazing service that I'd highly encourage getting used to, simply because it can do so much.Call quality is just okay, nothing great. You'll be able to hear the person you called, and they'll be able to hear you -- but you might find yourself asking them to repeat themselves every now and then, and vice versa. The camera takes average pictures, and the autofocus works about as expected.Bottom line? If you're someone who is new to the smartphone world, wants something that can get wet, and plans to install a handful of apps (say, Facebook, Twitter, and maybe a game or two -- and that's it!) you should be perfectly fine. Though, if you find yourself getting addicted to games, and can't seem to stop installing apps (Yelp, Facebook Messenger, Pandora...), look elsewhere -- you *will* be disappointed.

Since he is almost 95% of the time outside in the nature-conditions, it is very likely that his phone will be subject to dirt and water. He has dropped his phones before into machines and deep pools...'breaking' the phone. The same incidents have happened with this phone and yet the phone survived. He can still call after picking it up from a body of water, or nearly being buried in fertilizer. With a strong case, he believes the phone is indestructible, yet only time will tell how well that bodes. So far, all the 'oops' incidents have come and gone and it is still working as if brand new.His previous phones were a variety, but what led him to this was a recent investment into a Kyocera Hydro...that met an unpleasant fate inside a compactor.

Having a tracfone for, oh, like 6 years, it was time to evolve. My older brother, God(dess) rest his soul, was ALWAYS telling my sister we needed touchscreens due to music and photo capabilities. We have been resistant for some unknown reason. I was going to do the metro pcs touchscreen which was like 100 bucks and then 40 a month, like the guy throwing those blue spheres into the walls says, his haircut is boss.....I was in target looking at plans, saw ones costing way more, and the ONLY thing I would of liked on this, but for this price it would of been too much of a giveaway, would of been a FRONT and BACK camera, for skype. That said, I don't want to look at my beautiful girlfriend though a tiny screen, as she usually uses a tablet herself, so that would be too small, so that takes away that con, making this a near flawless cell phone.I then went to radio shack, looked at phones, almost thought of getting a contract plan one, then the nice, helpful lady asked contract or non, and I smartly said non. She showed me the boost phones, this one, which while I was reluctant at target and radio shack, just cause the screen \"wasn't big enough\", lol. A guy thing? I finally broke down and got this. It was on sale for 55,  about the price here new. She asked if I wanted to activate it at home or have her do it, HAVE THEM DO IT. There was no drama beyond having to do some steps more than once, to be expected, this had me walk out with a working phone. GREAT!Where this puppy shines is the apps, of course. with a slew of free apps, I find it pointless to pay for any of them, as I seem to have everything I need and want on here. I got an SD card, 8gig, will get a larger one in the future to have room for all my music, though this will probably be all I need. there is a battery saver app, or something like that, that has extended my phone's life which is awesome, as without it, it will run out quickly, and daily. apps to clean your phone of junk files and stuff, and helping it run faster, gps, music eq, there is one called music player that is a MUST if you have more than one song to put on your phone, as it sorts them and lets you listen while you do other things on your phone, stock music program listening won't allow that, sounds simple, but it was a HUGE LEAP FORWARD when I got that app. there's a nifty super bright flashlight app, even though there is a free one already on the phone, this one is so bright it's almost too bright, which will be very helpful when needed. those are the basics, but you will find others. Like I said, if this review helps one person buy this, great, if not, I'm glad I can write about how much I dig mine. Like I said before though, if you can get this in a store and have it activated before you leave, do it. so for like 120 something I walked out with a new phone and one month paid. 55 dollars a month unlimited everything, more than pcs, but this thing is really fun and it's nice to not have to think about minutes or data or any of that stuff....", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Standard", "Author": "James Tattini Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1IXT3LSODMGRN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a hydro, and thought that the upgrade would offer more.

Also was an Iphone user. Somehow this service does not deliver. It has quite a few glitches. I use online banking. My bank sent me authentication code to my cell that has never came. When I was with Verizon,. I would get text messages from my bank and even authentication code.Boost claimed the problem is not on their end.  As for using yahoo email, one day it worked and it never worked again. I try signing back in to get email through my phone. The only way I was able to get my email is to sign in through the browser. Even then, to send email or receive pictures, took more than 2 minutes. Boost Mobile claims it has APPS that can be downloaded. All which had problems downloading. Text messages: even when on vibrate or silent, would make a noise that received the text. Wi-Fi would automatically turn on by itself. As for visual voicemail, it states the message was received at a certain time but message did not appear til the next day. The alarm clock is terrible.
