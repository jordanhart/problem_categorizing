I've never had a smart phone like this so I'm not sure about all the bells and whistles but what I do see I like. I actually going to buy another one for my teenager because it's such a good price and I don't have to lose to much if she drops it. Anyways, why spend a lot on a phone that's gonna be outdated by the end of the year?", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Dede Sofyan", "ReviewID": "RX14H9B2RFQID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "High quality smartphone,I really like it..I will buy it soonI can browse any sites and using or download any applications with no problem at all", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Used for 2 hours then returned", "Author": "Dave C", "ReviewID": "R1TEI321M6L4K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone since I had had luck with cheaper phones in the past, but this is far from usable as a phone. The 3g function I could not get to work at all, and it would only utilize 2g on my unlimited data plan. If I had it hooked up to the internet via my wifi, pictures, and letters both would take forever to load onto a screen when utilizing an internet browser or an app like Facebook or Instagram.The rear camera claims to be 8mp. It seems to function worse than my 5mp camera on my other Blu Studio 5.0 phone. Somehow every picture turns out grainy and weird looking. The front camera was better than my Blu's though. That is the only positive about this phone, is that front camera is decent, but don't try to use Skype with it, the phone won't load any of it. I believe the processing power in this phone is severely over-rated. The storage is also dismal. The Android operating system takes up about 3/4 of the space on the internal memory, and what is left over will be enough to hold maybe 3 normal apps. Once you hit the limit, you download APP2sd and then move a bunch over to the sd card, but you are still limited as not all apps will move unless the phone is rooted. ALso, once it's full, you can't take any more pictures till you figure out a way to move them to the SD card.This phone was only frustrating to use at best - and I would not recommend it as a cheap phone - as there are different things out there that function better.If you really must MUST have a cheap phone, get an LG Optimus Elite for a similar price. I never had an issue with it and things would load quickly. The processor was better equipped to handle apps and internet data.This phone might function well if it was rooted and ran a different rom, but you SHOULD NOT have to do that just to get a functioning product.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Zion", "ReviewID": "R8PR1WVSCR3GO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually haven't have the phone yet, but hearing all of these bad results are sometimes not right. My friend got this for his birthday and it worked just as good as a samsung galaxy s4, the camera is good, the screen is good, nothing really to not like about this phone. Except the fact that it took so long for the 3G network to work. Otherwise ok I would recommend this phone to anyone who thinks most phones are overpriced and just want a decent 5 inch replacement for a high end phone.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cubot", "Author": "Barrie J.
