{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Phone...", "Author": "S. Allen", "ReviewID": "R2WIOSI4YGJQI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...but there are a few things to be aware of:1) Know Which Hardware Version You're Getting:If you're going to buy one of these, ask the seller which one they're selling to you. Essentially, there's a Chinese version and a Taiwanese version. The Taiwanese version has an inferior display, and generally isn't a good candidate for mod enthusiasts who want to 'root' their phone. Determining the type of Mytouch 4g in one's possession is as simple as looking behind the battery for the \"made in _____\" sticker.I noticed someone gave this phone a one-star review because they got the Taiwanese version and wound up disappointed. I wound up with the China-made version, and my experience has been quite the opposite--it's a wonderful phone.2) \"Stock\" vs Custom Firmware, Battery Life: For the common phone user, the stock software (the rom) on this phone is fairly solid. For android enthusiasts who like their custom ROMs (*cough*, Cyanogenmod, *ahem*), this phone is an absolute beast.From my experience, I've never had any issues with performance or stability with HTC's stock firmware (Android version 2.2 at the time). It is very responsive, and all of my 50+ favorite apps from the Android Market worked very well on it; however, I wasn't very impressed with the battery life (even without any of those 50+ apps installed). For whatever reason, it seems as though there was something slowly, consistently draining the battery--even while leaving it idle and unused.The official, updated 2.3 firmware from HTC supposedly addresses the battery issue, although I've never tested that for myself. After rooting my phone and installing the ever-popular Cyanogenmod firmware (7.10 / Gingerbread), I haven't looked back. The battery life has been incredible ever since. After tweaking a few things, I've been able to leave it on standby for a few days and still have a decent charge left, or use it pretty heavily throughout the day without the need to recharge it.3) My Usual Rant About Other Reviewers:This may or may not contribute to your impression about this phone, but I feel it's worth mentioning (as I usually do for my other product reviews) for the sake of doing justice for a product that gets 1/2-stared for silly reasons.* If you don't like big phones, then the MyTouch 4G probably isn't a good fit for you. Please don't buy a phone with a large display and then complain about its size. It's like buying an SUV and later complaining about the gas mileage or curb weight.* At the time of this writing, this is one of the very few phones with a front-facing camera to be had for under $[...] used. Realistically, most front-facing cameras on any gadget lack the fidelity & resolution of the device's main camera. Like every other phone, this one's front camera was meant for video chat--not professional photo shooting. If you expect more than that, please become familiar with this easy-to-remember formula when buying *anything* in general: \"Features. Quality. Price. Pick two.\" All-in-all, this device is very well-rounded on all three accounts. Yes, of course it could have better [insert xyz] here. But for what I paid for it, it's one of the best phones out there for meeting all of my needs (good hardware specs, video chat, tons of custom roms available, wireless N, nice display, etc, etc.)* From my experience, the speaker quality and volume for this phone is about on par with the previous 4 Android devices I've owned. I don't expect to use the loudspeaker as a noise-maker at a football game, a personal home security alarm, or a replacement for my frequently-used car-horn in crazy traffic. For what it's worth, I can hear my wife/kids/boss/best-buddy/annoying telemarketer from across the room with this phone just fine.* I am reviewing this product in a product review section--completely separate from my experience with the seller I bought it from, and without consideration of the shoddy on-hold phone-based support that most companies provide these days (if they provide anything at all).

I love this phone. I used to help create apps but got out of that, I wanted something relaxing and easy to use that was also fun to use which this does all of. The customization of MyTouch is why you'd even consider buying one in the first place, you can change the entire look of your phone in a matter of seconds which brings new life into it when you're starting to get sick of it.Live wallpaper means the background moves constantly which is cool for newer users (also a batter killer), the video chat can act as a mirror if you're vein like me or of course to chat with friends on Skype or whatever service you use. **Facebook** is embedded in this phone from the phone book to texts, if you use facebook - you'll absolutely love this phone. If you don't use facebook, it's seriously no big deal either way.It's really skinny, light, I've got more compliments on this phone than the Droid X or G2 which both have physical keyboards (I have to say, I miss physical keyboards... you really can type much faster with them).*Under the hood* This is where you want to pay attention because this is the part that really matters. The battery life is so-so, don't expect maricles but it's not bad. The processor is very fast, I have 62 apps, 7 screens of widgets and what not, the security app running, auto-updates and can still watch a youtube video when commuting without any lag which is very important because that means you can have a lot, do a lot, and not suffer for it. I've had this for a year, I also have tons of music on the SD card and about 2,400 pics.. again, no lag ever which this is the only phone to not lock up on me with that much running. Not to say other new phones aren't even faster than this phone, but any higher speeds is called redundant and any current app on the market doesn't need that much speed. When it comes to overclocking the CPU, I have no clue what you're talking about because that's a breach in my contract! I can say this is not a developer phone so if you're looking to make an app in the future, I highly recommend another phone like the G2 which excels at that sorta stuff. The skinny on video quality and pics is very normal for this price range, it's better than the vast majority of phones I see people with but there are better cameras for the same price..but then you dont get certain features this comes with.**2 of the Best Features from this phone** This is my opinion, the 2 best are customization which MyTouch phones are known for and what people dont think about when buying this is that it acts as an access point. If you don't know what that means, it means if you have your laptop at the beach and want to get online but dont want to connect any cords, all you have to do is turn the access point feature on with this phone then your laptop has internet! 4G speeds at least where I live are very similar to cable which is even more fantastic. I truly cant express how great this feature is and the success I've had with it while traveling, no need to use hotels internet or airports. It has security to it just like a router and can have multiple devices connected to it...any device with wifi actually. A lot of people dont get 4G or if they get it, it's not truly 4G so a quick way to find this out is look at a map on tmobile of your area, if it gets 4G.4G is FAST!!! Ok well here's the deal with 4g, It's faster than 3G which we all already know but did you know there still isn't an exact standard for 4G? Make sure you understand this so don't expect to get your first 4G phone then see it's not as fast as someones phone in Orlando (internet speed that is)Enjoy this phone, it's really nice, the price is really good, also I'd suggest you buy it from T-Mobile! Might make sense? If not, Amazon is really great with returns!**This is all based on a year using this phone and years of using Android, since it first came out. Read professional reviews, go to the T-Mobile website, actually see one in person before buying any phone in this price range and tinker with it for at least 5 minutes... you'll be happy you did!**", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, way better if unlocked (rooted)!", "Author": "D. Ford \"Birdman\"", "ReviewID": "R3CMQW0CD2S5FT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so the battery life on this phone is weak if u let it run full blast, with all options etc... enabled, here is what you do: Download SetCPU from the market, now, set the scaling to CONSERVATIVE. Now your phone will not jump wildly from 245-1024 MHz at the slightest processor activity. Experiment with the profiles, you can lower the CPU while the screen is off for instance, i have mine set to 368 MHz whenever the screen is off, and set the priority high. This phone is AWESOME if you have it unlocked/rooted, its functionality and capability are opened wide up for you, just look up the forums on xdadevelopers.c0M THis phone has all the great features mentioned above yada yada, blazing fast in my opinion even having owned an iPhone, this phone opens and page FULLY first before the iPhone does, the iphone loads the 'window\" faster, but the My Touch finishes loading FIRST< ALWAYS  ON EVERYTHING. MY phone has been off the charger now for 17 and a half hours i browsed the net for 20 min, made some phone calls, took some videos and pictures, download some apps, played need for speed shift 20 min. My phone is at 59% after light to moderate use, almost 18 hrs later its not even half battery yet. Now on a HEAVY USE day, i can go all day before having to put it on the charger in the late evening.

It's way faster and the screen resolution is much better, not to mention it's native Android. Mine is using the Cyanogen mod so it's wide open. The screen is pretty sturdy too since it's smaller and stronger.I find the audio quality to be great as well. This phone has about the same dimensions as the iphone so not too big or too small for smooth internet browsing and to hold in your hand. One thing I wanted is a more fine resolution volume setting, the jumps between settings either make music too loud or not loud enough especially since I'm using the Cyanogen DSP audio booster.The front and back facing camera is awesome as well and can be used as a video camera too. Battery life is excellent if you either use the Cyanogen cpu governor and set it to conservative or use dl setcpu from market and do the same thing.I'm using this for t-mobile and consistently get the \"H\" or 4G speeds.

I had a few minor problems that I was able to resolve, but recently this phone has been nothing but a big problem! I don't use very many apps on it nor has it been damaged in any way. I've had to do 2 factory resets on the device recently. It has repeatedly crashed on me in the middle of doing something simple like a text message, it has significant lag time in doing anything, and now there is zero sound from the speaker! It doesn't play sound from a video, a call, a notification, an alarm, nothing! All it does is vibrate. My cell carrier is replacing it for me, fortunately, but I was surprised that these are not available as the exchange piece. I had to get an upgraded phone.

Here is my take on the MyTouch 4G.Pros:-The back 5MP camera with LED flash was pretty decent. I liked the multiple types of video and photo effect that it offers.-Built-in Hotspot feature (requires data plan) that turns your phone into a wireless internet router.-Responsive touch screen and crisp 3.8\" LCD display.-Multiple options for hands-free voice control-Internet surfing was smooth with its large screen-Texting was easier than other touch screen phones due its larger virtual keyboard size (compared to the IPhone) and offers Swype-Built-in / integrated GPS (I realized that you could run GPS apps like \"Navigon\" on the phone without needing a constant internet connection-- unlike others smart phones)Cons:-The phone feels bulky/heavy compared to other smart phones out there in the market.-The camera quality of the front facing camera was pretty \"choppy\" unlike the built in 5MP camera on the back. Don't expect great pictures or clear video conferencing with the front facing camera. I feel like the front facing camera was a \"gimmick\" to sell the phone-- do NOT buy this phone if this is an important feature to you.-Battery life was fair with moderate to heavy use, but should last you a whole day (averaged 4 hours with heavy data usage)-Speakers quality were poor and the ringer volume isn't as loud as other smart phones.Overall:This Android phone is overall great if you are looking for something with a crisp and large display at the cost of size and weight. It could just be me, but I initially had issues connecting to the internet with my data plan (this was however eventually resolved by calling T-Mobile's customer service). The internet speed with my data plan was faster than I expected, but I felt like it was draining the battery too fast. Loading applications were pretty snappy with its Qualcomm 1Ghz Snapdragon processor. Call quality was good, but it needs a better built-in speaker. Overall, I would recommend this phone--- it gets the job done as a smartphone in terms of calling, web browsing, and taking pictures-- but still has some of room for improvements.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Guys be Aware!!!", "Author": "Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R1KLJ6OXS4PIHB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although i didnt buy this item here i just want to make sure all the customers are aware of the QC issue in this phone.

Out of all the smart phones that are available on the market right now, the MyTouch 4G by HTC is a great phone to have if you love to keep up with all of your social networks, and take pictures, or are a business man always needing to check your email.The MyTouch is a very straightforward phone, all of the buttons tell you exactly what you are about to press and are easy navigation. Even though the phone is touch screen, it provides push buttons that let you go: home, back to previous, menu options and easy touch guide. The home button is where all of your main applications are; for example, text messages, Facebook, phone calls, etc., it is where everything is in front of you all at once. Menu option, is the spot where you can find your settings, wallpaper, and edits to your phone.  Everything on your phone is in the palm of your hand at the touch of a button.If you are someone who likes to capture every moment with your camera or video, this phone is perfect. The MyTouch 4G has a great quality camera on the back, and then a front camera for up close pictures; once the picture is taken it instantly shows on the screen for your viewing with no wait time. The camera settings also come with zoom, brightness and contrast, and lots of cool effects like: distortion, greyscale, sepia and many more. It takes it to the next level with being able to video chat with your friends via camera. The storage space for your pictures and videos is close to unlimited; taking pictures is not a problem for this phone because it will keep every moment until you want them to be deleted. Since this phone is one of the recent smart phones it has many new features and applications and many ways to personalize it your way at a reasonable price. It has a mobile store that lets you buy apps for a low price or get some for free; they range from Facebook to keeping up with the stock market. It can keep anyone entertained from little kids playing Angry Birds on their parent's phone to teenagers being bored in class and posting pictures on Instagram. A few of its many features include ways to talk-a-text and blue tooth. Being able to talk-a-text and Bluetooth are very useful when driving so you can use your phone hands free and keep focused on the road. MyTouch is specifically named that to make it \"yours\", the personalization features range from picking the color of your fonts to being able to have a lock background picture and a main page background picture. If you want to compare the price of the MyTouch 4G to the other top selling smart phones, like the iPhone 4s, the MyTouch beats it out hands down. You can buy the MyTouch for $350 at the T-Mobile store; it comes complete with a charger, phone holder, earphones, and car charger, with a warranty that you decide how long. The iPhone 4s is priced at $600 and comes with a charger, the better deal is obvious. There are only two flaws of the phone that people should be aware of, battery life and reception. Once the phone has been used for a while (have had it for two month plus) the battery life begins to get shorter and shorter. It is good to let the phone die once in a while to let it recharge itself, but if you are on-the-go constantly and don't have time to let it die or have it charging all the time, halfway through the day you will see that the battery has withered away and you didn't even realize. Since the MyTouch 4G is only covered and made for T-Mobile, the cell phone reception is not very good. You can be walking and have perfect service, then out of nowhere your call will drop, which can be frustrating and make you want to throw your phone.I would recommend the MyTouch 4G by HTC to anyone who is looking for a small, compact, smart phone with a lot of applications and fun aspects that come with the phone ,while still being able to stay up with your friends and keep you occupied while you are bored.

He immediately informed me that these phones had been previously exposed to water which was identifiable by a \"red\" color changing marker inside the phone. He also immediately noticed that the phones had after market parts including the battery. Then he opened up the phone to discover wires cut, new wires soldered in all over the place, parts missing, and by passes etc... He said the phones were ridiculously used and he refused to repair them or have anything to do with them. He showed me the inside of my phones compared with a new model. Obviously I was scammed. I had him go ahead and open up my husband's phone which was bought at the same time but so far was currently still working and his also was horribly rigged inside. The repair man said he had never seen phones in such bad condition on the inside, he was surprised they even worked at all. On the outside they looked new. Of course it's past the return/refund date so I won't get reimbursed but I at least can leave this review to warn others. I looked extensively through the reviewers comments and at the time of purchase no one said anything about used phones being passed off as new. Buyer beware!!

I ordered the phone in time to arrive for a busy weekend when I would need a reliable phone.  Unfortunately, the phone did not ship until after it was due to arrive.  The seller printed the printing label however did not drop the package off until after it was due to arrive, thus causing the phone to arrive a week after I needed it.  I will not order from this seller again.Regarding the phone:I have had this phone for about 2 weeks now and find it more than capable of handling my cellphone needs.  Let me be clear though, I am a modest cellphone user.  I primarily use the phone to take pictures, text, gchat, facebook, gps, online searches, and listen to music.  The phone is quite competent in addressing all of these needs.  This is my first android phone (I FINALLY upgraded from an old blackberry) however I have found the phone easy to navigate.  Furthermore, I am familiar with Apple products due to owning an iPad.  I did not feel the need to purchase the (in my opinion) over priced iPhone, and after having the HTC MyTouch 4g Android phone, I still stick to my original feelings.  This phone accomplishes all of the tasks that I would have wanted out of any phone, including an iPhone.The major con that I have so far is the moderately short battery life.  For typical every day tasks, I can go easily 24 hours without re-charging.  My typical every day tasks include: texting, listening to music, short conversations (maybe 1 or 2 30-minute convos), gchatting, internet browsing, social networking, and taking a few pictures.  However, I have noticed that if I take a long conversation, 3 hours or more, the phone typically needs to be recharged.

Everything worked like new.After a couple months, though, things just stopped working.**FACEBOOKThe phone tries to 'sync' all your accounts, but it makes doing ANYTHING near impossible, so I turned off the sync.It wasn't until later I realized without the sync, the integrated facebook for mytouch app wouldn't work.I had to go remove my account, and re-add it to get it to work.I like the 'friend stream' app on this phone, but you can't see pictures or videos.The facebook app is okay, but it's a little difficult to navigate.I just like to stick with using the internet browser for facebook.**CAMERAI must say, I LOVE taking pictures, and this phone is pretty good for that.The front facing camera is okay, but of course the rear facing has better megapixels so you get a more clear picture (and flash) that way.The phone itself actually has a dozen different options to edit your pictures.The videos, however, aren't as easy. I have the video set to 720p, so the picture is pretty good (in the light), but the sound is somewhat muffled and far away. Unless the sound is right next to the phone, or the sound is very loud, don't expect to hear much besides static.**OPERATING SYSTEMThis is my BIGGEST complaint. The operating system SUUUUUCKS!!!My phone is CONSTANTLY freezing...for no good reason.Every day, I have at least 2 apps that have to be forced closed because of my phone.If I go into manage applications, and force close apps I left open, it doesn't even make a difference.The screen goes black sometimes, like when I have an alarm set, and the alarm goes off, the screen comes up black and I can't snooze or dismiss, I have to press the lock button twice for the screen to come back. It's not just with alarms, though, it happens a lot.Sometimes, if I try to open an app, my phone will open something else, and I have to restart it to make it stop. You're probably thinking what does that mean? Well, let's say I try to open text messages. I press 'messages', and for some reason, my words with friends app pops up. I press the home button, and try again. This time, my email will pop up when I press messages. I press home and try again. This time my photo gallery pops up. I have no idea why this phone does that, but restarting it fixes the problem (for a little while anyway.)But the most infuriating thing about the phone is that it freezes. I will be on my text messages, with no apps open, and my phone will just freeze. The screen is up and visible, but I can't press anything on screen. I try the home button or the lock button, and still nothing. Sometimes, it will stay frozen for over 5 minutes, in which case I have to take the battery out to get it to respond to my touch. (lol...mytouch.)This happens at least once a day.You might be thinking 'well that phone is over a year old that's why it has so many problems.' WRONG!This is my second mytouch. I got my first one about 1 1/2 yrs ago, and the first one I had was having problems like this one. Silly me, I tried to reset the phone and erase all the data from it (I took out my SD card first), and once the phone turned back on, it was stuck on the 'mytouch' logo for over an hour. After trying to fix the phone using the T-mobile customer support, I sent the phone in. They said if there were water damage, they'd charge me for the new phone, but if not, they'd only charge like $5 for shipping. (of course there was no water damage, so I was happy to start over for $5!!)But my joy didn't last long, because my new phone (less than six months now) started having the same exact problems.**COMPLAINTS**I read some of the other reviews. Yes, this phone is a little big, but IT'S NOT bulky and it's not heavy, which I liked. I'm a woman, and I have small pockets, but my phone still fit in them, along with small pockets in my purse. The speakers on my phone work AMAZING...with playing videos, with music, and with calling (using regular phone calls or skype.) My alarms and ringtones were loud enough for me to hear over 100ft away (at home) so I don't understand that complaint. This phone is ONLY fast when you are on a good wifi connection or have 4G, though. If you are at some random store and can't connect to T-mobile's 4G and the store's signal isn't amazing, don't expect your phone to go very fast. However, I will say when I was in the middle of a small town, I was still able to download apps and surf the web, which was impressive. On the other hand, my calls are dropped all the time, but I've always had that problem with T-mobile, and it's nothing to do specifically with the phone.As for BATTERY life, this phone does pretty good. I am ALWAYS on the internet, taking pictures, calling or texting, or playing a game, but the battery holds up pretty well. I have to charge halfway through the day, but even when I don't, the phone will last about 8 hours straight until it dies. You can't expect INCREDIBLE results if you use it as much as I do, lol.In my experience, this phone is okay (for netflix movies/shows, internet, apps, pictures and music), but it's extremely frustrating and has a lot of problems that need to be fixed.I've addressed all the important issues that I can think of. If you don't care about your phone having issues like listed above, by all means, get this phone. If you are looking for a phone that won't just keep screwing up, keep looking...I will be getting a Samsung Galaxy 3 soon, and I'm hoping that since it's Samsung, it's going to be better quality, but we'll see.If you have any questions, ask me. :)I would have given this phone 1 star, but it has endured quite a bit of usage from me, so I can't say it's a COMPLETE waste.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keypad not Great", "Author": "K.

I'm so glad I purchased it here for the price I got it for.  I've had it for over a year now, and with all the drops it's been through (well now I have a good cover on it) it's still working with no problems.  I actually use this as a pre-paid phone, with the Tmobile pre-paid service.  I just turn on the wifi feature whenever I'm in an area where there is wifi.  So don't let the sales reps tell you otherwise.The only issues I had with this phone were 1) the weight, and 2) the storage space.- This phone was heavier than a lot of other phones I've used.  I'm sure it's the reason why it's such a quality phone, unlike other lightweight phones on the market that can break after just a few drops. However I did have to get used to holding it up for long periods of time--I'm used to it now.  You don't feel it at first, but after 15+ minutes of holding it, you begin to feel the weight of it in your hand and wrist.- I outgrew the storage space after just a few months.  So I invested in a 16GB mini sd card to replace the one that came with the phone.  Also, whenever I install new programs, I go into Settings > Manage Applications, and I switch the storage location for each app from PHONE to SD CARD.Other than that, it's a fantastic phone.  I personally love the Android phone operating system (my previous phone was a 1st gen Tmobile G1 HTC Android phone)... and I love that I get the most updated Android operating system downloads when they are released... so it's like having a brand new phone... never gets outdated.  I'm heavy on social media so I love that I can switch back and forth between apps with ease.  The battery life is great (seems like all day when used minimally).  I take care of my battery by only charging my phone for 2-3 hrs at a time, and unplugging at night.

I call voicemail and have to re-save the first 9 messages before I can get to the new message and the phone screen blacks out.  I have to keep tilting the phone and pecking at it like an idiot to try and hit the right button to save the message before the screen goes black.  Drives me insane.  Then, there is the issue with the phantom text messages.  I'll send someone a text and a few minutes later I'll hear the alert that I have a new text.  I pick up the screen and there is a \"view\" button.  I push the button, but then I have to slide my finger across the screen to open and then I go to the text message screen and there is no new texts.

It arrived a few days before Christmas, so I opened it to make sure everything was there and to charge the battery. I wrapped the box and put it under the tree. When she opened it on Christmas Eve, we installed her sim card and started personalizing it with pictures and ringtones blue-toothed from her old phone. About 2 hours into the customization, I discovered that the phone wouldn't recognize voice inputs as it did when we first turned it on. I figured it was just some issue with the phone's settings that we could fix by reading more into the owner's manual. The next day, my girlfriend tried to make a couple of calls and, each time, the person on the other end could hear nothing.

Since I've heard so much good things about Google operating system I wanted to buy another phone and try it out. I first bought Motorola XT720 with Android 2.1 but realized that the SD memory with over 7gb couldn't be used when downloading apps from Google market!? So I ran out of memory after using up only few thousand megabytes of the phone memory.  There were other flaws such as not being able to create Yahoo email accounts for quick viewing of all the email accounts with out loging in and loging out with each email. Whereas iPhone you can have Gmails and Yahoo mails accounts and I have over 15 email accounts in which you can see it all at once.  I returned the Motorola and got my Mytouch 4g just two days ago and so far I'm loving it!  I say so far because who knows what will pop up after playing with it for awhile like I did with the Motorola.  Anyway, I checked the user reviews for this phone prior to purchasing and that the consensus was that it is a good phone but has couple of complaints such as speaker volume.  Sure enough, after trying it out, the speaker is really poor compared to the Motorola I had. The Motorola had dual speakers and this Mytouch only has one so when you're in a semi-loud environment you really can't hear too well even the volume is up all the way. Another complaint was the face to face video calling but I haven't used it yet and I'm not that much concern about it since not too many people have that capability on their phones so I don't need that feature at this time.  Otherwise, everthing else seems to work just fine.  I love the camera with flash and the video recording comes with flash light so you can record in the dark! I will continue to update if I see anything else I need to mention as I get used to using this phone more.Edit: December 13th, 2010I've been using this phone now for little less than a month and I'm changing my opinion from loving it to just liking it.  The things I really like about this phone so far are that what I mentioned before, camera and apps from Google.  Also, this phone does allow you to create more than one email accounts from both Yahoo and Gmails.  So I'm able to see it all at once since I have over 15 email accounts. It is, however, not as good as my iPhone 3G.  It seems to be much slower in retrieveing all the emails compared to my iphone and it's not clear cut looking either.  Ok here's the one MAJOR reason that I had to drop the star rating from 4 to 3 stars on this phone, and that is the battery life is ridiculously WEAK!  I thought my iPhone 3g was weak but it still isn't that bad compared to Mytouch 4G!  It is a pet-peeve of mine with a weak battery life on any phones, the CNET review says 4 to 5 hours of talking time but I really didn't even come close to using it that much.  I tried using the battery saver apps such as killer apps and juice saver apps but none helped at all!  I barely use it for no more than an hour of talking then did some internet surfing for couple of hours and my battery had drained more than 40%???  This is after fully charged!  So now I have to charge this phone about twice a day if not more!  I don't know if it's the battery that might be defected or not but it's a brand new phone and battery and I'm not about to go and spend another $40 for a new battery to see if it's defected or not.  Another flaw detection is that when I am sending some old photos from my laptop to my emails so that I could downloaded to this phone's gallery but it wouldn't do it???!!! I never thought this would be an issue?  This phone doesn't have a selection of which to download into the gallery format!  So the photos are just stuck there in the format under the email I sent and if I need to view it, I have to open that email and view it from there.  This is a major problem for me.  I will keep this phone and will be purchasing iPhone 5G when it comes out next year.Edit: 12/18/10Previously I complained that there was no selection in downloading the pictures from the email to the gallery on the phone and that is still true.  However, about couple of days later I found that the photos were there in the gallery??!!  It took about few days before it actually got into the gallery?  There obviously is some sort of delay effect.  I'm happy that it did get to be downloaded into the gallery but it's annoying still to think that it took so long for it to do it.  Strange.
