Also I don't think BB phones should be compared with iPhones because they are totally different devices.If you don't feel ready to jump directly to a touchscreen phone this is your perfect fit. If you work with emails, web browsing on the go, documents edition and so forth, again this is the perfect match. People's complains about the lack of apps as the BB's weakness have been solved since the new OS was released a couple weeks ago. Now you can install Android apps without a problem directly on your BB10.For me, this is the perfect combination between a powerful working tool, and an excellent entertainment device. You can watch movies from your phone directly to your HD TV with one touch and many other things.This is a great phone.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Clearly not a \"new\" phone", "Author": "Teresa Lockhart", "ReviewID": "R1LNK27JOAORH5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item is sold as a new item, However it has Verizon logo and did not have all the components that are supposed to be in the box.
