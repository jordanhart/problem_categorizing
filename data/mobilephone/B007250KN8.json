{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Solid Choice If You Want A Physical Keyboard", "Author": "Robert I. Hedges", "ReviewID": "R165SEQO204TIB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently started having reliability problems with my iPhone 4 and examined my options. I had had a very early Droid and I liked its flexibility and ability to be configured more easily than the iPhone. I also never liked my iPhone's virtual keyboard for texting. With those things in mind I looked into recommendations of consumer magazines and bought the Samsung Stratosphere.The phone has good and bad points like almost every electronic device. The interface is generally good, though it is now harder to tailor than earlier Androids in my opinion. The display is gorgeous, and I found the camera and video to be good. I thought the Internet interface worked great, and call quality and clarity were both good. I also like the flexibility that the SD card provides. The physical keyboard is a very nice feature (and was the primary driver of my selection of the Stratosphere,) and though it's not as comfortable to use as an older LG I had, it's satisfactory. The balance of the phone with the keyboard extended is awkward however, and the physical requirements of the keyboard make the phone notably thicker and heavier than the competition (especially when compared to the new iPhone 5.) The battery life is nothing to write home about; you might want to pack a spare battery if you travel and are a heavy cellphone user. For me the biggest single negative was the contour of the phone itself: it is very curved and has highly profiled edges making it easy (very easy) to drop, though some cases may help this. I dropped my Stratosphere more times in the first week I had it than I dropped my iPhone in over two years.Ultimately after using the Stratosphere for ten days I reevaluated it and decided I wasn't going to be happy with it so I did something I didn't think I would do: I returned the Stratosphere and got a new iPhone 5. Though I don't love the iPhone 5 (though I like it better than the 4,) I do prefer it to the Stratosphere overall (though call clarity is worse on the iPhone) due to it being so much thinner and lighter. I miss the physical keyboard, but I don't regret making the swap.The bottom line is this: if you want a Droid and you want a physical keyboard, this is a very good choice, just realize it's noticeably heavier and clumsier to handle than some of the competition.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Teacher", "ReviewID": "R3EZWGE6IM1FES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone came in great condition and was exactly what I ordered.  The Samsung Stratosphere is a great phone that is very similar to the IPhone in that it is very quick and has all the apps.

The first one I had new stopped working when using wireless, it would only work on the 4G network.  My carrier replaced it with a refurb.  Now, just outside it's warranty, it deletes photos randomly off the SD card.  I've replaced the SD card and it still randomly deletes pictures and files.  Once a day on average it freezes up and I have to take the battery out to restart it. Sometimes it just shuts off for no reason. It deleted downloaded music. I've performed a full factory reset, which only partially helped.  The slide out keyboard (which is the reason I chose this phone in the first place) is buggy.  Avoid this phone at all cost.  I am stuck with it until I can do an early upgrade with my carrier several months from now.

While I'll be the first to admit it leaves some room for improvement, I also don't believe it deserves all of the criticism it has received.I write this review as a vanilla reviewer of the phone at factory specs, essentially as it is out of the box (with a few apps ignored/uninstalled). My phone is a about fifteen months old at the time of writing. It has kissed the pavement or tile floors nearly a dozen times. I assume at least partly due to those impacts, it has some glitches. These may also be due to OS updates or app updates that aren't tailored to the device however.First, the bad. With factory battery, again after multiple drops on very hard surfaces, the Stratosphere sometimes does not update notifications through any wireless network in a timely fashion. However, it WORKS through wireless, just sometimes it doesn't get messages or application notifications as quickly as I'd expect - meaning something I see in my email might not show up for a few hours. Whether this is important to a user is up to that consumer. New, with factory battery, I got about a day and a half's use out of it. This life can be increased by installing other applications that lower the screen brightness - in fact I think that should be mandatory on these phones, considering my 2nd generation iPod touch still has a dimmer screen setting than this phone even after installing a 3rd party app.Part II coming soon.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reconditioned, But Perfect Otherwise", "Author": "Michael Miller", "ReviewID": "R3PMOL8E25B4VQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this unit at a great discount.

The phone was great at first. About six months later,I started having problems with it shutting off periodically for no reason or losing internet connectivity. The only fix was to pull the battery and put it back in. Then, starting a couple of months ago, the battery won't charge. I tried different wall sockets, a new battery, etc., but no change. It has the \"critically low\" message, but when I plug it in, even though it says charging the and the little lighting bolt shows on the battery indicator, it doesn't charge. Soon as I unplug it, it's right where it was when I plugged it in. I cant use it unless its plugged into my car charger, or sometimes, plugged in at home. Naturally, it's just out of the warranty period and my upgrade isn't due until July. I have looked online and this phone has pages of reviews with the same issues.

This morning it about got thrown away.  The only way to make it stop is to take the battery out (then what good is having a phone if you can't have it on), he turned it off 3 times and it would just turn itself back on, but at 4am you don't want to constantly hear the dinging noises it makes.My battery will only last 9 hours on a good day, his can go pretty much 20 hrs sometimes, even though mine has MUCH less apps on it than his and is pretty much only used for texting and occasional cking of emails.I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone that plans on having it for more than a year.

Take a free replacement phone of Verizon's choice (not mine) and extend my warranty for two years; i.e. be locked into another phone that I do not want.2. Pay hundreds of dollars for a certified pre-owned phone to carry me through the two-month gap remaining until my next contract upgrade date.  Either keep this (older model, NOT NEW) phone and do not renew/extend contract or spend more money to get the new phone of my choice at a discount and extend my contract for another two years.The options made available to me by Samsung:1. Send the phone back for repair (and pay for the repairs) - this will take a minimum of 2 business days plus shipping on both ends, and a loaner phone would NOT be made available, so I would have no cell phone during this week+.Which of these options makes sense to you as a consumer?  None really.  Why not get someone at Verizon Wireless to actually get off of their 'scripts', think outside of the box and realize that it wouldn't take much to keep this customer (of over 20 years) happy by just moving the two-year upgrade date up by a mere two months.  I would happily extend my contract in exchange for a new, discounted phone of my choice.There must be major changes made to the way the largest carriers do business, if they intend to stay in business.  As for me, I will be looking for a more flexible option for now, NOT renewing my contract (on my phone number - I have three phones on my account) and seeking alternatives for my wireless service in the future.Oh, and be cautious of any Samsung cell phone - I believe that there is an inherent weakness in their charging port (inside the phone) - the Verizon Wireless tech even told me that all Android phones seem to have this problem, as well as security/app issues.I'll be switching to an iPhone.

I bought this about five months ago and a little bit less for it than it is currently priced (re-furbished).  If you compare it with today's phones, you will hate it.  However, if you are looking for a cheap 4G phone with a keyboard and don't need to install alot of apps and games, this is an affordable option. This runs on the Verizon network so if you have unlimited data on Verizon still and are looking for a replacement 4G phone to swap a broken phone, this is one of the few options available. However, do note that Stratosphere have several known problems:  the charging ports frequently malfunction so buying a second battery and external charger is essential and since accessories for this phone may not be around for much longer, I would recommend you do so at the beginning.  I recommend getting a case for it as well as this phone has a slippery back on it.As other reviewers have noted, this does not have the best battery life, depending on your settings. However, I can get a full day and sometimes a day and half with the right settings.  Disabling Wi-fi when not using it and disabling  the \"Notify me when networks are available\" and disabling \"auto connect\" under wifi settings are some of the best ways to save battery life.  Like wise, disabling bluetooth settings, disabling animation, and dimming the display and enabling power saving mode help also.The keyboard is great. One of the best on any phone I have a had on any phone.  The phone itself is very sturdy but a case is recommended.It has a slot for an extermal card. You will need one = there is not enough storage space.  The camera is not the best and it does not compare well with newer phones. (I had several LG feature phones before I had a blackberry and the stratosphere and both the older LG phones took far better pictures.Note that it is a verizon phone so it comes with bloatware (including an NFL app)  and it is impossible to remove.It does have an task manager built in that lets you close apps and clear memory. I do so about every other day to ensure I have the most memory available.  Like most smart phones, it is important that you clear out your internet data using the settings menu in the browser daily as this helps the browser run faster.It appears that cases, chargers, screen protectors and batteries are still available for this phone.

The battery life far outpaced other smartphones at the time and I liked the slide out keyboard. Over time, I relied on the keyboard less and less, so it became less important.

The phone would be drained in about 3 hours. And that was after I went through and turned off everything I could. Late in the game, the phone got so bogged down that using data became nearly impossible. I learned to stay logged out of Facebook entirely, which meant no more picture sharing. I couldn't stand making phone calls on it because I could never hear the person I called. I assumed that was all cell phones.

McDowell \"elefanlisa\"", "ReviewID": "R2EN9SBIZIXCX5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone new from a Verizon store in January or February 2012.  It worked well at first.  I liked the keyboard.  I've now gotten a used iPhone 4 3G and what a difference.  The Stratosphere was freezing every day in apps and sometimes would just suddenly restart on its own.  The battery got hot quickly if any apps were running.  I had issues with the bluetooth connection in my car.  I couldn't tell if it was the car or the phone, but now that I've had the iPhone I know the issue was with the phone.  The iPhone always connects.  I'd set the Stratosphere to have the Bluetooth on and the next time I got in the car it would be off again.  I'm prone to dropping things so I always get cases for my phone, but this one kept freezing so I'd have to take off the case, then the back, then take out the battery, but it back in, put the back on and the case on and turn it on again.  I also had issues with memory usage.  I couldn't keep much on the phone before I had to delete pictures.  Therer were some game apps that came with the phone that used up a lot of space that I didn't want and I'd delete them, but they'd automatically get installed again.  That's stupid.  If the program isn't required to run the phone, the user should have the option to permanently delete it, especially when the phone has a very small memory.  I had issues with the signal in my building at work.  Now, the iPhone also struggles to get a signal, but I've already seen it has better luck than the Stratosphere did.  The Stratosphere was also very slow with game speeds and got slower and slower and I learned that this meant the phone was about to freeze and sometimes would just set it aside to cool down.  The battery life was poor.  I carried a wall charger in my purse in case I needed to charge it and almost always had it plugged into the car charger when I was driving.  I had issues with the keyboard sliding out.  After a while it wouldn't slide out 100% like it did at first.

What we got was a phone that is a buggy mess on a good day, and unusable on a bad one. If you must have the physical keyboard, this phone has a great one. It feels good, the buttons are a perfect size, and require just enough force to press that you wont accidentally be punching in letters, but you wont be straining your fingers with them either. That is where the good news ends. I will start with minor bugs and problems and escalate to larger ones:1. The touch screen is so sensitive you will frequently launch apps or cause some sort of input by simply brushing the face of your phone against your sleeve, pocket, etc.2. You CAN NOT multitask. Having more than one or two apps open causes serious slowdown.3. During normal use, you will get about 6 hours of battery life out of a full charge while on a 4g network.3. Common and non system-intensive apps frequently crash, freeze, lock up the entire phone or just don't work properly.4. Sometimes, and I mean at least once a day on a good day, the phone will just up and turn off.5. This has become more common lately but started off somewhat rare, but it will occasionally suddenly lose all signal and will not ever find it again until you reset it at least once. And by reset, I mean take out the battery, because 9 times out of 10, using the power off feature will just cause the phone to hang at a blank screen with the soft keys still lit up. Today I have removed the battery to reset the phone because of this problem 12 times.If you have an ounce of tech savvy, stay far far away from this one. If you like having apps that function properly, stay far far away from this one. If you like having a phone that works as a phone and can keep a cell signal reliably, stay far far away from this one. If you want a phone that isn't loaded with shovelware garbage apps, well, I guess stay far far away from verizon...If you want a $200 post-it note you can carry in your pocket with a nice built in keyboard, this is the phone for you. Oh, but don't have any other apps running while you are trying to type your notes out.

It's definitely a bit heavier and bulkier than other phones, but I like the keyboard option. It does freeze up from time to time and can be a bit slow on start up, but otherwise I'm happy with it. I did have to purchase a refurbed replacement b/c I didn't get insurance on it & the first one stopped charging on me after about a year of use.

Excrutiatingly slow internet, which would drain about half of your battery life before your page would load. I guess the best word to describe it's calling capabilities is 'laggy'. I would hit the call button, and about 3-4 minutes later, it would start dialing. I had to factory reboot this phone once before, and shame on me for not saving all of my contacts. I lost everything. Yesterday, it just froze and shut off out of nowhere and I cannnot get it to turn back on. Mind you, this is almost 2 years after I got it, and 20 days prior to my upgrade date. So, I have no phone because this hunk of junk decided to crap out on me. I have known 3 or 4 other people who bought this phone, and they have either traded it in for something better (anything is better, really)or are still putting up with its shortcomings. All in all, there are much better phones out there, so don't buy this, unless you have an over abundance of aspirin and patience like a saint.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$100.50", "Features": "The Samsung Stratosphere SCH-I405 is a 4G LTE Android smartphone featuring a full QWERTY keyboard, 5-megapixel camera, and front-facing camera\nThe Stratosphere also comes equipped with a Super AMOLED 4-inch display, Bluetooth 3.0, and Wi-Fi with DLNA streaming and Wi-Fi Direct\nOther features include GPS, capacitive touchscreen, and support for multiple languages including Spanish\nOffers access to thousands of apps, games, books, movies, and music available on the Google Play Store\nThis product has been extensively tested, is certified to be 100% functional, and ready for activation", "Name": "Samsung Stratosphere I405 4G LTE Verizon CDMA Android Slider Phone - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CGyvAVDRL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007250KN8"}}
