Clark", "ReviewID": "R309VZ2R2IQ8WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is NOT a smartphone.  You will never want to connect to the internet with this phone!  This phone, however, is great for anyone who wants good call quality, a reasonably sized querty keyboard for texting and low cost cell phone/texting.  I purposely bought this model, because the keyboard is a little bit bigger than some.  The one I  bought has Verizon service.  -The C means CDMA.  This may depend on your zip code when you set it up.  If you buy minutes online at Net10, you can get about 1500 minutes for $100.  That is a great deal for my parents, who are not huge cell users.  They spend about $15 a month with Net 10, and since their minutes roll over, they have about 5000 minutes on their phone right now!  Same with my mother in law.Net10 pay as you go tip, never buy a used phone, and you will greatly reduce your chance of having problems!  This advice does not apply to smart phones bring your own phone.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Ns", "ReviewID": "R67R9BTO2OIF4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ringtone could be louder.
