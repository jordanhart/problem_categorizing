So I bought this hoping it was the real phone.The phone works well 90% of the time. Twice I have had to shut it down and restart it because the screen froze. Tells me it's not going to last verry long. The Battery is terrible seems to lose it's it's charge way to quick. I have lost operation of the phone twice now and that never happened with my last phone. It would take a couple days to lose it's charge. This one Every night loses it's charge. Tells me it's not going to last very long. The color of the Battery cover does not match the phone. Tells me this is not factory new and I thought I bought a new phone. Lied. The return button is different symbol than it is supose to be. Maybe got mixed up with pieces off a phone in a different company. VERRY DISSAPOINTED!  Will probably never use AMAZON again.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very dissatisfied", "Author": "klmccrary \"klmccrary\"", "ReviewID": "R17ABTOLQD1KB7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone didn't even last a year.

I can't send and receive pictures, this model is not as updated as the A767 which is the phone I wanted.  Too many buttons on the front of the phone lead you to Java and I'd rather have buttons that are more useful to me on the front of the phone.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Satisfied!!!!!!", "Author": "Topdog9311", "ReviewID": "R1YXAH5WWVKD3X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone NEW at the first of January, here we are going into the first of March and the phone no longer works properly. It has given me a number of problems. I would not be upset if this were a USED phone I purchased! I checked with my service provider and all is well on their end so the problem is with the phone I purchased.

Caro \"Mikey\"", "ReviewID": "R1E2E20YRALER5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is into talking and texting on the cell phone. She wants no smart phone. Just a simple talk and text phone with a qwerty keypad and internet connection if so desire. She also loves the slider part of the phone which makes it more compact and hides her qwerty pad when not in use. Great phone for the money!", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "overall good phone", "Author": "jamesm", "ReviewID": "R2T5JO1EX22N4C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good phone. The sound is great. But for messaging it is not so good. The problem that i have is the keyboard buttons are to small and jammed together, which is a problem for a person like me who has big fingers.Every other feature on the phone is really good though.It has a good bit of memory for holding songs and games or videos.The screen is bright and vibrant. Quite a few times i have used it as a flashlight when the power goes out. The camera is nothing spectacular but it does the job.The battery life is decent about 4 days on average for me. Overall it is a good phone.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "almost looks smart!", "Author": "Adolpho", "ReviewID": "RJ5V46FT2U3RX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't use a smart phone, but using my regular phone to text was starting to become a problem.  When I have to do 4-4 4-4-4 to say hi, it's just too much, and then when I started typing like that well, 4-4-4 8  9 2 7-7-7-7  8 6-6-6 6-6-6  2-2-2 7-7-7 2 9-9-9-9 9-9-9.  I like the full keyboard on this phone, because I don't have to make as many strokes to say the same thing, and it looks like a blackberry, only blue...is that a blueberry?", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty good phone for texting.", "Author": "JohnKes \"John K.\"", "ReviewID": "R3CVDDYE4OGBEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good phone for texting.  It has a nice keyboard, and a 1.3 MP camera.  The first one that came had a bad MicroSD slot.  Cellular Gallery Inc. was really good about sending a replacement.  They even pretested the MicroSD slot before sending it.  This replacement unit works great!A small snag - AT&T; needed to enter the serial number into their system before the SIM card would work.  That necessitated a trip to the AT&T; Store.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for Non-Smartphone Users", "Author": "S.

I've had it for nearly two years. The sound works well(or used to) and the camera's not so great, but acceptable. The browser is not great but not horrible. the messaging is pretty good, and the call quality is great. The battery is normal. It usually runs out after a good deal of heavy web browsing or messaging or camera use. However, you are a parent looking for a cell phone for your teen or tween, I would recommend this phone.

It was the best phone I ever had, so I was happy to get another just like it, but in this wonderful blue!  The color is soooooo pretty!!!!  It's a beautiful metallic sky blue.  I personally hate smart phones because all I care about is texting anyways, and this suits my needs (weird for a 26 year old to say, but I hate smart phones!)  Also, the slide feature is a plus to me.  I love the squareness of this phone.
