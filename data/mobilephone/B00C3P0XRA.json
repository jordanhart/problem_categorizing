Este es un tel\u00e9fono b\u00e1sico muy bueno. Muy f\u00e1cil de usar y la calidad de voz es asombrosa. Puesto que es un tel\u00e9fono desbloqueado, lo prob\u00e9 con AT&T; y TMobile y funciona muy bien.

(Even for Today) \"Edited\"", "Author": "DB62", "ReviewID": "R3V7V6BSLM11AA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excluding the i-phone, there are 2 name brands I consider better than the rest.In my opinion, both Samsung and Motorola make the best quality cell phones.Now for the Samsung C414M, this is a very well built phone, yet still sleek but not to small.I prefer a flip phone, or clam shell type (whichever you like to call them).I have no need for a smart phone, as I only use this phone, as a phone.The camera and other features are simply a bonus, that I'll never use.This C414M has very good battery life, the display is very clear and easy to read.The menu is intuitive and easy to navigate.The sound quality is very good to excellent, and the ringing sound is plenty loud.This is a 3G phone, so again, the sound quality is just great in my opinion!Even with only one or two antenna signal bars showing, my calls are fast, and clear as a bell.This phone does not come with a MicroSD memory card.You can add one for a small cost. I've ordered a SanDisk Ultra MicroSD.I've been using SanDisk memory cards of all kinds, for many years, with \"0\" failures.SanDisk makes some of the fastest memory cards in the market today.The only thing I would have liked included, would be a car charger, but no biggy there.This phone comes completely unlocked, to use with most any GSM network (AT&T;, T-Mobile, ect...).Just pop in your own SIM card and your off.Edit:This phone is very cement unfriendly!!! lolThe surface of this phone is fairly slippery, so add that to it's slender size, and it's easy to drop! Mine has kissed concrete 5 times, the 5th time, it just stopped working. So now I'm using a Rugby 2, and love it.In the end, this is a top notch phone, easy to program/setup, easy to use, and looks very sharp. High quality!It does have web browsing, picture & video, email, and texting capabilities.At the price Amazon's selling these for, it's by far, more than a good deal!In fact, I'm going to buy a second one as a spare.All I'd need to do to use it, is swap my SIM card.I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a simple & easy to use phone.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good basic phone w/ a few more bells than I expected", "Author": "Mark D. Gordon", "ReviewID": "R3RK3GFH614OFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good basic phone w/ a few more bells than I expected.  Camera & MP3 player are serviceable.  Built-in software can render text and word documents.  \"Operating System\" is easy to use even w/o looking at the downloaded pdf manual.  Had no trouble moving files from the phone to the microsd card.My biggest complaint is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack.  The supplied headphones use the micro usb port.  Samsung Canada does not have any information on accessories for this phone.  I'm still looking for a micro usb to 3.5mm adapter that is made for this phone.  Will probably take a chance at one of the ones I've seen on Amazon that are not specifically for this phone.I guess that makes my 2nd biggest complaint being the manual doesn't list or make mention of accessories particularly to utilize the micro usb but even to recommend they type of microsd card to use9/7/13 - quick update. I did find that \"B004T6N67K - New Samsung Micro USB To 3.5mm Headset Adapter With BONUS 3.5mm Stereo Headset Popular High Quality\" worked as a micros usb to 3.5mm Adapter.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good simple phone that works", "Author": "No time for a rocking chair in retirement", "ReviewID": "RZWND49ZTDSB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this one to replace an older flip phone. We travel internationally so it is good to have one I can use with an inexpensive SIMM in a foreign country and have local phone access there. It has a screen you can see when it's folded so you know who's calling without opening it up. The sound is good. It takes decent pictures. I had to call Samsung tech support to figure out how to get the pictures to save to the mini SD chip I put in it. They were immediately available and helped me solve the problem. If you want a simple phone, this is a good choice. I don't use the internet on my phone so I can't say how it works that way. I use it with a prepaid $30/month unlimited talk & text plan from H2Owireless (www.h2owirelessnow) and it works great for not much money.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Sudarshan Ravichandran", "ReviewID": "R1QEMDIJJ42E51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

I traded our wireless phone company telephone for this one. The sim card went in without a problem and telephone works as it should. It is user friendly and the keys are just a little bit larger; just the way I like them without making it look like a phone for kids or one for the visually impaired. I do not like the newer touch screen phones and need a phone that will stand up to my use. The phone folds and the exterior is kind of tough which is very important to me. The photos it takes are of decent quality suitable for my use of the camera. Though it is user friendly it could be a little easier to use which is why I gave it four instead of five stars. If you are looking for a phone with a camera, decent sized buttons, internet and is text user friendly this one is for you.
