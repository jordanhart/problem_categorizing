If you connect the phone it works perfectly, but even if you download a program it goes off, I reset it a couple of times but the problem continues. I really don't know what to do any suggestions?

The UI of the phone appears to be tuned to hard-core \"Blackberry nerds\", and not casual users.  Basic settings like the ring tone require navigating a twisty maze of menus and options buried under an application icon.The worst UI flaw of this phone is the way applications are left in -exactly- the state they were in when you last used them, even if that state is useless or confusing.  Left a menu popped open when you exited?  It's still popped open when you come back, blocking access to what you're after.  Browsing photos last time you used your camera?  Now you've got to explicitly exit browse mode before you can take a picture.  This may sound like a minor detail, but trust me, in overall use it makes the phone very confusing and frustrating to use.While the call quality on the phone is generally good, it would mysteriously shut off the radio occasionally, making sure you don't receive calls.  By default, the \"switch phone profile\" control is on a side button that's easy to hit by accident, frequently shutting the ringer off and insuring you miss lots of calls.  Bluetooth access was never reliable.My wife was really interested in browsing the web phone the phone, but the web browser is a huge disappointment - it looks like something out of the 1990s.  Unless the web site has a specially designed \"mobile\" page, you can expect trashed formatting, difficult navigation, and very slow response.I think the Blackberry was a hot item ten years ago, but the iPhone has raised expectations far beyond what it accomplishes now.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "The phone was old and looks horrible", "Author": "Maria I.

As you can see in the beginning of the video, the battery is not an original BB one. The product page clearly stated the item for sale was a new one.Initially the phone constantly turned off without reason. A day after activating it the phone simply got incapable to do anything useful (Please see the rest of the video). We have tried with several SIM from different providers to no avail.I paid $169 believing that I will get a new, fully functional Blackberry smartphone without any defects, so I could not be more dissatisfied.Will file a claim to get a refund,  trusting that Amazon will do the right thing as always have done during our long time as customers. In any case Amazon should be more careful with the mercahants allowed to use its site, to not get caught into these situations.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Be sure yours is new!!!!!!", "Author": "Gregorio Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R2Q11X6C6TP5AF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was advertise as new and it was USED, btw a lot.I returned it same day I received it.

THE ONLY REASON that I didn't purchase the phone directly from AT&T;, was because it was a gift to my niece.  She had been involved in an accident and her cell phone was damaged, and no longer worked.  As with many young people today, this situation was extemely disrupting to her and her communication of friends, network.  Her current contract with not up for renewal and thus she was left without a phone.When I was asked to help, I stepped in and took all of the details of her request to assist in getting her another cell phone.  Being a long time customer of Amazon, my first (and last) choice was to view the sight.  I was very excited when I found (what I thought was the perfect match) the cell that she wanted.  I purchased the phone and had it delieverd directly to her.  Between 24-72 hours later, she contacted me to relay that the phone wasn't exactly what she wanted nor did it have the features on it that AT&T; phones (of which I thought that I was purchasing one in the same AT&T; compatible phones!) and that it (the phone) was more compatible to another company/brand.I asked for some assistance and was not pleased with the seller's response to \"Only assist\" in bringing in the phone closer to an AT&T; model/compatable celluar.  Bottom-line........I ended up purchasing (on my AT&T; account) another cell phone for her.  The one that I purchased from Amazon.com, was put back in the box and set aside.Larry T.
