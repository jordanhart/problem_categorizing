Android is great!", "Author": "Jairo Nunez \"Alejofly\"", "ReviewID": "R2YAZCN7AG7CO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a deep research on the internet about new phones, i decided to change mi Great Nokia 5800 for an android based phone.  Galaxy Ace was the best Cost-Benefit choice.  Big challenge for me to change my Symbian system, because use to be really stable and well done.  Comparing the experience with symbian and nokia phones as a reference, the change to Android is awesome.  You can feel the difference due to the best hardware set up... 800Mhz processor and 277MB RAM memory.  Both, SO and processor make a huge difference.Looks great, big screen (quick response, sensitive), Light, fast... really fast, with the android market ant thousands of apps, many of them free.Only one big issue:  battery life.  I have been trying to configure it to get the best battery performance, but until now... no more than One day using randomly the wifi to be synchronized and using the web.  For me, is not a big deal because i use to work close to my office, so i have the opportunity to recharge it during the day easily, but for those people working without an energy outlet close, and forced to use data connection all the time,  this phone will be a problem.  .  That is why i am not giving the 5 stars; but could be a nightmare for another kind of phone users. That problem is suppouse to be improved with the new Gingerbread firmware, which i am waiting for (samsung announce it few days ago).If you get this phone, charge the battery for the first time at leas 12 hours.  Does not matter if the phone announce the full charge, that issue makes a huge difference with the battery life.  For some reason, even with the full charge activated on the screen, the battery will continue receiving charge and increasing the usage of the battery.I am impressed about how easy is the synchronization with google software:  calendar, gmail, docs, etc and also with facebook and tweeter accounts to get information of your contacts.Very nice and powerful phone.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Andriod phone for the Price", "Author": "A.

Almost everything works fine out of the box.Android market is full of some good apps. Plus if you are adventurous you can build your apps with Android SDK. They have plenty of documentation and examples.Only issues so far. The battery seems to last (less as per my expectations) only for 1.5 days with little (1.5hour) wifi and 2 hour talk time (I use loudspeaker so this might be more if you don't) and 2.5 hours of games. Could not get gingerbread installed via Kies (might use 3rd party ROM flashers, Odin??,  which seem to be available in plenty)Note this phone ships from outside US. As advertised you have no warranty and US Samsung customer support won't help as it is a non-us device. So wrt tech help you might be on your own. Or buy the warranty version.Could not get GPS to work as of now. Need to understand all the settings.Pluses.. awesome screen with no lag. Android community for support and development.Love it and would recommend if you are looking for a cheap unlocked phone.Update:  Got gingerbread update from Samsung using Kies, so no unlocking or rooting required (will have to see what happens for later Android upgrades). Now the battery has improved significantly. So no qualms for the money spent.  3G speeds from Att&t; in my area are decent, tried gtalk and youtube and multiple app download with no noticeable lag.And writing apps for android is fun!! Wish I had more money to upgrade to more powerful newer phones :(. But no regrets from this one so far!Update: Almost 1 year now after purchase. Upgraded the firmware to 2.3.6 (I know no ICS or Jelly bean). But it does make the phone feel more responsive and snappy.Loving it so far.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "No charger, no earphones", "Author": "Jackie", "ReviewID": "R2FXBT584KRNTX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this cell phone last week. There were different Samsung Galaxy Ace's here at Amazon, and I chose this one because I was going back from my trip and needed the cell phone to arrive at the hotel before check out.My complaint is not about the cell phone itself, but the company who distributes it. INSTRUCTION MANUAL AND WARRANTY CARD ARE IN GREEK OU RUSSIAN (can't tell the difference).I DID NOT RECEIVE A CHARGER OR EARPHONES. I received a box with the cell phone, battery, a white case and USB cable. Nothing else. In the description it says `` Wireless phone acessory``. If this means no charger, then the company should specify it.I don't recommend buying from this seller. There are other Galaxy Ace's here that cost maybe 10 dollars more, might take longer to be shipped, but will come with all the accessories it should and in English.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stay away from Samsung phones!", "Author": "G.

The phone is great... when it works!My phone turns off by itself a few times a day. Even when the battery is fully loaded. I have upgraded firmware and read every support forum out there. No luck.The second phone is even worse. First of all, the touchscreen had serious trouble for a few days. The phone was not usable. This issue got solved, apparently by the firmware upgrade. Then, a couple of weeks later, the speaker went completely dead. This means the phone doesn't ring, alarm clock doesn't work, speaker phone gone, music, everything. I found out that a lot of people are facing this exact same phone with Samsung phones.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good phone for the price", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RHZLS2YQ1EH3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's an Android phone that costs a bit more than 200 (at the time of order). Considering that it's a great phone.The resolution is HVGA (340x480), and while the screen isn't (by far) rich in details, paired with the digitizer (I think that's the name of the capacitive input piece) it provides a very nice touch feedback. I mean, on some low-end phones, the touch feels erratic (I'm looking at you, Galaxy 5), but not on this phone: it's as sleek as it gets on a phone with its limitations. To sum it up, the touch feels very fluid, which is a surprise.The internal storage is _the_ downside of this phone. You will fill it in no time when you start to download many apps, even when you put all of them on the SD card (remember: it still stores some inside).The battery feels \"OK\". Granted, if you do any graphics/CPU intensive --- which is basically any game on this phone --- it will drain fast. But first of all, I don't think this phone is for people who want to game and also demand good battery life. It's a basic Android phone for those that don't want to (or can't) buy subsidized. It also has Gingerbread, which ensures plenty of life time when it comes to apps. And even after that, there are Ice Cream Sandwich ROMs for it (still buggy, give them time...). The phone is good as it is, but it's nice to have the option. If you use all your regular apps and phone calls, the battery will last. Battery is not a problem under regular use.Performance wise, of course there are lags here and there. Ice Cream Sandwich provided a lot of bells and whistles (in this case, a much more fluid UI), and this phone has Gingerbread only (with no official updates beyond that). And... the hardware is very modest. The most impressive stuff is that Samsung made a very good job on this and other phones: it's more responsive than stock Android (I've read about them adding tile-rendering to the browser and other stuff added only later in Honeycomb, not sure about that).The camera is definitely subpar. But it's expected for the price.Considering the price, I give it 5 stars. It's great for people that want a good smartphone and couldn't care less about future updates (it's good enough \"as is\"), all while paying less.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "GOT A STOLEN PHONE SOLD AS NEW BY HASSLEFREE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Aliz0512", "ReviewID": "R2KWBPTENG0SND", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this item (Samsung S5830EUBLK Galaxy Ace Android Powered Smartphone) around February. The condition of the phone was clearly stated as NEW on amazon.com.

By the time I received the phone I had to go on a business trip, so I just reset the phone myself and used it as I urgently needed it. I havent been able to post til now.

VERY SLOW, has some kind of a repeated impulse to continue to bring up certain applications over and over again and not allow you to do anything. The only way to make it stop is to shut the phone off. I have contacted Amazon, Samsung, as well as the seller blutek and nobody can help me. They each say the phone is not in their system and to contact someone else. Very disappointed. I would not suggest ordering a cell phone off amazon. Especially not this one.

It came with Android 2.3, what is fine. I will not talk about the system, only the phone.Galaxy Ace do not runs the most graphical intensive software like some of the 3d games, but its not a high-end phone anyways.The camera has a good quality, with flash. The video recording, despite the initial internet reviews, is NOT limited to 320 x 240, it really goes up to 640 x 480.The touch (multitouch) is flawless, no problems with that. The operations are fast 90% of times, the other 10% are lags that ocurr here and there.I have only two major downsides: first and most important, is the internal memory. A big part of apps still use a good chunk of phone memory instead of the sd card, and soon enough you will see your device bothering about having no space. It needed the double of memory.The other problem is the battery. Run a game and see your battery bar goes down really fast. The battery only lasts if you use it only as a phone.

I am quite pleased with the design, feel and functions. I must confess, I'm a Samsung fan but I moved to this from a Nokia E71 which was rock solid functional with excellent battery life but the online experience was a bit clunky and limited by the screen size. Now I have far more screen real estate and online connection is seamlessly smooth with no pauses to ask permission etc.Phone is quite light and I'm a pocketer not a belt clipper. On the lookout for a spare battery. Love the Android Market. Heard a lot about Swype but haven't tried it yet. Only irritation is Bluetooth seems to disconnect occasionally from my BlueAnt S4 handsfree set or vice versa.

This phone detects Wi-Fi networks easily and works flawlessly with emails, texting, and other apps.  Yes, like other reviews, the little drawback is the battery life, yet we follow other reviews' advice to eliminate some power-hunger appts, so my husband doesn't even need to re-charge every day, depending on his daily phone usages of course.

I can't comment on performance yet because I didn't test it with US GSM card but WiFi setup was easy.

Very slow processor for its era, volatile battery life and general inability to cope with the demands of ICS made this the most regrettable smartphone purchase I've made. All of these are relatively forgivable until I realised the tiny internal memory, which couldn't support more than two widgets and a couple dozen apps before refusing to accept SMSes on the grounds of no more space.

Again it \"woke up\" after a few hours of downtime.  Maybe it was on a coffee break or something ;-) .  Back to the wireless store it went and we \"super sized\" the Ace into a Nexus S.  The Nexus S is *extremely* impressive - nice size, great screen, good user interface.  I think I've been playing with it more than dear wife.=============================================The Ace was my wife's first smartphone (I have an iPhone) and she wasn't crazy about having a phone that does more than make phone calls, so it took a little nudging to bring her into the light.  Unfortunately the light went dark ;-)While we bought the Ace from our local cell provider, I wanted to share our experience with the phone on Amazon since I rely on product reviews here to make buying decisions.I *extensively* researched the Ace on the Internet and it seems to be much more popular outside of the United States - there were relatively few reviews from North America.There are three primary and consistent complaints about the Ace:1) poor battery life2) lack of storage (memory)3) early deathBattery life needs to be managed.  Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, minimize playing games, etc.  Lack of storage can be mitigated to some extent by the use of a memory card.  Early death - it goes back to the store.Personally, I think if you buy this phone without a full warranty, you're completely nuts or don't value your money very much.On a positive note, the call quality of the Ace was quite good if maybe a touch on the loud side.

Another reason was the lack of a file system sort of thing, to have direct access to my files. To top it off, this messy and buggy change from Mobile Me to iCloud did it for me.Then I got a Samsung Galaxy tab 8.9 that I am very, very happy with, and which I find much better than the ipad, so I wanted a simple android phone to go along with it, and decided for the Galaxy Ace.However, I am quite frustrated with the Galaxy Ace.Primarily, the battery just sucks. The phone doesn't last a whole day if I check the web sporadically, and doesn't last half a day if I am traveling and need to use a little bit of GPS, Navigation, and internet. That is basically the main thing!Another big thing is the display, which is also very bad and hard to see if I am outdoors in a bright day.There are also a few minor things I miss from my iphone (when it was working properly), like a better Mail software, a hard button to mute it, and a lock screen in which I could still easily see the time. The App Store by Apple is still much more reliable and the iphone apps are much better looking and don't have the amateur feeling like many android apps have.However, there are a number of things that I like about android, though, and overall I don't miss Apple, but it needs a better phone to make it worth it.I just ordered a Samsung Galaxy S and I hope it will be significantly better.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "bueno", "Author": "JANIO A.", "ReviewID": "R5DLHGVUKA60Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "el equipo en terminos generales es muy bueno, lo malo es q en la caja solo me vino cargador, deberia traer todos sus accesorios completos, manos libres,  memoria, compre dos equipo y trajo como sistemas operativos diferente parece q uno es mas actualizado peroo aun asi estan muy buenos", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Joyner Padr\u00f3n", "Author": "Magallanero", "ReviewID": "R2QU1JGVR65HD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Todo salio muy bien, el envio se hizo correcto al dia establecido y el telefono en perfectas condiciones!!! 100% recomendado.

And it works just fine. This is also my first android and so I have been on a learning curve. After about 2 months of buying this, I still discover something new from time to time, sometimes a feature that I wished was on the phone! So, a nice ride so far.As for the apps, I dont like the preloaded apps on it and there is no way I can change that(Unless I root it which might be risky). So these apps take up a lot of RAM.The RAM is 279 MB, You dont get a free SD card, you have to buy one separately. The camera is a decent 5 MP(only on the back) and capable of taking great shots even during the night(ya, theres flash!) but I would have liked a dedicated button for it(you have to use the touch screen to take pics, Kind of inconvenient).Overall, a good phone.
