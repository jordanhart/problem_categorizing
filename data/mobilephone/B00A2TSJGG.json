I9300 is \"SPY CAMERA\" brand. It says \"White\" and it arrived Black. 1st battery was charged, and I switched out to the second battery to charge it, and it required the whole phone to be reset. Lost the time/date. How long has it been since you ever had to set the time/date on a phone? The screen locks up when it \"sleeps\" and requires several power down selections before it \"behaves\" properly. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. It also describes the phone is in English, and that was also not true. Very difficult to navigate to settings and change to English when you don't even know what you are reading in a foreign language. Didn't come with a book.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "highly disappointed", "Author": "me", "ReviewID": "RN9X4USO4EX6Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If there was an option to do less than one star I would.

Number one if you're expecting a galaxy s3 or anything even close look again. I bought this knowing its a knockoff and not expecting much and I'm still horribly disappointed. It looks nothing like the pictures and is significantly smaller than the galaxy s3. It is not even an android system, it is set up exactly like the flip phones I used in eighth grade like 6 years ago. You cannot download apps, get on the internet without trying to throw the phone, or customize or change much at all. The camera is awful but that is actually on here and I knew it would be bad before I got it. The phone barely stays on I find myself having to turn it back on after it randomly turns off at all day. One good thing I can say is that the battery lasts FOREVER, but that's because I LITERALLY CANNOT RUN ANYTHING- facebook, internet, email.... nothing. There are better knockoff phones I know that for sure. This is a GIANT waste of money no matter what carrier you are using. Also, I am using this for straight talk and still haven't gotten the internet set up because the APN settings are just ridiculous and nothing how they should be. So I would definitely reccommend NEVER getting this.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible!!!", "Author": "jade", "ReviewID": "R1JGDB67GYEXDX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "not at all what it said it would be!
