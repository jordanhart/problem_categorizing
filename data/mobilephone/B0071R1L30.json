It was made for the ATT system and not \"compatible\", as other sellers advertise their products.  All ATT functions will work correctly with this phone.  The V3xx is the only V series Razr to come with 3G technology and it makes a huge difference in reception and transmission.  Couldn't be more pleased.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "i was scared", "Author": "Tristen Morris", "ReviewID": "R17Q1VTZ630REF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was nervous to buy this i wasnt sure how it would all work i talked to another buyer and he assured me it would all work out what to watch for etc....this phone was like new it made him so happy.....thank you so much....there wasnt 1 problem", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0071R1L30"}}
