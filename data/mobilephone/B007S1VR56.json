I must admit the first thing that drew me to this phone was the plan. 50$ a month for unlimited talk, text, and web! Heck yeah! The phone is a dream! Internet is fast the voice is clear the touch screen is a breeze to work and personalizing it is easy as it gets! I really love the Micro SD slot for my own stuff. The one and only draw back was that if you drop it, it breaks apart and you have to chase down the back and the battery, however I got a case on here for 75 cents and it is worth its weight in gold! The case i got is plastic rubberized and pure purple so i'll let you figure out which one i am talking about. All in all this phone is amazing! I would highly recomend it!", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice semi-smart phone", "Author": "PT", "ReviewID": "R1NEFXA0NI6DJV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: Price is ok.  Phone works well, good call reception and sound.  When talking on phone, if you move it down to look at it, it brings up the screen automatically which is really cool.  Like having a slide out keyboard, makes texting really easy.  Cable provided so you can get software updates via your computer.  Fits nice in your hand and feels pretty sturdy.Cons: Keys on keyboard would be much easier to use is they were pillowed.  Web browsing is very clunky and difficult to use.  Applications are very limited and adding them is expensive.  I was really enjoying the webmail app until it \"expired\" after 30 days.  To get webmail app to work again, you have to pay $7.00 per month.  That's an $84 per year app.  It only provides a button to easily access your external email account.  That's an incredible amount of money for a button.Basically, this phone is a flip phone with a bigger screen.  If you are looking for a true smart phone this isn't it.  If you simply want a decent phone with a bigger screen for photos that works pretty well for calls and text, then this will work for you.  Overall, it is a pretty nice phone for the price but it would be nice if the webmail button had a one-time charge of $1.99 instead of $84/year (for a button!).Good luck and happy shopping!", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love mine", "Author": "M.

The size and weight are excellent though I have to mention that even an easy drop pops it open and case and battery part company. Also battery life isn't great just good, but you can't have it all for the price of this \"feature\" phone. I think the touch screen is great with just the right sensitivity not to mistakenly press buttons but easily accessing what you want. The QWERTY is fairly small and close but manageable with practice. Not thrilled with the micro SD being under the back cover but it works. The sound on this cell is great can go loud on both calls and music. The camera... well it's not great but once again  \"feature\" it's got one. User interface is nicely laid out and has standard tools. The contact info I love with a save for everything but shoe size so on the go I have addresses and everything with me. I haven't used bluetooth. It's a cell small enough to slip in your pocket, able to make and receive clear calls, send texts, take pictures, play music and videos, browse the web, store info, and keep up with contacts and events.

I currently own a Samsung Juke that I love.  I got the phone because of the memory capacity and touch screen for scrolling through songs.The touch screen misses half my finger presses and won't even get through the touch calibration function most of the time.  However, it always produces the click sound even when it ignores the finger press.  That leads one to believe that it worked, when it didn't.The Bluetooth only works when it feels like working.  It often just says it can't connect.  The same Bluetooth devices work flawlessly with my old phone.  The Bluetooth range is only about 2 to 3 feet when it does work.  Playing music through Bluetooth makes the music player lock up until the Bluetooth device is turned off.The music player stops whenever a call is received (normal for basic phones).  However it also stops when one turns on or off Bluetooth, or does anything else.  Leaving the music player screen immediately stops playback.  The music player does not remember even the last song that was playing, nor where it was playing in the song.  It doesn't pause the music when doing something else, it just cancels the entire music playlist.  There is no equalizer, and there are no settings for bass, treble, or balance.  The sound quality of music (through stereo headphones) is excellent.Call volume is good, but the sound is robotic, like it is using a low sample rate or dropping samples.The text messaging features seem to work OK, though I don't use them much.  The keyboard works well, though the keys are hard to read.  Since they have multiple functions, the lettering is small for the symbols and special functions.  I also discovered there is no way to enter a \"W\" in a phone number when using the keyboard.  I had to close the keyboard and press the touch screen while entering a phone number.The phone book insists on having a default number for each contact.  You can have it prompt for call versus text on pressing a contact, but not which phone number to call.  It is necessary to go through the address book to select a phone number.  The shortcuts always dial the default number!  The voice-mail contact only supports one number and is impossible to delete.Icons cannot be added or deleted on the second icon screen.  They can be moved around.  That is annoying if you don't want some of the features, like My Verizon that are easy to accidentally press.  Depending on your plan, one accidental touch can cost a few dollars for Internet access fees.One can add shortcut icons to a shortcut menu, or the initial desktop screen.  There are no additional icons provided for contacts except the default.  Pressing on a contact will either call the default number or bring up a choice of call, e-mail, or text.  There is no function to arrange or line up icons.The desktop animations are good, but there is a choice of only three.The menus are inconsistent about whether they have a back button or one has to use the disconnect call button to go back.  I found myself bouncing between the screen and the disconnect button.The phone is very slippery.  A case is absolutely necessary to avoid dropping the phone a lot.  The charging cord is rather short (4 feet).  USB functions work OK, but there is a long delay before the memory is detected on the computer unless you configure it through the menus.  The device starts in CD mode, then switches to either storage or modem.  The modem is basically useless since Verizon doesn't support that.The flash slot is inside the phone underneath the back cover.  The back cover must be removed to remove or install the flash.  If you plan to change the flash card frequently that could be a problem, especially having to use a case around the phone.  If you plan to leave the flash in all the time, then it is ideal.In summary, the features in the phone would be good for the price if they worked reliably and were well designed.  Unfortunately the features do not work well, and are not well designed.  Although there are a lot of features, they are each very limited.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had this phone for over a year and still love it.", "Author": "julieinid", "ReviewID": "RP492IB8U6SCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone.

Admire", "ReviewID": "R3U3SEOL43HHYD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a hearing-impaired person, I don't generally use telephones very much, preferring to rely on E-mail and instant messaging for long-distance communication, so I resisted getting a cellphone for years. Due to the need of family members who don't use their computers as much as I do to keep in touch with me, though, I was given this phone as an early Christmas present at Thanksgiving last month. I had wanted a smartphone, but the various prepaid plans were too expensive, so we settled on this one instead with the pay-by-the-minute plan (though I'm given to understand Walmart has a $10 per month data plan).I've been using this phone for a bit over three weeks now, mainly to check mail when I'm unable to get to a computer or to receive direct text messages, and I like it so far. It's TDD-compatible though I haven't yet tested this feature; cellphone-compatible TDD's are $200 or so. The slide-out QWERTY keyboard is a feature that I specifically wanted given that email/text is my main use of this instrument, and when opened changes the screen display from vertical to horizontal. It's sturdy and fairly easy to use though I had some difficulty at first learning how to use certain special keys (such as those needed to type in symbols). The screen is large, clear and sharp and the touch-screen capability works quite well. There are nice little extras such as a tip calculator, world clock, drawing pad, calendar and notepad included, and of course, the 2-megapixel camera, which won't replace my existing digicam but is fine for taking quick snapshots (I think of it as being like one of those old Kodak Instamatic cameras). The built-in memory is puny but can be upgraded to 16GB for less than $20 (or 32 or 64 GB for more) with any of several brands of Micro SD memory cards. The USB port allows you to recharge the phone (in my use so far, I find that the battery should be recharged - which takes 1 to 2 hours depending - every three or four days) or connect it to your computer to upload or download data. There are lots of extras available though they cost varying amounts per month, so you'll have to judge which ones are most useful to you. If you don't like the default red/black color schemes there are plenty of protective-case accessories on Amazon to change the color to something you like better,as well as protective screens for the display.Very nice phone overall!", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great basic phone - except bluetooth unreliable", "Author": "Girl on a hill", "ReviewID": "R2KGOEWL57N8JN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a good basic phone and don't need bluetooth, then this phone has a lot to offer.

First off I will start with my first impressions with the phone.  I am 42 and this is my first 'complicated' phone.  Before this phone I have always had the basic flip style with no fancy features such as internet.  I found this phone easy to learn how to use and within three days I was even using the internet on it just because the feature was there, the unlimited internet was already included in my pre-paid plan and I thought that I would prove my kids wrong by my not being \"too old to learn the new technology.\"  HA HA.  The first month my camera stopped working.  I did everything to fix it, believe me!  I searched the internet, downloaded some software from LG which I downloaded to my phone via a transfer USB Cable and I even eventually called LG about the problem.  The problem was that each time I tried to access my camera, it would not load and my phone would say \"camera load error\" (or something like that).  It turns out that the problem is very common and caused by a variety of different things from dropping the phone to moisture damage and really it could have been caused from just about anything.  LG is very aware of the problem and the only thing that they would do was to have me to mail my phone to them at \"my expense\" (since it is still covered under 100% warranty) and then they would fix it and mail it back to me.  'But', if they found the problem to be from anything that they considered to be human error they would not fix the phone until I paid for their hourly wage to fix it plus the parts.  Okay, I paid $75.00 for the phone, so the possibility of paying probably around $150.00 (my husband used to fix electronics and that is generally what it cost for something like my phone) just made no sense so I did not send it to them.  As for what made the camera go out, I am not sure but I had been taking cell phone photos outside with my daughter and it was snowing, so there is a chance that it could have been moisture damage?  By the way, the fix for the problem is an update to the software that ONLY LG can repair!  It is not part of the software that they make available to the public on their website.  So this is a problem that they know about, even say that it is extremely common but still charge to fix it and do not include it in their 100% warranty.  Nice.  :)  ....A bit of sarcasm there.  So now I am using my still new phone with no working camera and a few weeks ago my MP3 Player went out.  I had a Microsoft Zune and now Microsoft does not make them anymore or service them, so I had to junk it and now my phone must be used as my MP3 Player because it seems that no company is making MP3 Players anymore, at least none that hold anything more than around 10 gig and I had an 80 gig Zune.  So what I did was I found out that this model of phone can hold a micro card of 32 gig maximum, so I purchased a 32 gig card.  My next adventure was finding out through trial and error that this phone will not support anymore than 9.18 gig of music REGARDLESS OF THE MEMORY CARD SIZE!  What will happen if you load more than 9.18 gig onto the card is that when you try to load it, the phone will turn itself off and it will not load the music, ever!  Again, I had an adventure trying to fix this problem and eventually I found that it is just the way that the phone is made and there is nothing that I can do about it.  So if you purchase this phone with the intent of using the MP3 function, this is very important information to know.  I will also add that I do have full length movies also on my memory card and so far my phone has no problem loading or playing those.  I used a conversion program to convert my full length DVD's into an MP4 Format made specifically in size for an LG Phone.  I also have about 8 gigs of movies on my phone right now in addition to the 9.18 gigs of music and there are so far no problems with that.  Now for the other things that you should know about the MP3 Function.  The music cuts out frequently, it is almost like a regular cut out that happens every few minutes and lasts about one full second.  I say \"almost\" because I have not timed the cut out's but I would guess them to be regular and happen about once every five minutes or so.  Again I could not find a fix for this.  It sounds weird but updating my roaming capabilities on the phone seemed to help it for a short period of time but that does not always work, so if anyone ever finds the fix then perhaps you could please be sweet and let me know?  My research turned up nothing and this problem is frustrating.  Other than the above problems I have not had any other issues with the phone.  The touch screen is not very sensitive and sometimes I have to touch it several times for it to recognize that I touched it but I am okay with that, it is just a bit annoying.  I did drop the phone once recently (this was 'after' it had already had all of the above mentioned problems) and it did not fall apart or anything and it still worked just fine, so it seems to hold together decently well.  I have my own hard phone case on over the factory case, so nothing came off.  There is one more thing that I would like to add and that is that these problems that I have mentioned are not just isolated to my personal phone.  When I purchased my phone I purchased another identical one for my husband as well.  As soon as his came he hated it, he said that he didn't like the touch screen (his fingers are very large for the phone) and he wanted a different phone, so I kept his as a back up.  So far his camera function is still working so whenever I get around to it I intend to switch phones but I did try out the memory card in his phone and his has the identical MP3 problems that mine has.  So I just wanted to let you all know that it is not just my phone.  I hope that this information can help someone out.  I am not sorry that I purchased this phone because for the $65.00 that I paid for a no contract phone I feel that it was fair.  The calls have good sound, the volume is high, the speaker phone works well and the internet works well also.  But knowing now what I do, my next phone purchase is going to have a better MP3 function and also a better camera.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "T.B.", "ReviewID": "R1YYPJ8CE7ZKL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a flip phone to this one and love it!

The Amazon price was much less than the cost of all the Verizon options, and turned out even better than expected.  To my surprise, when I uplinked the phone to my Verizon account, the phone also delivered a $10 credit to my account -- reducing its costs by that amount.

Right away one can see the advantage in the Extravert's platform versus my flipper. The slide-out keyboard speeds texting enormously. The Extravert's larger touchscreen makes viewing texts and pictures easier, and the touchscreen is faster for dialing versus having to flip open my Samsung.The phone has many options for personalization, including loading ringtones (including homemade via the micro-SD card or use the enclosed USB cable), pictures and the many internal personalization settings. Call quality seems very good in my area (mountainous with spotty coverage, mostly). Setup was easy thanks to Verizon's activation scheme. You simply call a number provided which will give Verizon the MEID number, pick a plan and whether you want to keep your old cell number or get a new one, and Verizon does the rest.The major downside is one that I didn't find so detrimental given the other reviews I've seen regarding this phone. The touchscreen does take a bit of getting used to but is quick and those with smaller fingers would find it quite easy to use. When selecting various options on the screen or to scroll, you must press more firmly than on more-expensive phones. The irritating thing about this is that you will often select an option you did not intend to use. Scrolling numbers can also be irritating as you will probably select a number you did not want when in fact you intended to scroll upward or downward. I've learned to live with this as I generally like the phone. The phone is a bit slippery, but manageable. The phone becomes MUCH more manageable if you also order one of the many rubberized cases on Amazon. The overall build quality seems very good. The phone menu is fairly straightforward. Placing calls and messaging are easy enough. I was surprised at how quickly web pages load in my area considering the speed of the phone. The phone uses the Opera browser.Screen resolution can be fairly mediocre. Pictures tend to have a \"blocky\", pixelated appearance. Images taken with the 2mp camera fare a little better. Viewing webpages is easy enough, especially when you've been used to small flipphone screens.Overall, I like the phone very much! It's a good transition between a standard phone and a full-blown smartphone. I purchased the phone through Amazon- GREAT price and fast shipping.

Sometimes it will register my touch correctly, but more often than not I am unable to click on what I want to, which makes the phone virtually useless. Verizon walked me through their only troubleshooting solution for the phone, which is a factory reset, but the phone's screen is still not functioning properly.I am quite disappointed since I still have another 10 months left on my contract and have to buy a used phone online to use until my contract runs out or purchase a new phone at full price (something I refuse to do).

I have had it one week and it has been a huge problem. First I needed the email app so I pressed on this app on the desk top to learn that if I wanted an email app it would be an additional $6.95 a month for this one \"Mobile email\". Ok, I needed it and accepted. A few days later the app stops working. I call Verizon technical support, stay on the phone one hour following all their directions (trying to download the Verizon email app from the app button on the phone without any success), and then the technician apologies and states that he just read that the LG Extravert can't have any email app per Verizon who locks it out. Ouch! This is bait and switch. Then I checked the internet and others complained of the exact same problem. I saw that a Verizon tech wrote in response to call tech support -(well you can see where that circle leads).
