I think it must be people trying to use one hand to operate it. if you use left thumb, no problems. it is LARGE but lighter than I expected.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone ive ever had...and ive had alot...", "Author": "Joey", "ReviewID": "R2GC5PQX4P6WEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone, ive had it for over a week now, i dont know much about ZTE but i mainly bought this for its camera, i upgraded from the samsung galaxy s2 on virgin mobile, love the ZTE much better, dosent have as many bugs/glitches...my samsung had alot...also the battery life is great, even with the data always on, this phone is really fast, so far havent experienced lag once, hasent froze up on my like my galaxy s2 does all the time, it has restarted a couple times though, but i was downloading a lot of apps so maybe thats why, the display looks absolutely beautiful, i cant ever look at a non HD phone screen now, also the camera is pretty good, i compared the galaxy s2's 8mp pic to this phones pics, the pics on the ZTE had better colors but when i zoom in to the detail like text off in the distance looks basically the same, so may not be the best 13mp camera but atleast its a tad bit better than the galaxy s2/s3's 8mp camera. also the HDR shots are quick and look really nice, and the 1080p video dosent zoom in like 3 feet like my samsung phone does...no idea why it does that but it was annoying the s*** out of me. also the front facing camera records at 720p...which is awesome, my first phone ever to have an HD front camera!!!", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3G/4G LTE Network Fast surfing, messaging and downloading - that's the power of 3G.
