The StraitTalk representative's decision was that the SIMS card needed replacing and there was a promise to send a new one. We finally did receive an envelope with no card and a piece of paper with instructions!  However, our \"point of salesperson\" for the phone was more than willing to work with us and did allow us to return the phone after we made a different purchase.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android value in Straight Talk, uses AT&T; towers", "Author": "Cable Monkey", "ReviewID": "R3DRI9A60PQNKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's be honest: Straight Talk is not at the cutting edge of technology or customer service.  But they do have excellent pricing and some decent mid-level smartphones.  For my purposes and budget, this is the best phone in the Straight Talk line.I was considering the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII, but that more expensive model uses Sprint towers exclusively.  This Straight Talk Galaxy SII uses AT&T; towers which have much better reception in my area.I definitely recommend using a sturdy case such as an Otterbox to protect this phone since the Galaxy S-series phone screens tend to crack after multiple drops.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm confused...", "Author": "Jess", "ReviewID": "R3TGYT3OXZI0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't get where all of u ppl are seeing this phone for $350.

Here are my opinions on the product;Pros:Affordable and off-contractHigh end specs that still compete after 2 yearsNever experienced lagg on any mainstream appCamera takes beautiful pictures and videosThe features are uncountable, always sated my needsWeb browsing is a breezeI get 12 mb/s on the AT&T; Network that this phone runs off of. (HSPA+)Crystal clear call qualityCons:Battery life could be better, I'm a heavy user and my phone sometimes dies in 3 hours. But again I do 3d gaming on it.Speaker could be better, distorts a bit at high volumes which is common.Screen is bright and pretty, but its not HD resolution at 480x800Outdated Android version (I use Cyanogen mod which puts my phone at 4.3)Phone can get VERY hot at times, and make my face sweat.Overall I'm happy with my little pocketbuddy, who is realiable, resilient, and stylish.Would DEFINATELY recommend this phone to a friend (And I have!)", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving My Phone!!", "Author": "Theresa Williams", "ReviewID": "RID1KNMMEYV2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great!

Topper \"Topper\"", "ReviewID": "RYA038UG3GETL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are three million reviews on the Galaxy SII, so I will start with the important detail about this specific one.First, this is an ATT phone. While it does not entail an ATT subscription, it uses their infrastructure. If you want to know if it will work somewhere, try an ATT phone there.Also very important to note is that there are several models of the SII. This particular one is the S959G, and that implies one very important detail. While other S2'are upgradable to android 4.1, this one IS NOT UPGRADABLE. It comes with Gingerbread, and that's it. There will not be an update now or in the future..As for the phone itself, it is solid, feels well built and runs reliably. The platform is fast enough and stable. Not many glitches to speak of. It's worth it up to about $150. Beyond that you can get more for the money.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Straight Talk Galaxy S2.", "Author": "emilyy17", "ReviewID": "R3KI2818QJD1YI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone at walmart for $199.00, but I love this phone.
