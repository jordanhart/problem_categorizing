Seller shipped this phone and a black one promptly. Both phones in new condition. Mine replaced a touchscreen phone and the black one replaced an older flip phone for my husband. We're both happy with ease of use (much easier to text on than my touchscreen or his old flip phone), battery life, call quality, and durability. If you want a phone that does a good job of being a phone and planner without a lot of internet or social networking fluff, you will like this phone. That said, it does have a browser, but I rarely need to use it. Calendar, planner, camera, and other Blackberry functions are easy to navigate.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad phone and service", "Author": "Richard Morris", "ReviewID": "R3EYFVMK7IH4OC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was suppose to be rebuilt.

My issues are that it doesn't have BB ap world nor 3G nor wifi; and you can't have a whole picture as your background it only changes the bottom half of the wall paper. Also the bluetooth doesn't work at all it will connect to other devices but you can't send or recive pictures or songs. I think for $100 there shouldn't have been this many issues.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Okay?!?!?!", "Author": "Candace", "ReviewID": "RFBDR1AV9WTBH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the phone in the mail one day early!
