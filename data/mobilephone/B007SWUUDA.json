{"Reviews": [{"Title": "New 2012 Cell phone watch", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R3H9M7M7J3MDMG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I have had this watch since the 7th and I am having moisture issues wich causes the screen to become unresponsive to touch...and I have to pull the back off and dry it out.  I am not sure if it's from just sweat on my wrist of from washing my hands.  I like the watch and I hope I can get it to dry out enough to stay working properly.  The watch functions well and you can use the built in speaker as long as it's not too noisy around you.  The Camera takes ok pictures and the Video camera is not that great (choppy video).  The Radio works well and so does the music player...even the supplied headset isn't too bad.  The phone has some cool features, it has a feature to turn on and off the watch at times that you set, an alarm function with 5 alarms.  I love the watch and I hope that my issue will clear up.Update: 9/3/12The phone stopped responding to inputs on the screen a couple of weeks ago... my fault due to getting it wet while washing my hands.  So, Be carefull when washing hands or around water.  I did buy another watch and I have kept it away the H20 and has worked flawlessly so far, except for my charging port on my watch... it has for some reason stopped working and now I can't charge my batteries.  I luckily kept my old watch and now use that to charge my batteries.  So, am I just having bad luck????? I guess there are a bazillion scenarios for what could have happened... guess it's just one of those things with electronics.  I still like the watch and I would recommend it.Hope some of my Pain will help in the decision making process.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Charger dead, too many defects", "Author": "SP", "ReviewID": "R271MMGT807HT8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked the watch, but then the charger died 1 day after I got it. Now it's dead. I can't see if it's just the cord or the watch itself that broke since it's this weird Chinese-made connector. Now I have to return it, which annoys me greatly. This thing gets a 1.Here's some other stuff that went wrong with it that I was willing to live with:#1: The stylus broke in 1 day. The top part fell out, then while trying to fix it, it got pushed in so I can't extend it anymore.EDIT: I was able to recover the stylus with a thumb tack! YAY!#2: Touchscreen has a bug where it won't recognize touch for more than about a second. Tapping works fine, but it's very difficult to move icons, and the handwriting feature doesn't work at all. Try to write an O, and I can only get half done before it cuts out.#3: This watch did not come with the bluetooth headset or 2GB flash card as advertised. However, when I spoke to Amazon about it, they helped me out. That's not really a strike against the watch; just wanted to mention it. I'd say it's actually a plus as far as Amazon's customer service is concerned.FYI, if you're going to use it to listen to music via bluetooth audio, remember to set it to stereo output. Scared myself for a bit there thinking the sound quality was going to be like AM-radio!", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good phone.
