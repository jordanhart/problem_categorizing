And how they could say that it was unlocked.... to me it is flat out lying. With a minute of research I learned that the Global version doesn't even come in black...They won't take back the product, even though it's useless to me.  Don't buy from this seller, they are immoral and just trying to steal your money.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it, great phone just what I wanted.", "Author": "T", "ReviewID": "R1QL41J0B5WAO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great phone, works well and does everything expected. The import fee for the UK was higher than i expected but it still worked out as a fairly well priced product.

Very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "GOOD CONDITION INDEED!", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R38XGVRI049RPW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this phone with the physical exterior almost new, the screen is good too, and best its unlocked!! I put it my sim and it worked! I can use data without wifi (the wifi works too).Only thing which is the big killer, the right side of the phone's touch screen is cripled literally, it does not respond to any touch no matter how hard. From the top of the right corner to the bottom of the search button does not work at all, I have to use the keys to get around, which makes the phone not as cool, and slows me down. Because I cant text or do anything vertically.I know its a digitizer issue, and I wish the seller had sent me one to solve the issue. I live in the Caribbean and sending this phone all the way back up there to wait for it to go and come could take more than a month! And am not up for that.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad phone!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1N66ZFDZS7NN3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone would freeze, and shut off randomly.

In the case of the Motorola Droid 2 Global, I may have prevented someone from making the same costly mistake that I made. I should point out from the onset of this review, I already own a Droid 2 Global. I purchased it from Verizon before I bought the second one. Now on to the review...The software was wrong from the start. This Droid 2 has the software from a Droid 1. It was supposed to be factory unlocked and it wasn't. I wasn't even able to load up a sim card because there was a sim lock on the phone and not from the card. I contacted the seller, which also was in no way, shape, or form helpful. Being that I'm in another country, sending something back by mail in the alloted time is next to impossible.So I \"ate\" this purchase. Now I know, if I want to buy an unlocked phone, not to do it from Amazon. Nothing wrong with Amazon as a whole, its just that not all of the sellers on this site are \"honest\". If I could find the information about the place who sold me this phone, I would gladly put them on the hot seat. If you advertise a product or a service, you should deliver on it. If not, sell your items on Craigslist...", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "unlocked motorola droid 2 global.", "Author": "mack", "ReviewID": "RHT7H8FTNZW4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased a motorola droid 2 global unlocked from standman90.this was my first online purchase,so i was a bit worried.well my phone came in the mail,i opened it and it looked like new.everything was intact.I charged it up and put my t mobile sim and memory chip in,rebooted it and it was up and running.everything worked fine,added facebook and yahoo in minutes,played with the camera,and the music sounded good too.Im definantly happy,and i would buy from this seller again.He even answered a few questions i had through e mail,and gave me correct answers.so standman90 is definantly the man.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "My DROID2 review", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "R2HTJFA9NRAAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using my Motorola DROID 2 Global for a month now and its great, I have nothing bad to say I would recommend this product to any and everyone I know, it that good.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent cellphone!!!", "Author": "samuel", "ReviewID": "R33FNBVOINQ2P5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the product received was in very good condition, the truth is to look like new and also worked very well, met the conditions were asking as it was unlocked and had all the applications for the phone.
