Daniel", "ReviewID": "RUPDHO2XOJ453", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Eastern Caribbean so when I ordered the phone and realized it was coming all the way from China I was feeling down in the mouth; however, having placed the order on November 28, the phone was in my hand on December 23, 2013.The only complaint I have with it is that the home button has to be firmly but gently pressed to respond. So that is where the fifth star went to.However, I am quite satisfied and feel like someone in an exclusive club with a top of the line product. The weight of the phone lets me know it is valuable and durable. I actually think of it as a mini computer with one of its features being to make phone calls. All the features are in tact and perform incredibly well. All the items listed on amazon as being in the package were indeed inside. They included the phone, usb cable, charger, 2 batteries, phone case, ear phone, manual in English. Additionally, I was pleased when I found a protective screen along with a soft cloth for cleaning the screen. There is a separate back cover for the phone as well. The large 5 inch screen display is a user's delight, especially when it is rotated. The back camera is quite powerfully clear and the front camera has shown pretty clear images when I used it in a semi dark room. The led flashlight is also a nice touch.Because I had read the previous customer reviews here on amazon I was not too panicky when I got the phone and noticed the processing language was in Chinese. That was interesting. The general wording on the screen--the main menus--are in English, but as soon as you clicked any one of them the next prompt was in Chinese. So I remembered the experence of an amazon customer: I looked for the \"LANGUAGE\" tab and changed the DEFAULT language. Problem was history.I do feel honoured to have this quality phone---Galaxy Note--as the inscription says--without having to pay an arm and a leg for it. I am expecting to have this phone for a long time to come.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Stuff", "Author": "EVARISTO REGALADO", "ReviewID": "R2C23KV8F2K9EO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought several of these teams to resell (about 6 or 7, approximately) and the experience has been very good. I must say that one of them came to me with a slight factory fails (which is normal for any product, these things happen even with the best and famous brands), so I contacted the supplier by mail and they left me impressed with the good service and the attention they gave to my. In a relatively short time they forwarded me a new device that works perfectly, to the point that I decided to stay with it and not sell it.This equipment provides very good performance. The touchscreen response is very acceptable and my country dual-chip power use constitutes an advantage. The connectivity responds well in this equipment and quality materials are also good.In terms of quality-price, I give it five stars!I recommend", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.93", "Features": "Wi-Fi, GPS, FM, Bluetooth, Browser,AT&T;,T-MOBILE COMPATABILE,WCDMA\n5.0 INCH ANDRIOD 3G SMART PHONE OS: Android 4.0.3\nMP3, MP4, MMS, Alarm, Calendar, Calculator\n1GHZ,ROM 4GB ,RAM 512MB, TOUCH SCREEN,WIFI\nDual Camera: 8.0MP camera 3264 x 2448px picture,1.3 MP frontcamera,LED Flash Light", "Name": "Eson I9220(n9000)5.3\" Capacitive Android 4.1 Mtk6577 Dual SIM Smart Phone Wcdma Wifi Gps Fm", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415zL8ldrOL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ENUJ6NU"}}
