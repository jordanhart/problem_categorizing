{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone but.......", "Author": "K \"Metal head\"", "ReviewID": "R2GG7SE4MNA80X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone came 23 days after order but that's what I expected. The phone is lightning fast and after deleting the Chinese apps it was great. But all I was able to do was via wifi. It seems the phone had a defective receiver I'm not sure but the seller was very helpful in attempting to rectify the situation and then offered to refund my money. I am sending the phone back but I wish it had worked. I would try again but I can't wait for a new phone. If you have the time to wait I would try it out. The only difference is the phone was slightly thicker but it also has android jelly bean and a faster processor than the original. The batteries lasted all day but they were very irregular at displaying how much was left.  All in all I was very happy with it and I'm sure I'd keep it if it received a signal. I tested out calling using VoIP and it was clear. Basically for 200 dollars it was incredible but being sent from China most likely it was damaged in shipping.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "khiya", "ReviewID": "R2U7KD6RDB7M8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got the phecda i 9300. its a great phone BUT does not work with cricket.so if you are with cricket do not get unless you are willing to switch to tmobile or net 10 or some other network that supports this phone.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "it is advertised as being CDMA is not CDMA", "Author": "Billy McFadden", "ReviewID": "R5O978SVJ1RKQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone it's self is fine but if you looking for both CDMA and GSM this phone is not CDMA and will not run on Sprints network", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really good", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "R3KI1LMB164MFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is fast and work with Tmobile I am no so sure with At & T but i'll tried it later, android apps work really good in this phone.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone eats up battery 2 hour talk time needs bigger battery", "Author": "snobirdbjs", "ReviewID": "R1NZB309G6B26Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a really good phone but the battery is too small it has a 1800 mah and needs a 2500 mah to get a full days use.

However, I discovered it will not work on Verizon's network. So I ended up switching to Net10, but I think it will work on any GSM network requiring a SIM card.

He currently uses H2O wireless and there was some configuration needed to get that data working.  Fortunately, H2O has an app for that. ;)  The phone is superfast and he gets all bars on his data no matter where he is.  I don't get that and I have a legit phone with my company. lol.  He has no complaints other than finding a case that truly fits.  If anyone finds one, please let me know.  Otherwise, enjoy this phone. :)", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good phone", "Author": "manuel", "ReviewID": "R28DNBXCFGBOP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very fast and good features.

It is lightening fast and ever since he had it he has not been able to put it down.It took a little time for the phone to recognize his sim card and update at first. It works on the t-mobile network and takes wonderful pictures. It does everything you could want in a phone. You can talk and text, download music, stream videos, access the internet etc. The phone looks like the S3 and is well worth the money for under 200 bucks. An unlocked S3 practically cost an arm and a leg but this phone works just as good as the S3  but the only difference is the bottons are located on the right side of the phone. The only thing my son did not like about the phone is the checkbook case it came with.  The S3 cases will not fit this phone. Still looking for a case for the phone.

Can this phone work on Verizon? I really would like to know for sure. Right now I am  40% sure it can only because Verizon now has there own sim cards andI know you can buy Google's Nexus 4 and take to Verizon and get a  free sim card to use however I think thats because the Nexus is 4g and the Verizon sim cards are 4g.This phone isn't 4g.
