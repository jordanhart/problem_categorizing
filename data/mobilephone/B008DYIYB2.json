All the right frequencies and amazing specs (4G!!!) for the price.  I received it and it looked great, but, it is a Scandinavian phone.  The manual is in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish.  The USB charge adaptor has a European plug.  No problem, I found an English language manual online and I have several USB charge adaptors.I charged the phone completely as the manual directs, and finally got to put in my SIM.  The problem came up during set-up.  No data connection.  I bailed out of set-up and went into settings, as we have several android phones and tablets, so I know my way around the OS.  The device could see the T-Mobile and AT&T; networks, but couldn't connect at any speed, 4G, 3G or GPRS/EDGE.  I didn't bother with Wi-Fi, as I wanted 3G/4G.  I did verify it could make a voice call.I'm very disappointed, but back in the box it goes.  This is only my third return in many years of being an Amazon prime customer, so I don't fault Amazon.  These aren't intended for North America and the vendor shouldn't sell them here.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone exceeded my expectation", "Author": "Amazon Fan", "ReviewID": "ROFZ4EHGUQQLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is so easy to use and fast as well.Its design is nice.Its screen are so clear and bright.Its sound is good enough.It works with my GSM network (T-Mobile)Its features are great for its price.I recommended it for anyone who wants affordable smart phone.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great handset!!!", "Author": "Jeremy S.
