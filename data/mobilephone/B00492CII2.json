Windows is not user friendly, battery life sucked but was manageable. Mid May (^ weeks of light use, no wifi and no bluetooth, very little internet, mainly email and phone use) the phone battery took a dive.Tried new chargers new batteries and nothing worked.Ran updates and cut everything off, still 4 hours without any use was about the best i was getting.This was unacceptable.To late to return, so contacted HTC as it was within warranty. Jump through hoops and may still have to pay. I'm selling it local and taking a loss to get rid of it and the accessories.THIS IS NOT A PHONE TO GET, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best PDA you can get for this price", "Author": "PDA-LOVER", "ReviewID": "RHAF621CLSHD1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fabulous device.Sensory look: A bit heavy(by the opinion of Samsung Galaxy-S user). But has tough case. My device succesfully survived 3 drops from 3-4 feets height. No twists or distortions after drop. Good covering - no scratches or chips on the case after wearing for 1 week in a pocket with keys and other scratching stuff.Despite all sliders it's binding looks very robust. No loose after 3 months of active use.Screen seems not so flat like it should be. there is a slight deepening around red button. So it is become a bubble around red button after applying a screen protector film.Snap on cases mostly did not fit on this model. you need to choose it carefully. The same true for protection film. Seek exactly for t-mobile model.Battery standart 1500mAh: stable 2 days of using. typical daily usage: 3 hours of reading with maximum backlight, 2 hours of EDGE/GPRS Surfing, 50 minutes of  talkingRecords video 640x480 - 4 hours with full charge. 'udio recording was not tested till full discharge.WiFi - works out all charge in 3 hours.FM-radio makes battery heating and eats charge almost like a WiFi. FMradio not presented in this version but can be installed as a separate application or will appear in a custom ROMs.GPS works fine. Initial sattelite detection takes less than a minute. But also eats the battery charge in 4 hours and heats the battery. It looks like it should be used in a car with constant charging from a car. I wish to have this battery : [...]Camera: nothing special. 3Mp is just what should these plastic microlens have. Needs a good lightning. Good color sensivity. 'verage autofocusing - focusing logic very strange - it don't like a close objects. Making a simple shot takes 5 seconds.MicroSD: works fine with 16Gb MicroSD. Class (2) will just fit for 640x480 video recording.Device have a choice when coonecting to a computer(to be a flash card for MicroSD or to work with ActiveSync)It also has a good accesories. A perfect connector from HTC-USB to 3,5 audio jack allows to use professional headphones and there is no need to disconnect phones or to take it off from your head when you have incoming call. Just talk while your music is paused.I bought additional accessory - TV-out cable and tested it on my TV. Works fine.Charges Quickly 80% for an hour and the rest 20% for the second hour. Charging from a computer a bit slower than from the charger. USB cable is not standart miniUSB. so you need to have that HTC special cable with you.Interface: I like that features - automatic screen switching off when you talking. So you can't occasinaly drop  a call with your ear. When you put a phone with screen down to the any flat surface it automatically goes to the loud speaker mode. I was new to Touch Flo interface, but it was very convenient.G-sensor works fine.Stylus present but almost never needed.At native 528MHz speed works just fine for it's 200 bucks. But Divx video player stumbles alot playing non optimized 720p mp4 movie , copied from BB.also Touch Flo interface works slowly and not smooth.Overclocking with WinMoSpeed program shows stable work at 806Mhz. Touch Flo interface operates very smooth and fast, it starts flying. TCPMP and DivX players smoothly plays any video in fullscreen 800x480. No noticable discharge after overclocking.What is bad: it has Windows mobile 6.5 and it does not support Adobe Flash 10, Adobe Air. But there is some projects building Android version.was not tested: 3G, WiFi router mode, Wifi Performance, discharge time while listening music/recording sound.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY UNLOCKED HTC TOUCH PRO", "Author": "pinknblu \"jenn\"", "ReviewID": "R16IHQ7W1ENA9N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just bought this phone you can't download ANYTHING, I REPEAT ANYTHING!!!!! It messes up often with calls, you have trouble with emails coming through, the back cover is crap--it will break, the clips are small as heck. UGH....so many issues...just do yourself a favor and save yourself and don't buy this crappy phone. Oh, by the way..I have T-Mobile service just so you know...not that ...that has any bearing its just the way the phone is systematically set up, trust me it has some blocking to it through Windows to where you just can't be free to download anything, to make this phone your own. F.Y.I. I had a Windows phone a few years back same issues of trying to download  it was a different brand (Shadow) but same system. I don't think they need to be in the cell phone business because they for real strap the user in making their phone their own!
