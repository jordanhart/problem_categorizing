I got Verizon to replace the phone once, now I am on my own, says the Harrisonburg, Virginia Verizon wireless store. They had a display unit in the store, but told me (I am NOT making this up!) that \"they could go to jail for doing a warranty replacement.\" Another gal in the store told me that \"car chargers charge faster because automotive voltage is HIGHER than wall outlets.\" This lady was just not on the ball. That's Verizon! And they wonder why we will not sign a renewal on the two year agreement! They also tried to convince me that the price they charged for the phone ($475) was at their cost. Yeah, right. Lies and misinformation, then they wonder why you walk out the door.So, if you get the Boulder, also make sure that you have the charging cradle, to get around the defective plug for the car charger.Buying on Amazon saves alot of $$ over retail, without an agreement - which provides a nice exit strategy (and ability to transfer your business) when things go sour with Verizon, as it does every six months or so.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Strong, Reliable, Irreplaceable Product", "Author": "D. Hawes \"American Soldier\"", "ReviewID": "R27K0CCENPCIEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: I am currently using this product. Purchased from Just Cellular. Received the phone in box. Seems new and looks OK (bought 2 of them). Bottom port on both phones work and charge. Activated my phone by calling Verizon (called *611 from my g/f phone and activated my new phone on my existing contract. did not require renewal of contract of change of current plan). Put the extended battery on (nice tight fit) and its now charging. My only problem is how to get my contacts from my old phone to my new phone because the bottom port does not work on my old phone (not an issue Just Cellular can fix or is responsible for)Personal Experience:-I bike 1.5mi from home to school in Corvallis. My old phone (same model) has dropped out of my pocket while doing ~15mph from 3+ feet, landing on asphalt, at least 3 times and was ran over by a car. It has been rained on, dropped in a bowl of spaghetti then washed off under the sink with soap and warm water, and while in my pocket been sat on and slammed into walls and corners with little effect to it working. Each of the drops scratched it up but the most damage done was when it was ran over by the car; a chip of plastic popped off right below the hinge on the outside panel (just above where  my phone says Verizon) and the battery was not held in as tight as it once was.-Battery life is approx 7 days if used for one ten min call and 10txt's a day (i have the extended battery).-call quality is poor. I'm not looking for high def sound or a media player in my phone so it does just fine for me. make a call, communicate, then hang up.-the only other feature I use is the alarm. the ringer is louder than any other phone I've used and the vibration function is ridiculously powerful, like if its on vibrate only and goes off I can hear it from 20ft away.Issues: -there were times when my old phone would not complete a phone call. I would call my g/f and then it was say calling but i got no ring and my g/f said she never got the call. I would just cancel the call and try again and it worked the 2nd time every time. - when i received my old phone from my g/f, the bottom port was not working. however, i have the phone dock to charge it with. the battery lasts long enough that i have never had need of a car charger- non issue for me. -It has been about 3 weeks since the last incident, ran over by a car while it was open, that would have destroyed a normal phone (probably including the Gz'One Commando). my phone now randomly turns off. It has happened about 5 or 6 times since then. I believe it is because of the battery not being held in position. i have since modified the way i hold the back of the phone and have had no issues for the last 5 days.-The phone is picky about how it is set in the dock to charge. this is the main reason i am getting a new (the same) phone. because the bottom has been nicked and banged up so much, plus the plastic stopper that plugs the bottom is jammed, it will not play nice with the dock. I have to get it just right for it to sit and charge.Other thoughts:-This phone does not require a data plan. Major plus in my opinion (that saves me ~20 bucks a mo)-This phone is the perfect mate for me. I am hard on things and this phone can take a beating. I expect the phone i ordered to take the same beating and last as long or longer than the one it is replacing (i think this one is 4-5yrs old)", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "A tough cookie", "Author": "M.

I used this phone from 2008-2010, and it would have lasted much longer if...well, anyhow, I got it because it reminded me of a Digi-Vice. Yeah, like form Digimon. And I needed something rugged because I was a lifeguard and had a very active social life, too- never knew what was next. This phone was just too cool- great sound, take pics underwater, AMAZING battery life. The phone, luckily stayed on for 3 days at one point with many many calls to it. It was lucky because that is the only way I found it, was a last ditch effort at calling, in the middle of the night, out in the driveway. Only to see a multi-color lightshow coming from under the rear passenger-side tire of my mother's pickup truck...........My mom's truck had been parked on top of this phone for 3 days at that point and it still worked. Unfortunately, I had to retire it because although everything worked, the display was cracked and something that looked like ink had spilled all over the inside display.I loved this phone. </3", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "software", "Author": "Janice E.

If so, it must be a remade version. It comes in a Casio box but it is not the same as the original. The plastic is softer and it feels much more flimsy. I have the original Boulder and my friend got this one. His new phone's paint started flecking after the first week, the front screen broke after two weeks and after a month he bought another phone. I've had my original Boulder for over three years and it still works great, but it's important to recognize the difference between this version and the original. The way to tell the difference is to look at the front of the phone. The original has a raised speaker that says \"Casio\" on it but the weaker version does not have the raised speaker and it says \"Verizon.\" This phone may work fine, but I would not buy one myself. Wish I could get the original Boulder, still, as it seems to get better reviews than the Ravine. Check to see if they have the black and gray Boulder as some of the ones I've seen on here still have the raised speaker. If you find a Boulder with the raised speaker, buy it! Ruggedized phones seem to be getting weaker rather than stronger, which is no mystery since that ends up being more lucrative for phone manufacturers and retailers. As smart phones become more prevalent, genuinely tough phones will probably become harder to come by. This, in my opinion, is a great example.

I've dropped it and its been rained on. About a year ago the battery starting not holding a charge but found the dbl heavy duty replacement battery for it here on Amazon, and also a car charger which I never had before. I use this every day as my wake up alarm as well, it has 3 different alarms times you can set on it. I take great pictures and videos with it as well. I've never used the website on it as my plan doesn't have data usage that isnt crazy expensive, so cant say how good that is.

This originally caught my attention from the reviewers that talk about its durability like the cyclist that clattered it down the road at 15mph or the guy who lost his in the snow bank for a week.  I cannot attest to those extremes and will not throw it across the room \"just because I can\".  It is obviously more rugged than the typical smart phone though because it does not have a huge, glass screen and at $75 it is also easily replaceable.I've been using this for about a month and really like it.  It looks really cool and disappears into the pocket of my cargo pants where it is entirely safe with no screen protector or case.  The analog clock on the face is also cool and a press of a button turns it into a digital compass.  Making actual phone calls is just like using a normal phone, but it also has the modern feature where I push one button and say \"call Robin, Mobile 1\" and it will call the first mobile phone number for the person of that name in my contact list.  This also has a simple camera that can be used to send picture messages as video or still.  My wife wanted a recon of Home Depot's available flowers and that was neatly done in a 30 second video message.  The camera is rather low resolution, but that just means that my data plan can be super cheap.  This produced a useable video on her fancy smartphone.The phone is indeed compatible with Page Plus Cellular, but it took some playing around to get through the activation.  I tried for a few hours and then called their support.  I was given a laundry list of things to try and then was told that the phone was simply not compatible.  Then I went through the phone's menu and downloaded a software update and it magically started working.  For less than $12 per month, I have an emergency phone that I can talk on and send basic text and picture messages.  I have a desk phone at my office where I spend my days and a wall phone at home where I spend my nights.  The cell phone is primarily for emergencies such as when I'm on long bike rides or wanting to call ahead to someone that I'm meeting somewhere nonspecific like \"at a restaurant, are you there yet\" or a mall.  Sound quality seems fine to me.  I've called my desk phone and left messages to myself and they were clearly understandable.  Under my light usage, the stock battery lasts all week.  I bought the extended duration battery as a backup, but that makes the phone fat and is not necessary for me so I put the original battery back in.On the negative, the stories about the charging port being fragile are very true as I discovered in the first few days.  To charge the phone, you have to pick open the plastic cap at the bottom of the phone which is held by two, fragile strands of plastic.  The charging plug fits into the charging receptacle, but it is tiny and cumbersome.  In another review, I mentioned buying a car charger.  That danged thing fit the charge receptacle so tightly that even with gentle pressure to unplug it I managed to rip the charging receptacle out of the phone.  The company I bought the phone from was willing to replace the phone under warranty, but I actually kept it.  For around $15 I bought the cradle charger that others recommended.  This is WAY nicer than the charging port because I just set the phone in the cradle and it charges via the external battery contacts.  The phone screen lights up, says \"Charging\", and all of the other things that happen during a normal charge.  I haven't opened that cumbersome cap since then.  I hear that the port is also for the proprietary headphone, but I cannot imagine anyone wanting that.  The old bluetooth headset from my previous flip phone works fine.If you do a lot of texting, you will hate having to use the telephone keypad since this is a very retro way to peck out a message.  If you want to post to Facebook or other things that the kids are into, you will also find this lacking.  I just don't want to pay $300 for a fragile smart phone that wants $50 per month in fees for such frivolity.  My desktop computers are substantially more powerful and have full sized screens and keyboards that are better for that.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Phone, Bad Battery", "Author": "Terri K.", "ReviewID": "R1ZJBEUFTUPV55", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone is exactly what I wanted and was actually delivered sooner than expected.

But after 6 months, while unplugging the phone from the wall charger, the USB connection attached to the circuit board broke off, staying attached to the charger cable. This simply should not happen unless the solder connections were faulty. We decided to pay for the shipping to return the phone to Casio for service. But several weeks later we received a postal letter stating this was not a manufacturer fault but abuse of the phone. We would need to pay $89 for repair. I was out of town for a week so couldn't manage to call them during their limited hours.
