If you are interested in a non-apple smartphone, this is it!Primary function, being a phone, is outstanding. The phone has a good reception and you are able to have clear conversations even in noisy environments like games or construction sites.Additionally, the screen is amazing and very responsive. GPS, camera and Wi-fi works as expected. Form factor is adequate. The phone is slim and not so heavy.Despite of the bugs mentioned in several forums, I haven't found any.

How could a brand new fully functioning smart phone with Android, wifi, GPS, etc. be priced this low?  Sure the processor is a bit slower than the newest phones, Android is advertised as an outdated 1.5 but guess what - the darn thing works really, really well!  And Android was updated to 2.1 by Dell and is on it when you get the phone which opens the door to thousands of useful apps.  Do not depend on a Dell warranty.  Although the phone is new in a broken seal box, an attempt to register and activate the warranty falls short - a \"warranty expired\" message from Dell and they just barely support the phone on their website.  The seller can't explain why and only stands behind their 30 day return policy (with restocking fee etc.)although Amazon policy states a new, unlocked phone must carry a manufacturer warranty.  There is info in the box in Turkish and the phone can be set to their language which makes me think it was manufactured for the foreign market and probably purchased in bulk by the seller for whatever reason.  None the less, if you want a low cost entry into the Android smart phone world, give this little misfit a try.  If you can work around a compacted on screen keyboard and some useless proprietary apps (it was designed for AT&T;) you can actually have fun with it.  The wifi works great - I even setup free VoIP phone calls with my gmail account without a problem.  Every new app I've downloaded works.  If you don't need instantaneous response times, this complex light weight smarty will deliver.  Get a silicone cover cause it seems so light and fragile it could blow away yet it is sturdy and function keys are well placed once you get used to it.  Loading apps on the SD card is ackward but can be done. I've paid more for an MP3 player or a camera - speaking of it has auto focus and and LED \"flash\" and takes great photos that you can instantly send via your favorite media. Straight Talk mobile uses the AT&T; network and works great on this phone.  You have to buy their sim and the \"unlimited\" plan but you get the same massive AT&T; coverage and many options for about half the cost.  Any GSM sim will work I suppose.  Sorry I ramble, but I am beginning to feel like a found a real bargain and want to share.  I took a chance and am pleasantly surprised at this point.  We'll see as the days go by.  Shop around for the best price - I paid $66.00Dell Aero Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 5MP Camera, GPS and Wi-Fi - Black", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dell Aero Review", "Author": "R. Xavier", "ReviewID": "RWAUBGH2FM6BW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I also received the  phone in Turkish but I eventually found a solution online (contact me if you want the link).The bad reviews are unfortunate as it was the sellers problem - shipping items configured in Turkish. The phone works well and it is not slow out of the box. It comes with a 2 GB SD card which you can upgrade to 32 GB. To me it is comparable to the Blackberry 8520 that I use and a Nokia C6 that my wife uses (it has a bigger screen & is better looking too!).  I use my phones mainly for business so I cannot tell you much about facebook etc... Audible for android works fine. The only cons so far are: I cannot connect to my yahoo account (says I have to have a Yahoo plus account) and the battery life is average not great. It connects fine with gmail though.Bluetooth work well with my car radio and  I am very happy with it considering the price I paid. Dell has a video on Youtube where you can  see all the functions and how the phone works. I only have the phone for about a week now so  I cannot say much about reliability at this time.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "limited", "Author": "lewsurfer", "ReviewID": "R1LAVOR97ORTMG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I love the Dell line of products. In fact my last 2 computer purchases have been Dell and most likely my next purchase will be Dell. With this in mind I jumped at the chance to buy the Aero when it was offered on Amazon. I purchased the phone hoping to take advantage of its 3g capability. However that has  not been the case. I purchased the phone thinking that it would work on all gsm networks. My carrier is T-mobile. Thus far I can only make phone calls and text messages. I cannot use their 3g network, only the edge. This makes web surfing nonexistent. I contacted Dell technical support and was advised that the 3g capability only works on ATT, not T-Mobile. Not being able to connect for web data connection greatly diminishes the value of the devise. I do not know how the phone performs on other gsm networks, but I would advise those wanting to use it on T-mobile to save their money. You can find other phones for less that can provide you the same service.Now that I have complained, let me offer some other considerations for potential buyers. I have no problem accessing the web with this phone using wi-fi. I like the looks and feel of this phone. Its lightweight and sleek looking. Video is clean and crisp. Pictures look  good and its easy to use. Sound quality is better than most phones I've used in the past. I would have preferred it the have a 3.5mm jack connection, but you can  easily work around this. For these reasons, and the fact that I received the phone in 2 business days after ordering, I gave the device 3 stars.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Brian Boonstra", "ReviewID": "RFOTOGOLVZS93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For less than $100, unlocked, this is a darn good phone.  The software is reasonable, though not nearly as well thought-out as iOS from the same (2010) era, and it has a lot of very good technical specifications, such as GPS, multi-band GSM for worldwide usage, and a capacitive touchscreen.  You really can't find a modern Android phone with anything like a comparable price and feature set.  I successfully downloaded and installed a couple apps from the Android Market, and linked it to my Google account.I tested the phone with the SIM from a friend's AT&T; iPhone.  Data and voice calls worked fine.  To give you a sense of battery life I can say that after about 26 hours, awake and on Wifi but with no SIM installed the battery is just under 50%.  Plan on charging daily.My phone came with a European-style charger and US adaptor for its plug.  (That was actually great for me since I plan to use it in Europe.)  The phone came set to European time.  The box had some Turkish writing on it, and the box had been opened.  Taking all three of those facts together, I presume this phone (like those of other reviewers) came from Turkey.

Johnatty", "ReviewID": "R2DLPPB4SNQLNE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I feel compelled to review this phone, because i feel I could help prospective buyers. I bought two of these phones and I am reasonably satisfied with the purchase. Why two stars? I am very tech savvy although I havent fiddled with many phones. I have rooted and installed custom roms on a few androids. I bought these for my two 8yr old daughters who badly wanted a touch screen phone. However this phone is likely to frustrate most buyers who are thinking that they are getting something of a modern phone based on the appearance. The good - it can be had cheaply and it runs android from a fairly high res touch screen. The bad - it runs android 1.5 and its not upgradable. Despite the many that say its using Android 2+ there are no discussion on any of the android forums that describe how to get it running on 2+ other than some source files that appear on Dells site. If it were possible someone would have documented it - I see several failed attempts. This phone is the poster child of a failed android attempt by a very major tech company. The phone is very very slow and can run very few games without significant lag. A big part of the problem is Android 1.5. So it cannot run very many apps, its very slow BUT its very cute and looks great for the price - something that will appeal to my 8 yr olds. For most other users I would suggest looking elsewhere and the phone has almost no functionality. The interface that Dell insisted on putting is another part of the problem - its very unintuitive and frustrating. Buy this phone only if you want a cool looking phone for a low price, and dont care about apps and speed. The power plug on the phones I bought did not work - they had multiple adaptors that was falling out the US AC sockets and looked more of a fire hazard. They also use the OLDER USB mini jack and the headphone is not a standard headphone jack (USN mini). The battery life is poor and the phones wake up from sleep (both do) every few minutes which further drains the battery.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Cupcake version Android 1.6 for the Money", "Author": "Gerald", "ReviewID": "R2H9ANSIWFG9VA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In order to make this phone work with T-Mobile or other 2g-4g carriers, you need to modify the APN Android 1.6 settings according to the carrier settings.

It is my official first smart phone so I naturally loved it. It did everything I wanted done such as planning events on the calender, texting, alarms, phone calls and snapping pictures. It felt fast, complete and professional. Very nice and compact to carry around in my picket and loved the earbuds that came with it to listen to my MP3 songs (purchased of course) and even could connect with many of my other devices via usb.Now a few months later problems started to surface:1) It is painfully slow to use for online purposes and as a employee on the go at times I need to search for things quickly and cannot always access my laptop so I have to rely on my mobile and with such a slow processing speed for internet this becomes a chore. Both 3G and Wifi.2) The battery seems to sap incredibly quickly regardless of little applications being active and the brightness turned down to the minimum. I have to charge it at least 2 times a day to use it properly.3) Recently the battery has become more ridiculous, it dies within an hour or 2 regardless of how long its been on charge and even more so the time/date setting reset to random settings. Just yesterday my phone was set to 2015, this also makes no sense since the phone remembers my alarms, files, and various settings but will continue to reset the one setting that I need to keep setting to keep up my alarms and plans.Overall its a temporarily to use product which is disappointing. I really liked this phone and it saddens me how it degraded to such a travesty of a device in under a year. Needless to say though this isn't the first time a dell product has crapped out on me. If you want to use a new smart phone for a limited time go ahead and purchase this at your own risk.

You insert the provided battery and your SIM card, charge it up....and wait awhile. The wait is actually middle of the road unimpressive. I used my Kindle Fire's charger to encourage it along.Once I turned it on, the fun began.WARNING: Whatever it is that you'd like to use this phone for, IT DOESN'T WORK. At least, not reliably. Need to call the kids to make sure they got home safe and sound? Maybe you will and maybe you won't. Want to shoot them a text since the calling mechanism sounds like so much dead space suddenly? Yeah, ok, sometimes. How about an email? Yeah, well, about that....This is the thing. If you'd like to feel like a cross eyed and dizzy air traffic controller with 48 planes all demanding to land now, then by all means, get this phone.WARNING: You must have a Google account to unlock the \"potential\" of this phone. Seriously. It spits snark at you if you don't key in some satisfactory Google username and password pronto. Something about factory settings. Whatever man.WARNING: Sometimes--because it hates you--your phone will forget you have a cell phone carrier, even if it plainly displays said. carrier for all to see. It has no problem doing this in the middle of a phone call you initiated. When this happens, several options are available to you. If you are connected to Wi Fi, it will continue the call so long as you are relatively close. Wi-Fi range for this phone is reminiscent of an Old West shoot out. Three paces, turn, and you're dead. Why? Because the other guy knew not to go so far away. Try using this phone after three paces and you will likewise find it dead.WARNING:  While this is an Android it is the most offensive excuse for one I've ever seen. Be prepared for multiple, constant, inexplicable, and overlapping crashes of even the most basic apps in addition to recurring announcements that these apps have crashed without you restarting them.....Which leads to....WARNING: Be prepared for quick and multiple battery exhaustion during the same day.You will need to have a charger handy if you plan to so much as keep the phone on. Which leads to my next point...WARNING: However much money you save on this phone will be spent tenfold on antidepressants, high blood pressure meds, psych meds, anger management counseling, etc.You deserve better than this.
