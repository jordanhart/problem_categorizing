{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect phone for light cell phone users", "Author": "Johntastic", "ReviewID": "R381TZ8ZIEULFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use the Boost pay as you go plan. I only use my cell phone for around two minutes a day, so the plan is absolutely perfect for me. Texting is 10 cents as well - to send and recieve - which can get surprisingly expensive quickly. If you're a textaholic, go with Virgin's monthly texting plans.Anyway, the phone isn't great, but it is so better than some of the other entry level prepaid cell phones I have had *points to Tracfone, ATT GoPhone and espically Net10*. I see people complaining that the phone seems easy to break. Here's the solution: Be gentle with your phone! If you can't, get one designed for \"rugged\" use. And if any of the covers break for this phone, you can get a replacement cover on amazon for around $4.The screen, yes, it kinda sucks. It's grainy and the colors seem washed out. Does this bother me? Not really. If you're one to look at your phone a lot, espically for web related stuff, stay away from this phone. But if you just need to talk and text (sometimes), it's perfect.The calling quality is decent, and far exceeds most entry level prepaid phones (I'd definately prefer it to the blue Samsung cameraphone that Verizion's prepaid service uses).The only issue I really have with this phone is that the button layout is somewhat irritating. The directional pad buttons are surrounded by other buttons that activate various features (see picture), so it's easy to press the wrong thing. But I paid $20 for this phone, so I do not expect it to be without some flaws.I do like this phone. It's a prepaid phone that I'm not ashamed to pull out and use. Go for it if you just need a basic prepaid phone!", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Phone: You get what you pay for; Service: Not bad", "Author": "R. Johnston \"jrbaytown\"", "ReviewID": "RMWN3XL4DPM7Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Regarding the phone, it touts all of these great features, \"Multi-media\", Wireless Web, Color Screen, Picture Viewer, Java Enabled Games and Applications, GPS Enabled.  That's great...but the quality of the screen is so grainy that you can't even tell what most of the icons are, the screen always looks faded and it looks like one of the first color-screen cell phones that came out.The phone is obviously very breakable, as the battery cover (the entire back of the phone) pops off and is a flimsy piece of plastic that anyone could easily bend and it would snap without any effort.  If (or more likely when) I drop it in the parking lot the whole back and battery will most likely fly in opposite directions...can't wait!  And the plastic cover for the charger/earphones is waiting to pop off any day!Seriously though, for the price, currently $29...it's a deal.  It's no iPhone, just a mediocre cell phone with a great price and some nice features.  Quality of picture vs. price is my biggest complaint.  I would have gladly have paid a few extra bucks for a better picture quality phone screen...and do not let the picture of the phone on this website or boostmobile.com fool you, the screen is not that crisp, not easy to read and some of the icons leave you wondering what the heck does that mean.  I'm actually thinking of taking it back and exchanging for another phone.One last thing, boostmobile.com says this phone has bluetooth, it does not.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Boost will cancel all Motrola i425 in June 2013", "Author": "Gift Card Recipient \"welrdelr\"", "ReviewID": "R1A8XAMKM03UK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Motorola i425 have a iDEM chip in them and in June 2013 Boost will not be cancelling all i425. If you have an i425 that is presently on Boost and has time on it you can take to a boost store and trade it and get a  Rumor Reflex for free (have to pay tax) the Rumor Reflex qualifies for the Pay as you go Boost plan and it has a camera and slide out key board.  Boost has already canceled my Motorola i425 and I complained as I had $300.00 of time on it. Boost claims that I did not re boost in time.. yet I have a receipt from Walgreens showing I purchased a Re-Boost card and I re boosted two phones on the same day and the other one is okay...  I think this is just a way of cutting back on honoring Boost's responsibility to furnish  service and give me two new cell phones....", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Want a REAL TIME GPS Tracker cheap?

Wells", "ReviewID": "R12Z9P91JXT3FM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I switched over from Tracfone to Boost Mobile thinking maybe I'd get a better deal and a nicer phone, but man was I ever mistaken. I paid $40 for the i425 phone and both the phone and Boost Mobile service are terrible! The phone is extremely slow and takes forever to start up when you power it on or when you use various functions. There is a big delay between when someone sends you a text message and when you receive it, and when you finally get a message it can take over 30 seconds to download it which is ridiculous. And sometimes when you send text messages to people they won't even receive them, but you still get charged for sending them!If you'd like to use this as an emergency phone, think again. Whereas tracfone displays how many minutes you have left directly on the phone display, with Boost Mobile you must call a special service number to check your minutes, which makes it difficult and inconvenient to keep track of how many minutes you have. The phone's battery life is also extremely short and lasts only a few hours. So if you get in a situation like I was in and become stranded somewhere and need to call someone for a ride but your phone runs out of minutes or the battery goes dead, you can thank Boost Mobile.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Caveat emptor", "Author": "Hoke", "ReviewID": "RRNUWVQOB0PNK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This review is not intended to review the phone listed here specifically but is rather focusing on the service that accompanies this phone.  Since the phone and service are both necessary to make this product functional I believe it is appropriate if I write a blanket review for every Nextel phone listed on Amazon.  After all, these reviews are meant to help the consumer make an informed purchase and this review will serve in that role.I had problems with my Nextel service almost from the beginning of my 2 year contract.  I would experience repeated dropped calls in my apartment.  Since I had no landline the use of my cell in my apartment was very essential to me.  Repeated calls to Sprint/Nextel failed to resolve the problem.  They would either tell me they would look into the problem or that there was sufficient coverage in my area.I pointed out that if there was sufficient coverage for my area that I would not be experiencing dropped calls so frequently.  Apparently my logic was lost on them.  They then told me that concrete building would interfere in the signal.  I informed them that my apartment was a wood structure and actually had quite good clearance from the sky.  I also asked why the Sprint/Nextel signal was experiencing so much trouble but my work cell (Verizon) seemed to work fine.  I have since switched carriers and as of yet have not experienced one dropped call.I eventually felt compelled to buy out my contract at $200 after one year.  I sent complaints to my State Attorney General as well as the Better Business Bureau.  Sprint/Nextel responded to both of these complaints with the standard line they had given me about adequate coverage for the area.My intent on filing these complaints was to compel Sprint/Nextel to make good on their failure to live up with their end of the agreement i.e. providing coverage to my cell.  They have decided that $200 is worth more than a reputation of standing behind their service.It is my opinion that Sprint/Nextel is the worst company I have had the misfortune of doing business with in at least the past 5 years.  In fact, never has a business in my experience done so little to try to make things right with a customer.I would encourage anyone considering doing business with Sprint/Nextel to talk with people they know in their area that has used the service.  Had I done so when I was initially looking into cell phones I would have steered far away from Sprint/Nextel.  Perhaps other people have had better experiences in other areas.Sprint/Nextel you had a chance to make right.  I am guessing that if just one or two people are persuaded by my reviews then it will cost you well in excess of $200.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000VXVGAY"}}
