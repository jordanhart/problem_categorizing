I didn't want him to go to web and incrue a big bill and if he happenes to push the web button inadvertently,this phone shows a warning message. Many other phones usually just let you go to web and charge you later. So I like that a lot about this phone. It is also very simple to control the volume.

You don't have to use the SIM card for the prepaid plan that comes in the package. I just took the old SIM card out of the old cell phone and put it into this new phone, and that was all it took to switch the service for the old cell phone number to this phone.Something awesome that discovered is that is phone changes on a standard microUSB cable, so if you already have a Kindle charger, it will work for this phone also!It was very easy to add items to the \"Go To\" menu for quick access to make it silent and to check voicemail.The only thing I don't like about this phone is that it doesn't have a screen on the outside. When a call comes in, you have to open the phone to see who is calling. Not much of an issue for me. It does have a default setting that when you open the phone during an incoming call, you can choose to answer or decline the call. It does not automatically answer when you open it.Nice compact phone that slides easily into pocket or purse! I have been very happy with it!", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect little phone", "Author": "yurih", "ReviewID": "RSTT21ZB52SIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for my mom who lives abroad, but needs a phone when she visits me.

I needed a quick, cheap phone to get me through the next week or two.  This was the cheapest phone I could find; popped my SIM card into it (it requires the larger SIM, but you can still position the tiny sim and it works) and voila, working phone.  Obviously it's basic; no camera, no internet, not even any games, but it makes calls and texts.This is a bare bones \"calls and texts\" phone, but I have to say it has fantastic reception and works for what I need it for.  If you are in a bind and need a phone for temporary or basic purposes, I would highly recommend this particular one.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable Price - Go For This Phone!", "Author": "Craig Hamilton \"Craig Hamilton\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMKXNCY9ZD8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is totally awesome.  It is excellent for text based internet, like Facebook.  I totally love the T9Eab function, such that I find it more useful and quicker to use once (once you get used to it).  So for, cell phones that have a keyboard, generally I feel that once you get used to T9Eab, you will never want to go back.  Additionally, as a bonus with this function, you can add words to the T9Eab vocabulary.It does have a small screen.  That can either be a bonus or a bane.  For me, personally, it's a bonus.The A157 is also perfect for checking one's email.  I use Gmail, and here and there during most days, I use this phone to read my email.Be warned though, there are some features of websites that this phone can't handle, such as buying at amazon.com.  If you use Amazon, then I recommend connecting with a computer with a larger screen.  Thus, though this phone can't buy via Amazon.com, it would probably not be good enough as a computer to use Amazon's functions anyway, and that is neither plus nor negative.  The reason being, size.  If you want a small phone, that is well constructed, and has some internet function capabilities, go for this phone!I personally use my phone as an emergency phone, usually paying just $15.  I spend $5 for internet, and roughly $9 in emergency calls.  That is unbeatable!The one thing I feel that is actually lacking with respect to the A157, is that it can't interface with say a laptop or a desktop to be a source of internet capability.  Yet, for $20, I still feel that you really can't beat the price of this phone for the functionality of it.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Combat Medic Approved", "Author": "Dong Zhang", "ReviewID": "R2D7O9SPRSGVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simple and reliable.

I bought it to replace another basic AT&T; cell phone that stopped working.  I'm not one of those 'play on the internet all day' people, although I fall into the typical demographic - 30-something, middle-class, etc.Anyways, my wife has an iPhone and she uses it for work and play.  I work a job where I'm not even ALLOWED to have a cell phone on my person and if I'm caught with one it can lead to disciplinary action!  Enter the Samsung a157 GoPhone.  It's a phone that does what a phone is supposed to do - MAKE/RECEIVE CALLS.  Also, I can text with it(sometimes required when talking is not optimal).  I believe it can be used to access the internet, but my plan is for talk/text only so I've got no experience with that.Reception is good, but that could be due to the provider.  I like the sleek appearance and size(it fits in those little 'pockets inside of pockets' in men's pants for cell phones easily.  I can't say that for some of the 'is it a tablet or a cell phone?' devices out there.  The picture makes it appear two-toned black/gray.  That is just the flash of the photographer as it is all black.  It's not made 'vision-friendly' with larger-than-normal keys even though it looks like it could be(I often get ribbed for my 'Jitterbug' phone).  Everything is well laid-out and I don't have any problems accessing my Contacts List or changing Settings.Finally, I like that I paid only 15 bucks for this phone!  I just transferred the SIM card of my old AT&T; phone to this one and 'Viola! - New Phone'.  I once washed it in my jeans and after a couple days in a baggie of rice it was good as new.  I may have sweated a little bit if it were my wife's iPhone, for example, but I knew that even if the 'rice trick' didn't work I just needed to spend less than I would for two movie tickets for a new one.  4 stars for being a good, basic phone.Jae", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useless if it doesn't work", "Author": "Lauren B. Castleberry", "ReviewID": "R1E5VAHVX3O5FH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone a couple months ago.  From the time it arrived, it kept powering off - even when the battery was fully-charged.  Sometimes it would stay on for a few hours;  sometimes it would make it a day.  Sometimes it wouldn't even make it half an hour.  It did it even when it was plugged in.Dud, I figured.  It happens sometimes... understandable.  But since it was brand new, and since it seemed like a waste to throw away a brand new phone, I went ahead and contacted Samsung email support.  The hoops they made me jump through to diagnose my $15 phone were ridiculous.  Then, when they finally agreed that it was a legitimate problem, they told me that I had to call the support line to create a repair ticket.  An hour-long call and lots of rehashing later, I had my RMA info.  Sent in the phone... waited a couple weeks... finally got it back... and it still has the same problem!  What a waste of time.  As much as I like the simplicity of this phone, I'm not going to waste another $15 on a new one.

I got this phone for emergency backup to my main Smartphone (Galaxy Note II) and it's been a task in attempting to remember all the old functions and navigation from the early cell phone days.  Having to actually read the manual to discover the myriad functions I clumsily got through the various set ups to include voice mail, making calls, sending texts, building the address book with current contacts and that sort of thing which is second nature easy on the modern device.A word of caution:  One can easily insert the Sim card backwards as I did on my initial attempt.  Going back, I re-placed it with the notch in the card matching the notch on the inner lining of the phone itself.  Had I carefully read the instructions, I would have known this but haste made for frustration.  The same could be said for setting up the phone with the basic functions so a word to the wise there.  The call quality is very good and once back up to 'old speed', the various navigation movements can be done with minimal drama.I plan on carrying the a157 fulltime in my main vehicle along with the appropriate mobile charger for those times I might forget taking my Note II with me OR when one of the phones is outside its calling zone.  The a157 is AT&T; while my other phone is with Sprint.  I elected to bite the bullet and take the 10cents a call package, paying the $100 for a full year so I wouldn't have to renew the thing every few months or so.  AT&T; dings you for EVERYTHING on this unit!  Checking voice mail?  Ding.  Setting up voice mail? Ding.  It does provide a current standing after every usage as to where you stand with the financials so that's somewhat helpful.Summing up, it's an okay phone and if what you want or need is the basic stuff or, like me, a seldom used backup, I think you'll be okay with it too.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok phone", "Author": "andrew", "ReviewID": "R2E5UKQHKF5MHR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved the style of this phone but the volume was not loud enough even when I turned it alll the way up I also could not hear the text messages I got", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm loving it.", "Author": "Santiago", "ReviewID": "R3SYPA8C5KJ06Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really its worth for the money.

I returned the phone to Amazon and am still waiting for a response. I have good faith Amazon will refund my money and contact seller that the phone they sold me may truly have been stolen or removed form Best Buy without a purchase.

I live in a remote area of the Columbia River Gorge and am blessed with cell phone towers that are not too far away, also I benefit from being up high on a hill.  I've had really good reception from all the cell phone carriers that I've chosen for the past 10 years including AT&T.;  Free phones have been the best deal in the past, even though they came with a one year contract, with far superior quality and reception. Things have certainly changed. I bought this phone through Walmart thinking they have a good return policy on phones. Walmart had major trouble trying to scan this package and it took a supervisor 15 minutes to wrestle with it before I got charged, I felt bad for all the people waiting behind me.  So I went home and fully charged the phone as the instructions said and tried to activate the phone.  It was really difficult and I spent many hours trying over and over.  I finally got the thing activated, new phone # and tested it,  but the voicemail did not work.  Also, the reception was very poor.  It worked for about 2 hours and then suddenly stopped working.  I was able to call AT&T; but the call went to their security department.  Apparently I was being investigated for stealing this phone from Walmart, but they realized that Walmart had failed to scan the phone properly and they told me to return the product to the store and have it rescanned. There was no \"I'm sorry, this is not your fault\" from AT&T.;  So today I tried to return the phone to Walmart since it does not work because of their failed scan, I want nothing to do with AT&T; and this stupid phone.  They told me they could refund the price of the phone (14.95), but the card could not be refunded ($25). Thank goodness I didn't buy the $100 phone card.  Problem is I can't use the card without an AT&T; phone and I have no intention of doing any business with AT&T.; Needless to say, I will not be shopping at Walmart any more.... and this phone is trash, clearly not worth all the trouble.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not contain a sim card", "Author": "H from SPhilly", "ReviewID": "R38HTQAO8L17BJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone for my brother.
