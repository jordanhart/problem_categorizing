I picked the Dash because it runs the same operating system as Pocket PCs, which have been around for years.  This means the Dash can run all of the programs that were made for Pocket PCs, allowing you to choose from thousands of games, office apps, music players, video players, and tons more.The phone is quite easy to use, and the keyboard feels great.  Overall, I've been extremely happy with the Dash, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good smartphone for a low price.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Ro", "ReviewID": "R2KGJ7SZEKTMC4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because it is the only phone T-Mobile carries that is compatible with Mobilespeak, a screenreader for cell phones. I went blind a year ago, and did not have an accessible phone. After installing Mobilespeak, the Dash became fully accessible. I can now text again, though on the full keyboard, its taken some getting used to doing it blind. The 5 key is the D key, so there is a raised bump there which helps me find my place. I have the sounds all routed through my blue tooth, even the screenreader, so I have privacy for texting and so the computerized voice does not annoy people. I get baseball text alerts too. The sound quality is excellent, and all my calls are crystal clear.The design is slim which is comfortable for holding, but doesn't work so well if the need arises to prop the phone on my shoulder. There is a touch strip on the side  of the screen to adjust volume during calls, but I prefer the old buttons on the side of the phone to do this.The internet works well and is fairly fast. I don't know if it is the screenreader, or the fact that it is a Windows phone, but it tends to freeze if I go too fast. Popping the battery out resets it, and this is easy to do even though I can'tsee.The windows on the phone open and close like a Windows computer and they are easily navigated.All in all, I like it, but mostly because of the screenreader I have installed. I do like the audio quality though; it is better than my old Samsung flip phone.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone I have ever owned", "Author": "Jessica D. Rocha \"Jessica Rocha\"", "ReviewID": "R22ESYL7ZIMRJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone, its been my favorite out of many. And I have had lots. The phone is very durable, I have dropped it plently on times and it still works. The screen is glass and it had never broken. The buttons are amazing. Makes texting so much easier. Its kind of like a keyboard. You can type without looking. Its very small and thin.Cons: It can freeze up if you have too many programs open. The programs dont close on their own. If you just close it, its most like minimizing the screen. Once a day I clear of the programs open to avoid this issue. You just go to the task manager and close all functions.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone But!", "Author": "Wassamon420", "ReviewID": "R2WPE5BJO7BMP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone came is great condition dont get me wrong i love the phone even those its 2010 and this is a little bit older phone but hey i use prepaid so this is like getting a new iphone for me..Well the only thing i had to say that was really bad was the shipping..I came home one day tired hoping one ill get my phone.

I love the calendar feature and the full keyboard.  A couple of months ago I dropped it and the LCD screen cracked! (I have a snap on cover but it was not on at the time) I didn't want another phone, I wanted my phone!  So instead of paying for a new phone, I ordered a brand new LCD screen with the tools and I replaced it myself! I spent about $37.00 for the new screen vs.$200 to $300 plus for a new phone!  That is how much I love mine. Incidentally, I just ordered two new snap on covers....as I just dropped it again yesterday...with the cover ON and all was fine!! I highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst \"Smart\"Phone Ever Created", "Author": "K. Barker", "ReviewID": "R2TXWY5YNHZ1MU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After the untimely death of my Blackberry (by toilet), I switched over to the Dash. This phone is the worst phone that has ever been put on the market. It is so awful that I am willingly switching over to a Nokia brick phone.Battery life: I am a college student and I have a 2 hour break between one of my classes. I pass the time by grabbing something to eat and looking up the news on my Dash. After a solid 10hr charge time (got to sleep in that day!) The phone died from using it in those two hours -- precisely, I sat down to eat at 1:27pm, it died at 2:43. That's just over an hour of internet usage. Fully charged. And this was not the first time.Volume controls: you have to press a side button that's more like a \"slide\" than a button. Problem is, the only time you can change the volume of your phone calls is in that phone call, so if you are scrambling to answer the phone, you may have \"slid\" your finger over the button and now you won't be able to hear your calls. Alternatively, you may not be able to hear at and and frantically slide your finger over the volume up button. The only time I've switched the volume is by accident.Alarm glitch: I put an alarm on my phone and shut it off for the evening. Unlike a Blackberry, Dash does not produce an alarm UNLESS IT IS ON. I turned on my phone fifteen minutes after my alarm was supposed to go off -- and that was three weeks ago. My phone TO THIS DAY has an alarm go off at 9:30am despite me disabling all the alarms. Tmobile store says they have no idea why that is after looking over my phone.Put your money somewhere else -- it isn't worth it.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really good phone", "Author": "Lornapone", "ReviewID": "R137UD7PSIKGYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this one a second time around as a family member had one from 2007 and it still works well.Really good phone,great camera, easy to use, wi fi ready, connects quickly to the net, reads PDF and other documents.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "question", "Author": "smtcmt258", "ReviewID": "R13OZSXR1F1N43", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "can you use this phone without a SIM card? if not, you need to put this on the description that it requires a SIM card, i ordered this not knowing you need a SIM card. thanks for NOT telling me", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ok phone", "Author": "Nika", "ReviewID": "R17M065BS81R13", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before I bought this phone.

It works OK, signal is better than my old phone had but sometimes it is not too clear sound at another side when you talk. Be aware that this phone comes with charger only (no accessories like USB cable, manual or headset). I downloaded Dash manual from the Internet and it says that a new phone comes with those 3 accessories so I called to Amazon help and was told that I can return the item for a full refund.
