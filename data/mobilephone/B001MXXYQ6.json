The slider is pretty solid & even after a number of weeks of use their has been no degradation in it's action. The only obvious weak point I would say is the camera 3.2M pixels. The build materials are a nice mix of metal & plastic, I especially like the hardened glass used on the display which certainly seems to live up to it's non-scratch nature so far. Overall though maybe not quite reaching the very best of Samsung phones, it is much better built than any N series device I have owned of late. Be interesting to see how it holds up over time.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Ericsson G705", "Author": "Roberto", "ReviewID": "RND4K2YM72HGR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The letters associated with each key are small: ABC, DEF, GHI, etc.Only two languages for to change settings English and Chinese.
