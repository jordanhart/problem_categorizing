I am mostly home, as I work PT out of my house.  I had been a loyal Sprint customer for 11 years.My Sprint contract was coming up.  This time, instead of just rolling over and accepting another 2-year contract (with new \"dumb\" phone), I decided to look around.If I would have upgraded to a smartphone with data plan, my bill with sprint would have jumped by over $30 to nearly $100/mo for just my cell phone.  So for someone who averages 75 min. talking and a lot of text messages, I couldn't see adding that much to our monthly bill.Enter T-Mobile Monthly 4g.  Wow!  I get 100 min per month and unlimited text/data, and it's less (per mo.) than I was paying with Sprint? I can definitely work with that!  So I researched all their phones and spent time on foot viewing different models.  I was unable to find the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G in any store.  I knew that the Galaxy SII was too large for my small hands and just didn't feel comfortable to me.  The Galaxy S Blaze is basically the same as the SII, just smaller, with some weaker features (camera).I have been using this phone for over a week now and am EXTREMELY HAPPY!  We get spotty reception in our home and this phone has the capability of wifi calling.  So I can have perfect phone reception inside my home.  I also use wifi for data while I'm home.  It's much faster than what I can get w/o.I was able to sync the phone with my itunes and now have all music on the data card.  I bought a 32gb mini sd from Amazon.  That beefs up the storage space considerably.  I also upgraded the firmware to Android Ice Cream Sandwich.This phone now replaces my ipod touch and my \"dumb\" phone.I couldn't be happier!This is a great phone!

It is his first phone and he is used to what my iPhone can do.  I was not about to pay contract prices for him.  He is a texter and netflix user, not a talker.  I believe his unused 100 monthly minute alotment will roll over for month to month, for up to 3 months, so that may give him some extra talk time if he does get chatty in a particular month and its .10/minute after that.  Data coverage is good in the area he is in for 90% of his life, but falls quickly when traveling off major interstates and highways, but he still is able to text/talk in most of those areas.  He charges the phone nightly and that will get him through the day even with heavier usage.  The phone seems faster than my iPhone4, screen is definitely not as good, but still adequate!!Bottom line is that this seems BY FAR, the best no contract smart phone that my reasearch led me to (for less than $300).  Could not justify Virgin mobile's $600 iPhone plan for him.  I had been putting him off for months on this purchase because I wanted to get it right the first time.  There are other carriers that offer similar $30-35 no-contract plans, BUT the phones they offer based on reviews by users, I feel, were all JUNK.  Based on reviews online and tmobiles user reviews, I knew I finally put this search to an end.  The Blaze is a slightly toned down version of the Galaxy S2.  Small enough and light enough for him to pocket it.HE IS VERY PLEASED to have a smart phone that does it all.  Many of his friends got phones months and years ago, but my patience (read: CHEAPNESS) prevailed.  NOW all he has to do is take care of it and NOT LOSE IT!!!It's a COOL phone that has, in the month he has had it, worked flawlessly so far.  Thinking of replacing my wife's cheapo $50 LG800 (through NET10) with this one, it is SUPERIOR in all aspects and a perfect alternative to my BELOVED iPhone, which has spoiled me to accept NO cheap substitutes!!!UPDATE 9/28/2012-Still happy with phone, but the 100 minutes expire at the end of each month and do not roll over, which is a little disappointing.

It runs on Android 4.0.  If you read anywhere that it's on an older Android version, that information is outdated.  This phone has now been upgraded to 4.0, and if you buy it, it'll come with 4.0 already installed.  I bought this phone after having an Android 1.5 phone for too long.The Galaxy S Blaze 4G came out about a year ago, but I don't think it'll become dated anytime too soon.  It's basically the same as the Samsung Galaxy S2, with a few minor things missing (like HDMI port).  So, if you want a phone from the Galaxy family, and don't want to pay too much, I strongly recommend this one.  Plus, Tmobile is currently installing an LTE network, so I don't think it makes much sense to pay a lot of money for the Galaxy S3 which is on HSPA+.  The Galaxy S Blaze 4G is on HSPA+, but it's cheaper, and a great phone to have until LTE is fully up and running, IMO.  I don't do too many crazy things with this phone, but this phone has everything most people use smartphones for.I love the size, it's about the size of an iPhone.  It might be marginally smaller than the Galaxy S2.  So, if you're looking for something about as big as the iPhone or S2 (as opposed to the giant S3 and S4), this is your phone.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone loaded with bloatware", "Author": "jokah", "ReviewID": "R313CLH9AD9SQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the Blaze for a few weeks and wanted to give my initial impressions.  To put these comments into perspective, I was previously using a Samsung Dart (3G, Android 2.2 - see my other reviews).  The Dart is decent for a starter smartphone, but after installing a few apps and updates, I quickly ran into app storage limitations not to mention that the Dart could not take advantage of the 4G data network.The Blaze, on the other hand, is incredibly fast, which is to be expected with a dual-core processor.  The face appears to be glass (but not Gorilla Glass).  Size wise, the phone is slightly wider than the Dart, but not quite as wide as the Galaxy S3 (which is a bit more than I prefer to carry esp. once you add a case) and fits very comfortably in my front pants pocket.Before purchasing the phone, I went into a TMO store to give it a test run, which included downloading and running the DiskUsage app.  Although the specs boast 4 Gb of internal storage, it seems that the pre-installed software (and there is a LOT of it) cuts the available app storage to roughly 1 Gb.  I believe this should be sufficient for most users, but it is something to be aware of if you load tons of apps onto your phone.Battery life seems to be better than average for a smartphone.  FWIW, I have gotten into the habit of charging overnight as well as a few hours in the office.Given the price ($300 w/o contract through T-Mobile web included a $50 prepaid refill card), I am quite satisfied overall.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "stingerdoc", "ReviewID": "R1Q4QWGHZ5A3EE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "bought this phone as a replacement for my aging Galaxy, what an improvement!Went from eclair to ice cream sandwich and noticed the speed was awesomeit seems to be a bit more temperamental in that it's easier for calls to drop but  I also live in badsignal area.where I would have to wait minutes for internet pages to load this thing does in a second or two.The battery lasts for about 12 hrs for me, maybe a little longer depending on use, i am not constantlyon it however the last phone lasted about 6 to 8 hours in comparison.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is pretty great!", "Author": "Gaea", "ReviewID": "RU0U0OV2E7OGR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about 3 weeks.

It has a 4\" screen, which was the big attraction for me (I don't want a larger phone). I use T-Mobile.The reviews online are correct that the screen on this phone is not great, but you can look at the phone and judge for yourself whether that's a deal breaker. The bigger problem is the software. It's got Samsung's theme on top of Android, and it's accompanied with a lot of T-mobile garbage, some of which seems to be placing widgets on the screens.I switched from a stock android phone with a failing power button. Both my old and new phones are Android 2.3.6. I _much_ prefer stock Android. I would pay extra for a phone with stock android (would have bought a nexus but it's too big).Please T-Mobile and Samsung (and Verizon and ATT and HTC) give users the ability to switch to uncluttered stock android and see what people choose. Maybe folks would prefer Samsung's overlay and T-Mobile's clutter, maybe not.

It may be a mid range phone, but they packed the same dual core S3 1.5Ghz chip and 1 GB system memory, but a 4\" screen. Despite being slightly larger than the Exhibit II, it has the same resolution of 480x800. Samsung/Tmo updated the OS to Ice Cream Sandwich, which I'm sure will be the last update. I've had my Blaze for a few weeks. It's so much snappier and I'm very pleased, though I wish they had either kept the same smaller size or upped the resolution. I don't see the point of just making it bigger, though perhaps they had to since it now has one of their Super AMOLED screens. I have no idea what that means and don't care, but it looks fine to me. And finally, the coup de grace, the Blaze comes with LTE, so IF you get it in your area, it might get a speed and or reliability boost.  The design is certainly conservative but not cheap or even budget looking.  It also has a removable memory card and battery.

I bought this one for myself and it really blows me away. 4\" screen is still considered small enough to fit in your jean pocket, very nice design, feel, and look. The screen is really nice and super AMOLED is noticeably better than LCD. But comparing this screen to Exhibit II 4G's LCD screen, I find Exhibit's white is cool white (better), while Blaze's white is warmer white. BUT super AMOLED's color is very good - nice indeed. Also AMOLED seems to be less reflective than LCD. Dual core is fast! Internal (system+SD) memory is about the same as Exhibit II 4G, 1GB+1.6GB, though Blaze has 1GB RAM while Exhibit has 512MB. Blaze does come with a 4G microSD card which is quite useless for me as I bought and replaced it with a 32G. Blaze comes with gingerbread v2.3.6, and my Exhibit has v2.3.5.

Most sub-$200 phones cheap out on either the processor or the RAM. This one is packing 1GB RAM which is sufficient for Android 4.0 and up, plus a dual-core 1.5ghz qualcomm processor which is also pretty decent. However, Samsung's software is its own worst enemy.Samsung's phones use a software interface called \"Touchwiz\" which is basically a layer of software in between you, the user, and the Android Operating System. Samsung likes to pretend they're adding useful functionality, which is true in a few, limited cases -- but overall it slows your phone down by hogging a ton of RAM. You'll definitely notice after about a week that your phone is too slow.However, with some modifications, this phone is GREAT!CynagenMod, the most popular custom software ROM out there, has released a version of Android 4.4 for this phone. Android 4.4 is the very newest version, and is optimized to use as little RAM as possible. There are also a ton of other custom ROMs (Operating Systems based on Android) out there, and most of them will offer significant improvements over the software this phone comes with.Here's a link to where you can ask people about how to do some of the things I mentioned, and how to get started with installing custom ROMs: [...]And if you already know how to do this kind of stuff, this is the Android 4.4 ROM link: [...]After installing Android 4.4, this phone is so incredibly better than it was before.

Just remember to back up your data using ClockworkMod Recovery first!

For me, it's the perfect combination of compact size (4.79 x 2.48 inches) with a big screen (4-inch diagonal), a powerful processor (dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 running at 1.5 Ghz), and Android operating system (4.0.4). I like it BETTER than Samsung's flagship Galaxy S III because the Blaze is smaller; it's able to fit comfortably in a pocket. Blaze has good audio quality sending and receiving, snappy screen response, beautiful vivid screen colors, nice camera (5 megapixels), fast browser, and everything works. No strange reboots, no hanging apps. Reasonably-good battery life, but you will need to recharge during the day if you use the phone constantly (talk or surf all day). My complaints are minor. (1) There is no LED indicator, so the phone WILL correctly notify you of an incoming call or text when it's asleep, but if you miss it, then the phone goes back to sleep (black screen with no flashing indicator, no LED). You have to wake the phone to check if something came in that you missed. (2) The XT9 predictive text is a bit intrusive when it's turned on. It works, but it could be smoother and more intuitive. This can be fixed with an ad-on text app such as SwiftKey. (3) The emoticons in the SMS text dialogs are green \"Android\" illustrations showing smiles, laughter, love, etc... But they're poorly drawn and difficult to distinguish one from another. A smile looks like a little green blob, not very different from a laugh or a cry. Note that sent messages actually include only the original text characters :-) etc... and when you copy the text to another app, the original text characters reappear (as they should). So the problem is just the display.Besides these three quibbles, the Blaze is just about perfect for me. It's by far the best smart phone I've owned, and I prefer it to all other smart phones compatible with T-Mobile's network.

Cheaper and faster: Speed difference from iPhone is obvious with 4G and better processor. T-mobile provides with cheaper plans.2. Smooth and beautiful Video: I rarely watch TV/movies on a smartphone. This device made me think again. Quality of the movie screen is amazing - smooth and clear. Watching experience is close to laptop. I will enjoy this on flight.3. Camera: Without considering more resolution, this camera is better than the one in iPhone GS. It is much less sensible for small shaking.4. Wireless tethering: I didn't really care for tethering with 3G because of its terrible speed. But this device's 4G now and supposed to be 21 Mbps. After rooting, I first installed wireless tethering. And it works like a charm. This portable wifi router does not really make 21 Mbps but 8 Mbps but it's still practical.5. Unlimited expandability: Since it's android OS, unlike iphone, the device is not much restricted to expand. You can virtually install whatever you want.Cons1. Lack of internal memory: 500MB internal memory is too small to store apps. So after getting this device, you'd better start moving apps into internal 16G SD card. As I will mention about this below, however, not all apps can be moved to SD.2. Bloated apps: Unnecessary apps occupy in apps screen and some of them also automatically run. And most of these bloated apps can't be deleted nor moved to SD card. - Solution: Root and Titanium Backup. See the last part of this review.3. No flash LED: I rarely use it for taking pictures so it does not matter much to me. But it's one component people may want to have at some point. Besides, you can use it for other purposes with apps. As other devices in this price range have the LED, I am not sure why Samsung is not getting it with this excellent device otherwise.Root: Root is like easy jailbreak for Android device but without any downside. Of course Rooted device can be bricked and void of warranty but in reality, most of times, CS will fix the bricked device under warranty. Google \"Super One Click\" for more details.Titanium Backup: After root, get the Titanium backup app to delete all unnecessary apps. One thing to remember: don't delete telenav app because it will mess GPS up otherwise.In summary, root is almost required for this smart phone - root will take less than 30 mins. Other than that, with its amazing speed and powerful customizing ability from Android OS, I still have to figure out what it can do. This device is truly a personal computer + more in my hand.

We saw a Samsung in Walmart for $99.98 and thought it was a good fit.  While shopping in the mall we passed a T-Mobile booth that had both phones (the one from Walmart and the Blaze) on display.  We found out the Blaze was faster than the Walmart phone and had slightly more memory.  T-Mobile was selling refurbished Samsung Blaze phones for about $250!  We picked up the Blaze from Amazon for $139!The functionality is great, the Android software is up-to-date and the couple of apps we have loaded work well.  My wife is still getting used to her first smartphone and all it can do.  The call clarity is much better than her old Samsung flip phone and the pairing with her car's Bluetooth is much easier.  It took her a few tries to really get how easy it was compared with the old phone.  She has about 18 Gig of music on her phone and we used it the last trip when the hometown radio stations faded out.  The camera takes decent snapshots and the contacts list is (in her words) \"much nicer\".We are moving up to a complete voice, text and data plan and we will join the grandchildren in the technology we use daily.  oh yes, I'm on Social Security and the wife will join me in two years.

I was so excited about getting this phone so that I could easily take pictures/videos of my baby and send them to the grandmas.  However, the shutter lag of 2-3 seconds in dealing with a baby, especially, have made it difficult to capture 'the moment'.  Unlike the iPhone 4s that my friends have, there is a significant shutter lag from the time your finger touches the button until the time the picture actually takes.  I am also disappointed that the voice activated system has such a hard time going through my contacts (when I am trying to dial someone through voice activation), that sometimes it defaults to a \"google search\" of what it thinks I said, and I have to scroll back to look up the person by name and dial manually.  With the dialing screen being dark, sometimes in direct sunlight you can't see anything when trying to dial a number.  It bugs me that I can't seem to keep the screen \"unlocked\" during a call, and once the call starts there's no way to make the call options stay on the screen...they disappear unless you hit the \"unlock/lock\" button.  (If I'm missing something, some please walk me through the steps of how to make it happen.)It is a cute phone.  Its a good phone.

It was easily able to speed past my girlfriend's iphone 4 in terms of connectivity and in terms of processing I found no software it couldn't run. Rooting it was a chore but I didn't find I really needed to install too much stuff other than superuser. When I updated and it wiped my root access I didn't bother putting it back on. The tethering was the main thing I wanted root for and t-Mobile proved quite combative about that, but their prices for it were much more fair.I did come across a problem with the audio jack eventually. T-mobile was no help, they told me that the malfunction was my fault ** because I had them unlock the phone** No problem though, I sent it so Samsung, they replaced the entire side assembly and returned it to me in 7 days, round trip, audio problem resolved.** Cons** T-Mobile eventually proved to be the weak link with this phone and pushed me to a family plan with my parents on Verizon. Their customer service is just horrible. When I first signed up it took them 2 weeks and 8 phone calls to transfer my number. According to the FCC it's only supposed to take 24 hours and it actually took an FCC complaint to get my number transferred. after that it was gravy for about 9 months because I didn't have to talk to T-Mobile. I started running into service problems then though, texts with images attached wouldn't send. The tethering wouldn't work, the 4G started to slow down. Calls to T-Mobile just made things worse (literally worse, one tech managed to make the internet quit entirely before accusing me of making it quit working by having had it unlocked.)Now I have an iPhone 5 on Verizon. It's great. I love it. I still miss the Galaxy S Blaze though.

I first started with the basic smart phone for $100- but returned it- because it was so awful. Then went up to $300 for the Blaze. It's a heavy phone- does not have a clear screen- and forget about even seeing the screen in daylight! Also it shuts off too quickly- even at the highest setting- as it's supposed to go black when you put it to your face to talk- but when you are done- and want to end a call- it's black- and you have to play with the on-off switch- which is touchy to get it to go back on.  Horrible phone all round...spend another 100 and get the better model.
