{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good $99 4G LTE Smartphone Locked To MetroPcs", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2X0TY74EVQABH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG F6 is the larger screen \"twin brother of the LG F3. Both have high speed 4G LTE data and both are crippled by a very limited amount of internal memory for new apps and games.T-Mobile owns Metro and sells a version of the F6 at its mall locations that is locked to T-Mobile for $200 and it sells a version locked to MetroPcs for $99 on the MetroPcs website.  They are identical phones and both run on the T-Mobile 4G LTE network.On Day One, you must install a 16gb or 32gb memory card and select it as the default storage location.  Your music and photos should be stored on the memory card, saving space in the tiny internal memory for apps.The F6 works well if your town has 4G service which you can verify by entering your address on the coverage map on the MetroPcs website.The camera works well in bright sunlight but is not great indoors using flash.  Music sounds fine with good headphones or bluetooth speakers.The smaller brother of the F6 is the F3, which is about the size of the Apple iPhone 5c.  The F6 is a tad larger than the iPhone 5, but has a larger screen.  The F3 and the F6 are the same phone except for their size and screen size.In May, Metro released the new LG Optimus L70 which sells for just $49 at MetroPcs. The L70 is similar to the F6, but sells for half its price. The L70 has a 4.5 inch screen that is not as sharp as the 4.5 inch screen on the F6, but the L70 has Android Kitkat software, which is newer than the Jelly Bean software on the F6.  The L70 has only 4G HSPA+21, which is slower than the 4G LTE of the F6, but the L70 is still fast enough to stream music from Pandora Radio or videos from YouTube.  The F6 sell for TWICE the price of the L70.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "The perfect upgrade from LG Spirit", "Author": "johnklem", "ReviewID": "RNLYSTBU3MEXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compared to the LG Spirit, which is rightly loved by most users and which I owned for a year, the F6 brings the following improvements: SCREEN, same res but much better contrast and black levels; OS, Jellybean rather than ICS with most apps running more quickly and on occasion more stably, BATTERY, 25% higher capacity but even greater improvement in use; DESIGN, nicer to look at and to hold.I've owned the F6 for a couple of weeks now and it improves on the Spirit in every way that I wanted. Regarding storage, both phones offer 4GB while in practice making much less available. There is a difference in the way that the phones report the storage, perhaps a function of the different OSs. The Spirit seems to make all 4GB available while the F6 shows only 1.3GB as available. In practice they have similar limits and if you are a gamer or even an apps addict neither phone is for you.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price", "Author": "jairo", "ReviewID": "RB9K2N7HCCYEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is very good for the price, easy to use, good wi-fi sign, good display quality, i would like another better but i enjoy this.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, but internal memory is an issue.", "Author": "Skogkatt", "ReviewID": "R9S07OEVVA2Y2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like this phone, but, the internal memory is a nightmare. Trying to download Apps, and updates is annoying, and most of the apps can't be moved to the SD card.

For the price and what it is, it offers a ton of bang for your buck and I definitely recommend it! I use an iPhone 5S and also had an LG G2 (the superphone sibling of this F6) so I'm used to high end phones - but I really like the F6.Pros:- 4G LTE (compatible with MetroPCS, T-Mobile, and AT&T;, once unlocked)- 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon 400 CPU w/ Adreno 305 GPU (definitely midrange, not entry level)- 1GB RAM- 5MP rear-facing camera w/ flash and auto focus, and front facing camera for video chat and 'selfies'- 4.5\" qHD IPS LED screen (\"IPS\" = very wide viewing angles, not seen on cheap phones)- Large removable/replaceable lithium-ion battery and microSD slot for more storage space- \"QuickRemote\" app w/ infrared sensor to control your TV (mostly a gimmick but still fun!)- Physical home button is easy to use, and also serves as your multi-color service light for notifications (love this!)Cons:- No auto-brightness sensor (you'll have to adjust your brightness manually, not a big deal for most)- Could be faster or have more RAM, but this is a cheap phone!- Only 1.3GB user available memory for apps. I see a lot of people saying that is just utterly unacceptable, which I can see if you load up lots of games and apps.. but that's enough for me. I always use a microSD slot for my music and pictures and I don't download large games or apps to my phone; I download them to my tablet.All in all, a very nice phone for a small price tag. The screen is gorgeous for being on a cheap phone - thanks to the IPS panel - and the screen is just very responsive, which is important on a touch screen phone. It's thin and light, with a large battery. It's rated almost double that of my iPhone 5S! The camera is not top of the line you-can-print-and-frame-it, but will do just fine for Facebook, Instagram, and picture messaging. Call quality and speaker quality is good. When you're in a 4G LTE area, download speeds are just blazing fast. I would NOT buy a new phone without 4G LTE anymore. No, it's not necessary but everything loads instantly.. I like that. Like I said, it could be faster or use more RAM, but for the price, it's a GREAT buy. If you want something fancier, you'll have to open your wallet and step up to something like the LG G2 which is pricey.You'll probably compare this to the newer Optimus L70 also available on MetroPCS at a lower price tag, but you lose 4G LTE and step down to a Snapdragon 200 CPU w/ Adreno 203 CPU. Paying extra for the F6 is well worth it me but to each their own.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended ( If You are Willing to Root )", "Author": "John3:16", "ReviewID": "R3VVQUKVUGCXYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is far better than the F3 in every way except size.  The F6 ( MS500 ) is a solid mid range smart phone with good build quality, great Qualcomm processor, HUGE removable battery, nice screen, LTE etc. This phone supports high speed data via HSPA+ and LTE on both T-Mobile and ATT.  To access ATT the phone must be unlocked.  T-Mobile and Metro are less than forthright with unlock codes.  I unlocked my F6 for $1.90.The camera is rather mediocre 5 MP. The phone is crippled with only 1.3 GB of internal memory available to the user out of a total of 4 GB.  Don't consider using this phone unless you are prepared to root it, remove the bloatware and use an app like Link2SD / Apps2SD to store your apps on a microsd card. Rooted and correctly configured, this is one of the three best cellphones for the money ( the Moto G and Nokia 520 / 521 are the other two ).  Metro sells it for $99.  Forget the $20 rebate, Metro rarely honors rebates. Don't buy the phone if you are unwilling to root it. In stock form the F6 simply lacks enough memory to function smoothly.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "Display: 4.5-inch HD IPS with vivd and true-to-nature color\nCamera: 5-MP BSI autofocus rear facing camera\nInput: Touchscreen with Corring\nOS: Android 4.1 Jellybean", "Name": "LG Optimus F6 (MetroPCS)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-WoPc1S0L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IM4GIK2"}}
