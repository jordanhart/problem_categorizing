I only download the apps that I know I'm going to use. It's a low-end android phone so it should be viewed as such. But here are the things you CAN DO on this phone:*Watch Videos*Surf the web (Bing comes with the phone, i heard some bad reviewers dis-liking this, but all you have to do is download GOOGLE for free. I have both)*take video & pictures & share instantly on facebook/twitter/email*Text*play games*talkCONS*I am a 31 yr old woman and can type on this phone easily. However if you have big fingers/hands, this has a tiny screen and will probably be a problem for you.* I do wish this phone was a little bigger when surfing the net.PROS:Price (free with verizon)touch screen works flawlesslyMany accessories to choose fromAndroid 2.1 network works greatVideo clarityVoice functions (you can tell it to call someone and it has worked perfect everytime.)", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Deal EVER!!", "Author": "loyaltii11", "ReviewID": "R25CN045WA45TY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my phone. I was sceptical at first, buying a used phone for so cheap... but it works amazing. I haven't had any problems with it and i've had it for a few months now. it's an android phone... so i can dowload all the applications that i want. Best deal i have had in a long time. :)", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Marginal Smartphone", "Author": "Poogy", "ReviewID": "R1AOYPW835ELLP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I broke my Droid (the original one) and since the phone I wanted to replace it with wasn't going to be available for a month and I needed an interim phone, I purchased this one, as the least expensive smartphone Verizon had available.  Wow, I had no idea anyone made smartphones this poorly.Does it \"work\"?  Sure.  You can call on it, send and receive emails, take photos, surf the web, download apps.  Yes, it works.  But compared to my two and a half year old Droid, the screen is tiny, the keyboard fit for only very small hands pecking very carefully, the browser is slow to load, everything is cramped and difficult to read, the sound quality when playing back mp3s or videos is poor (including when listening with headphones), and the operating system is antiquated. It's a little like comparing an Atari videogame from the 1980s to the current state of the art, or using a computer running an ancient operating system.I understand that not everyone needs, or can afford, a top of the line smartphone.  However, the additional cost of a phone that's substantially easier to use--larger screen, faster, more up to date software--really isn't that much.  So I recommend anyone shopping for a smartphone, even someone who wants something basic, to spend just a little more.  It'll be well worth it.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Citrus Phone", "Author": "Gayl", "ReviewID": "R1IWYYS0O22GW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like the look and size of this phone, it is perfect for sliding into my pocket.

It is very easy to use and does everything that I need it to do such as mobile banking , facebook, etsy etc....

The navigation function only works if Wi-Fi is turned off.  This is by design - Verizon has crippled the phone.  It's not anBut it took no special effort to use on Page Plus.

I am not a heavy phone user and my needs are very simple.  for the most part I like this phone and it meets my immediate needs.Profile... Fits in my front shirt pocket or pants pocket quite comfortably. easy to pop the back off to access the battery or insert memory card.Keyboard...  I can type a message on the virtual keyboard without fat fingering the other keys. (medium sized hands)email... easy to set up and sync with many different types of accounts.  I had issues with my godaddy account, but a free application in the android marketplace solved that problem.Web... I don't do much web surfing on the phone other than to look up addresses and phone numbers.  This phone is OK for that.Blue-tooth... music streaming works flawlessly in my car but the sound quality varies.  I am not sure if it is because of the quality of the music file or issues with the bluetooth hardware in the phone; but it does come in at cd quality for the most part.  Voice quality is decent based on what people on the receiving end tell me, but when calls come in, they are frequently interrupted with static and garbled popping noise (it's not my speakers).Music Player... I use spotify and the application works perfectly; the built in music player also works great for playing music as well.performance.... This phone is average when it comes to performance.  It is prone to lag and will randomly stall.  It doesn't happen often, but then again I am not a heavy phone user.  Battery life is just ok... do not expect it to last longer than a day if you have wifi / gps turned on.Overall assessment.  Decent phone for the $$$ that I will probably keep for awhile provided nothing happens to it.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone but", "Author": "Run Lickety Split \"Rockin 64\"", "ReviewID": "R1HM1OZW7P6QJB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a great little phone but some of the apps on Google Play aren't compatible with this phone & it doesn't have very much memory so you can't add many apps no matter how much space is on the micro SD card.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!", "Author": "Liv", "ReviewID": "R1T9MSRTDF31VP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!

The keyboard disappears and types thing you didn't even come close to typing. It's slow, unresponsive. It's horrible. You can't download instagram or snapchat because it still says android market.

And I wish the question mark was on the main keyboard instead of having to shift for it all the time. I had a full fledged qwerty keyboard on my last phone in which the question mark was on its own key, and got use to it, so its a minor annoyance for me.For the heck of it I decided to download some games, the phone itself works fine with basic games but it was so slow with a game like Fruit Ninja that I couldn't even play it.For the first month the battery life was fine. I would have to plug it in every few days like any other phone, but after about a month the battery life dropped amazingly. A full charge would only last until about 12 in the afternoon, and that was with little-to-no use. A few texts here and there and checking the time every now and then.
