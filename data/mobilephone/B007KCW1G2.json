It has 3g speed & I love the email feature.  I just push the email button and up pops my yahoo acct.  I don't even need a computer anymore to write read or send emails.  That is a wonderful feature to me.  Below are more impressive features that this phone packs:* Slide-out QWERTY Keypad* 2MP Camera with Digital Zoom & Video* 3G High-Speed Data* Wireless Web Email Access* Instant Messaging* Multi-Media & Text Messaging* MP3 Music Player* Stereo Bluetooth* GPS Enabled* Supports micro SD(tm) Card up to 16GB (card not included)* Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting and Call Forwarding* Speakerphone with Voice Recognition* Downloadable Games, Wallpapers & Music Ringtones* 600 Entry Phonebook* Alarm Clock, Calendar, Calculator, To Do List, & Voice-Memo RecorderCONS:  The things that I do not like about this phone is the battery life, No apps, Not the greatest camera pixels, most pictures are blurry.  Still overall You will be impressedUPDATED: 04/22/11 I reduced this down to 3 stars because the battery life is just unreal.  It goes dead in less than 4 hours.  One night I took the fully charged phone off of the charger and put another phone on the charger to charge and before morning the phone was beeping and the red dead battery alert was beeping.  The battery life is awful.  I would not buy this phone again", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be careful... your CELL PHONE just might have other plans!", "Author": "Please be nice to my package!", "ReviewID": "R2H6MVQJKZ9D50", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am writing this review as a warning to OTHERS!  You see I ordered on 10 June13 this cell phone as a \"Sprint SAMSUNG refurbished\" RANT phone...  My way of thinking ===  WOW!  Great phone at a fraction of a \"new Sprint SAMSUNG\" RANT phone! ***And my daughter would just LOVE it (PURPLE).***  You realize that \"EVERYTHING\" gets computerized........ Well, that's where it ends!  We could go into WHAT IS A PURPLE RANT DOING VACATIONING(?) IN BROOKLYN?!  Oh,when is a PURPLE cell phone, NOT a Sprint?  I MAY HAVE ordered SPRINT, but I was told a \"LG ANDROID\" would do nicely...  Yes, a PURPLE cell phone...  But try convincing the SALESMAN(?) through FIFTEEN e-mails that he did NOT get my item correct.  Try to convince the SALESMAN that you can read a calendar... and a week is NOT the number of days that HE came up with!  AMAZON stepped in,  (good news!) I JUST got reimbursed.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Boost Mobile Rant", "Author": "Malcolm J", "ReviewID": "R1J2A4GA742X8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "phone was in inpeckable better than new condition and shipment was extremely fast i am very satisfied with my phone and the seller very good deal A+++++++seller", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "No contract Sprint cell phone ready to activate on your Sprint Wireless account\nExcellent Conditioned Pre-Owned Phone, You Will Be Very Satisfied\nUsed No Contract Sprint Cell Phone\nFull 30 day customer satisfaction warranty\nPlease contact us with any questions and we will reply ASAP", "Name": "Samsung Rant SPH-M540 Black No Contract Sprint Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415ZGUOPZwL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007KCW1G2"}}
