I love my Razr; it's the perfect phone for someone who does not need a fancy iPhone, Blackberry, touchscreen, etc.  I expected a completely brand new phone, unlocked, direct from the manufacturer.The phone was locked (it needed a code) and had a \"Refurbished\" label.  T-Mobile and Amazon could not help me so I called Motorola.  I provided the MSN and IMEI codes (one-of-a-kind ID numbers assigned in the factory) from the phone, and he said the codes were not in the database, meaning the phone had been sold by a carrier or refurbished.I asked Amazon for a replacement. The replacement phone did not have a \"Refurbished\" label and did not ask for an unlock code; I inserted my SIM card and made and received calls.  However, the phone has AT&T; logos, screensavers, browser links, etc.  While it was technically unlocked, it was not what I expected.  The next morning, all the keys and buttons stopped working.  The phone was a complete dud after less than one day of use.This time I asked Amazon for a refund.  I guess I could ask for a third phone, but I'm sick of this and I found a much better price and warranty on the exact same item at another retailer.This page does not state that this phone may be refurbished, may have carrier branding, or may be locked.  In my experience all of these things were true.  Two different customer service representatives told me that every time they send me a replacement, it is from the same batch that Motorola sold them so it may have the same problems as the phone I'm returning.Bottom line: Amazon admits that, when you order this item, they don't know if you will receive the product described on this page.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Broke in 6mos - warranty company is not reachable.", "Author": "dbshah \"Divyang\"", "ReviewID": "R2EJO391SFZ3KC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in July,2009 and it stopped working in Jan,2010.

Penny \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R2RQLM0SQ0TGZ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone arrived about a week after I ordered it.  The back of the phone would not stay snapped on with the battery in place, and I sent email to the vendor, but it was the subsequent seller feedback that produced a response.  We swapped about one email a day regarding the back cover.  I do not know if the fellow was busy, or if I was on a leash.  (I suspect the latter.)  After about four days of emails, the seller sent a new cover.I have not yet received said cover, though the email tells me it's in the mail, but being in a hurry, I applied tape to the back cover, and proceeded to get the phone ready for use.  I had forgotten the pure simplicity that is this phone.  However, that pleasure was not to last.First, the phone is not new as indicated in the sales copy.  It's a refurbished device that was first sold for use on the T-Mobile network, which is apparent when the phone comes on.  It's also apparent from the back cover being a different shade of silver from the rest of the phone, and then, of course, there's the problem with the cover popping off.The phone makes calls.  It sends texts.  It will take pics.  However, it will not send a picture to another phone (MMS).  After some delay, an error message appears on the screen indicating a \"send\" error.  There is no suggestion I've found for tweaking the network settings to make MMS function.I'm at a loss regarding what to do about this phone.Update (25 October 2010) The replacement cover arrived today.  It is wrong on two counts.  First, it has two tabs at the bottom whereas the phone only has one slot.  Second, the cover is too short.  I sent return email to that effect.Update (28 October 2010) Yesterday, the seller requested the IMEI number for the phone.  I suppose the intent is to resolve the MMS issue.  Given that T-Mobile and AT&T; do not appear to use the same frequency for 3G, I doubt much will happen there.  Then again, the seller could be looking for a back cover that fits AND stays on.Update (29 October 2010)  After sending the IMEI number for the phone twice yesterday, it was requested once more today.  The request came with a note that a return shipping label would soon be sent.Update (02 December 2010) Toward the middle of November, this mess all ended.  The phone returned to the vendor.  The sale was reversed.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Reasonably happy", "Author": "DrakeM \"DrakeM\"", "ReviewID": "R306C6AZMVDYN1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having used the razr v3 for a month or two at this point, i have no significant complaints. The reception is reasonable, better than the 3 year old Nokia 6822 that my wife uses, but not as good as many other phones of newer makes and models. The phone when first turned on begins in Spanish but automatically switched to English as soon as the network was accessed.The speakerphone is not worthwhile and is only used when absolutely necessary as there is poor voice quality on the other end and the output sound is scratchy and sounds as though the speaker is blown. Another point of frustration I've experienced with the razr is an increase in the voice echo when speaking with other cell phones, although I'm not certain if the fault is the phones or my current networks' issue.Overall, I feel like this phone is a reasonable purchase for 100 dollars for an unlocked phone and I'm satisfied with it. In fact, I'm considering purchasing another to upgrade the reception of my wife's service, but not so sold on the value as to make it a no brainer-type decision.Other functions such as bluetooth, camera, video camera etc. work as expected and provide satisfactory results.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Problems with this RAZR", "Author": "Luv My Amazon Prime", "ReviewID": "R20BCTKMYS51SB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this cell phone from Amazon and it was sold as new. This cell phone purchase was to replace a cherished RAZR that an elderly parent had and absolutely loved. I wanted a new phone and so I purchased it from Amazon LLC and not from one of the hundreds of other sellers on Amazon. The first time my Mom called me it had a loud screeching sound in the background and that never went away. It also wasn't \"new\" as it had it five quick notes written in Spanish on the phone. Someone at Amazon didn't bother to check these phones or they would have found mine and many others here weren't new but probably refurbished phones. Phone never worked properly and Mom took it into an AT&T; store and the rep was nice enough to check it out. He found the phone was defective and advised returning it for a refund which we did.

Although sold as a US version, phone was programmed in another language, I believe french. I was able to tranfer to english as I had the equivalent phone already and was able to piecemeal together the steps to get to the section where one can change the languages. However, it was still difficult and time consuming, and if I didn't have the same phone already I do not believe I would have figured out how to do so. Now that the phone is programmed in english it functions the same as the original Razr phone it is replacing. The manual that comes with the phone is a significantly \"shortened\" version of the original manual and is not helpful at all for the aforementioned process. Vendors selling phones from other countries need to either program the phone in english prior to selling or include instructions on how to do so as the process is near impossible unless you can read the other language. Overall very satisfied as the phone is a quality phone.Addendum:  After a month of use we have switched back to our original Razr phone. This replacement is not of the same quality.  Reception is minimal in most places. Phone hangs up during call consistently. Seems the only time the phone functions as expected is when the \"speaker\" function is being used. Otherwise it has many faults. It is clear the phone is not made with the same high quality as the original.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "works a advertised.", "Author": "F.

I ordered from a third-party reseller at Amazon, and I noticed that there was something different about the phone when it arrived. The keyboard-screen articulation was not as tight as my old one, and the keys on the side of the screen jiggled. It just felt like it was more shoddy manufacture. Something to do with the fact that the logo on the back says \"China Mobile\" instead of \"AT&T;\" perhaps...As I have been using it, I noticed that the Bluetooth connection is not as robust (the headset sporadically disconnects), and I can no longer use Bluetooth to sync with my Mac (it says \"Connection with device lost\"). The firmware is a bit different, but I'm getting used to it. The mini screen on the outside went black for about 2 days, but is now back--does not bode well.Overall, I'm glad to have a RAZR again, but I feel tentative about the quality of this one.
