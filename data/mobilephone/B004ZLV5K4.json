I got the phone overnight delivered to me and was extremely excited to open it when I got off work.  I got it, opened it, things were new and in very great condition, you would've though it w,as new.  But me having owned multiple iPhone's, iPod's, and iPad's (plus jailbroken and unlocked them professionally) I instantly checked one thing first.  I flipped it on the back to not only make sure it was a 3GS (it's 3GS when the apple logo and below lettering is all shiny and chrome) but to make sure it was the right amount of GB's.  To my dismay I received a 16GB model.  Even though I got the 3GS that I was planning on working on, it wasn't the one I was expecting to receive or pay the extra $17 to have it delivered so quickly.  You would think if you pay for overnight they'd at least make sure they're giving you the right order.  I'm now extremely upset for two reasons.  1st, Since it's not an Amazon item, I can't just send it in and get it replaced with the correct one & 2nd, I will now have to wait a possible 2 weeks just to get my money refunded when I paid them $17 for 1 day (it'll probably take an entire 4 days just to get to Indiana and I'm in Chicago, which is ridiculous, and then they'll take forever to process my refund).
