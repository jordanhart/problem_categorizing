I ordered this phone and received it the next day.  I am quite pleased.  The phone is not as elegant looking as the purple one but it is nice. Can't complain.  I just wish though that some of the features of the E63 were  added to this one.  Other than that, it is reasonably priced and works well for me.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Iam very dissappointed", "Author": "mary", "ReviewID": "R1YLF62LTM3NHW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I brought the product to latin America and ,it has been impossible to connect to the internet,there is no way,no wifi,no,nothing.So I am very dissappointed and feel that it was a waste of money,never again will I buy anything", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Starlight", "ReviewID": "R3S2A83EYH10RW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a little gem! Love it, love it, love it. This phone works with my AT&T; Go Phone plan. Had to get used to all the bells and whistles on this phone as my previous very old Nokia was quite outdated. The best best best part...it only needs charging once a week!! The instruction booklet does not have English as a primary language, so it takes a little time to understand what you are doing.It is worth it.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "great!", "Author": "Leetlemama", "ReviewID": "RM1TYCUU435UF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased for my daughter, this phone has worked great for her!  She uses it for phone service but also as a mp3 player.  Battery lasts a long time before needing charging (3 days).  Has nice options.  I think the only \"con\" to this phone is the unavailability to block certain phone numbers.  That would be a nice feature.Would definitely purchase again!", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "good quality.but language only english and spanish", "Author": "Jin", "ReviewID": "R1V1TEZ92ZNG9D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "nokia always got good quality.sound is loud,and battery life for standby can last for 2weeks !but language of system only english and spanish", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent article", "Author": "Alexander Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R3IM45QKG9VT08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An article of top quality and utility...

No complaints (those are reserved for At&T;, sigh ...)All features are easy to handle - in my experience. Would buy it again.
