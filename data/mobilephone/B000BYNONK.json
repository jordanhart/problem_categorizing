{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best phone I have ever had!", "Author": "Yuliya Bakalo", "ReviewID": "R35F0YZUGF7DTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not going to write about options this phone has - that you can read from official Nokia web site, but...This phone is unusual, beautiful, stylish and has a very good reception, works with bluetooth. The only minus I can point is that if you have to dial a lot of phone numbers - that's not the phone for you. It has a rotator and to dial you have to rotate to each and every number. Though if you can program numbers in to the memory and use it from there - that's another thing: you can use bluetooth or infrared or GPRS to transfer numbers from your current phone, it is convenient and fast!I have this phone since it was released in Europe and I still have it as my favorite, I am going to use it as long as it works and Nokia's phones work a looooong time.", "Date": "December 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "AMAZING phone", "Author": "phastkat", "ReviewID": "R34MH2DBRLTAB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "yes, the dial takes some getting used to.  but once u get the hang of it, it becomes very very easy.  a lot of people say texting takes too long.  i agree it takes longer than on a keypad, but the intuitive programming in text mode is very helpful.before buying this phone, i read every review i could find online.  and i have to agree, that the reason u would buy this phone is for its styling rather than its practicality or ease of use. however, for a phone that's supposedly built for looks, it's packed with features.  sure it doesn't support java and doesn't come with any games, but when was it decided that a phone had to have games?  other reviews complained that the camera resolution is also not that great, but i think for a phone camera it's decent.  besides, i don't use my phones to take pictures.  i have  a 6 megapixel camera for that.summarily, i'd have to say this phone was worth every penny.  it has everything a cell phone needs.  it dials out, it recieves calls (great sound quality and reception, btw), has voice dial and voice activated features, stores contact numbers, has a date book and planner, text messaging with a multimedia format, et cetera, et al.and oh yeah, did i mention how gorgeously STYLED this phone is?  thin, lithe, retro-60's chic, pulsing lights, and a mirror finish on the screen.  'nuff said.  i'm keeping this phone until it falls apart.  and then i'm going to buy it again.  ;-)", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Voice dial.", "Author": "Waytoofunky \"waytoofunky\"", "ReviewID": "R35FMNPDPIDZYC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The last commenter had some very valid comments; I'd like to add that although it's a bugger to dial with that little rotary (and text messaging is downright akin to sending smoke signals), you can use voice dialing to dial. I use this with a bluetooth headset (Jabra 250V) -- just press the button on the headset, the phone beeps, say the name, it plays the name back to you for confirmation, and it dials. The phone stays in my backpack or pocket the whole time.You can also download software from Nokia for this to manage contacts, numbers, schedules, move around mp3s and pictures, create ringtones, and lots of other neat stuff. You can do all that over the unit's bluetooth.Good points: audio quality and reception, speakerphone (LOUD for such a small device) bluetooth, infrared, radio (you need a special headset for that, not included), camera (lousy quality, but heck, it's there if you need it), small size (like 2 iPod shuffles), zappo-neat Tron styling and glowing buttons. You can hang up by snapping the pop-up earpiece closed. The perfect hardware to use while ordering shaken, not stirred, beverages.Bad points: Icky dialing and operation. Non-user replaceable battery (though Nokia will do it for you; I tested them on this, and their customer service was GREAT. Has a bit of a reputation (propogated by Nokia marketing) for a \"fashionista\" phone. Mirror ed screen makes seeing the screen difficult in daylight (which is not a problem for me since I live in Oregon).", "Date": "February 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Most wonderfulll mobile in the world...

Best Style in the world.When I want to impress someone, I leave my Sony Ericsson P910 at home (who would imagine that!) and change to my new 7280;The \"dial\" system amazes everyone (altough it's not something you get used to it easyly...).It's small, it's the most beautifull, it has so many other features... bluetooth, infrared, and more and more...I would like a belt house for it... when I find it, I will give a 5.Sami", "Date": "October 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "The lipstick!", "Author": "Carson S. Darnold", "ReviewID": "R1SMX05577SUKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is quite unique, but you need to be very careful with it. If you are known to be even slightly rough with anything, then you might want to look at their more stout 7380.This phone is not a woman's phone by the name 'lipstick' but it probably would be safer being kept in someones purse. I kept it in my pocket and am a very skinny guy, hardly bumping into anything, and it still tends to hit the hang up button alot (thus turning off the phone).Also once you get it in your hands you can feel that the entire case feels like a very thin, almost eggshell like plastic. It feels breakable, but underneath is a thick metal plate holding all of the mechanics safe. So even if it feels like its going to shatter in your grip or fall apart in your palm, you really only need to make sure you don't scratch the plastic.Main flaws of the phone (for me);~power button is raised and not flush with the phone (obviously due to style), which caused me to accidentally turn off the phone when it was in my pocket and by slightly leaning against just about anything.~rotary dial is literally the soul of the phone, and mine died. There is a seller on ebay that has cheap replacements for $17, and its easy to switch out. But by doing so you will have to break the warranty sticker on the phone.~my phone had random stickers on the red plastic (once slide open), which were hard and obnoxious to remove! I think my phone might have been a refurb!~As with the other very sexy 7380, the mirror front is a nice touch but makes it impossible to use outside in most daylight.~possibly just on mine, but the speaker is somewhat weak. It eventually gave out and all sound came from the side port (speaker phone out i think). I'm typically good at personal repairs but i doubt that i can fix something like this easily so its going to have to stay like that.With all of this in mind, do remember that i'm a somewhat physically active guy, but no moron. I kept my phone safe, and refused the craving to play with the dial by swinging the phone back and forth with it (cause it is sort of fun...but DONT!). But even with my caution, just keeping it in my pocket eventually damaged the dial and the the fact that it kept turning off is sort of annoying, but my own doing.If your looking for a high tech phone that is pure style, then get this. If you've ever broken a phone before by your own actions, look for something else!", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000BYNONK"}}
