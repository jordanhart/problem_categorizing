I have NOT placed an SD CARD in this phone, because I have read other reviewers who said that the SD CARD caused the phone to not function properly.  So, I don't want to take that chance at this time, since I intend some overseas travel real soon ...  IT COMES WITH CHARGER, USB , EAR PHONES, VERY BASIC MANUAL , ...  Mine came \"Quality Control\" Inspected which means the box was opened and had a Q.I. seal placed over the opening ...  I paid about $140.00 for this phone and in my opinion, it is a bit pricey...  DO NOT PAY MORE !!!  Just my opinion ...  Do what YOU want to do ... IN ANY EVENT ...

It's not a mini tablet as some of the newer smart phones are but it is a phone with some very nice, usable features.  Notes:  If you don't care about the white vs black case - save your money and get the black; also if you really don't need the dual SIM feature, save your money and get the single SIM version of this phone (it has a different model number).  I have an AT&T; prepaid plan and this unlocked phone works great.  I am still getting used to the touch pad but it seems very responsive and a stylus is a real help.  I opted for this item because I wanted a white screen and the warranty.  But when I tried to register it at Samsung US, they didn't recognize it as a US model and wouldn't give me one, so beware.  Again, love the phone, but save your money and purchase this model, black or white, dual SIM or not, without the warranty because it isn't available in US.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "sweet little phone", "Author": "Jose R.

Unfortunately the niece who has the first one had it slip out of her jacket pocket while riding on a motorcycle.  Warning - these phones do not bounce well.  So one of these three new phones is a replacement. It lasted her almost a year with no problems.**UPDATE **  November 2013.  I brought three of these S6102's to the Philippines.  They are the dual sim card Phones and gave them to three of my nieces, they are crazy about them.  Using web based chat like Facebook Messenger and 'WeChat' we keep in touch.
