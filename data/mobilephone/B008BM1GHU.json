I bought the phone in April of 2011, and generally it worked ok from the start. The guy at the AT&T; store did tell me that it was slower than the iPhone 3GS, but I figured it was just because he wanted to make the iPhone sale.Boy was I wrong. Hmmm...where to begin. The majority of the time, the phone will just randomly drop a call, freeze during a call, and my absolute favorite, restart during a phone call. Replace phone call with a) Google Maps, b) gmail, c) Facebook app, or d) listening to voicemail and you have the bulk of my user experience right there. Also, while trying to send a text most of the time it just doesn't even work.Very frequently it will attempt to load Google Maps, and then just stop. It will crash the app, then the phone, and the only way to get anything done is a force restart (as in, I pull off the back cover and pull out the battery). I have learned that the only way to use apps like Google Maps is to kill all tasks (the only reason why I keep Advanced Task Killer around) and then sit patiently for about 5 minutes while it all loads. WTF?My absolute favorite is it's apparent lack of sequencing when it comes to apps. No, Motorola, I do not want to update every single app while I am watching Netflix, which then makes Netflix freeze, and you guessed it, I am forced to restart the phone.I can not wait until I can get a new phone, and I will never choose another Motorola product.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice so far", "Author": "tracy simmons-jones", "ReviewID": "R1GHFPATSPAS15", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just did not understand why I need a new charger within 20 days of using it.
