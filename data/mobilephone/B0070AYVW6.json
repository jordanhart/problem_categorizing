{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Actually a Verizon phone that has been modified to work for Cricket, batter may be dead from age/sitting in box.", "Author": "RB101", "ReviewID": "RB7OY8QN6ZNRT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The handset works great; however, I did have to purchase a replacement battery shortly after the handset arrived.  I assume these handsets are new old stock, so the batteries are most likely at the end of their life from age.  Also, be aware this is actually a Verizon handset and is marked as such with the Verizon name.  Cricket software has been installed on the Verizon phone to make it compatible with Cricket.  It took some extra time to get it working with Cricket because the ESN ( Electronic Serial Number) was not already in their database.  On the first call, the rep did not know what to do, but on the second call the rep was able to add the ESN to their database and activate the phone.  I gave the product a \"1\" because all of this should be explained in the description of the product.  Other than the dead battery and ESN problem, the phone is new and works fine.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "TRUE CLASSIC PHONE", "Author": "vance brady", "ReviewID": "R23ZATT3HOIWCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT PHONE.
