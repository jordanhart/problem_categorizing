The volume adjustement buttons are active when phone is closed, so it keeps changing between loud and soft in my pocket2. It doesnt have T9 word recognition in text typing (but you probably dont get this phone if your primary use is text/sms anyway)battery lasts 4+ days.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple Flip Phone that works GREAT", "Author": "JustMeDawn", "ReviewID": "R2B57UWE4QAZRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband refuses to enter into this century's technology, so when he needs a phone it is difficult to find a GOOD flip phone. We have gone through several (at least 8) that lacked reception, in-call volume options, SUPER easy options. This one has it all! He can adjust the ringing volume and it doesn't adjust itself, he can receive and call from inside his shop (metal building) and he can hear me when I call. Very happy with this purchase :)", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple use", "Author": "Gregory Glenmore Creech", "ReviewID": "R22N0RZWEGPBBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my mother because of it's ease of use.

Longstreth", "ReviewID": "R1PPRVTDF2QXVB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a \"no frills\" phone. I got it because I was wanting to ditch the traditional cell phone companies over-charged monthly plans and save some money. This phone helped me to do that and I went from over a $1000 per year in cell phone expenses down to approx. $250. If you don't think that you can make it using a basic phone and you need to have Bluetooth, apps, the internet, etc... choose another phone. If you're aim is to go inexpensive, this phone may be what you're looking for. I've been using it now for about 5 or 6 months and it does everything I want it to do... IE - I can talk to family and friends.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone should not be in the market.", "Author": "William H.", "ReviewID": "R1QM1TNHJCY9PB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very poor excuse of a phone I tried using it for one week and went back to my previous phone.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "battery dead upon arrival", "Author": "kw \"kw\"", "ReviewID": "RVU49UXHQ23JC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the battery was dead.

Honestly i think they'd be better off with an older smartphone where they only use the basic calling features.The 'extra features' of this phone are unbearably bad. Even the texting and messaging program is completely frustrating to use.Giving it 3 stars because I bought it to make calls and it does that just fine. If you're looking for a phone where you can even use some of the other features occasionally, i would look elsewhere.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "No blutooth", "Author": "UncleDuke", "ReviewID": "R37EPSLN5B4NCZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I mistakenly assumed the product had blutooth capability; otherwise the phone is okay; basic cell phone but not quite exactly what I expected", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE!", "Author": "DISAPPOINTED", "ReviewID": "R1EO331LWA5YUL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BEWARE!
