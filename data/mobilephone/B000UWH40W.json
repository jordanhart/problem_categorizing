However, there is a way to increase battery life: change connection type from UMTS to GSM from Auto.  This will disable 3G and force the phone into GSM mode, which will greatly increase battery life.Hope this works.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Average Battery", "Author": "J. Sensenig", "ReviewID": "R20NTDB8TJ450P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone last week directly from the AT&T; store.  I renewed my existing contract with AT&T; so I already had their service.  I am very impressed with the phone overall.  It is sleek and stylish with a lot of features which work well.Pros:  Styling and Features  Call quality and signal strength  Micro SD card slot  Dedicated USB cable port  Dedicated headphone jack (albeit a small one so you still need an adapter)  Pin type connector charger (not the clip on connectors)Cons:  Battery Life  Lack of installed ringtones, (correction, see below)  Hard to navigate folders and menusI mostly use the phone to talk on and not much else.  I need to charge the battery pretty much every night.  I can go about a day and a half or 2 days if I stretch it.  If you talk a lot or intend to use the other features plan on charging it every night.  In their defense the battery life is rated at 3 hours of talk time and that is pretty much it.  You won't get more than that and like I said you won't get even that much if you do games or other stuff.  The other thing that was kind of disappointing was no ringtones installed except the standard ATT ring. (Correction).  There are a couple of ringtones installed I just wasn't looking in the right folder which is the biggest problem I have with it now.  The music hides in different menu folders and depending which menu you are in you won't see them which is why I didn't think there were any tones at first.  You pretty much have to download anything you want to play.I really like the phone and if the battery would last longer it would be about perfect.  Since all I do is use it for talking and not much else it suits me.I have had this phone for about 5 months now and still really like it.  I am not a tech wiz so I have not even used the music player and other features until recently.  I downloaded some ringtones from a 3rd party website and it was easy.  They play great.  Today I used the bluetooth capability to load pictures from my camera to my MacBook and also loaded a few songs onto my phone.  It was easy for a novice like myself. No compatibility issues.  Call quality and reception have been above average.  I fly all over the east coast and it works pretty much everywhere you would expect.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Battery Life Makes this phone mediocre", "Author": "Berkeley Grad: '06", "ReviewID": "RBJ8CQJ18IPER", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got this phone on Weds, as replacement for my old Nokia - I was looking for a phone that is reliable, easy to use, has texting capabilities, sleek, has a streamlined design, a loud alarm (I rely on my phone to wake me up), and takes clear pictures. This phone is compact, and performed well when I saw it at the Cingular store.BUT today, I experienced the worst battery life that a cell phone could have. After charging this phone to the max, I texted my friends, and talked for about 3 hours when the battery indicator showed that 1/4 of its capacity. Then, my phone died. Usually, I'd have at least 1 hour left to use the phone, with an indication of 1/4 battery. BUT NO! It just died, and luckily, I wasn't in a situation where I needed a phone (I was at home all day today). Everyday since I got this phone, I've had to charge it. Usually every 2 days I'd charge my old Nokia phone.I will be calling Cingular to ask for a replacement battery.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "This phone does just about everything", "Author": "D. Dell \"Dell\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y3OV1YJA5KP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced my Motorola L6 with this Nokia 6555. I liked the L6 except the keys were very small and close together, so I would sometimes hit the wrong key. Also, I had to lock the keys whenever I carried it so a key would not get pressed accidentally. What I needed was a flip phone with slightly larger keys and this Nokia was just the ticket.This cell phone has so many features that I will only list a few. First off, my friend just got a Samsung Blackjack II and this Nokia does almost all the same things that his does. They both have MP3, 3G, Bluetooth, internet access, camera, Micro SD memory ready, organizer, and more with services through ATT. As far as we can tell thus far is the only thing the Smartphones have the Nokia 6555 does not have is Microsoft Mobile Suite. The Blackjack keys are so tiny that I do not know how anyone can use them. Plus, the Blackjack cost much more. The better choice is by far the Nokia 6555.The only problem I am having is navigating the menus to find the settings I am looking for. I have to keep referring to the manual. I suppose after a while I will learn where everything is and memorize most of it.The battery life seems to be about average for a fully loaded cell phone. Maybe some day they will make batteries that last much longer for those power users that complain about short battery talk time. For now we just have to charge the battery more often. Not a big deal for me. If I plan to use the phone a lot, then I simply charge my phone and headset at night to have a full charge on both and I am ready to go the next day. If I do not use it very much, then I only have to charge them about every 3 or 4 days.Pros:Slim and stylish.Good sound quality.Many features.Cons:Menus difficult to navigate.UPDATE:Another con is the backlight only stays on for 10 seconds and there is no way to adjust it to stay on longer.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good but fragile", "Author": "Daniel A. Koblosh", "ReviewID": "R9YO13KROQP4T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, the bad. I purchased the Nokia 6555b from AT&T; Jan 8, 2008. Three weeks later the exterior mini-display was cracked and inoperable. I had worn it on my belt while driving and my seat belt buckle put enough pressure on the mini-display to crack it. VERY disappointing. All Nokia had to do was put a thicker, more rigid plastic cover over the display and it would be fine. Instead, I have a busted phone. Except for the broken mini-display and the inability to see the clock or caller ID, the phone still works, but that mini-display is a Bad Design.A lot of people complain about the battery. At first I experienced very short battery times as well. I even bought a second battery for $15 with some other accessories. I have never needed it. I believe the battery gets better with time. At first it was displaying low battery charge. Now it goes for a couple of days no problem. I charge it each night, though, just to be safe.I bought the 6555 because it works with the Acura Hands Free Link system via Bluetooth. (Not all Bluetooth phones do.) It also works with the Ford Sync system. Both work very well. It is indeed nice to place or receive calls without having to find the phone. No clumsy earphones. No looking away to dial or press buttons. No wires at all. My wife leaves hers in her purse, I leave my in my pocket (not wearing it on my belt anymore--I might break it again.) With Sync, the Bluetooth even allows the phone to become a media player. Very cool.Using the free downloadable Nokia software, you can edit the phonebook from your laptop via the special--and hard to find--micro USB cable that costs $15. But if your laptop has Bluetooth like mine--because I bought a Microsoft Bluetooth wireless laser mouse 8000 and its Bluetooth receiver also receives other Bluetooth devices like my phone--you can connect without having to buy the micro USB cable. The cable is handy to carry though, so you can connect the phone to other computers if necessary to download pictures and video if needed. Using this software, you can also make your own ring tones. My custom ringtone is Hillary Clinton cackling/laughing.The main display has a nice large font that is visible in broad daylight. Color combinations (themes) are adjustable and some are better than others, but it's nice to have options.The phone has a speaker phone built in if desired.It's easy to switch from ring to vibrate--just hold the # key for a few seconds.If you have MS Outlook as your emailer, you can sync your calendar.The 6555 comes with a host of useful tools including: a Stopwatch with split times; a Countdown Timer to remember to take the roast out on time; a full-function Calculator; an Alarm Clock; Notes; To-Do list; and a Calendar.It has some dumb games that are mostly demo only.It has a very mediocre still camera and an even more mediocre video camera.It can text, but I don't do that.It can be configured for Push-To-Talk, at extra cost, if you must have walkie talkie capability.I was worried about the tiny charging plug, but so far it's been durable, even though it did obsolete all my previous Nokia accessories.It does need a micro-mini plug for the headphones if you want to use it as a personal music player. Mine included a short Micro-to-Standard mini adapter so you can use your regular headphones.The Settings menu allows you to reconfigure what many of the buttons will do: if you need to get to some buried menu item like the calculator often, make the Right Selector button do it. One touch and you're in business. This is a very handy feature.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone. The audio quality is fine, it rarely drops calls and is small, thin and lightweight. The only real problem is how fragile the outer display is. Nokia should have shipped it with a protector or engineered it better from the get-go.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Bad phone - don't waste your time or money on this one", "Author": "imbubbasmom", "ReviewID": "R2GWYQIHRFOTFW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this phone as a replacement for my Motorola V557 that went kaput. These are a few of the things that have not made my life easier in the 2 weeks I've had the phone:1) The battery life IS a joke, but it improved once my husband turned off the internet browser, which apparently is on full time by default.2) The quality of the sound on calls is dismal, even though I've got it up to full volume.3) Reception is not good, even in town, and it drops calls, which my V557 never did.4) It loses my address book on a regular basis, requiring a restart (sometimes more than one).5) It also tells me my smart card isn't installed (it is), which again requires restarting.6) It won't save my ringer settings, no matter how many times I push the \"save\" button. It seems to be stuck on vibrate only.If there had been something else available at the store we trade with (such as another V557), I would have gotten it instead of the Nokia.

If the phone is in a pants pocket more than 1 foot away from the bluetooth headset, I get lots of static while moving - it sounds like paper being crinkled up. Keeping phone in shirt pocket or holding it near my ear solves the problem, but kind of defeats the purpose! If I am not moving it is OK. I found it was even affected by standing next to a running stream of water from a faucet!Why do I think this is the phone's problem? Because I have tried two Jabra Jawbone, two Plantronics Voyager 520 and one Motorola 681 and all have exhibited the problem.I had AT&T; exchange the phone for another 6555 and the problem remained, but was noticeably worse with the second phone.Nokia can only say \"we only test with our own bluetooth headsets, buy one of ours\".I will also confirm the abyssmal battery life, even after changing \"packet data\" to \"on demand\" instead of \"always on\".

I did my homework before going to the store and I had narrowed my decision to 2 phones (an LG and a different model Nokia).  However, when I got to the store, I let the salesman talk me into this phone, which he said was a better quality, though at a higher price.  I took it home and immediately had problems. The vibration function did not work, no matter how much I adjusted settings, and the manual was no help.  I went online and saw that almost every review for this phone was negative.  Just this afternoon, the vibration miraculously started working, though intermittently, which confirmed to me that I had a defective phone.  I also was having problems with it powering down by itself, or suddenly lighting up--which was very annoying because I use my phone as an alarm clock so all of a sudden I would be awaken by a bright light in my room.  Perhaps mine was a lemon, however based on the other reviews I read, lemons with this model seem to happen fairly often.I also found that the way the operating system on the phone was set up was not very intuitive.  Maybe I just didn't spend enough time getting used to it (though I did spend about 4 hours on it last night trying to figure it out).  I consider myself fairly tech savvy, but I just don't understand why they make simple tasks like setting an alarm for am or pm require an additional 3 button pushes.  I also didn't need any of the \"sophisticated\" features, I only needed a phone that worked well as a phone, and that could text with relative simplicity.  The sound quality and signal strength were fairly good, but that was dwarfed by the other problems I was having. Based on my experience thus far, and the reviews I saw online, I took it back today and got the phone I originally was going to get.

The Nokia 6555 will find the tower signal even if you live on Mars, and it will do it with great call clarity.  I have never had a more ergonomically pleasing keypad than the one on this phone---all buttons are smooth, require just the right amount of pressure, and they deliver the appropriate tactile feedback. BUT, battery life and function ruin an otherwise perfect machine. As other reviewers have aptly written, this phone ravishes battery power very quickly, even when you are cruising through the menus and not even talking. Adding insult to injury, the battery indicator on the screen drops slowly with the passing minutes then falls to \"low battery\" unexpectedly, oftentimes giving you a warning of a bare 3 minutes before all goes dead. I love this phone, BUT I ALWAYS CARRY MY OLD 5-YEAR-OLD NOKIA 1208 as a trusty backup. The 1208 has no internet, no camera, no bluetooth, and no music, but the battery lasts seemingly forever, and it will pick up a GSM signal maybe halfway to Mars. The Nokia 6555 is perfect except for its battery performance, but when I carry BOTH phones I get everything I need.

This phone is a beautiful phone (I had the black and red version) and will slip into even a small pocket.  After purchasing the phone, I looked up the reviews.  You've probably read them....kind of disappointing and even scary. A battery charge lasted two days for me.  (Turning it on at 7:00 a.m.; off at 6:00 p.m.; with about 50 minutes of talk time/day)  I decided to take the phone back since 2 years is a long time to have a phone that begins with disappointing features.  The AT&T; service rep. took back the phone with no questions asked. Before I told the rep I was continuing with the service, she even asked if I wanted to cancel the 2-year contract. It was a pleasant exchange for a different model. I was in and out within 25 minutes.

After reviewing the phones available and having a family member review the phones available, I decided to purchase the Nokia 6555.  I had previously had Nokia phones and had no problems with them.  The battery life is poor, but I can adjust to that.  However, I had my phone less than 10 days when the mini screen showed a crack in the LCD.  I had not dropped the phone, smashed the screen of the phone in any way, or gotten it wet.  The outside of the phone shows absolutely no damage at all.  When I called the AT&T; store where I bought the phone, they said the initial 30 day warranty that the store is supposed to provide for the phone does not apply to the LCD screens.  The  AT&T; customer service does not cover the phone for 30 days and will not cover the LCD either.  I am now supposed to pay the insurance deductible for a phone that is less than 10 days old.

I don't use my phone a lot so battery life is acceptable for me. It's not as big or as solid as a Razr, but the price was right -- free with a family plan.The speakerphone could be a little louder.  The menus are ok and are somewhat customizable, and I think better than my inexpensive Motorola.  Switching silent to ring profile is easy.  It also has a flight mode which shuts down the cell phone but allows you to use the multimedia and phone book etc.I got a plastic shell and a leather case that both work fine and protect it as it is a bit fragile.I ordered it from ATT with a handsfree mono earbud which works okay, but is uncomfortable and rubber earbud cushions seem next to impossible to find.  I also have not been able to find a stereo headset with mic.  I tried the Nokia HS-47, HS-42 and HS-40 with no luck.  You can get a 3.5 to 2.5 adaptor, but you won't have a mic.I had no luck with the 3rd party SIM card reader in backing up the address book, but the I did get a data cable that worked.  You have to put it \"Nokia mode\" for the data cable to work right, the data and music mode don't seem to work as well.  Bluetooth worked ok on my Mac, but I didn't try the \"Nokia Suite\" on the mac.  I have not found a video format that will work, but takes most audio files, although some it won't play.  MP3's seem fine.  I added a 1 GB microSD card without any problems.  It has both phone memory and a memory card with is a little confusing.

The phone has an excellent screen with vivid colors.  The features are numerous and at first, I thought I would not use them.  However, the internet capabilities are great.  I check my email with ease and look up sports scores quickly with the touch of a button.  The phone does get hot sometimes when I connect to the internet for a lengthy amount of time, but goes away just as quickly when I disconnect.  The battery discharges rapidly with use of applications, but not when using talk time or standby time.  If I do not use the applications, I do not need to charge my phone more than once or twice a week.  The memory is awesome, as well as the camera and video features.  The keys are small and close together, but it just takes getting used to.  I can text with ease.  If you are not a high tech type of person, you may want less of a phone, but for me, this is the best phone I have owned.  Very durable as well.

Incredibly distorted and waaaay too much high end, you won't often be able hear this one ring after adjusting the EQ to sound halfway decent. If you leave the EQ in any of the normal modes (rather than customizing it), it sounds like an AM radio turned up all the way...only without the volume. I actually thought that my speaker was blown and exchanged it for a new one (another NEW one, not a refurb), and it sounds just as crappy.
