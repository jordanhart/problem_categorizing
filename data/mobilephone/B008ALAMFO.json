Then I started looking for it daily, finally I found it in Amazon.  It works fine, but it looks as fragil as the first one. I am planningBuying another one as well  as a replacement battery. It's incredible that such a phone can't be usefull due to those things. There must be a place where we can find parts for SVP G13", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Compgeek", "ReviewID": "R2YPRJF1IL8Q9K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product is garbage.  It fell apart within a few hours and it was never able to charge my Cell Phone Watch.  The original adapter broke within a few days also.  Very poor quality.  I loved the concept of the watch but it wasn't worth the cost.  Very Disappointed!!!", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008ALAMFO"}}
