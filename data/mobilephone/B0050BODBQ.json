I ended up returning it after some deal breakers showed up - namely random rebooting on its own. Another was that the menu system did not give me the option to connect to Wi-Fi, one of the MAIN reason for getting this phone.  I think the BIOS/ROM instructions may have been a little outdated.Oh, and the manual was Spanish-only.As I said, returned it, the seller gave me no flack about it.On the bright side, they were great people to deal with.
