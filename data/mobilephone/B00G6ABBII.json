Have had it for 1 day and have messed around with it most of the day. The call clarity seems to be good, but as for use as a tablet I notices some web pages didnt work correctly, couldn't watch netflix on it for some reason, the movie would start to play but the video would freeze about 3 sec. into the movie and the audio would keep playing as it should....weird. I could forgive the issues I just covered because I'm not going to watch movies or surf the web to much on it anyways but 2 things I can't push aside is the horrible viewing angles and the not so good cameras with weak flash. But I guess thats what the difference is between a $124.00 phone and a $600.00 one. I will keep it for a couple more days and play with it but this might be going back to the store.Update: March 7, 2014  Phone screen became very inaccurate, and most of the time unresponsive, attempting to return to seller.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "George Turner", "ReviewID": "RGFK051U8LYJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These phones are awesome, especially for the price.

Camera is a little below average and the led flash is not very bright.It is slow, but if you are mainly interested in making phone calls and texting it is adequate. It will play most games on the play store.It has no compass,navigation is about useless,the gps takes forever to lock on.  The built in FM radio is sketchy.The call quality is fair.I say it is a buy if you are the type of person that needs a phone that will do most everything but not as well as the more familiar big phone makers.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "themeca irving", "ReviewID": "R3ACMIJM7DRWQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone I buy it for my sis and one of my friend it works just like the s4 phone", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.99", "Features": "5.0 inch large capacitive screen with 960*540 pixels QHD screen resolution\nSupport 3G: WCDMA 850/2100MHz ;2G: GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz\nAndroid 4.2 with 1.2GHZ MTK6572W Cortex-A7 Dual-core processor and 512MB RAM + 4GB ROM\n8.0M Pixels High definition back camera with Auto Focus and flashlight, front 2.0M camera Light sensor, Gravity Sensor, Proximity sensor\nSupports Android Navigation, built-in GPS navigation with A-GPS assisted, makes the positioning swiftly and accurately", "Name": "Cubot P9 Unlocked 5.0 Inch QHD Screen 3G Dual Core Cell phone Dual SIM Dual Standby Android 4.2 1.2GHz MTK6572W Smartphone (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QZsmVjtcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00G6ABBII"}}
