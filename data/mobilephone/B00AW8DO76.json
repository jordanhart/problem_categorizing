I have had this phone for a month and a half and I still love this phone. I was trying to justify spending extra $80 and purchasing the G4 model but settled on this model as a startup and unsure on how this phone would work in USA. First of all customer service from TAKUDADOTCOM was above and beyond excellent. Phone was orded on expedite shipping from Hong Kong, but shipping company screwed up the shipping and returned it back to them. They immediately refunded my expedite shipping fee and re-expedited the phone for free. They communicated with me every step of the way, so they have earned my 5 STAR. About the phone, it does come with chinese apps that just needs to be disabled but I have come to realize that this phone stands apart form all these other samsung and htc copy cat phones because of its operation type. Jiayu has portrayed its style as Jiayu style. I am an outdoor person and do not require to be gentle with this phone thats why I call it my man-phone. The gorilla glass gives me the confidence that I dont need to be gentle with this phone. The black case sent with the phone is heavy quality rubber and Jiayu personalized which gives the phone the whole rugged feel. The back case is soft and flimzy but case covers it all. Phone also comes with a screen protector that needs to be applied for added protection. Camera is great compared to my last 2 phones with 6mp-8mp depending on the screen shot. International travel will only require a sim card addition with dual simcard slots and no reason to carry multiple phones when traveling international. Great part is that I am free from contract.  We used to pay $160/month with sprint on family plans and crappy smart phones, now we pay $88/month for the same usage with ATT from PuretalkUSA with a simcard with these really fast processing phones. Next upgrade will surely be Jiayu G4. This is a great man-phone for outdoor men and overall a very sexy phone.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "jiayu G5", "Author": "Bakur", "ReviewID": "RN6XD5YC5H5U2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like jiayu. But in terms of power and successful execution of the battery and memory jiayu g5 advanced better. Therefore, if possible, I'd like to ask you to provide for the sale - jiayu g5 advanced black and I would like to buy it. 3000mAh, 2GB RAM, 32GB ROM. I would be very grateful if I can buy exactly G5 Advanced Need more memory and larger batteries.
