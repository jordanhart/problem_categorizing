Medasani", "ReviewID": "RHDKNPOKNMVWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After loosing the phone (samsung 807) which came with my cingular contract, I was on hunt for a cheap, nice phone with not many internet features. Because the guy who stole my phone made huge bill using internet.After searching for a while I fixed on w200i. And after using it for a week, I am very much satisfied. The good points are1) Walkman player on the phone is very good. Sound quality is very good with the included earbuds. Also the included 128MB memory stick is sufficient for ~20 songs which is nice, but I want to upgrade it to 2GB stick.2) FM radio is good3) Voice dialing. I like the implementation of voice dialing on this phone better compared to samsung D807.On D807, there is no user control on how a contact is to be pronounced. Based on stored conact's name, the phone assumes a pronounciation. Since names are not standard english words, this always leads to wrong assumptions.Also being from India, my accent is different from American accent. And for me,it never worked on D807 satisfactorily.On w200i, you can record a sound and associate it with a contact. Whenever you pronounce the sound, the associated contact is called. This way I can use the correct sound for the name and also I can use nicknames. This is much better and for me more natural.4) Sound volume is good & clear. Unlike D807, I don't have to press the phone to my ears.5) Light weight and looks cool6) Limited internet features. This phone comes with no net browsing facility and limited data features. This way I don't end up with extra bill for using internet, after inadvertently pressing some button (many phones I saw have the important buttons associated with internet). This is good for those like me, who don't have/want data plans.Average w.r.t.1) Battery life2) camera qualityBad1) The hands free cable implementation is a mess. It can be designed better I feel. The clip should be above the heavy handsfree button. Also for me, the left earbud cable is a bit short", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good stuff", "Author": "Carl Schager", "ReviewID": "R3JCL2VKLB2501", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty solid phone.  The one I got came from Mexico.  It still was easy to switch it to english, but some of the stuff is still in spanish, such as the games.  Not really a big deal to me, though.

Not enough light, and whatever you do see on the screen seems to be of very low resolution and low contrast.Very limited menus, although you can download some, it seems.  I can't rate the other features because I got sick of it just trying to improve the themes, the wallpaper and the lighting.

Phillips", "ReviewID": "R10AFKOB08BZI5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I ordered this phone a few days before the latest warning comments were written.  My phone seems to be from Russia, or somewhere else they use Cyrillic script.  The charger provided does not fit US wallsockets.  That is the dealbreaker right there.  If I hadn't been replacing a Sony Ericsson w810i and still had a charger that fit, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EVEN CHARGE THE PHONE.  It was simply luck on my part that this phone could even work for me.  !!  Thankfully, when I inserted my SIM card, it let me choose English as my language of choice, and everything is working fine, due to me having a correct charger.However, I'm sure some of you wouldn't be so lucky.  I'd recommend ordering this phone thorough the official Sony Ericsson website for just about... 15$ more, I think, and not having to waste time and energy on this seller.As for the phone itself, I'd give it a 4 star, due to crappy camera and annoying center/control button, but I feel it's more important to warn others of this seller.", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Careful with unlocked phones", "Author": "A.

Being an unlocked phone, it came loaded with software from the service provider of whatever country it came from. It came from a spanish speaking country and the internet software, games, and some other items are in spanish only. Even if you configure the phone to English it seems to operate in a sort of \"Span-glish\". Audio quality and reception are sub-par. Internet is simply impossible to use.

When i got this everything is in spanish. All the books and cd is in spanish. The phone itself was in spanish. I finally found the settings and changed it to english, but all the alerts and alarms were in spanish still. I got little to no reception. 90% of the day the phone would read, emergency calls only. It feels very cheap like your gonna break it just dialing a phone number. My girlfriend used it for 2 days and i finally threw it away. On the plus side it did come with headphones and lets you download quite a bit of music to it. Also the wall charger was these two thin prongs, but came with an adaptor to fit in regular outlets. I dont know what country uses this plug in but i can make one guess. I dont recommend this phone for anyone unless your in dire need of a cheap phone fast.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not an AT&T; approved product", "Author": "R.
