All the features are good except people can't hear me on it.  I tried calling customer service 5x.  Each time I talked to someone who had no idea about my prior calls.  I was on the phone with them for 3 hours.  I was so frustrated with them.  Every time they promised me the phone is now perfect, it wasn't.  Finally I realize I am just going to have to cancel.  I hate to do it but what is the point of having a phone I can't talk on?  I am willing to go with the contract phones.  At least I can go to the Verizon store and talk to someone face to face and they usually do a good job of fixing any problems I have.  Bad idea to buy this phone; i was trying to cut costs but ended up spending more.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HZVZJLM"}}
