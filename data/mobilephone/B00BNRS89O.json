{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works just as good as my Samsung Galaxy Note and WAY cheaper", "Author": "D. Suich", "ReviewID": "R2MQVFLGQAAEE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reviews online talked about the resolution of this screen being poor quality.  But I could not tell the difference until I used a magnifying glass.  I replaced by Samsung Galaxy Note with this phone because I needed a dual sim card.  What's nice about this phone is that you can receive calls from either sim card which can be operated simultaneously.  You can even choose which sim card is used for your Internet data plan and you can deactivate or reactivate sim cards via the phone's settings menu.  It seems to perform even faster than my Note did even though the processor is slightly slower.  That's probably because the processor doesn't have to drive as many screen pixels so the phone refreshes faster.  Overall, it's an excellent phone.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "happyj", "ReviewID": "R263BSMZGWNCT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone works just as it says it would.  I receive calls from both sims through call waiting.  The camera takes excellent pictures.  Its very fast and easy to work with. Great music player, awesome flash light (very bright), am/fm radio and lots more features.  I would highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone is AWESOME", "Author": "Rigoberto Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R1AMWN10BIDDG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is great! The battery lasts pretty long, it's 30% after a whole day of work with regular use. The phone seems big but it's easy to get used to the size. The keyboard is very comfortable because of the screen real estate. Android OS 4 does a great job handling the 2 sim cards unlike Android OS 2. The camera is amazing and the phone doesn't show lag at all.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good!", "Author": "Michael M.

I am waiting for the end of the month before getting a sim card. I have go to GSM network now.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Question!", "Author": "Mamadou Lamine Ndiaye", "ReviewID": "R1EK7JQK3AQWQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can you tell us about the size of the phone?
