{"Reviews": [], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "Iphone 5s is precision crafted down to the micron. And it's evident throughout. The beautiful aluminium housing. The sleekness of metal and glass. Sapphire crystal in the home button. And more sapphire crystal protecting the isight camera. Design and construction on this level is unmatched. As a result, iphone 5s looks and feels unbelievably thin and light. And it's available in three elegant expressions: gold, silver and space grey.\nYou check your iphone dozens and dozens of times a day, probably more. Entering a passcode each time just slows you down. But you do it because making sure no one else has access to your iphone is important. With iphone 5s, getting into your phone is faster, easier and even a little futuristic. Introducing touch id - a new fingerprint identity sensor.\nThere's fast. And then there's a7 fast. The new a7 chip gives you cpu and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the a6 chip. Even more impressive, a7 makes iphone 5s the first 64-bit smartphone in the world - that's desktop-class architecture in a super-slim phone. And because ios 7 was built specifically for 64 bit, it's uniquely designed to take advantage of the a7 chip.\nThe new m7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the a7 chip. It's designed specifically to measure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope and compass - a task that would normally fall to the a7 chip. But m7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness apps that track physical activity can access that data from the m7 coprocessor without constantly engaging the a7 chip. So they require less battery power.", "Name": "Apple iPhone 5S 64GB (Space Gray) - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HWgp%2B1H3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FBTZB72"}}
