{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "GI", "ReviewID": "RDFEM6ZGDO5X8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Right sized phone. Pocket friendly. It's a Samsung, like my Galaxy Tab 2, so I knew what to expect - good quality.It's an Android, so you can configure just about anything. I set mine to GSM network only, no mobile data, and I use wifi for my data connection.My display is at ~ 60% brightness. I also disabled bluetooth, nfc, sync, gps etc. I'm using about 35% battery every 24 hours with moderate use. With light use I should get several days.The screen is amazing for a 480 x 800 LCD. The user interface is smooth. The 1.4 Ghz quad core CPU is fast but steps down to 400 Mhz when idle to conserve the battery.You can disable the bloatware, and move some apps to an SD card. Also, this phone has a removable battery and a micro SD card slot. Big pluses for me (The Moto G lacks these features).The home button wakes up the phone, so you don't have to reach for the power button. Nice. Also you can configure calls so the home button answers and the power button disconnects. Nice and easy, even in sunlight.The negatives, well there is no notification LED so you have to handle the phone periodically to see if you missed any calls (but the notifications do show on the lock screen). Also the phone is a fingerprint magnet. The battery cover really shows smudges. I guess I'll need to get a case.It uses a micro sim, I found a template on the internet and trimmed my previous phones mini sim to fit. No problems. Otherwise it does come with a new micro sim, you just have to go through the hassle of activating it. To do so, you need to go to a T-Mobile store or call them, web support seems non-existent. Your phone number, account balance, etc, all stays intact.I'm on the T-Mobile Pay as you Go plan. I use WiFi for data. Like I stated earlier, I set my phone to GSM only (saves battery) and enabled WiFi. Battery life is exceptional in this mode.Great buy here at amazon. It came in a T-Mobile retail box with phone, charger, micro sim card, and manuals. Probably the best buy you can get in this price range. Overall I'm happy.UPDATE: I purchased case for this, it's a TPU Smoke colored semi-transparent one. Cost me ~ $6 on e-bay, fits the phone well, and actually makes the phone easier to hold (adds a little grip). After receiving it, I also purchased one here on amazon (Eagle Cell - blue) so I have a replacement.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good value", "Author": "Wayne", "ReviewID": "R2OIAO55HRZN62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is Samsung's second offering in a nine month period for T-Mobile that gives them a version of the Galaxy S3 mini. The Galaxy Exhibit (SGH-T599, not to be confused with two older Exhibit phones) was similar, but had less memory and a dual core processor. This one has a quad core processor, and LTE, both of which are a step above the S3 mini and the Exhibit. It has far more memory usable for apps than the SGH-T599, equivalent to the S3 mini. It's fast and responsive, features Android 4.2.2 (also above the other two models) and newer features such as voice control, NFC, S-beam, and so on. It has a TFT screen that's crisp and sharp, but not the AMOLED screen of the S3 mini.With a selling price of $150, (list is much higher) it's a bargain and is as inexpensive as the SGH-T599. If you can get this at a good price, it's well worth it. The SGH-T599 is close enough in most respects that you might want to consider it if you are in the market for a used one, find it cheaper, can find an unlocked one and/or don't need the newer features of this one.

So, I'm not sending the phone back just yet. I've been able to work out some of my earlier issues and will now see how it goes for awhile. The lack of signal was a major issue but is now better.For those of you with same issue this may help: Go to settings, network connections, \"more networks,\" and \"wifi calling.\"  while it can be marked \"yes,\" click on \"connection preferences\" and make sure \"cellular network preferred\" is checked if you want to primarily work off your cell service. For some reason, this had been checked \"wifi preferred\" (I wonder if this is the default?) and was actually zapping my cell signal in the house. As soon as I changed to \"cellular\" preference the signal bars went up--way up. Problem solved for now. I was also able to download the 2 apps I wanted (then promptly turned off Google), work with the widgets, etc., so I'm much happier. As I don't like Bluetooth headsets, I got a microphone headset with on/off which works perfectly and allows me hands-free calling in the car, if I really need to talk to someone. Mostly though, this phone can send a text message that I'm not available when I'm driving, so that's good.So it's all good. Except the design. Still can't figure why anyone designed this with the power button and volume button directly opposite of each other, at the top of the phone where your fingers naturally hit them constantly.I wrote this earlier:So here are the good features, so far:1. My text messages now have a thread so I can see past texts I'm replying to. Yes, my previous phone was just that old.For those who already have this feature, this is nothing new for you.2. Better internet access than before (my old phone did have internet access).3. Larger screen than my old 2.5 x 1.5 screen.4. Email capable (old phone was not)5. Front facing camera. Others have said it's not a very good camera but I took photos with it and they're fine.6. Size. I'm not at all fond of the large clunky phones and am thinking that more people will want to go back to something smaller again that fits in a hand, a purse, a pocket. This is a perfect size.For those of you who already have a newer smart phone the above are probably not pluses for you, or make no difference.The camera is exactly the same as my older camera, video is the same (same phone manufacturer) so those don't matter in my assessment.NEGATIVES:1. As other reviewers have stated, the design of this phone is ridiculous. After reading the reviews I somehow decided that the buttons would be fine for me. HA! While I like the smaller footprint of the phone, what was Samsung thinking putting the volume button directly opposite the power button and putting them both at the top of the phone? The natural position of your fingers while holding this phone make these locations untenable for most needs. You hit the volume key (which also makes text size bigger) and end up turning off your phone or putting it to sleep. You open an app and your finger, while cradling your phone, accidentally closes the app because of the power button position. You constantly have to think about exactly where your fingers are placed on this phone to make sure you don't accidentally hit one of those 2 keys, or both at the same time, while you're working with an app, a call, etc.2. I'm looking through the owner manual to see how to make the tap features less sensitive because just holding the phone can end up hitting menu functions that mess things up. I haven't found one so if you even breath on the \"back\" portion of the phone you'll lose either your app or your place.3. The phone freezes. I suddenly lost access to the keyboard and after calling TM I ended up having to turn the phone all the way off and restart before I could get the keyboard back.Personally undesirable feature, GOOGLE:This actually has nothing to do with the phone but with my personal preferences: I don't like Google and didn't realize just how monopolizing Google made Samsung phones. My old Samsung could download apps from the internet w/o Google Play, this one can't. You HAVE to have a Google Gmail account to download anything and/or other Google invasive functions do just many things on this phone. It took me a long time to figure out how to make Ixquick my default browser and the phone still has problems with it. I disabled Google from running mostly, which will disable many features. I can turn Google play off, which I did after the app downloads and thankfully payment can be made directly through your Tmobile account, so that's good.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Brand new and awesome!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RQ1VY9G97J2KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first, I was skeptical about this phone as I thought it might have been used.  But it isn't.  It is BRAND NEW as it states.  The photo shows the phone out of the box which I thought was misleading and such a low price.  Nevertheless, the phone is awesome.  It ranks between a S3 mini and a S4 mini.  I tested it side by side with my S3 and the scores were fairly close (the S3 beat it by a smidge).Folks that did tests with the phone say that the resolution isn't a good as the S3, but I beg to differ - it is bright and looks sharp!You can easily get it and activate it on T-Mobile (it comes with a T-Mobile SIM card), and T-Mo's MVNO owned MetroPCS which operates on the same network.

For the first time in recent history, my wife now has a phone that actually works the way it is supposed to.  From the get go, it was simple setup.  Pop in existing sim, answer a few check boxes and fill in some settings, and away it goes.  I love the fact that it has an \"easy mode\" which eliminates the clutter of android.  Great idea.  The camera is average for a 5mp.  It takes decent pictures in good light, about the same as every other Samsung phone.  Low light, just acceptable pictures, again like about every other cell phone you might buy.  Battery life is good.  Wifi calling and MMS over wifi work seamlessly.  Call quality is excellent.  The phone is stable and never hangs or reboots.  No dropped calls.  It is not lightning fast, and I'm not sure I would go trying to play 3d games on this phone.  However, quad core and 1g ram is downright great for this price point.  It is certainly not slow in day to day use at all.  For a budget phone, this is about as good as it gets.  It just plain works well.  Highly recommended as a lower end smartphone for average people who don't require 3d graphics, 24/7 movie streaming, or amateur photography.  If you are someone who requires your phone to be your little mini pc and entertainment center, keep looking.

The biggest issue I have is that the phone is very slow.  For example, I will touch the screen to make a \"one-touch\" call to have it take 2 seconds to decide what to do.  Very frustrating.  This slow processing is even more irritating when trying to use the GPS/navigation tool(s).  I'm not one for tons of photos and/or apps so I can't imagine what is slowing the phone down.

After seeing the Galaxy 4s Mini I fell in love with the smaller size but was sadden that T-Mobile would not be carrying the phone.  So after reading several glowing reviews on this I decided to give it a try.  I've heard it described as a mini version of the Galaxy III.  Anything is better than the old HTC I had, I love the size and display.  It also takes decent pictures/videos and has many features that I liked on the 4s without the $600 price tag.  I am a T-Mobile customer so I didn't have any problem activating this phone.  My one complaint - the phone service/signal doesn't seem to be as strong.

I mainly talk and text on the phone (I have a computer and Nexus pad for browsing, videos, etc.), so the portability/size tradeoff is totally worth it for me.

But the 4G/LTE capability works well when you need it.  You can find the phone unlocked as well. I've had it a couple of months and am very pleased so far.PROS:- Easily fits in your pocket - and your palm!- Battery life good: under normal use, holds charge all day; light use, 2 days; low use, up to 3-4 days- Decent 4\" 480x800 screen, bright, clear, and works well in most lighting conditions- Excellent value, well under $200 on Amazon with no contract- Good reception- Good audio quality even on speakerphone- T-Mobile version allows talk/text over WiFi using your mobile number (your minutes still count)- Removable back cover and replaceable battery- Keyboard usable even with two thumbs. I recommend investing $5 in SwiftKey app.- Relatively responsive to use (1.4 GHz quad processor), and sufficient onboard memory (8GB)- Runs recent Android version (4.2.2)- Add a Micro SD card for up to 64GB - no need to pay extra for versions with more memory- Worldphone - worked well traveling overseas (in GSM mode)- Front and rear cameras- Standard micro USB for charging, etc.CONS:- No LED for missed call/message notification- Camera is fair at best... 5Mp (w/ flash), and poor low-light performance- Long (up to 1 sec.) delay for camera autofocus- Bloatware courtesy of Samsung and T-Mobile (some can be disabled)- Plastic case, though it looks nice and feels good in your hand- Screen small for video watching or extended web browsing (but that's the point, it's a pocket-sized phone).Actually, my biggest complaint is the lack of an notification LED - that would have added very little cost and been handy since I don't keep the phone on me 24x7.  The second big issue is the camera - frankly it sucks, but then again, what do you expect for the size and price?  It's acceptable for quick shots (well, after waiting for the autofocus), but not for pictures you'll want to get right and save. But for those, I use my small, dedicated $100 14Mp point/shoot camera that blows away *any* cell phone camera... and probably always will. It's physics: decent photography, especially under different lighting conditions and with optical zoom, requires a larger lens, longer focal length, and more powerful flash than will likely fit into any affordable phone anytime soon.  For what you save on this phone, you can buy a better pocket camera than is available any $700 phone.Samsung apparently set out to make a smaller Android phone with most of the Galaxy 4 features, reasonable performance, and an excellent price point -- and on those criteria it totally delivers.

I have found quick, easy shortcuts to turning on/off bluetooth, wi-fi, and driving mode.If it is your first smartphone, there is an Easy Setting: it is 3 simple screens with a very uncluttered look. On the 3rd screen, you still get full access to all your apps. It is a lot less intimidating than the regular look. And by the end of a week or 2, you'll feel comfortable going to the regular setup. My only gripe is that the battery lasts only 1 to 1 1/2 days. I am told that is normal for smartphones, but my feature phones used to last 3-4 days. It takes some getting used to. However, with the phone off, it fully recharges in about 2 hours.My shortlist was the Lumia 521, Optimus F3, and the Galaxy Light. I skipped the Lumia because of the Windows app market, and the Optimus because it had less RAM/ROM.

None of that paying a Genious at the Apple store a bunch of money to swap the battery out for you.

However, I suspect that most of them (like TouchWiz) are just instances of carrier fiddling, and would continue to bedevil me even with a more expensive phone.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Ira", "ReviewID": "R20KOOD7CGK8ZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first smart phone and I am so delighted that I choose the Galaxy light.It was a little learning experience to use it but still easier then I thought.I highly recommend this phone and system.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Light", "Author": "K.

It's my first smartphone and I am totally satisfied. It does all of the PDA things my iPad Touch did and works whenever I need to use it to make or receive calls. I bought 1000 talk minutes for $100 and have a year to use them. If at the end of a year I still have minutes left I have only to top up my minutes with a $10 purchase and the original minutes plus the new ones are good for another year. We are definitely low usage callers so I'll have minutes left over and will only need to spend $10 a year going forward. The phone itself is a typical Android device and has every conceivable app available, many free of charge. I use it to listen to music (with Winamp) and free audiobooks from the library (with Overdrive) and was already using Gmail and Google Calendar, so all of that synced up with no hassle. The voice quality is good and the speaker phone is loud enough that I have to turn the volume down a notch. The screen is sharp and bright and battery drain is moderate: if I turn the phone off at night the battery is good for a couple of days. I've had an Android tablet for more than a year so the learning curve for the phone was not very steep. All in all this was a good purchase at a very good price and will serve me for some years. My only issue in the beginning was getting the phone to recognize my T-Mobile account. It turns out, not surprisingly, that it's not enough to just insert the new SIM card in the new phone.

Don't need or want Phablets and the newest, shiniest, glitziest with all the bells, lights and buzzers isn't a much of a priority. We're gadget freaks to a point, but NOT techo freaks, just want reliable android phones that are reasonably current & functional, that work like they're supposed to, that fit in a pocket, can be operated with one average sized hand most of the time and are practical & affordable.I research the hell out of nearly every equipment purchase I make and where cell phones are concerned, decent battery life and a user replaceable battery are MANDATORY. Why anyone would spend hundreds of $ on a phone that they can't perform the most basic and frequent basic repair on themselves (battery replacement) is beyond me, but to each their own decisionsWhen I came across the Samsung Galaxy Light I was absolutely THRILLED!  Then my follow-up research began...While signal quality is an issue of concern reported in some reviews that I'd still need to check into more deeply before clicking \"Buy\", I have been extremely frustrated to learn that as of the date of this review, and although the Light is constructed to allow battery replacement by the user, there is NO REPLACEMENT BATTERY AVAILABLE for purchase by an owner of a Light!!!  THAT is a non-negotiable deal-killer for me, and IMO extremely stupid and ridiculous. Why make a phone like this WITH the capability and configuration to allow the user to replace the battery (and therefore carry a spare, when desired), yet not simply produce and sell a replacement battery??? It's like a sandwich shop offering a sandwich with just ONE piece of bread. Who does that kind of stuff? Who BUYS that kind of stuff??Samsung support even has a part # (EB-B105BUBEBUS) for a replacement battery, but it's NOT AVAILABLE and the rep I spoke with had no way of knowing or finding out when or even IF this battery might ever be available.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clipped. Previous content from original review deleted at this point as it's no longer applicable or pertinent.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 5/20/14 - Thanks to all who commented and provided info about the availability of a replacement battery. I pulled the trigger today and ordered two of these phones. More to come in a few weeks when I have some time to evaluate their performance.UPDATE: 6/5/14 - We've used the phone(s) for a couple of weeks now, and I find them quite satisfactory! Ended up buying both phones, four cases and two replacement/spare batteries + screen savers for +/- $310. TOTAL. Excellent Value!I've had no signal issues, no dropped calls & the 4G LTE and WiFi work fine, call quality and volume are outstanding, all features work without issue and in my opinion, these are EXCELLENT phones for the price!  We prefer the small form factor and they are very close in that respect to the phones we had to replace, so no real adaptation to them was necessary. Also the battery life is excellent if you use them prudently. We get TWO FULL DAYS out of a full charge with moderate use, which amazes me. We don't play a lot of videos or games but again for what we need and use them for, they're more than acceptable in every respect.We don't use the cameras much on the phones as we have digital cameras for when we need them, but I find no fault with photo quality for what the cams are. The descriptions of others identifying these phones as a great \"beginners\" phone doesn't do justice to them, as they do everything we need them to do, and more than our old phones did very, very well.If you're looking for a good quality, functional, reasonably priced, small form factor android phone, that fits in your pocket and doesn't feel like you're carrying an LCD TV or brick around with you, you can't go wrong with the Galaxy Light!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Jan W.
