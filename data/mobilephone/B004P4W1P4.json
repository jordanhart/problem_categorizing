It works with her t-mobile sim just like it says it does.  The phone came quickly and is working the way it should. It was very easy to switch the information from one phone to another. This is a great phone for someone who does not need all the bells and whistles.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "limitations for texters", "Author": "FEJH", "ReviewID": "R32MPOCL1WWFLW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not happy with this phone. I mainly text, so these gripes relate to texting:1. When sending a text you can't type in the name of the contact and have it looked up. In the To: field you either type the number, or you have to press options, Add recipients, contacts, then you type the name of the person for a lookup, ok, add.2. It will only store 230 texts despite the user manual saying it will store up to the limit of shared storage. It actually means it will store to the limit of the smaller of those two. Texts are separated in inbox and sent box rather than being sorted by person.3. The letter keys are squishy and if you don't hit the center the key won't register4. You have to type alt before each number in a text because there are no dedicated number keys on the keyboard.5. We bought two of these. My phone won't let me make groups of contacts but the other one will. I have done a master reset on my phone and still no go. I presume it's a software corruption.6. You cannot download text tones whereas you can download ringtones.7. The icon which means you have voicemail is almost always on. I call voicemail and there are no messages and the icon turns off for a few minutes, then it turns on again.8. The sequence to unlock is to push two buttons that are next to each other. Consequently if you put it in your pocket it will frequently unlock itself and pocket dial. I have not found a suitable case that will prevent this.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Marsha Silagy", "ReviewID": "R3ASIB6URYX7FO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you just want to talk and text this phone works well. The keys on the keyboard are a little flat but manageable or I would have given it 5 stars.  The most IMPORTANT feature for me is the feature that repeats an alert every minute when you get a new text.  So you don't have to constantly look at the phone to check for texts. You can set it for 2 minute alerts if desired.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the better basic phones. No longer made (of course)", "Author": "Bill Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R16BZXOADFGMVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No longer made, this Samsung model was one of the better basic phones. The first one I had broke only after year's of constant use. Tried replacing it with same model but couldn't find one (at the time). Ended up with a similar looking Samsung model that was poorly made and some hardware and software features didn't work too well. Lasted about 6 months before screen got broken somehow. Searched again and found a new supply of T369s available and quickly nabbed one. The one I got must have been retired inventory from a Canadian carrier. Works the same but had to bring it to a T-Mobile store to have them change some settings in order for picture texts to come though. Keep that in mind, but these phones are a solid choice for basic needs.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Proven & Durable Design", "Author": "Sandra \"Sandra\"", "ReviewID": "R3NWVSCAEJGD9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for quite some time, using the T-Mobile Pay As You Go Play. Of the many cell phones I have come across, this one has proven itself. Don't get the \"old fashioned\" design fool you, this phone is dependable and has only a few minor flaws.The buttons are all physically there and raised so that you can find them tactfully. It even has a slide-out physical QWERTY keyboard with non-slip buttons. The \"cursor\" is a raised ring that you can easily feel and clicks in 4 directions, I've given it to men with big clumsy fingers and they had no problem with it.The UI is also simple and easy to navigate, use the cursor ring or push the corresponding number on the keypad to execute a function. It's one of the more simpler yet useful UI's I've come across.Photo and video are surprisingly decent, even at low resolution it takes very clear pictures with minimal color distortion, has good auto-white balance too. Video is not quite as a good in quality and the still camera requires that you hold the camera very still for at least 2 seconds. So no action shots.The camera shutter sound is also very loud and the shutter button is frequently accidentally hit and photophobes sometimes freek out and think you take a photo of them. You can \"lock\" the keypad and other buttons by holding down the star (*) key. It supports optional PIN/password locking as well.Voice and text work just fine, supports T-Mobile and AT&T; networks. There is a normal volume and speaker phone volume option you can enable during voice calls.E-mail and account balance no longer work, unfortunately.The memory card can be removed/unmounted while the phone is still on and remounted. Only problem is that you have to open the cover without detaching the battery and when you push in the memory card its easy to accidentally click the camera button.You can set custom ring tones, even for for each individual contact, from an mp3 on the memory card. But you can not change the default new text message sound.The construction and durability is one of the best, and a rarity these days. Mine has been dropped, stepped on, scratched, etc, and it still works like brand new. There is a hook in the corner of the shell in which you can hang a wire noose (sold separately).There are no advanced features like WIFI or GPS, but it does have bluetooth and a modem feature for dialup Internet. This is an all-around easy and dependable phone for your parents or people who don't want to fuss with a galaxy of features.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone!", "Author": "Kristen", "ReviewID": "R2D16LAI3FJUTT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this for my husband because I like the one I had so much.
