{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb phone--once bad call audio has been fixed by disabling EVRC_B codec", "Author": "Nventor", "ReviewID": "R4XM7GDG76NWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace my original upgrade, a Nexus 5, which I was not happy with (disappointing battery life, call-performance issues, unexplained self-reboot). The G2 is very similar, also made by LG, but with 30% more battery capacity (3Ah vs 2.3Ah), so it was a natural choice. I couldn't be happier with the decision, as the G2 has every bit the beauty and performance of the N5, but a significantly longer battery life. In fact, my impression is that the difference is more than the relative difference in battery capacities, so I suspect that there might be some clever power-saving software techniques at work in the G2 that are not in the N5. I could certainly go on and on about the gorgeous screen, very fast performance, surprisingly convenient \"knock-on\" feature, etc. etc., but you'll probably already have read all of that from other reviews. I can't give an opinion on the placement of the power and volume buttons on the rear as I haven't had the phone long enough to really adapt to that feature, but I don't really see it as a problem. In short, I'm certain there is simply no better value in a contract phone on Sprint than the G2.I'm writing this review primarily to describe one very annoying issue that I had with the phone initially, namely poor call-audio quality, with frequent pops, static, distortion, drop-outs, etc. Since this phone is so new to the Sprint network, I figured it was most likely a software issue, and sure enough there is a discussion thread on the Sprint Community forum about it, including a post that identifies the EVRC_B codec as the culprit and provides a procedure for disabling it. Once I did that, the problem disappeared, so I'll include the procedure here in case others have the same problem. I'm sure LG and/or Sprint will eliminate it soon enough with a software update, but until then this fix certainly works well enough for me.Here's the procedure:Bring up the phone Dial PadEnter ##443336772# and capture the 6-digit SPC code that's displayed for 3 seconds or so, which you will need to enter in a subsequent step. (This is also known as the MSL code.)Enter ##3282# to access a \"Data\" menuTap \"More\" at the bottom of the menu.Tap \"Advanced\" and then \"Edit\", at which point you will be asked to enter a Service Code. Enter the 6-digit SPC code captured previously to get another menu,.Tap EVRC_B and set the option to DisableTap the Back key, at which point the phone will reboot with the EVRC_B disabled, and the problem should be solved.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just say \"NO\" to S4, HTC One, and iPhone...", "Author": "Isaac J. Vanhoose", "ReviewID": "R197RG5DSZ1FHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my G2 yesterday, and all I can say is Amazon hooked me up!  The price w/2-year upgrade was just $20, which beats the pants off of the advertised price from Sprint and elsewhere.  I honestly can't believe that they're \"giving\" such a powerful, fast, sexy smartphone for that.  If you are due for an upgrade, look no further.I originally was between the S4 and HTC One, and went into the Sprint store to play around to finalize my decision before ordering online.  I had messed around with my friend's S4, and wasn't too keen on it, but I did fall in love with the svelte looks of the HTC One and similar performance.  Mind made up, I was on my way out the door, and the G2 caught my eye.  I picked it up, and while not as aesthetically pleasing as the HTC One, the performance and specs on it blew me away.  I got home, reasearched pricing, and with a $150 difference in price, the decision to go for the G2 was a no-brainer...Much has been penned about the rear volume/power buttons, and I was pretty worried about breaking my side-bezel muscle memory in that regard.  After messing with the phone for 1 hour, it was already 2nd nature.  The ONLY drawback I see with the location is the propensity to touch the camera lens while toggling volume/power, but it's really a minor inconvenience as I'm not snapping photos with my phone every few minutes.  I love the slim profile, HUGE screen, and - oh yeah - the RECEPTION.  This thing absolutely blows my Motorola Photon out of the water on ability to get calls/data!!!  With my old phone, I couldn't get calls/data within .5 miles of my workplace parking lot; today with my G2 I can now surf (3G), text, and call all from inside the building!  I don't know what magic LG put into these phones to make them so prone to pulling in good signal, but it worked.Other than the camera lens touching issue, the only \"cons\" about this phone are the plastic body (albeit a very GOOD LOOKING plastic body) and slight static on some calls (may be a geography issue?).Lastly, my wife is now on the G2 also after having an iPhone for years (I've always been Android).  She is FLOORED and has asked me repeatedly why I ever let her get an iPhone in the first place.  After playing with the iPhone 5s, I can say with absolute certainty that the G2 with it's 4.2.2 Android eats its lunch.

MORENO \"Robfactory\"", "ReviewID": "RM6NB34PSP5JO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG G2 has been called innovative.It has won design awards.However, it has failed to become a mainstream phone.I did a review 2 months ago comparing the HTC One and the LG G2. In this review I went over the basic differences between both phones. I didn't give a conclusion because I had the phone for two weeks and I had not customized it the way I wanted. This included rooting the phone and doing several tweaks.I will note the stock and tweaked versions of the review.Screen:Well, I'm two months in with the phone and this will be a full on review of the device. The first thing you'll notice about this phone is the 5.2 inch screen. It is a full HD 1080p IPS display with 423 ppi resolution. This is housed in a 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 frame. The G2 is one of the thinnest if not the thinnest bezel smartphone in the market. This makes the screen look rather large compared to same sized phones with larger bezels.The colors of the screen are overly saturated. This is something that has become common practice. It makes images pop and also makes images brighter and the cost of losing real life image quality. In no way is this phone supposed to replace a tablet or E-Reader, but as a commute reader, it will be more than adequate.The screen is also part of a new technology called Graphic RAM (GRAM), which caches an image when the screen is static. This means when the screen is not being refreshed on a new image, the CPU and GPU do not have to be used. This can enhance battery life, according to LG.Pros:1. Amazing screen to bezel dimensions.2. Good viewing angles.3. Good under sunlightCons:1. Over Saturated colorsBattery:The phone's non-removable Li-Po 3000 mAh battery is one of the main reasons I switched from the HTC One. I often go out of my provider's reach. This causes the phone to search for a signal and drain the battery rather fast. Not only that, but I also leave the GPS, data sync (GMail, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, tumblr, LinkedIn, Google Offers, TuneInRadio, DropBox, Box, Google+) on, while using the MP3 player.On a regular 6 hour outing with reception coming in and out, using the camera,editing photos, uploading stuff to social media and listening to music, I would drain the battery about 40%. So the phone still has 60% of battery life left.Battery Tweaked:After rooting the phone I used a couple of ROMs and MODs.Currently, I am using furnace-0.0.7 kernel. This kernel has different optimizations which include tweaks to the voltages, CPU overclocking, fast charge, and battery extender among the many.While using all of the software above, I have managed to drain the battery 30% in 13 hours. Leaving the phone with 70% battery life.Pros:1. 3,000 mAh2. Need I say more?Cons:1. Not removable. Then again, you won't need to.Camera:No camera is perfect. In fact, all cameras have a compromise. This is especially true when it comes to mobile phones.The bad:The OIS on the 13-megapixel camera is not this good. In fact, the camera has had several issues. First of, the camera depends too much on software stabilization and denoising, it then uses the two-axis optical image stabilization and multi-point auto-focus to help produce a stable picture.Here is where the problem lies. Rather than using the hardware stabilization more and then the software, the pictures at times come out as if they were painted. This is more evident in night time photos. The over processing and software stabilization makes the pictures come out oddly Van Gogh-esque, which is not a compliment.Modes:The phone's software is very much like Samsung's Galaxy line. Click on Mode and it will give you a graphic example of what it does and an accompanied text explaining it.The best mode for daylight photos is Intelligent Auto (IA). However, for some reason, LG made the software default to normal.Now my questions is, if you taut IA as being a great feature and the best of all the camera settings, why not make it the default mode?Another issue with the way the camera software is that it doesn't keep the previous mode selected.For example, I'm at a sporting event and choose the Sports camera mode. I take a shot and go back to my home screen. If I want to take another photo, I have to go to Mode again because it goes back to Normal as default mode.Night mode and image stabilization are a problem on this phone. As stated above, since the phone depends on denoising software and stabilization first, and then the physical OIS, it softens the photos to a degree where it looks drawn.Click on the photos below to enlarge.Focus: Not for the rapid photographerOne thing you'll notice is that the focus on this takes a while.  If you try to hurry the shot you will get something like this.This is just unacceptable performance from a high end phone's camera.However, don't let this discourage you.The Good:The rear volume - acts as a camera activator when the phone is on standby, it also lets your capture a photo once the camera app is up and running. I found this useful for taking candid shots.Multi-point Auto-focusThis is something I wish more companies would use. By letting the camera have multi-focal points you get a cleaner picture. And yes, some companies have used the multi-face tracker, but not on random objects.DaylightWhen there is a good amount of daylight, this camera is amazing. The shots are clean and clear. The colors are very accurate. It doesn't help that the screen also accents those opaque colors at times. Depending on the scenery, I usually pick between Dynamic Tone Range (HDR) or IA. The only time I pick Normal is when I don't have time for the menu.Either way, here are some shots: I use the Wide Angle setting which is 10 mega-pixels.Since you get 13 mega-pixels (10 for Wide Angle) you get a lot of details per shot. This enables you to crop and edit a photo without much loss of definition. It also allows details in depth.Camera Pros:1. 13 mega-pixels2. Quality under good lighting3. Intelligent Auto setting4. Volume (-) camera launcher and shutter.Camera Negative:1. Low light capture quality2.  Focus set time3. Camera UI's lack of keeping the last Mode setting.Tweaked Camera:I've been using Xdabbeb's Camera Mod. This mod enhances focus times, night time shooting quality, overall image quality, it adds 1600 ISO and it lets hardware stabilization become eminent in the process. For information click on the link.Video:The version of the phone I have only has two noise cancelling microphones, which is ok, but could be better with three. Since the third microphone would have been in the back of the phone and capturing the audio from the front.The video above will go over the different video features.It's pretty neat that the camera is able to support 60 frames per second in daylight and well lit areas. This gives the recording a more realistic view and flow.This setting will only be available on 1080p.I wish they would have set it for 720p and lesser quality videos.By recording in 1080p 60 fps you will soon realize that the files are rather large. So be careful when filming videos that you do not fill the phone's drive.Asides from that, I noticed the video quality to be quite good. You get Normal, HDR Recording, Live Effect (which makes you have funny faces), Dual Recording (use both front and rear cameras in one shot) and Tracking Zoom, which is explained in the video.The Negative:The video camera lacks a clear focus. In some phones you are able to click on the screen and get a visual mark of where the video is trying to focus. Sadly, this phone doesn't have that. I've noticed that when I zoom in to an object at a distance, the video will quickly lose focus and become useless. This is something I wish they would fix.There's no slow motion.Tweaked:By using the same Xdabbeb's mod, we get more options in the settings menu. We are able to use 60fps in 720p videos. We also get better focus times and anti-shaking. This is on top of the OIS.Pros:1. Good Quality Video2. 1080p 60fpsCons:1. Lack of focus notification2. Digital Zoom and the lack of focus speed.Camera Overview:The camera's quality and details are great. It's a really good 13 mega-pixel camera if you are going to shoot landscapes, have the camera conveniently set up to take a shot, or are taking regular pics.The major problem I have with this camera are the focus times. They are horrible. That, and the optimized image stabilization algorithm. I mean seriously... if you have the hardware, depend on that rather than the software which is making most low-light photos come out as if they were oil painting.Audio:Phone now days have become more than just phones. They have become point-and-shoot cameras and mp3 players. This phone is able to playback MP3/WAV/FLAC/eAAC+/AC3/WMA files. They make a point in their presentation to mention this is the first smartphone on the market to feature 24-bit/192kHz hi-res audio playback.At that definition the sound is quite good. Especially if you have a good pair of headphones /earphones.The only drawback to this is that a regular track can be more than 100mb. The average person has about 3 hours worth of music on their phone. That would be a total of about 8GB-10GB.Calculations based on this scale.Storage:This is a perfect entry into storage. The US version of the G2 has a fixed 32GB hard drive. The drive on this phone is actually quite fast and sufficient for most.However, there is no expandable slot. This leads to the issue of why are you going to have a hi-res player when the hard drive space is limited? After all is said and done you get about 24GB of HD space. You add apps and cache storage and that's about 22-20GB left.CPU and RAM:The phone has a 2.26 GHz Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon\u2122 800 Quad-Core Processor, which is the latest on the market. It also has 2GB of RAM. This is enough to power any top of the line phone and tablet.Buttons:Having the Volume +, Power On/Off , Volume - on the back of the phone has yet to be a negative. When I use my mobile phone, I usually have my index finger next to the camera lens. I realize it has taken some getting used to, but I like it.Features:KnockOn:The major software feature this phone has is the KnockOn feature. Tap the screen twice with your finger and it wakes up the phone from standby. It's a feature I use quite frequently when I have the phone on my car dock or bike dock.QSlide:This feature lets you use defined apps on top of your current screen. It's a feature I really have not used.QuickRemote:I found LG\u2019s Quick Remote software to quite complete and easy to navigate. However, the IR Blaster is quite small and you have to point the phone directly into the TV.Final Impressions:The phone feels the same as a Samsung Galaxy S3/S4. It is made out of plastic and nothing on the phone is removable. Since the phone is mostly screen, I would recommend getting a case for it. If it falls chances are the screen will shatter. The G2 I possess has a silicon case that adds a bit of heft to it. This makes the phone feel sturdy on my hands. Also, choose the white version. The black version of this phone is a fingerprint magnet. Plus, the white phone looks nicer in my opinion.Do I like the phone?Yes, I do. The phone has many advantages: battery, screen, audio, and image quality.The two main negatives are the lack of  expanding storage and the camera quirks.If you set your phone to create and use high quality media, you have to allow the capacity for it. It would have been easy to allow for a microSD slot like in the Asian markets.The camera suite leaves a bit to be deserved. In my opinion the HTC One has the best camera suite. The Zoe feature is amazing and something Android mobile manufacturers should imitate. Having said that, the image quality on this phone is amazing. I actually could go out and say it is in the top two in most Android categories.Overall, I would recommend this phone and give it an 8.5 out of 10.Pictures taken with the phone and edited with VSCO CAM or SnapSeed, Or PicSay Pro, or Pixrl-o-MaticFor photo samples go to my site robfactory . come", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "I. Love. This. Phone.", "Author": "Lazarus", "ReviewID": "R34FKFHUXXT0S0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went through countless reviews before choosing this phone. What it boiled down to for me was price, battery life, call quality, screen size, performance and to some degree, features.I was debating between the S4, Nexus 5 and the LG G2. I've had the Epic 4G and the Epic 4G Touch (Galaxy I and II) for the pass 3 years and decided to try something new. Although there are many similarities between the S4 and the G2, battery life and raw CPU power was enough for me to switch. As for the Nexus 5, it is a cheaper version of the G2 so that's a no-brainer unless price is an issue and your buying at full price. I do miss the \"finger hover\" feature\" from the S4 but I figured battery life was more important than that single feature.I've had the phone for a couple of days now and I love it. After turning some bloatware off, the battery life is incredible! The very first day I had it on for 8 hours straight before it ran out of juice. Today it will easily last 20+ hours with moderate use.UPDATE(3 WEEKS): I still get insane amount of battery life. A few days ago, I had 13 hours of usage with the screen on for 7 hours, a live wallpaper and I still had 9% of battery life left.A lot of reviews are dogging this phone because of the power/volume button placement on the back, but I like that feature. When I'm holding the phone to my ear, it's easier to press the volume buttons on the back than on the side. The \"knock\" on feature is great and I use it most of the time.The keyboard does not have Swype, but aside from that, it is the best onscreen keyboard I've used. It is qwerty with long press for symbols and numbers on the top row.EDIT: There is an option in settings for the official Swype keyboard.The screen is big (enough) and the side bezels are small so there is less wasted screen real estate. It's winter here in the Seattle area, so I haven't had the chance to test brightness out in direct sunlight but so far the screen is great and the high pixel density makes text look amazingly clear. I'm no colorphile but the IPS screen is vibrant enough for me.The speaker placement and sound leave something to be desired but they're good enough for me. Some reviews say they sound \"tinny\" so that is quite possibly true but I don't really care. To me it's a portable device so I'm not expecting top notch, home theater sound. If I were that bothered about it I would've bought the HTC One. When I want to seriously listen to music, I'd use headphones anyway.UPDATE(3 WEEKS): The speakers are not loud enough. I'm still looking for a good volume booster app. If you listen to music on you phone's speakers a lot, you might get frustrated with this phone.Some reviewers don't like the non-removable battery and that there is no SD expansion. Honestly, those are bummers but with 32GB of internal storage and a 3000mAH battery, that's adequate enough for me. If you are going to store Gigabytes of movies than this is not the phone for you.I wrote this review with my new G2 and I'll update this review if anything changes or I think of something life changing to mention.UPDATE (3 WEEKS): I had one instance where I experienced the \"Recent Apps\" (Access by holding down the home button) slow down. No matter what I tried it would still be slow. Everything else worked fine but after a restart everything has been back to normal.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone with a few flaws", "Author": "DP21", "ReviewID": "R2862MFRKSVI1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros-1. Excellent performance. Incredibly fluid and pleasant experience.2. Very long battery life.3. Nice big display. Excellent for watching videos on the go.4. Camera is excellent. Almost as good as a regular point and shoot.5. 32 GB of internal storage.6. The buttons on the back are great once you get used to them.Cons-1. Can be difficult to operate with one hand.2. Software bugs.3. No MicroSD card slot or removable battery.4. Quick Remote can be much better.5. LG launcher could be better.6. It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don\u2019t use a cover.Having used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.Pros (continuation)1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the \u201cnight\u201d mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don\u2019t think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.Cons (continuation)1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesn\u2019t have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesn\u2019t receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You can\u2019t take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.In conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don\u2019t think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isn\u2019t. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Engineering perfection", "Author": "Jonzer2049er", "ReviewID": "R26ID16ZD1UB36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone rocks!

Volume  could be louder at high setting but fine for my ears. Phone is amazingly fast in all aspects. The big deal is no buttons as the toggle is on the back of the phone. A bit of a learning curve for this but I don't miss having the buttons at all. Great camera to boot!", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Eric S. Shoup", "ReviewID": "R1LOR97K4SQBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from Amazon a week ago for a penny and all I can say is \"wow\".  Coming from a Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch, I figured how much of an upgrade could this phone possibly be, as I was fairly satisfied with my S2.  The reason I decided to upgrade was the price (one cent), the S2 had a cracked screen, and wanting a phone that supported not just Sprint's 4G LTE network but also their upcoming \"Spark\" tri-band LTE service.I was a bit hesitant to buy this phone due to no micro-SD card slot, no replaceable battery, and being somewhat loyal to the Samsung brand.  All those concerns faded away as soon as I powered on my G2.  This phone has a beautiful screen, it boots up in seconds (probably under 10 seconds) compared to the ~20+ of my S2, and the battery lasts almost two full days (48 hrs) with moderate use!LG was kind enough to leave the bloat to a fair minimum (it still comes Sprint Zone and LG's own app store, which seems completely unnecessary), and the 32GB of space allowed room for 12GB or so of music with plenty of room left for more.The knock-knock (double-tap on screen) to turn the screen on (and off) is an awesome feature; I used to worry I was going to wear out my S2's power button pressing it so much.  Having the volume and power buttons on the rear is kind of weird, but since I never use the power button I don't find myself pressing any of the back buttons very often.One issue I ran into on the 1st day of use was an incompatibility between the G2 and my wifi router (D-Link brand), but a firmware update for the router resolved this issue - a bit of an oddity since no other device on our wifi network has ever had any issues.In summary, this phone is the best I've ever owned, and has exceeded all my expectations.  It's super quick, has a great large screen, and a battery that seems to last forever.  There doesn't seem to be quite as much user community support for it as my S2 (custom ROMs and such), but it has been rooted and a couple custom ROMs already exist (including Cyanogenmod).  Right now Amazon's upgrade price is $50, and while not as good as a penny, the phone is well worth this price and a lot more.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best device I have ever used", "Author": "jacki pants", "ReviewID": "RGFF4FHL23B71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: Screen has minimal bezel Fast processor Good size and weight, feels good in your hand.

When I plug the phone into my AUX in the car, I have to turn the volume up all the way on the phone as well as the car radio when listening to Spotify.  I didn't buy it for sound, but it would be nice if the sound were a little better.I went from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus to this device.  I almost went with the Galaxy note, but slightly too big for me.  I have to say, the LG G2 the best device I have ever used, and I am not sorry I didn't go with the Note.  The processor is screaming, the look is sleek, and I have not had a single issue with 2 months of use.  If you are on the market for a nice-looking device, and are interested to get away from Samsung for a bit, this is the phone for you.Other than making calls, I look for a device that plays games well...meaning, the battery won't die on me, the look is nice and there is no lag.  This device fits the bill for all 3.  Battery life is great (it is an internal battery like the iphone.  It is not removable).  I don't have to search for a place to plug in after an hour of game play.  And the device doesn't heat up like some devices do when playing games for a long time.  I don't have issues where the device freezes up between apps like I did with my Galaxy.  The screen is beautiful.  There is a very small bezel around the edge, so there is a lot of screen to be seen.I spent weeks researching devices.  Prices.  Features.  Durability.  Battery life.  Screen size.  The LG G2 is a refreshing break from Samsung.

Honestly, I was concerned about an extra termination fee for the first 6 months to get such an amazing deal on this, but this phone is so fast and good quality I already know keeping it activated for 6 months is an absolute given. The volume on the back is great for phone calls but I still have to get used to it for everything else. Battery life is insane, it can take hours to just drop to 95% under light use. Since the battery can't be replaced, I keep it plugged in as much as possible to not use up charging cycles on it.

Went back and forth between brands, types, styles, etc.  The only constant was that I wanted a black phone.  The rest was up in the air.  This went on for months.. couldn't pull the trigger and pick a phone.  That was until I decided to look on Amazon for Sprint phones.  I was okay with Sprint, but my plan was up, my phone was dying, and I was eligible for an upgrade.For me, cost was a huuuuuge factor.  Even with being eligible for an upgrade, on the Sprint site this phone was $199, and out of my price range.THANK YOU AMAZON.....I checked here and saw this phone, which I had not considered because of the price.  It was 39.99.  Really. $500 phone and 39.99 on Amazon.  (I love you Amazon.)I AM NOT A TECHIE....I read every review, and I learned a lot.  Thank you Amazon reviewers.  For the most part, the folks do their job very well in reviewing their purchases.  I received replies from a reviewer, which helped my decision.  This phone has features I never thought I would use, but now cannot live without.  I can access all 3 of my work email accounts, plus 2 personal accounts. This phone was / is very easy to figure out.. even for me.  I have a problem... I do not read instruction manuals.  I don't have the time, and I just wing it.  That said, this phone makes winging it very easy.LG DOES IT RIGHT....I like LG products.  That's personal preference.  This phone has little subtle things that make it easy to use, and fast.  Fast to me is being able to move between functions, and apps quickly.  LG does not bury apps and leave you to hunt and peck for them.  Toggling between apps is easy and fast.  AND, I LOVE the fact that while I am on a conference call I can toggle to my notepad and jot notes while I'm on the call.  Talk about time saving, user friendly, and simplified.  PDF files download FAST, and easy to read thanks to the large screen.  Same goes for MS Office products.. easy to read and fast download.  I am not 'considered' to be in a 4G area, but my phone is always in 4G mode.  If I venture out of the area, the 3G is a tad slower on downloads, but still fast enough for me.  Storage space... plenty and then some.  Again... depends on your needs obviously.PREFERENCE.....A lot of a review is personal preference.  Obviously, right?  Like I said, I am not a techie, and fortunately there are those reviewers that are, thank goodness!  For my needs.. work, emails, texting, news, reliable (!!) phone... this phone is awesome.

Wow is this thing fast, and battery life is spectacular. I no longer have to worry about how I use the phone for fear of it dying in a couple of hours. I have gotten quite few 30+ hour sessions with heavy use - long phone calls on speakerphone, gaming, web browsing, music and podcasts, GPS, etc. I was going to be happy if I could just get a solid 10 hours, but it has been no problem making it from early morning until bed-time on a single charge. It also charges very fast.The interface is smooth and lag-free thanks to the processor.Coming from a pure Android phone, I was a little wary of dealing with a manufacturer's skin, but the experience has been better than expected. I was using third-party apps on the Nexus to gain similar functionality to some of the LG features anyway. Other LG features I don't use aren't really intrusive and therefore easy to ignore and/or disable in settings, such as the Slide Aside. I prefer to use the recent apps list, which you need to access by long-pressing the home button.The placement of the buttons on the back are easy to adjust to, but I find that I rarely need to use them. I find myself using the Knock-on feature most of the time to wake and lock the phone. It is so intuitive once you use it, that I stupidly find myself trying to do the same on my tablet, and even a couple of times on my computer. There is a quick volume control in the notifications bar as well.The screen is excellent both in size and clarity.

I loved everything else about it, but when you can't use it for the MAIN purpose, what good is it?I am now back to my Samsung Galaxy SII and afraid to try another phone and maybe get the same very bad results.If you are in an area with excellent coverage with Sprint, I'm sure you will LOVE this phone. Beware however, if you are on the periphery............FORGET ABOUT IT!", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Next stop, G2....If the price is right.", "Author": "Red XIII", "ReviewID": "R15SQ9PON349GP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this phone for a couple of days now, and after using it, I do \"feel\" my upgrade was justified. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy SII (Android 4.0.4 - Lastest update). The SGS2 was a great phone the whole two years I had it. I was due for an upgrade and saw the deal on Amazon for $19.99 and figured I couldn't beat that deal for such a \"fancy schmancy\" phone.Although the LG G2 was priced at $19.99, I ended up paying around $100 after everything was said and done. What some may not know is that the state taxes the consumer on the price of the phone. So say the LG G2 cost 599.99 (no contract), you would have to pay 8-10% of the 599.99 as tax (depending on your location) regardless if the phone was sold $19.99. Meaning the cost would be $19.99 (phone) + 59.99 (10% estimated tax) + $36.00 (activation fee) = !?!?!!Now after finding that all out, you might end up spending more than $19.99. There is a lot of little fine print that you should read and inquire about before pulling the trigger on this purchase. Make sure you have all your questions answered.I was choosing between the Samsung Note 3, Samsung Galaxy S4, Nexus 5 and the LG G2. The Samsung Note 3 had everything I wanted. S-pen, removal battery, software,hardware features were great. However, in my opinion the phone is just slightly too large for my preference. Furthermore, the persistent problems with call quality that users have been complaining about is a minus as it is a phone first, w/ bells and whistles second. Now I understand call quality can be disrupted depending on the variables, but still the cries of those consumers still send up a \"red flag\" on that choice. Also, hearing their experience with sprint about replacements, the hassle to go through it myself just isn't worth the risk. Like most, some have good experiences and others have bad experiences. I just want a clean and easy transition from one device to another.As for the SGS4, coming from a S2 I was ready to try something different, but I knew if the S4 was anything like the quality of my S2, it would be a solid phone choice upgrade. However, the cosmetic design of the Galaxy S series after the S2 has not caught my eye. I do not know why Samsung chose to use a physical home button instead of a flat capacitive touch buttons like the S2. Either way, it was my last option if the other phones didn't stack up to what I wanted.The Nexus 5 and the LG G2 are essentially the same phone. Both phones are made by LG and have nearly identical parts with a few exceptions. Also both have non-removable batteries. The differences that were important to me was screen size (4.9 vs 5.2), battery life (2300mAh vs 3000mAh, features, and feel. The Nexus 5 was great and Kitkat 4.4 was a smooth experience, but felt I wanted a little more screen. Since LG G2 will get a KitKat 4.4 update as well, the G2 was a clear choice for me between the two. LG decided to go with a rear volume and power buttons, I thought that was \"different\" and was curious about how it would feel in the hand.My experience with the LG G2 has been great. The phone feels great in the hand. The rear buttons feel very comfortable and natural when held. The rear buttons do not feel awkwardly placed, and I don't accidentally hit them when holding the phone from the sides like traditional button placement for cell phones. When holding the phone, I tend to let my pinky finger and index finger hold most of the weight, supported by the two mid fingers. I often found my pinky finger becoming tingly or uncomfortable when holding the phone for a mild (5-10mins) constant period of time. A quick adjustment of the phone and I'm right as rain. I know that the way I hold my phone is probably the cause of this, but coming from a \"traditional\" to \"non-traditional\" will take some adjustment.The speakers sound quality is average at best. I personally don't know anyone that listens to a stock speaker on any device these day. Most have headphones or an external bluetooth speakers like the Pill or Jawbone for their devices. Coming from a speaker phone perspective, the phone was what you would expect from a small speaker. I could hear the person speaking but as volume was maximized, the sounds became muddy (like you would expect from a small speaker). The front ear speaker worked well, and sounded clear depending on cell reception.The screen is bright and clear. Even with the shipping plastic still on the phone, I was able to see the screen clearly. I don't have relatively large hands. I wear a medium or large in most gloves. I found myself having trouble reaching across to the top left corner in certain instances of using the phone. However, this wasn't much of a problem as I expected the larger screen to have this inconvenience. The phone was very snappy and responsive as you would expect given the hardware.The applications that came stock on this phone surprised me. I'm used to bloatware from sprint, third-party devs and more. I was happy to see (at a glance) that there was not much added. Being that the phone has no slot for using an external micro SD, disk space is very precious. There are a few nice apps that Im sure the average user will find useful. The best thing about this phone is that there is a TON of customization options without the need to purchase another launcher. Less apps I have to install to get a unique experience, the better!The camera is one of my favorite features on this phone. Coming from an Android 4.0.4 camera, to the 4.2.2 camera was a welcomed upgrade/update. In my opinion, there is almost no need to purchase a point-and-shoot camera or cheap video camera anymore. The picture quality of both video and photos were good enough to replace both for moderate use. What is more important, I took video and pictures in low light and they were good. Better than I expected. The audio picked up by the microphone was good. The optical image stabilization (OiS) + burst mode will help you catch those precious moments you've missed. My S2 had to focus, then beep to let you know it focused, then click, or sometimes you had to press it again for it to take a photo. I've missed a lot of moments because of that slow camera. Not anymore with this camera. I can't wait to see what other videos/photos I can take with it. Another plus is that you can take pictures while recording video.The last feature I wanted to touch on but definitely by far the most useful but probably overlooked is the \"knock-knock\" feature. You simply tap twice on the screen and the phone screen will come on. I absolutely love this feature. I have had troubles in the past of buttons going out in my phones. Now I don't worry about that so much. All my control is done on screen unless powering on/off. Most people use their power button to wake the phone from sleep, after a while the button wears from use. Some may run into this problem, others may not. I have and it sucked.The LG G2 is a solid phone for the average user who wants to get a little more screen size without using two hands. The battery life, features, and design compliment each other well. It seems to me the big selling point of this phone is the customization. If that is what is most important to you, you can't go wrong with the LG G2. All the other hardware seems standard for most competing high-end phones (processor, ram, camera...etc). Like with any phone mentioned here, If the price is right for you, I'd say pull the trigger on the purchase they are all good phones. The LG G2 for me seemed to be the best phone for everything I wanted.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "N.

To my absolute shock, I was told that the technicians found a \"bent, chewed or mangled\" motherboard and denied warranty on it. WHAT?!!! The phone looked brand new, no damage to it whatsoever. I called LG and asked to speak to a tech. Nope, they don't take phone calls. I asked the service rep if they could explain how this could possibly be? Nope, can't explain it, it's just what the tech found. I was told that once a tech makes that determination, it's a closed case.

Walters", "ReviewID": "R2ZRD7AM73AVSL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, I want to state that the LG G2 is an amazing piece of kit. The hardware is slim, well built, and attractive. I'm even one of the few people that actually prefer the volume and power buttons in the back, something that I think scared off a lot of consumers (change, it's oh so scary). Second, I'm technically savvy. I know how to root, rom, and mod my kit, but I'm writing this review for the average consumer.Like I said, the LG is great kit, but the current rom's (software) issues have seriously overshadow any and all of the hardware's awesomeness. What was a functional and enjoyable device has become a consistent irritant. The issues go from general instability issues (crashing on apps & games that my single core moto triumph was even able to handle), to random overheating and battery drain, to a GPS that went from perfectly functional to useless. Finally, and most irritatingly, music playback that randomly stops multiple times in a given hour. In combination, these problems have completely removed this device as an option for some of the things I purchased it for; workout companion, driving assistant, and personal assistant. Since the last update, I've been forced to fall back to using my old car GPS, hiking gps, and mp3 player. Currently, I can't help but think the worst of LG. The fact that the previous Jelly Bean Rom was functional, combined with their utter lack of response these problems says, at best, they don't care.Till I get my hands on the next rom I'm recommend avoiding LG phones entirely (uh, excluding the Nexus 5 whose software is made and maintained by Google).", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Finally the smartphone has reached maturity", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R24BPHPIU2DD0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using the G2 for 6 months I realized that I'm completely satisfied with the phone.

It was a beast then, and with the new kitkat update, its even more amazing. Kitkat is one of the few software updates that actually help an android device run faster. It makes the LG G2 an absolute monster of a phone.I bought this phone coming from an iPhone 4, a really terrible and slow phone in retrospect. I watched the LG G2 Korean presentation and decided that this phone would be perfect for me.My favorite features with this phone are the blazingly fast speed, Knock on, the awesome voice assistant, the absolutely incredible camera (like seriously the best I've ever seen), optical image stabilization, powerful and long lasting battery, and HD audio and 60 fps video. The buttons that lie on the back of the phone are truly a better idea. You can more easily change the volume when the phone lies in your pocket, for example. After a while of using, you get used to it. You will be annoyed that other phones that you try do not have this feature.There are some pretty serious concerns that I have with with this phone though. I've had a pretty unnerving problem with the audio jack. I had gotten home from work and one of my headphones wasn't working. This may not seem like that big of a deal, but the reason it was unnerving was because the problem persisted even after I got a new pair. I restarted my phone, blew into my audio jack, cleansed it out with alcohol and a cotton swab, and waited for it to dry out. It worked after it dried out, but that's not the first time that my audio jack had had problems. It had a problem where the headphones wouldn't \"lock\" in when you pushed it in all of the way. With some reassembly of the back plate that was fixed. Other then hat, it is a very stable and we'll built product. There are some other strange software issues, but all of those can be fixed by installing an alternate software such as cyanogenmod.Other than that, this is the best phone I've ever owned.

You won't even use the buttons, and when you do, it's actually a lot more natural to have them on the back of the phone.

The camera is good and the zoom feature is wonderful. Some people say that the sound quality is average for the phone but I think it is very clear and sharp.

I'm on a family plan, so I stuck it out, and held off upgrading out of consideration to the Sprint Spark announcement. I saw the G2 on black friday for free and upgraded because I thought it might just be an old phone causing my terrible service, boy was I wrong.The actual phone on the other hand, is flawless. The battery is massive, I can play the Drastic emulator for 7 straight hours on 70% screen brightness and still have 20% battery life left. The double tap screen feature completely eliminated the power button for me, and is far more convenient in my opinion, I just tap the screen and it's on. It runs games and dozens of bloatware with no lag at all, I even rooted it and uninstalled most of said bloatware. It features a massive 2 gigs of RAM, and when you add in the amazing processor nothing stops this behemoth...Except Sprint,This phone is absolutely crippled by the service, I can't make calls or get internet service over wireless frequently, and the actual calls get very staticky during random periods of  the day. On wireless on the other hand, it is still a monster. It gets wifi signals over twice as far away from an access point as my nexus 7 2013. The audio is great, the design is interesting, the camera photos are crystal clear. All in all, my biggest pet peeve is the volume buttons for music, which I fixed with a widget on the homescreen. Also, the Siri wannabe \"Genie\" is far too crippled currently, and has a good number of bugs in recognition.So overall, amazing phone, but get it from a different carrier.

The only thing that is better about the LG is the processor speed.  Everything else is annoyingly inferior.My list of complaints about the phone are as follows:1. The power and volume buttons are located on the back of the phone beneath the camera lens.  Alternatively, one can turn screen on by tapping on it twice, but it doesn't always work, and you can't tap to turn it off if you have another app open on the screen.  I miss the side button the S3 has.2. The button that returns one to the home screen is located too close to the space bar when typing on the on screen keyboard.  I can't tell you how many times I have hit it while typing a text or facebook comment.3. As with the S3, a screen swipe unlocks the screen.  However, almost every time I swipe the screen to unlock it, it turns on my camera.  I make sure not to swipe quick launch icon, but still, the camera turns on.  I know I'm doing something wrong, but it is still annoying.4. When I turn the phone sideways to rotate the screen in order to make the keyboard bigger to type on facebook, the keyboard takes up the whole screen, making it so I can't see what I'm typing.5. When I open the messaging system to text, it open to the last person I texted rather than a texting home screen where I can select a recipient quickly or begin a text to a new contact. It is just a minor annoyance but still annoying.6. When asking Voice Mate for directions, she tells you to \"turn left in 100 feet\" but doesn't give street names.Yep, I sound like a whiner.

The Reception is AWFUL. Plain and simple. Do a quick google search and you will find lots of threads and posts across the internet of \"phone nerds\" like myself sharing their experiences with this issue. I read one story of someone having 3 phones before giving up on this. I have spoken to sprint twice now and gotten different responses both times. They are even sending me an Air Rave to try and correct the problem. Well the air rave only boosts your signal at home not everywhere. So what the issue exactly is, is that under anything but full bars for service I get severe digital distortion that makes calls practically inaudible. Also, even worse with both phones now EVERY SINGLE CALL IVE RECEIVED has gone straight to voice mail due to poor reception. And this is NOT a sprint problem in my area because I upgraded from an HTC EVO 4G LTE (which wasent that \"great\" of a phone to begin with) and i never once experienced calls going straight to voice mail or extreme levels of distortion in my daily calling area in the almost two years ive had it.
