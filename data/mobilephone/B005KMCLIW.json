This particular model does truly EAT battery time like it hasn't been fed in years. It didn't help that I received the phone w/a battery that expires in 2/2014! My husband bought the same phone and his battery's expiration was 6/2017! Which explains why my phone kept shutting down and had difficulty re-booting. I'm thinking of investing in a backup charger with a second battery for those days when I'm very busy on this phone. I don't make a lot of calls, it more like my 'second' brain.I'm disabled and I need to keep more info (reminders, alarms, memos, etc.) than your average user. So Blackberry is really the only true cell phone that can handle my needs.At first I thought it was the phone that was dying, then I switched batteries with my husband's cell phone and my phone worked and his stopped! That's when I looked at the \"Expiration Date\" on the battery, only to discover the big 'expiration time' discrepancy (purchased from the same seller). So, be sure to check the date on your battery BEFORE you start switching phones. My husband had to go buy a new battery ($60) just so I could be kept informed on critical information. (I'll leave a comment on the seller's site about this issue.)Blackberry is truly a great cell phone manufacturer and I've owned several models for the last 10+ years. Having a Desktop App that sync's with Outlook is fantastic and the BACK UP capability is the major reason for getting a Blackberry..., especially if you have a lot of info and need to set multiple alarms, events, reminders, memos, tasks, etc. No other cell phone manufacturer provides this kind of backup/sync capability..., nor do they allow for multiple alarms, etc. (unless you want to pay $400 and up!).I originally gave Blackberry a \"2 Star Rating\" not just because of the items mentioned above but more importantly because I thought Blackberry was dragging their feet in supporting their full features in the \"Pre-Paid\" cellular market. All of my previous Blackberry cell phones had been through one of the top wireless carriers and Blackberry supports all it's features if you have a \"Post-Paid\" account.Since we hardly used the wireless carriers' lowest package terms, we decided to save 50% and go with the same Wireless provider's Pre-Paid department. Blackberry doesn't want to support \"Pre-Paid\" customers. In fact, they won't support your cell phone unless you are a \"Post-Paid\" wireless customer! If you need support, expect to pay hundreds of dollars and even then..., Blackberry refuses to allow their best features to work as seamlessly as they do in the \"Post-Paid\" arena. I'm a very loyal Blackberry customer and I am hoping that Blackberry will step up and be the professional company they have been in the past.Well, I figured out why ALL of this phone's functions/features won't work and I owe a HUGE APOLOGY to Blackberry. It's AT&T; that's blocking this phone from being able to use all the features! Yes. AT&T;! If you want this phone to work 100% then you have to get it thru AT&T; in a \"Post-Paid\" environment. However, we bought this unlocked phone and activated it through AT&T;'s GO PHONE \"Pre-Paid\" environment and after all this time of AT&T; telling me it was Blackberry's fault, come to find out..., AT&T; is making a CHOICE NOT TO OFFER ALL FEATURES OF BLACKBERRY CELL PHONES IN THEIR 'PRE-PAID' ACCOUNTS! Not only will they not support ALL features, but AT&T; LIED TO ME for weeks saying it was Blackberry's fault. I've been able to talk to Blackberry Suppoort extensively only to discover they OFFER ALL FEATURES!AT&T; has REFUSED to contact me to discuss this issue! I've escalated to \"management\"..., only to get their big corporate \"run-around\"!AT&T; apparently doesn't really want to support SmartPhones. I've now wasted 5 weeks and I have a fantastic phone that is only capable of half of it's features because AT&T; WON'T SUPPORT BLACKBERRY SMARTPHONES!I guess I'll just have to keep harassing AT&T; until this \"Step Up\" and be the company they say they are!UPDATE:It's been a few days now and I now seem to have a more serious problem with the phone. It's set to automatically turn off at night and turn on before I awaken. However, this past week, I've been awake before the phone turns on and I've noticed that a few times, it goes through the 'RE-BOOT' process before turning on! This is not normal..., it doesn't happen to my husband's Torch 9810. I orginally asked Amazon to take the phone back, then changed my mind as the Battery was DEFECTIVE. Now, it seems the DEFECTIVE BATTERY wasn't the only thing \"DEFECTIVE\". I'm in the midst of contacting Amazon to see how to work out a return for a DEFECTIVE phone after 30 days. Wish me luck.Bottom Line: I still like the Torch 9810 and will get a new one..., one way or another!

It was in english so I just changed the language to English! Besides that, everything about it was satisfying.

In the other hand, 9810 is a very fast phone when t works, camera is great. But I insist that with today markets having Iphone and android as competitors, BB needs a lot of thing to work with, they need to update a lot, the new Bold is having the same issues, a lot of blackberrian users are unsatisfied due to the lack of new technology on the new BB.
