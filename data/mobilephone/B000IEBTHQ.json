{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great phone for music compatibility and compliments!!!!", "Author": "aryamukherjee \"'maverick'\"", "ReviewID": "RX0WJSKZ7FM1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nokia N91 is a great phone for people who love music and are always on the go. The dialing features are great and superb quality music. You can put in a lot of songs and enjoy videos on real or flash player. The dialing features are great specially with the voice activated dialing. Texting is also nice but could have been better with a little bigger keypad. The only it lacks is a LED flash which would have served the purpose of taking good pictures in the night along with the 2 megapixel camera, even though it does take great daytime pics. Overall the weight of the phone is reasonable and looks very manly. However i do not know if ladies would like this phone becoz of its weight but lookswise it is very fascinating. Connection is great too even in areas with low signal reception. Overall i would rate this phone to be a nice looking phone with very advanced features that would certainly attract people once you slide the steel keypad cover. I have had many compliments on this phone and am happy to have it.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "the ultimate phone", "Author": "B.
