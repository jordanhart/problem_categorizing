{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly good for the money, fast enough for most all needs", "Author": "Kendrick Vargas", "ReviewID": "R1FTWKKPD5BQRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my mom, for a friend, and for a cousin. I have to say I am very impressed with this little device. Just so you know where I'm coming from, my cell phone history starts with my current Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus, Blaze 4G... and it goes on and on and on. I am a smart phone aficionado, and this little thing impresses me.The screen has great viewing angles, and looks great in general. I dare say I like the color and viewing angles better than on my Nexus 5. The blacks don't become a light grey at the extreme corner angles. Obviously, my 5\" 1080p is more of a pleasure to use than the 4.5\" 720p overall, but I had to comment on just how rich and beautiful the Moto G display is. The size means that it has a PPI of about 329. The iPhone 5's retina display, for comparison, sits at 326ppi. The vast majority of people will need no more than what this display has to offer. And, AND... it's wrapped in Gorilla Glass 3. Not that it should really matter that much, I've had Gorilla Glass scratch and seen it shatter so it isn't a super material... but some people will be glad to have it.The Quad Core 1.2Ghz Snapdragon 400 was fast enough for me. According to some benchmarks I've seen, it supposedly runs about as fast as the Nexus 4. The difference seems to be that this CPU simply sips on the battery. But, I'll get to more on that later. The GPU seemed fast enough for me on the benchmarks I'd run. Not the fastest, but by no means slow. The device doesn't have as much RAM at 1GB as higher end phones which tend to come in at 2GB. However for the average person this will not matter. Android's memory management is pretty good. While a power user might be able to occasionally catch blips associated to the lack of extra ram, the average user will never see it.For a casual user, the battery life will simply be phenomenal. My own mom, with some light-ish use on mostly 3G network access did 21% battery use over 24 hours, and 55% over 3 days before charging. That's just crazy. Simply bananas. As a disclaimer, I bought 4 phones total and ran into a bug on one of my phones (that others have reported as well on some units) where a full discharge of the battery was not able to be recharged from fully dead without some serious fiddling. I managed to get that phone charging again and decided to try and run the battery down (testing) and I ran into problems. I couldn't tax the battery. I ran benchmarks, 3D intensive simulations, etc... the thing would not give up it's battery. I'm returning the questionable phone, but given that there are bad eggs in any production batch, I'm not docking any stars. I think this phone is worth the 5 stars, regardless of the occassional bad build.Cons? There's no \"advanced\" features. There's no LTE (4G) radio on board. There's no NFC sensor for sharing links or doing financial transactions. There's no wireless charging, nor any 802.11ac support for the WiFi. However the average user might not really care about, or need, those things. LTE would've been nice, and most people have been convinced that they need 4G in their lives. However many are reporting real-life 3-4Mb/s transfer rates on their Moto G's... I get 12Mb/s on my DSL. How much speed do you really need to check the weather? I don't see how NFC didn't make the cut, but I guess at the price I can't complain. I'm not wild that the volume rocker is on the same side as the power button, but that's not a big deal.Pros? This phone feels great in the hand. It has a good weight. I never liked the ultra-light feel of the samsung flagship phones. The phone feels solid despite having a user removable back plate. Oh, and you can replace the back plate with colorful replacements, or flip covers, or what have you.For most anyone, this will be an absolutely fantastic choice. Don't be afraid, just buy it.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money", "Author": "N.

The phone feels well built, of quality materials and it handles well (can almost be use one-handed). I would have preferred the power button on top but it still better than having it on the left.Pros  - good quadcore processor handles tasks easily given the 1GB of RAM  - not much fluff on top of Android4.3 and guaranteed update to 4.4  - good looking screen with vibrant colors and great resolution/DPI  - built-in FM radio (yes, I'm old-fashioned but it was a must for me)  - camera is decent for a phone  - LED is powerful enough and makes a good spot for using as flashlight  - built in compass is fairly precise and does not jump around muchCons - no SD card (this is more of a fault to me since I like to put loads of music on my phone and thus only 4 star rating.

Perusing about amazon, I came across the Moto G and started doing some research on this puppy and liked what I read; decided to take the plunge. My immediate reaction to using this device has been extremely positive, and surpassed my expectations coming from an iPhone 5. At a $180'ish price point, the performance and the most put together Android/Google experience the Moto G delivers is unmatched.What you get with the phone:Moto G and charging cable... That's it!Design:Honestly, for a phone this cheap, this is a slick looking phone. With its concave design, matte black back plate and just about edge-to-edge glass on the face, you do not need to worry about the Moto G looking like a cheap Korean phone. This thing has style. The weight of the phone seems to be on the heavier side, which I like a lot, makes it feel well built and valuable. Comparing this Moto G to my Fiance's 4s, I have to say the Moto G looks better than the more expensive 4s. The only physical buttons on the Moto G is the lock and volume rocker, which adds to the simplicity and coolness of this phone's design. The home, back and multi-task buttons are on the screen.One design flaw that bummed me out is how you have to remove the back plate to insert your sim card. Seems like Motorola/Google could have thought of a better way to make this process easier. I ended up snapping the thin plastic on the top of the headphone jack. I'm the only one that notices it, but it's there and it's a bummer.UX/UIThe first time I have seen a perfect marriage of an Android OS implementation and Google's awesome applications. If you have ever used an Android from another vendor, the OS tends to feel like a bootleg copy of another or does not feel polished like Apple's iOS. Using the Moto G, you will notice that this looks like the way Google intended their Android OS to be implemented on a device--remember, Google purchased Motorola and their handsets are starting to show the benefits of this acquisition. No weird bloatware is forced upon you, you basically get all of the Google apps, Motorola Migrate and that's about it. The Moto G is a lean machine out of the box, which is something I was thankful for when I first started it up.Also, the OS does a good job of guiding you on how to use the Google-centric apps instead of the on-board messaging/email apps with your google account, which each application is intuitive and runs flawlessly so far. Login to your Google account on startup and your whole Google-cloud-You is automatically loaded into your new Moto G almost instantly. Overall the interface and experience the Moto G delivers, running Android Jelly Bean, feels cohesive and intuitive. After using iPhones for so long, you tend to hear about \"fragmentation,\" \"walled gardens\" in the Android universe, but the experience this Motorola delivers offers a glimpse into some pretty cool things to come for the Android OS--with Motorola handsets.Performance:I will warn you that I am not a mobile gamer. I use my phone to get things done and keep my life in order but would consider myself a power user, but have no need or want to play games on my phone--personally, I need tactile feedback to play video games... Anyways, this thing zips. After playing with crappy Android based tablets and witnessing some of the performance issues friends and relatives have with their Android phones, I was expecting some hiccups here and there at this price point. Motorola HAD to pinch pennies somewhere on this phone, right?! Well, they did compromise dollars here and there on this offering, but not so much in the hardware. This thing is a speedy little handset that will be more than adequate for the average user and I think if you are a power user that needs your phone to be productive, the Moto G should be able to handle everything you throw at it.Not only does the quad-core processor and 1gb of RAM in this little beast zip, but it is a true battery sipper. Battery saver mode shuts down background functions you don't absolutely need to get every drip of battery juice. The efficiency of this phone is amazing, don't even need to charge it through the day even when using mostly cellular data.Speaking of cellular data, one thing you should know about the Moto G is that one of the cost-saving features that Motorola implemented is that this phone is 3G only. This is not a huge deal to me as in my area 3G is fast enough. I also do not watch Netflix on my phone or anything, I have a Roku for that. Honestly, it's a small compromise for a phone this nice at this price point, I don't think it's a big deal. Your mileage will vary, so it is something to take into consideration.Display/CameraThe display on the Moto G is sharp. No obvious aliasing or pixelation, everything looks crisp and clean... Except for the default background, get rid of that as soon as you get your Moto G.The camera is probably the biggest compromise made to the Moto G that I recognize and am kind \"meh.\" about. It will shoot 720p video, which is completely fine; shoots panorama images (cool); frigin burst mode (pretty cool); and that's about it. The still camera quality is nothing compared to what you will find on the iPhone 5 and up or other more expensive handsets on the market. BUT THAT'S OK! You're taking photos with your phone and posting them on instagram or Facebook or whatever, not shooting editorial photography for [insert any nationally recognized magazine name here].Overall:If you're looking for an unlocked phone or tired of the BS bloatware that comes with Android Handsets from other vendors, BUY THIS PHONE. This thing is a gem and the compromises that Motorola made to get the Moto G to this price point were all spot-on, correct decisions that consumers can really appreciate.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Moto G US GSM 16G", "Author": "H. L. Zanitsch \"LeelooMinai\"", "ReviewID": "R2LJ8ZNFDTQPZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone as a replacement to the Samsung Galaxy S3 I had that died a horrible death; details not needed...!  I wasn't willing to put out the $400 for a replacement Galaxy, even though I loved it.Compared to the GS3, for the price, this phone is a stunning replacement!  It's a little heavier, sure, but I'm perfectly fine with that.  I have experienced no problems with it whatsoever, having had it in hand since the Dec. 18th.  Everything seems to run smoothly, with no hiccups through T-Mobile's service.  I have dropped down from 4G speed to 3G, but this is entirely so minor as not to be a complaint whatsoever.  I do not experience lags over the network at home which is where use is heaviest.Phone calls are clear.  If you toggle the volume up, prepare for a loud ringer...There is a tiny gap between \"soft\" and \"loud\" on this phone.  This is also good for me, however, and the alarm apps I have, as I can sleep through most alarms and phone calls.  I do not have any problems with loose buttons on my model, either, which I had prepared for.The back of the phone is less irritating to deal with than the Galaxy's - it's not thin and I don't feel as if it will break when I remove the back of the phone.  Once you get the hang of removing the back, which you honestly shouldn't have to do often, it's not that agonizing of an experience, plus the phone comes with instructions on how to remove the back if you are fearful of breaking it.Cameras are important to me in a phone.  With static images I have not noticed any drop in performance over the Galaxy.  However, with some movement quality drops, but I am still learning how to use it and generally have an easy time mastering camera phones despite their limitations.  I haven't played with it as much as I intend to yet, so I can't really comment on how well the camera will treat me when I've learned it.The screen is clear, bright, and stunning, and I have no complaints there either.  It may be smaller than the Galaxy's, but again, as someone who uses the phone primarily for social media and to communicate for other projects when I am out and about, as well as keep schedules and tasks in order it does not bother me whatsoever to lose .5cm of the screen.The device does everything I ask it to do without hitch, therefore I granted it a 5-star rating.  For the price, it's a great device and I do not see much loss between it versus the SG3, of which mine was always a factory set and not a rooted device.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Righly puts every single cheap Android phone to shame", "Author": "NameLess", "ReviewID": "R364MIPO49BL40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered a Global GSM version which has been optimized for global roaming 3G.

The phone is great for the price. The best phone you can get at this price point (off contract) bar none. I did not experience any issues setting up the phone and using it. I purchased this primarily as a world phone for when I travel overseas. It is perfect for that purpose. Great display, sharp and bright. The processor keeps the phone zipping along quite nicely, I haven't noticed any lag yet. Call quality is very good and WiFi connectivity is also very good. Keep in mind that mine only came with a USB cable for charging and no AC USB power adapter. This was no issue for me since I have plenty from old phones. It is a standard micro USB connector. The picture quality is fair to good but what do you expect for a phone at this price. My only gripe is that the back cover is a bit finicky to remove. Make sure you hold the middle while prying up the BOTTOM of the cover first. If you try to open it from the top (like I did), you will most likely crack the back cover along the tiny strip of plastic around the hole for the headphone jack. I feel like they should have had the back cover go around the headphone jack without the thin strip (so it fits like a U around the jack instead of like an O like it does now).

When I had my Nexus, I got three to four hours of heavy use. In comparison, I get six or seven hours of heavy use with Moto G. I understand that the battery is non user-replaceable. However, I read that the cost of replacing the battery from the OEM was relatively low.The call quality's good, but user ease could be improved. When I was fiddling with my address book, I accidentally ended up calling that person. Placing the voice buttons next to the lock button caused me to lock the device when I just wanted to increase the volume.I didn't see a difference between Moto G's screen and my iPad screen. To be fair, I don't have super great eyesight. There's nothing wrong with the color gradient. For some people, the color spectrum might be considered too dark.The device aesthetic's bland. That's what cases and removable backs are for. I thought the plastic back was more practical than Nexus's glass back. I don't fear the device shattering if it ever fell. I wouldn't consider build quality to be especially good. I could see the parts loosening after a year. However, the device is cut cleanly. I didn't feel like the plastic jutted out. I felt that aesthetically I was getting what I paid for and more.I had occasions where the device wouldn't run websites. That amounted to five percent of the time. I had no problems running games like Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja. These games are hardly graphic-intensive, though. I streamed digital movies without the application crashing.The camera is nothing to write home about but it's perfectly serviceable - more so if you run it through filters. While Moto G's software isn't stock Android, i didn't feel like there was bloat. I thought Motorola''s own apps attempted to make the smartphone experience less intimidating to first time buyers.I got my phone around the same time the 4.4 update first occurred. I think Motorola was doing staggered updates because it took a day or two after articles talked about Moto G getting the update for my Moto G to get the update.Overall, I was happy with the device.

If you're on a budget, and don't do a lot of web browsing or video streaming, this is the phone for you.  Or if your phone provider's 3G network is fast enough, it's worth a look even if you do use the Internet on your phone a lot.Other minor drawbacks: no NFC, and no 5 GHz WiFi.Note: It comes with a USB cable but no power adapter.  This helps keep the cost down, reduce waste, and makes the box light and cute.  You can probably use the one you already have from your old phone.  But if you don't have one lying around, you'll need to purchase one separately.Also note: the micro SIM goes straight into the phone without a SIM tray.  If you're switching from one of the few phones that uses a nano SIM, such as the iPhone 5s or the Moto X, be careful using a SIM adapter.

Head", "ReviewID": "RRFKDTPQWAWAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About 6 months ago my spouse smashed the screen to her Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. She still had another year to upgrade and needed a new phone. I searched high and low for a used phone or another off contract phone. I was having little to no luck. most were either too expensive for what she wanted or so lousy it would be a huge step down in terms of quality an dependability. She had decided to just just get a used phone and take the leap that it wouldn't be in bad shape...that is until the moto G was announced. I was very excited to see it release but disappointed to see it would only be outside of the US at first. Fast froward a few weeks and it was released stateside. Here were a few of the quick selling points for her ( a non smartphone  aficionado). This was a X-mas purchase so these are all her points after she had the device:- HD screen - 720P and great viewing angles for a device at this price point. It's not mind-blowing but at 4.5 inches its a impressive pixel density and very well done. As a side note you might want to up text size as at this pixel density text mighth be smaller than you might be used to coming from a non HD device.- The size, shape and feel of it - It's about a midrange size. Not very thin but not too thick either, it has a good feel in your hand of some heft and feeling well put together. The buttons feel good and the back is a rubberized material that feels good in the hand.- Vanilla android - She came from the Samsung Touchwiz overlay on top of android and swore she would never like plain android. The plain android really surprised her with its simple elegant design and lack of ugly over the top icons or colors or just plain clunkiness.- The Android 4.4.2 update - Basically just turn your phone on you bought from Amazon and the the newest update is all ready to download. Simply do like you would an iOS update and let it update over wifi or mobile if you desire. 4.4 is a vast improvement over 4.3 in terms of smooth functioning and new features- Simple camera interface - You can tap the screen, focus and take a picture and the options are small. Many will like this. if not download one of many different apps.- It's very snappy - Her words. Basically if she wants to do her usual social networking, reading news, or playing a game...its fast and doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. apps open and close in a snap.Here are a few things you should know:1. You just have to update to 4.4.2...its simple, clean, fast, and has many new added features2. There is no NFC for you people out there who want it for paypass, but that's a small sample size. To make up for that and to share pics and videos, just use superbeam from the playstore. It works perfectly.3. You can easily migrate your stuff from your old phone by using the Motorola migrate app. It's fast, easy, and complete. (except music but I prefer to do it separately anyway.4. The camera is very middle of the road but is easy to use and more than great for pictures posted to social networking.5. FM radio is on here and works great. A feature most carrier phones disable.6. There is no LTE but H+ is still more than adequate for what  95% of people need.7. Don't use chrome browser as an indication of the speed of the phone. Firefox and Dolphin are much better and don't lag like Chrome is notorious for.8. There is no external SD card option but you can use a an OTG USB adapter to load content.9. Tethering options are all enabled.10.

So far it's working very well on the AT&T; side of Straight Talk except I cannot receive images via text messaging. This should be easily fixed by changing the APN settings.

I have used a T mobile prepaid phone for years (happily -- I hate spending money for tech I won't really use) but had dropped the phone several times and the camera finally gave out.  I decided to get an unlocked phone that I could use on T mobile's special $30/month prepaid plan, so my research led me to the unlicked Moto G.I've had the phone for a few days, and am delighted so far.  Since I've never owned a smartphone (though have played with others' phones over the years) it seems quite serviceable for what I need.  I was especially interested in getting better photos, and though I realize this camera is consider \"average\" by most users and reviewers, it is definitely much better than my previous phone's camera.  Quick moving subjects do blur, unfortunately, but the lighting is fine for the shots I take (my phone has the Google Play camera and Android Kit Kat update).  (If you are a serious photographer you will probably want a different phone.)The speed of the phone on both Tmobile and my Freedompop router (wifi) is satisfactory for my needs.  Messaging, surfing, and gaming at my level of usage are all excellent.The phone itself has a beautiful, bright screen, and handles well.  I'm purchasing a protective case for it since, as you can see, I don't buy a phone every time new models come out.For someone who is budget conscious and who wants a great phone at an affordable price, I think this is a fantastic choice.

I've done factory resets several times and according to other users on forums this problem been known by Motorola since January and it is May now. Still there hasn't been any patch or known solutions. According to forums, Motorola tech support wants you to send back the phone so they can downgrade the Android version to 4.3 but then you will keep on being notified to upgrade to KitKat every single day through push Notification. If you have time for this crap then you can go ahead and play tag with Motorola but for $200, I've got better things to do. Clearly, it's going to be an expensive paper weight that allow my kid to play some games on it in when her tablet is charging. I am quite disappointed with Motorola and their ability to solve issues with their products in the reasonable amount of time. What I don't understand is that, why they feel the need to push a new O.S that is not entirely necessary and ruined a perfectly fine hardware capable of many great things at a reasonable price. Whether if it is Motorola problem of KitKat itself is yet to be known and even Motorola tech support stop commenting on forums all over the internet tells me that they have no idea how to fix it. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless there is a known fixed or patch for this issue, which is highly unlikely given the fact that it's been over 5 months they've known about this issue.

I have used many cell phones with the same prepaid service and none can measure up to it. Calls are crystal clear, and loud enough for people who are slightly hard of hearing (like me) to hear. Absolutely no static or noise on calls. After 4 months of use, I still stand by my original post.By far the best deal you can get for a phone that's not part of a 2-year contract! The price is amazing and the phone, well what can I say? You would think that it would feel cheap or something. It's got Android 4.3 Jelly Bean when you purchase it. As soon as you turn it on, it updates to Android 4.4 KitKat. It has the stock Android OS and none of the extra garbage that comes with a carrier phone. The speed is super FAST! No sluggishness, no crashing due to lack of memory.  The battery is nonremovable. Not sure what I'd do if the phone got \"stuck\" on something, but that hasn't happened yet. I recommend getting the 16GB version for $20 more because there is no SD card slot. Out of the 16GB, you get about 12GB that's usable. It has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and it can be turned into a mobile hotspot. The camera isn't that bad. It is a 5 megapixel and this is a phone after all.

If I do typical surfing, checking email, etc. it will last about 3 days. I can't find any negatives with this phone. I use it with a prepaid plan. Oh, make sure you have a MICRO SIM card. I didn't realize until after I purchased that I had the wrong size sim card.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "No LTE, but an otherwise great phone for cheap!", "Author": "Etienne", "ReviewID": "RGB3PLJZTZ3QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my college age daughter to replace a seriously old Samsung Android phone (like v.2.3!).  While she wanted an iPhone, I do not have one for myself, nor am I rich enough to afford four of them for the whole family.  I was resigned to having to purchase another pricey phone with T-Mobile (which, while the coverage is not the best, offers the best family rates going, especially after their latest separation of phones and plans), or a bargain model that I would hear complaints about.  When I read about the Moto G being released and its phenomenally low price, I assumed it would be a dual or single core processor model, with a mediocre screen.  When I read the specs on it, I could not believe Motorola (Google) could offer such a phone for the price.  Either they are losing money or just breaking even (of course, Google's core business is advertising, so they probably are planning on the long term value).  Regardless, the phone is awesome.  Hopefully this will be the future of \"low end\" phones.The screen is large, but not monstrous, ideal for my daughter that definitely did not want a big display phone, but something small and easily handled.  The resolution is ideal and not an overkill 1080p display that taxes the GPU and battery.  The quad core processor gives the phone plenty of pep, although I cannot comment on game play (I don't understand playing games on a phone, given the small display, but that is a personal choice).  The battery is embedded in the device and there is no additional memory card slot for expansion (a Google device habit), so if you plan on having a lot of media and apps, I suggest the 16Gb version (8Gb is fine for her use and I'm cheap!).  If you want to load all your music on it, you better look elsewhere.  I am not sure of how long the battery lasts, but I have not heard a complaint about it yet. The camera seems OK, although I did not play with it that much, and really don't see the need for high resolution camera phones, give the limited sensor area available (get a digital point and shoot, or better yet, a nice used film camera -- I am a diehard fan of film in all its sizes, from 35mm to 4x5!).When first booted up, the phone was ready for Android 4.4, which I suggest using wifi to perform, unless you have unlimited data, speed, and/or patience as it is a big file (this was before adding the sim card, so I did not have it on T-Mobile's network at the time).  A quick restart and the phone was ready to go, using the standard Google logon.  Android on this phone is gloriously free of bloatware (like Samsung and HTC insist on stuffing on their phones), other than probably two apps.  The included Motorola app for transferring settings and files worked perfectly, taking a few minutes to do its thing (you install it on your old phone and connect to the same wifi, following the prompts).  I had to get a micro sim card from T-Mobile, but that was free via mail order (note that it will take prepaid and postpaid sims, defaulting to your plan -- it is just a \"dumb\" sim), or from what I later read, possibly free in retail locations.  I learned about the universal sim card by mistakenly ordering the prepaid for our postpaid plan.  Setting it up was easy on T-Mobile's website, with the phone was switched over within minutes of finalizing online.The only minor negative, is that the phone does not support LTE, but is otherwise 3G, and fast enough in our area. But I knew this when ordering. There have been no complaints about the call quality, either.My daughter seems fine with the phone, including no complaints about performance.  This is a kid that has no trouble of literally letting me know if things \"suck,\" so I consider it an awesome \"bargain\" phone not locked to a carrier.Had this phone been available when I purchased the HTC One, I would have purchased it for myself.  I like the HTC, especially its slightly bigger screen for my slowly decaying eyesight, but the bloatware and cost are not worth it.  I highly recommend the Moto G and look forward to replacing the HTC One with whatever iteration is available when needed.I added the following screen protector to the phone, Archshield - Moto G Premium High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector 3-Pack (no longer available on Amazon, thus no link), but suggest another brand, as my installation was troublesome.  If Spigen comes out with screen protectors I recommend them, finding them to be the best available (and the company is quick to reply to inquiries).  The following protective case is recommended, as long as you know the color of the pink version did not quite match that displayed online TUDIA Ultra Slim Melody TPU Bumper Protective Case for Motorola Moto G SmartPhone (Pink).One other thing of note forgotten in the initial review:  Before purchase, I read of issues with the back, removable portion of the phone being easily damaged during removal to access the micro sim slot.  Knowing this I was careful to follow the instructions and treat the back gently.  You can see how easy it would be to damage it by bending it a little too far.

The camera is a medium-quality sensor with only 5 megapixels.  The processor is pretty good, but I hear some sound crackles now and then when playing X-Plane (high quality flight simulator which ran fine on a Nexus S) and some minor hesitation when scrolling on large websites.  Little stuff, but evidence of it being a mid-range phone in some ways.However, this should be a mass market success because of the stuff that is good:1. Plenty of memory to leave a browser with multiple tabs open, switch among email, Twitter app, and maybe check the Play market for some app you just read about, and then back to the browser instantly without it having been closed to save memory.  Smooth uninterrupted use of multiple common phone functions.2. A display which is as high-resolution as you can reasonably want it to be (given limits of human vision) for a phone which is as big as it can be and still be comfortable in any pocket and, though not as wide-angle viewable as high-end phones, mostly looks fine (better than my Nexus S for sure) and is bright enough for outdoor daylight use when necessary.3. A processor which works fine for most games, even if the most intensive 3d stuff has small signs of the hardware limitation.4. A battery which actually lasts all day with a fair reserve chunk left over.  This is a big one, because no amount of pixels and megahertz and RAM will impress your friends if your battery is dead.  Even a lot of high-priced phones have batteries which just barely make it to happy hour as they die.  Typical mid-range phones have usually had 1500mAh batteries or less.  This one is 2000mAh, so your can actually do the things described above all day, and when you get home you've still got about a third of the battery left or more compared to your previous phone.  Motorola seems to have made this phone fairly efficient as well.  A lot of the cheap phones from Chinese manufacturers (sometimes re-branded for your cell carrier) get shorter battery life than major brands with the same size battery.  So It's got a big battery and isn't wasteful with it.So it does everything most people want to do, does most of that fairly well, does it all day, and doesn't cost too much.

From my own small test, the fluency of playing Real Racing 3 is even a little bit faster than iPhone 5, almost the same as my friend's 5s. This really shocked me!!! However, the camera is the weakness of Moto G, the quality of photos is not good due to the 5 MP cam, and the video quality is also bad.

Currently owning a Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Moto X I can say that the Moto G is a mighty fine phone.It doesn't have a hi end camera, it doesn't have NFC or wireless charging. But if you want those you can buy a much higher priced phone? Or pay another two hundred and get a Nexus 5. What the Moto G does give is a good solidly built phone with a good screen. I do wish it came in a 32 gig model, but 16 will do fine for now.Treat your self to one of the flip covers. Yah, they are a bit pricey buy they protect your investments screen and when you close the cover it shuts the phones screen off. Open it and the screen comes back up.For 200.00 I hate using it for work. Not the price mind you but that it is such a nice phone.People who say this is a bad phone while comparing it to the SGS4 or Nexus 5 are missing the point of a comparative review. The Moto G should be compared to other 200.00 dollar phones of comparable specs and relative value.Honestly, I wrote Motorola off more than ten years ago because they had gained a reputation for building CRAP. Even then the last two Motorola's I owned were nightmare's. With Googles purchase of Motorola I decided to give the Moto X a try and was totally blown away by how well it performed in every way. How well built it was and that some one put some thought in to it, rather than just slapping a bunch of hardware in to a phone body and calling it a phone.Needing a new phone for work I decided to give the Moto G a try having been more than happy with the MX. Happily I am not disappointed one bit.Googles presence at Motorola has put Motorola back on the track of excellence. I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone over other phones costing hundreds more. If you need wireless charging, NFC, and a boat of bells and whistles the Nexus 5 or Samsung Galaxy S 4 may be your better options. But if you just need a great phone at a unbelievably low price. Grab the G, You won't be sorry.And as always.

It's no Nokia Lumia 520, but it does better than the Samsung S4, which at least has replaceable batteries to make up for it.-Removable back cover = no need for a cover for the cover. If it gets scratched up, I can just get another one.-Reasonable 3G speed for the price: 6.1 Mbps download and 3.4 Mbps upload where I live.Cons:-Calls had a lot of static when using hands-free devices so I had to clear the partition using some overly complicated procedure (that's tech support's solution for everything by the way). Not sure if it's any better. FYI, I have AT&T.; Maybe there IS a difference between US and Global even for AT&T; despite what Motorola and so-called experts say. And don't tell me I shouldn't expect much from a $200 phone. My ~$60 Nokia Lumia 520 has great call quality.-Motorola's customer service is awful - wait time can go 30+ minutes and then you get hung up on while waiting for a level 2. This has happened multiple times. The online chat support is worse. They know nothing at all. The funny thing is, I never had to call tech support before I got this phone. My Wi-Fi kept forgetting the password so I had to re-enter it. Level 2's tech supporter said I had to do a factory reset. I ignored that advice. I ended up figuring out that it was my 2x Battery app. I needed to disable Manage WiFi connection.-So much wasted space around the screen. They could've put a gigantic home key and maybe even another phone on the bottom and still have room to spare, but it's not really something I mind given the price.-Very heavy and thick relative to other smartphones of this size, but it's not really something I mind given the price.-No external buttons are usable for the camera. The ~$60 Nokia Lumia 520 even has a dedicated button just for the camera - half-click for focus as well.-I can't use the FM Radio, something I was really excited about. You'd think a clear signal on my car and 10-year-old alarm clock would mean a reasonable signal on my phone, right? Nope. This is for all you suburbanites. I'll have to stick to the NPR app.-Motorola Migrate only works if your previous phone's screen works so you can take a pic of a digital barcode. Mine does not work so this lone option is lame.Some notes that aren't necessarily cons - just advice:-Need to download a notification bar (pull-down) for things such as quick lock orientation. I use Notification Toggle. Good app.-Need to download Screen Filter. The dimmest setting is waaaayyy too bright for bedtime use. The same went for my Samsung S4.-Need to download a visual voicemail app.-Need to download a battery meter because there's no percentage option. I use 2x Battery, but make sure you uncheck Manage WiFi connection. It causes your Wi-Fi to forget your password constantly!Bottom-line: Get this phone if you're a budget-conscious user. Support the off-contract, high-quality, low-cost movement! Scratch that...revolution! ;-) I'd recommend the US version if you live in the US though unless you're getting it as a backup only and would like to travel with it. If you're an ultra-budget conscious user and don't mind losing lock orientation, Google's traffic-based navigation (or anything Google), many apps you're used to on an Android or iPhone, screen filter for ultra-dim use, and a high-quality 4.5\" screen, get the Nokia Lumia 520 for ~$60 at the Nokia or Windows websites. It has free navigation with no data required, but it's not traffic-based. I still really like it overall. If you don't have a budget, get the Samsung Galaxy S4. It's got replaceable batteries and a 5\" screen, something I really miss. I hate external backup batteries (so bulky and costly). The Nexus 5 at $400 after taxes and shipping is probably too much for a phone without replaceable batteries or a Micro SD slot.UPDATE: I just got Kit-Kat today (12/24).

Coming from that, this phone is noticeably and, in fact, significantly quicker, both to boot and with execution of apps and the like. I want to put an emphasis on the boot time; it took what seemed like an eternity (2-3 minutes in reality) to boot my Droid Razr. In comparison, I've clocked the Moto G at a boot time of 35 seconds!My Razr also came with Verizon's plethora of crapware and their even crappier contract shackled to it. By contrast, the Moto G is an unlocked Google experience phone that, compared to that of a contract phone, has a very minimal, yet functional and convenient assortment of preinstalled apps. One of those apps, however, that I found to be much better on the Razr was Moto Assist, formerly known as Moto Smart Actions. Moto Assist is basically a dismembered version of Smart Actions with drastically less functionality. I found it useless in its present form and I ended up disabling it. The Moto G also came pre-installed with Google Now, which I have found very useful for speaking Google search queries, setting alarms, To-Dos and other day-to-day tasks, like checking the weather- this, for me, is much faster than using the screen for such functions.Battery life on the Moto G is like night and day compared to my Razr. With regular use, I can go the whole day and a good part of the night without charging. Minimal use, I could probably squeeze a couple days out of it. Above average use, I'd guess, would yield most of the day. It's definitely worth noting and looking into some of the very helpful apps out there for battery management that can really boost the battery mileage on Android phones. If you want a really thin phone, the Moto G may not be your ideal model. I'd estimate it's about 150% the density of the ultra-thin Razr, but personally, that does not bother me, even with a bumper case.The rear-facing camera leaves some things to be desired on this phone. The auto focus is not all that great and it does not take very good pictures in darker environments. The Razr was much better in this area. However, I have heard that Google has or is going to release a different camera app to improve this... We'll see.The one big issue I've had so far is one that, fortunately, thanks to Amazon's outstanding exchange policy, I am now in the process of correcting. That is the size of the internal storage. I didn't use much of the Razr's storage (I think it was 16 internal, 8 external), so I thought I could get by with the minimum. A lot of people probably could, but I store a fair amount of music on my phone, so in addition to the apps, my internal storage was almost completely eaten up only two weeks in. I encourage anyone buying a new phone to consider this carefully, as many retailers are not as forgiving as Amazon.Something else to consider with the Moto G is the cell radio: It only support 3G and 2G. No 4G on this phone. Additionally, you have to choose between the U.S. version, which is compatible with 3G coverage from AT&T; and T-Mobile in the U.S, but fairly limited in carrier compatibility overseas; if you tend to travel overseas, like me, the global version may be a better pick for you, as it support many more GSM carriers in Europe and other areas, however, it supports 3G coverage only from AT&T; carriers and is limited to 2G on T-Mobile carriers in most of the United States. T-Mobile is working on expanding their 3G coverage on the frequency this phone supports. Personally, I've always been quite happy with 3G speeds, and I was able to find a decent AT&T-based; MVNO, so the global edition has suited me fine, so far. If you're not sure, please do your research before committing to one or the other.The best part of the Moto G, of course, is the excellent midpoint it achieves between price and quality. Motorola really seems to be taking the bull by the horns with their budget and mid-tier phone initiatives.Overall, I am very happy with the Moto G. It lacks some of the bells and whistles of its higher end siblings, but if you're looking for a great entry to mid-level smart phone that is fairly fast, with good battery life and, best of all, a presently unbeatable price for its features, I can definitely recommend the Moto G. 4/5 stars.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Finally a decent resonably priced unlocked smart phone", "Author": "Christopher J.

Very sturdy phone with a long lasting battery.  I have a Nexus 7 so I am right at home with the OS.  Will keep review short and say I agree with Pros of other reviews. 3 Cons, minor but annoying.  1. My dumb Tracfones have the option to remind you with a subtle vibration that you have a message waiting.  There was no option for this by default but I fixed with Missed Message Flasher app.  The second is that most, if not all the time when I unplug phone jack from headphones or car stereo plug it doesn't pause like my ipods (going all the way back to my 2nd generation touch) do.  I will be listening to podcast going to work and unplug when I get there, and when I get in the office hear the podcast continuing at low volume in my pocket.  3. Agree with others that buttons on the bottom would be better if they were physical buttons rather than on the screen.  There is room for them and it would increase screen size for most situations (unless watching video, when they disappear).

Miller", "ReviewID": "R37O7ZXYQ55NOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this direct from Motorola because Amazon was out of stock.  My Galaxy S3 died VERY suddenly and without warning and I needed a replacement.  Work supplied me with the S4, but I had read about the Moto G and decided to grab that as well for comparison (along with a Chromecast).The screen compares very well with my S3.  I find the S4 to be a bit too big now (closer to the Note particularly when I put any protector/shell around it).  The entire experience of activating the phone was extremely smooth.  I had it hooked up to my home network and synchronized with my Google services very fast.  Subsequent install of key apps on the phone was fast and easy.  I would buy this again.PROS:  Responsive - NO problems with the screens being laggy or sluggish.  Clean - The interface is uncluttered and the phone doesn't have tons of junk applications installed for me.  The Galaxy 3 and 4 both have stuff from Samsung and AT&T; which constantly carp at me for some value-added services or another.  Lock Screen - I configured mine to display text messages on one swipe and the camera on the other.  This saves me a lot of logging in to just see a quick message.  The configuration took seconds.  Memory/Storage - The 16GB feels generous at the moment.  With my music and pics in place, I should still be fine.  Price - REALLY impressed by the value.  I bought an S3 Mini and S4 Mini a few months ago for my wife and daughter's replacement phones, and I think this is clearly a better value than those were.  Shape - I'm a tall man and the phone (without any shell) is not too small in my hands and the shape is comfortable.CONS:  Memory/Storage - Lack of an SD slot means that if'/when this dies, my chances of getting anything off it are low.  Use a data backup service for the device.  Screen Wrapping - Lack of screen wrapping.  When I pan to the different screens, I don't get a wrap around to the others.  This seems trivial, but it's something I've gotten used to doing for several generations of other phones and it is missing here.  4G - I put my AT&T; SIMM into the phone and get 3G services (I get 4G with the S4, but that is an AT&T; phone).  This isn't really Motorola's fault, but I would prefer to get the fastest connections possible.

For years I had an economical little flip phone. I could make & receive calls and do the same with texts. I had a simple plan through (no contract) Consumer Cellular for myself & my son for $57 a month for both phones. That was sweet, but I got the bug for more and something that wasn't clam shelled. I wanted a good camera; help with directions; be able to search for products when not at home; be able to send faster texts (you can speak to the phone instead of type) and a phone that would work in my 2013 car that wouldn't require me to turn off the car & phone in order to disconnect.

I had a plan with very little data (250MB) and international texts and calls generally cost way too much.So I wanted to see what life was like outside AT&T;'s walls.  I bought this phone and I am paying $39/month with Ultra.me. I'll discuss this carrier at the end of the review.Thus far it's been about 10 days and I am loving it.  My only slight regret is that a week after I bought this phone Motorola dropped the price on the big bro of this phone, the Moto X, and you can now buy it for $329 on their website.  I hope this comment doesn't get deleted, because Amazon sells the X for quite a bit more.If you're interested in the Moto X, the essential differences are these: (1) X is a bit more powerful; (2) X has 4G while G only 3G; (3) X has a 10Mpixel camera to the G's 5MP; (4) The X can pick up both the 1700 and the 1900 band, so you don't have to decide between the \"US\" version and the \"Global\" version of the phone.  If you trawl the reviews, as I did, the biggest beef with the G is with its camera.So, here's my take on the G.  It's so fast compared with my old phone -- I guess that's to be expected since my phone was 3 years old or so.  3G doesn't seem to be an issue, because the chip (I guess) is so fast.  Webpages load plenty fast.  I'm not a mega streamer of data -- I'm not watching netflix on 3g -- but on wifi, the screen definition looks fan-freaking-tastic.Compared with the iOS, I'm liking Android.  A lot.  I have always been an Apple guy, and love my Powerbook.  But I'm intrigued by Android.  The apps seem to work flawlessly.  When I got the phone, it immediately updated to Android Kitkat, and everything works fine.  I use Google Drive -- bonus, getting the Moto G got me 2 years of 50GB on Google Drive.  I may actually dump Dropbox for GD, although I kind of prefer the Dropbox UI.  I really like Google Gesture -- much easier to type than Apple's iOS hunt and peck.Essentially it all just works well.  Yes, the camera could be better, but hey -- it's $200.I went with the carrier Ultra.me for a variety of reasons.  One was that they have an international flavor, and I am often texting and phoning the UK.  For $39, I get 1000 international texts and 1000 minutes calling to the UK.  Both of those were quite a lot extra with AT&T.;  I also get unlimited domestic calling and texts.  And 500MB 4G (in this case 3G) data, and then it's throttled down a lot (128kbps -- super slow).  As I said earlier, I'm not massively bothered about the data limits since I just don't use that much bandwidth.  Or at least I can be frugal and use wifi.  If I want to move up a tier, for $49 you get the same deal but 2GB of data instead of 500MB.  Ultra.me uses the T-mobile network, which was my one frustration, because I wanted to buy the \"Global\" version of the Moto G.  Unfortunately, the Global version doesn't include the 1700AWS band which T-Mobile still uses in various places for 3G.  There are various accounts online of T-m moving to 1900 (which IS on the global phone) but I just couldn't count on such anecdotal accounts (there are some in these Amazon reviews) and so decided to go for the \"sure thing\" of the US version.  I have mixed feelings about this since I sometimes travel to Western Europe and envisaged using the phone with a European SIM card -- and most European countries use 2100 for 3/4G data. But oh well.

In terms of other phones that I was looking at, I was making note of the Nexus 4 (or 5). However, when I read about the Moto G, I knew this was the one for my mom.Amazon upgraded the shipping from two days to one day (thank you for that!) and I received it last Sunday. Packaging is minimal, but there's nothing wrong with that. The phone itself is built very well. Solid, feels great in my hand. Screen is gorgeous, almost edge to edge. But I won't ramble on and on about the features because I'm sure that you've done your homework by reading the other reviews and checked out the tech blogs.I bought this phone because this is how Android is supposed to be. Google owns Motorola, so there's no obtrusive manufacturer skin covering Google's OS. No carrier apps slowing down the quad core processor. Look, I know it's not the most powerful phone. It's not going to be the best or win any benchmark tests. However, I'm looking at the overall experience for the phone because my mom doesn't care about the specs. She just wants the phone to work when she needs it to. And that's where it delivers. Everything just works (well!), and I wouldn't choose another phone for her. Phone calls? Check. Facebook? Check. Camera? Check. Buttery smooth operating system? Check.Get the 16 gig version because 8 gigs won't last you for anything. The 50gb Google Drive storage is a nice touch.Also, I had to dig around for this information, but if you want to use T-Mobile on this phone, get the US GSM version. There's no legitimate 4g radio in the Moto G, but faux g (HSPA+) on T-Mobile works great. Just ran a speedtest and got 10 mb upload and 3.5 download speeds.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth It", "Author": "LIANG HUI", "ReviewID": "R2E6KOXGO89DE3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The hardware and pure android worth its price @199, but two disadvantages for you guys to know before you buy: One is the volume is too small to hear at noisy environment.

Watch out for idiot staff at phone stores", "Author": "Timothy Miller", "ReviewID": "R2FUTAY8NKL9ZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review as a public service for people who want to take advantage of \"bring your own phone\" deals recently offered by some mobile phone carriers, such as MetroPCS and T-Mobile. I bought this phone because \"bring your own phone\" programs, appeal to me. I like the idea of owning my own device, and I don't like multi-year mobile phone service contracts.One often hears, \"My iPhone only cost me $4.99.\" Not! When you sign a two or three year contract, the mobile phone carrier is financing the cost of the device for you, and making a big profit on the interest. That's a deal for suckers.A huge problem with expensive phones -- If you lose and break them and you still have a long contract, you have to buy another one at full retail price. With some phones, that can cost you over $500. This phone is cheap enough that you can afford to replace it if it's lost or broken.The phone seems to work great. I suppose more expensive mobile phones are \"better\" in some theoretical way, but this phone probably does everything you will ever need, just as well as any other Android phone, maybe better.When this phone arrived in the mail, I took it to a MetroPCS store, said, \"I want the bring-your-own-phone deal.\" The sales people looked puzzled, then hostile. They had never heard of it, and seems to think I was some kind of a con artist. They reluctantly sold me a SIM card, then told me the phone was locked and could not be used on their network. I explained I had bought the unlocked phone on Amazon, and went so far as to show them their company's own bring-your-own-phone promotions on the internet. They didn't believe the phone was unlocked, and gave me misleading information about unlocked phones. I could tell they were just guessing, and were technically ignorant.Same thing happened at another MetroPCS store. I could tell they were ignorant, too. I found a MetroPCS cart at the mall, a contract vendor. The technician there seemed a little more knowledgeable. He scoffed at the suggestion that the phone was locked, but then he ran into a password. He didn't know what to do. He seemed to suspect I had stolen the phone, because I didn't know the password. I was tired and frustrated. I had wasted hours by then.On the way out of the mall, I passed a T-Mobile store, where I found knowledgeable and courteous sales staff. I gradually learned that MetroPCS has traditionally ruled the pre-paid phone market. When Tony Soprano used cheap, disposable cell phones to evade FBI surveillance, there's a good chance he was using MetroPCS phones. When young, poorly educated people with minimal incomes get a smart phone, it's probably a MetroPCS phone. Their sales staff is accustomed to this kind of customer. T-Mobile seems a bit more upscale.I wasn't happy about paying $50 per month to T-Mobile instead of $40 per month to MetroPCS. However, I learned that MetroPCS charges an extra $5 per month for the privilege of setting up your phone as a mobile WiFi hot spot. With T-Mobile, there is no charge for that. I need that and so will a lot of other buyers. So they are really only $5 apart.The knowledgeable staff at the T-Mobile store told me that \"unlocked\" means two completely different things:1-An \"unlocked\" phone can be used on any compatible mobile phone network.2-A phone is \"locked\" if someone has set it up with a password.Apparently the clueless sales people I had talked to at MetroPCS didn't know the difference.This phone can indeed be used on any compatible mobile network (any U.S. GSM network). However, it had been password protected, I'm not sure when or why. Possibly a previous MetroPCS technician did it, maybe by accident, or maybe it shipped that way.I learned that a \"hard reset\" would easily remove the password, and that was soon done. The rest seemed like a miracle. I walked away from the T-Mobile store ten minutes later with a working smart phone. No money had changed hands, they didn't ask for my credit card, not even my address, and I didn't sign a contract. They gave me the first month for free.I want to warn you about one other gotcha. Everywhere you go, you see billboard and magazine ads: \"Unlimited Text, Voice and Data. $40 per month. Period.\" These are usually MetroPCS ads, though I think T-Mobile has a similar program. These are basically bait-and-switch offers. The \"Unlimited data\" is actually limited to 1 GB per month. You can get more data per month, but you've gotta pay for it, and it might not be cheap. Different carriers charge different amounts for data above the 1 GB allotment. On a pre-paid plan, you've got to pay for it in advance, and the unused allotment doesn't carry over to the next month, as far as I know. (Ask about this.)If you're careful to get your data by WiFi whenever possible you can probably keep your data use down to 1 GB per month, depending on what you use the phone for. This works best if you have WiFi available at home, office, and other places you often go. Learn how to use your phone settings.

Not quite as buttery as the Nexus 5, which has been the smoothest experience I've had (this is in part probably due to the 5 having KitKat), but not far from it. Very close to the Nexus 4.2.

Simple, good looks.4. Has a quality feel. I'm also not as worried about it being brittle like the Nexus 4.5. Battery has been more than sufficient.Cons:1. It has a definite heft to it and is a bit thick. It does give the feeling of quality, but I find it a bit too heavy.2. It can be a bit slippery. The Nexus 5 back texture is perfect.3. I'm not sure whether it's the hardware or the software, but the screen is sometimes a bit unresponsive to light swipes.

Motorola shipped this phone with Android 4.4.3 already on it. The latest version of Android, that came out just a couple weeks ago. Very impressive Motorola. I am glad to see that a company finally understands that consumers want the latest  version of Android, not something that is 1 or 2 years old. Motorola has also made some changes that allow apps written for Android 4.4.x to get moved to the SDCard. This resolves any issues I have with this phone only having 8GB of internal memory. I already have a 32GB microsd so I am all set.The build quality is impressive. The phone is comfortable to hold and feels very solid. It doesn\u2019t feel like a cheap plastic phone at all.

Coming from a Note 2 with an impressive battery this is a huge relief. I am also happy to use a phone that I can use with one hand again. The Note 2 was simply too big for me, I don\u2019t have big hands. So, moving down to a 4.5 inch screen is a good change for me. The Moto G screen quality is superb.

I had moved to straight talk this past year to escape the high per-month costs at Verizon.  Unfortunately, only the GSM version of the Moto G was available rather than a CDMA version, forcing me to move to the ATT world and purchase a SIM card from ST.  First of all, this is an excellent phone for people like me that use their phone for daily lower bandwidth applications such as email, texts, navigation, news, calendaring, google music or Pandora and the occasional youtube video.  I received the Android KitKat update about 1 1/2 weeks after receiving the phone.  The phone is responsive with the Android 4.4.2 OS being a vast improvement over the 2.3 version I was running on my Droid 3.  By improvement, I mean in terms of usability.  I am really enjoying the Google Now application as it tailors the \"cards\" presented to me based on my past browsing and location history.  The phone has been glitch free without any apparent issues after 2 weeks of pretty heavy usage.  The battery carries me the entire day with capacity to spare.  I do not watch movies or TV shows or play video games on my phone, so the lack of LTE does not affect me.  A big bonus for me was that my old droid 3 chargers (phone and home) work on the Moto G.  Investing in a new set of accessories can add a significant cost to the purchase price of the phone.  The only problem I had was the inability of the phone to receive SMS messages once I had set it up for use on the ST network.  This appears to be a widespread problem on ST with their latest ATT microsim cards.  I was able to resolve the problem by working with a ST person who contacted me after I wrote about the problem on one of the ST forums.  Everything seems to work perfectly now.  The only other phone I considered was the 16 Gbyte Nexus 5 which was $50 more, but has a faster processor, larger screen and LTE.

So it won't be a useful phone if it cannot support Chinese.Other than that, this is a great ph. The screen is sharp and clear. The FM radio sound quality is really+really good! Holding feeling is actually better than my Nexus 4.Just talked to Moto CS and confirmed Moto-G does not support other languages. It supports only the 4 languages listed above.

It can receive ph text message in Chinese (and maybe other languages). The GMap is showing Taipei city street name in Chinese. I can add Chinese input app and write Chinese characters on the screen. So for a traveler to Asian counties, this ph is definitely usable. But if the user need to have a Chinese menu on his phone. Then this phone will not work. Or the user wants to use Chinese voice input for search, that won't work neither.For the above update, I raise this phone to 4 stars.UPDATE(12/18): Good news! OTG support works.

As one who has owned iPhone 4S, Nexus 5 and Nokia 925 (thanks to pre-paid T-Mobile), I think this Moto G strikes a good balance between value, performance and size.  I am not a fan of large phones or 'phablets' and the Moto G is just the right size.  The phone feels vastly superior in terms of build quality compared to Nexus 5.  On T-Mobile LTE, I have measured download speeds in excess of 20 Mbits/sec!If you need an Android device without any strings attached or bloatware loaded by carriers, choosing the Moto G will make you very happy.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Moto G and Amazon service", "Author": "Maurice", "ReviewID": "R2BZBXU5AUGK8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone excellent delivery time 8 days from Usa to Israel.

I have owned an iPhone 4s, a Nexus 4, and now a Moto G. I also own a Galaxy Note 10.1. That being said, the Moto G is easily the best phone I have owned. Making the switch from iOS to android was painless and worthwhile. This phone as fast as the nexus 4 and feels just as premium. I made the change from a Nexus 4 to the Moto G because of battery life. While my nexus would need to be charged at least once midday in order to make it all day, the Moto G powers through all day long with battery to spare. That alone was enough for me but the fact that this device can run everything my nexus could and do it just as well makes the switch all the better.This phone includes the device, a microusb to usb cable, and paperwork. There is not a wall adapter due to the price of this phone but will work with most chargers above 500mA with a max of 2mA.Hardware:Screen:The Moto G has a screen with a pixel density to match the iPhone 5s retina screen. It is only 720p compared to many flagships that are 1080p but to the human eye the difference is not noticeable. Images are sharp and colors are true on the Moto G. This looks like a high quality screen. It should be noted that the screen size is slightly smaller than the nexus but this makes it easier to use one-handed.Material:The phone itself is a polycarbonate material but feels premium. It does not feel like Samsung phones or tablets where the cheap plastic is noticeable. The phone weighs more than the nexus 4 but not by much and the heftiness makes it feel truly premium for a budget price point. The back is removable and is needed to do so in order to place a SIM card in the phone. The SIM goes in gold side down with the side that has a slanted edge in first which I had trouble figuring out at first. It is recommended to not use SIM adapters or risk breaking the pins in the phone. The back of the phone is a matte polycarbonate and tends to collect finger prints and oil easily. I use the Moto G flip shell and that is better made and lacks this issue. The back is hard to remove but is made easier by the included instructions in the package.Ports:The headphone jack is located directly in the middle on the top of the phone. The jack is a standard headphone jack and will fit any headphones you may have. However this phone does not come with a pair of headphones which is probably partially a factor in the price. The microusb port on this phone is standard and will fit any cables you may have. It feels tight and well made compared to some other ports on other devices.Battery:Battery life is phenomenal with this device. I use my phone heavily for streamed music over wifi and 3g, calls, google hangout video chats, and texting/email and this phone lasts from 7am till midnight with battery to spare. People who casually use their phone will get two days from it. There is also a battery saving mode that cuts down background app data but I have not yet needed to use it. Sadly it does not support Qi Wireless charging which is a let down.Included hardware: This phone has a white LED that is used for notifications. The phone also has an FM radio in it that uses headphones as the antenna. This is a nice feature and important for some people. The power and volume buttons are slightly wobbly but that can't be noticed in a case and they are reassuringly clicky and responsive.Software:This phone runs android 4.3 out of the box and is upgraded to android 4.4 over the internet. A google account is needed in order to download apps and use google software and you are prompted to create one or sign in with an existing one. This phone runs nearly stock android and has absolutely no lag at all. There are added Motorola apps which are actually very useful. Moto Assist can set profiles to make the phone silent while sleeping or in meetings. Motorola Migrate moved all my texts and into from my Nexus 4 to the Moto G flawlessly. There is at least one more guaranteed android update from Motorola.Internal components:The Moto G has a Snapdragon 400 and 1g of ram with 8 or 16g of storage. These are not quite flagship numbers but they are extremely fast and even with 1g of ram I have not had any issues with apps closing compared to my Nexus 4 which had 2g of ram. Games run just as well as the nexus and this phone is zippy and quick. The Moto G is unlocked for any GSM network and the US version is optimized for AT&T; and T-Mobile. The data speeds are only 3g or HSPA+ but are good enough to stream music and watch Youtube or Netflix without a stutter. The 3g saves battery compared to LTE which is a bonus.Overall this phone is extremely capable of being a daily driver even for power users. The phone feels premium and is offered at a budget price. Compared to other budget phones, it is a no brainer to pick the Moto G. Even flagships have a hard time justifying price compared to the Moto G. The battery lasts all day and the performance does not disappoint. The phone does smudge easily, does not offer NFC or Qi Charging, and the buttons are slightly wobbly but overall this phone is a great buy.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Got 2 of these to my sisters, now they're hooked up lol", "Author": "Victor Oliveira", "ReviewID": "R7IUSI0EYAOPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Moto G was, and still is something extraordinary made up by Google (although Motorola is now a Lenovo company). It's quite affordable for its specs, and the ONLY flaw is that it does not offer microSD storage, and we all know that 8GB is not enough for our daily use. But then, you get what you pay for, and in this case, we're getting far more than what we should. The quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM doesn't allow this phone to run slowly, not only that but its nexus-like android allows it to be updated almost as quickly as the nexus flagships (that is, assuming you're not buying a carrier phone bloated with their custom stuff, unlocked ALWAYS get updated quicker)Its camera is very good for the price, even though it could have a little more options on it. Maybe I'm asking too much, but since I've fallen in love with the camera app for the 1020 I saw with a friend, I seek stuff like that in other phones.As for game performance, well, its Adreno 305 GPU paired with the quad-core processor (for all that matters, it's a Snapdragon) and 1GB RAM makes it a good gaming device. My sisters play Ice Age Village and Minion Rush and got nothing to complain.It is a solid phone, by far it's the best on its price range, and if you won't mind waiting, in a few weeks the LTE version WITH SD STORAGE will be released, and then Lenovo will \"cure\" the only bad thing about this phone.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible.

So far, I really like this phone -- if it dies tomorrow, I will order another one.  Here's why.First, it is a completely clean Android phone.  No extra shells, no goofy interfaces, just plain Android.  The Google Play store has apps for everything I need, or want.  And every app I have tried works.  (Disclaimer -- I don't use/buy/have a ton of apps, but have yet to find one that did not work.)  I like the flexibility of the Android OS, compared to Apple iOS (my previous phone was an iPhone 4s, which served me well.)Second, the phone is totally \"factory\" unlocked.  This allows me to choose the carrier that I want, without contract, and change when I want.  In the US, I use ATT; since the phone is unlocked, there is no contract required.  And it is global -- I recently took it with me to Europe (Netherlands, Italy, and Austria.)  In Austria, for example, I stopped at a small bookstore.  For 10 euros ($14) I could buy a SIM card with 1GB data, 1000 minutes, 1000 texts, good for 30 days.  After installing the SIM and activating it online,  the phone came up and worked perfectly.  This flexibility is great, and saves a lot of money compared to using a US carrier's global services.Physically, it is nice and solid.  I like the size -- fits in most pockets, but the display is significantly bigger than the iPhone 4s. The display is very, very sharp.  I can read it in sunlight when needed -- and the colors are true and bright.  The case is smooth, almost slick, so I added a plastic/rubber case after a week.  The buttons are small, but nicely placed.  Battery life is as good as the iPhone 4s was.  I have no complaints about the camera, but I do carry a small digital camera when I know I will be taking a lot of pictures.The only downside is that there is nothing quite like iTunes available for Android, and it took a lot for me to adapt.Thanks for reading!

Also got the Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) upgrade as soon as I turned on the phone and hooked up to the wireless internet.Despite the size I got (8GB), the quick streaming from my Google Play or live streaming internet radio applications have compensated for the lack of storage to put my music on the phone.All in all, I want to say that this phone has been a good investment so far, and the customer service that Amazon provided for the defective phone and new phone has been awesome.

Firstly, let's get the bad out of the way. The quad core processor DOES in fact lag through menus, and it is definitely noticeable running the newest version of Android. The price is certainly indicitave of this, and I wasn't expecting the world from a 200 dollar unlocked phone, however, I wish I could launch Google Play Music without 20 second delays, and the program force closing itself. Now, for the good. This phone is very aesthetically pleasing, and is a beauty to hold, especially for the price. It looks and feels like the Moto X, a much higher end phone. For the price, you will get a premium android experience. The two stand out features are:1. The camera shutter speed:insanely fast with shortcuts from the lock screen. If you want a phone that can snap an average pic very quickly, trust me, you'll be happy.2. The screen. Oh my, this screen is INSANELY SHARP. For the price I expected perhaps 180 dpi, not over 300. We are talking sharper-than-retina-display pixel density. No joke, icons are sharp, text is beautiful, and even in high sunlight, the vividity and tone of the display are very impressive.Conclusion: While the speed lags behind today's high end smartphones, for 200.00 USD, this is a premium experience in a durable, sleek and modern cell phone. Camera is good and the screen is amazing. I suggest renting an HD show from Google Play to test it. You won't be disappointed, and like me, will be very happy with your new phone.

The phone is an incredible value, and while the Nexus 5 is probably the nicest phone you can get at the moment, this one has better battery life (according to Anandtech), which frankly is the most important smartphone spec. Definitely get the 16 GB one. Having plenty of space so you never have to worry about it (unless you've got some massive stuff to dump on) is super nice. On the 8 GB version, you'll only have like 3 GB of free space, so you would always have to be very careful about what you put on it.I personally would probably prefer the 5\" screen on the Nexus 5, but then, I know that smartphones are always getting better and lose half their value in 18 months, so I figured I'd just save the $150 (actually $170 in my case, since I got the refurbished one) for the next phone. Eventually they'll hold their value a lot better when the market matures, but for now, it would be wise to get a very capable budget model like this one.I've also used the Lumia 520/521, and while it is very good for its price, I can get every app I want on the Moto G, plus the screen is larger and sharper, and the battery life is far better (again according to Anandtech, but I believe them).I also really appreciate the waterproof coating.

Moto x is better but double the price and Nexus 5 was too big for meThe camera.. after many reviews of this phone, the downside was the the camera, but for $200 bucks why not try it.  The camera is great!! I don't know what people are doing, but all my pics turn out as good as my old iPhone 5c. The only problem is low light videos,and pics then you get unclear photos, but thats it! Outdoor shots taken with my wife's 5s are a little better but not by much,but there are only a few camera phones that look good in low light and they cost triple the price of this.The phone is super fast!  I have done everything on this phone that you can and never ran into any lag or reboots. I would say just as fast as an iPhone 5 a little slower than Galaxy s4 when you update to KITKATThe phone itself looks larger on videos that I watched on youtube, but It's not!  It is almost the same size as my wife's iPhone 5s with the display almost identical! Gorgeous display!The phone is super slippery, so I ordered the grip case from Motorola to help with that.This phone rocks! for under $200 , there is nothing that can beat it!  I compare it to an iPhone 5c but with a fm radio  and larger screenPros. Amazing Display. Awesome Battery Life. Super Fast. Great Camera. Perfect size for hand. FREE 50 gig of storage Google Drive.

After sideloading the GEL interface from the Nexus 5 and after the KitKat 4.4.2 instant upgrade after I first turned it on - and setting to ART instead of Dalvik), this unit is basically flawless in its performance. I am not a gamer so no need for the best/fastest graphics - just want fast performance for my apps and a decent Camera (which this is; and, the one thing I will miss from the 5S is the great camera). But then again, this unit is literally more than three times less than a 5S with 16GB.So, very solid phone. Build is great, feels very ergonomic in the hand and the screen is really fantastic for any phone, let alone a phone that shipped to my door for $199. With T-Mobile HSPA+, I get 8 Mbps to 12 Mbps down and 2 Mbps to 3 Mbps up. This is not LTE but it's plenty fast for \"3G\".I may not have this unit for a year, but I am immensely enjoying it for a $199 phone. The size is perfect (Nexus 5 is bordering on too large) and everything about the Motorola G is, well, great. I am amazed this is unlocked for such a good price.

Have been using the global GSM version on T-Mobile in Washington, DC, and 3G speeds are very good (8+ Mbps down, 2.4 up; the area has been refarmed to 1900).Compared it to a Moto X for a few days.  It's not exactly a fair comparison given the large price difference, but thought it might be helpful to some. The Moto X is a bit faster when browsing and scrolling--it's noticeable.  What is more noticeable is that the Moto X's display has better contrast--whites are much whiter and blacks are blacker. That said, the Moto G's display is sharp and doesn't look bad, except when compared to a top-end phone.  I found the Moto G easier to use one-handed b/c of the slightly smaller screen, and more comfortable to hold, because of slightly greater thickness around the edges. Returned the Moto X and kept the Moto G.I had a curious problem after the Kit Kat update:  the icon for answering calls didn't display when a call came in, making it impossible to answer calls!  Called Motorola Customer Care, who tried everything.  In the end, a factory reset did the trick.

Now I think I did it right. I paid around $200, but I think I get more than that. This is good looking, handy phone. Few advantages are as below:1. It is unlocked. You can use it with any carrier. No need to go for any contract or pay more for plan. E.g. if you take ATT no contract probally you need to have a connection with them for 6 month. That will cause money. So, if you have lower cost carrier it is best.2. Best part is you get an update for Kitkat. The new OS is great. It takes less processing memory. I think now you get Kitkat only for moto x and others are till working on it. So, it is great to have an eary update.3. Price. Nicely priced. It is hard to get a phone with all these in $200 price range.4. Battery life - It is another loving point. The battery life is really good. With normal use you can have a full day battery life. Some time it goes more than 2days.5. It is Quad-band GSM phone. So, I can carry this phone any where in the world. So, if you are traveling a lot no need to change the phone.6. It has a nice display. The screen is OK for a smart phone. (4.5)7. Get 50GB in google drive.But it has few disadvantages also:1. Camera - The camera in this phone is not so great. I will say it just takes picture. If you are looking for a good camera, you may wish to have a different one.2. It does come with a wall charger and headphone. Motorola may think to add them. This is not a hudge problem for me as I have some from my old devices.3. It does not work with all car charges. I have tired to use my charge with I use for my samsung but it did not work. I have to find the reason.4. No extandable memory. So, you are stuck with only device memory. But you get 50GB in google drive for 2 years. So, if you use cloude it is good.5. You can not replace battery easily. But it maynot be a problem for most of you if it works.6. If you are very heavy user you may not get enough processing power.7.

It's literally falling apart and my T-Mobile contract is almost up so I figured it was time to move into the present day and change phones and companies. I purchased a locked version of this phone through Republic Wireless (they require a proprietary Moto-X or Moto-G which can only be used on their system). I am a VERY happy camper. The current version comes with KitKat (Android version 4.4) which is what I am using right now. With built-in FM radio and GPS, there's a lot of off-line utility with the Moto-G. Even without a cell connection, or wi-fi in the case of Republic, I can still listen to NPR, play some games, and even (with a little foresight) use this for navigation.I've been using Android based tablets for several years now, so for starters I found using the same interface was trivial. I particularly like the physical size of the Moto-G which seems to be hitting a sweet spot. It nestles nicely into my average sized hands, and fits fairly easily into my front jeans pocket (yes, I can tell it's there, but it doesn't stick out).Google owns the manufacturer of this phone, Motorola. It's obvious that Google/Motorola work tightly together. Setting this up with my Google account pretty much was all I had to do. All of my Google contacts were immediately imported into the phone. Very cool. All other Google products work very well on the Moto-G also. The Google Maps app has the ability to import a map for offline use. I tested the offline maps with the built-in GPS and had a very nice, albeit rudimentary, car-based GPS unit. Did I say that was with no wifi or cell connection?The screen is super bright and I've had no issues seeing this except in the total brightest sunlight (and I can still use it - just don't start watching a baseball game at high noon on the beach). One of the features I love is the built in FM radio but you have to attach headphones for an antenna.The only two external controls are the power switch (top right edge small button) and volume up/down button (larger button just below power switch).

I was at work and elected to download over 3G data stream figuring it would take a while. This downloaded in about 5 minutes thanks to the  HSPA+ (High-Speed Packet Access Plus) network connection. It has been smooth sailing since. My batter lasts about 12-14 hours on a normal work day with little talking, social media and texting. I get about 8 hours with game play and heavy usage. The 16GB is plenty of storage especially if you use Google Drive to store photos and videos.The phone does go into a reduced state after sitting for a while saving battery I am sure. When I pick it up I get a No Internet message. A simple refresh solves this appearance of a problem.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good featured phone with great battery at a great price.

I was paying $75 a month (normally $100, but I got a dicounted rate from work. $100/mo for cell service is just nutty) for spotty data covereage, minutes I didnt use, unlimited texting which doesn't cost the carrier a dime, and on top of all that the annoying \"2 year agreements.\"So, I did some research and asked some friends and I settled on this phone as my best option. I'll list the pros and cons below:PROS:-It's cheap, at least relatively speaking. All these 4,5,6,7 hundred dollar phones are ridiculous and companies are nuts if they think I'm gonna drop that much on a phone.-Good size, slightly bigger than your average iPhone, but not as huge as many other phones on the market.-Decent battery life if you tweak some of the settings like screen brightness and turn the data connection off when its not in use. I get about 24+ hours on average, sometimes more if I dont use the phone too much.-Charges VERY fast! About an hour.-Comes with the newest version of Android. I know thats important to a lot of people. I didnt really care too much since I dont use my phone for much else other than email and paying my bills with their respective apps.-Its unlocked, meaning you can throw any (compatible) carriers sim card in it. So if you're looking to upgrade your phone or need to replace one without signing another BS contract, then this makes it easy. Also good for those, like me, who went for an off contract plan.CONS:-Coming from an HTC ONE X, this phone has a slower response time and tends to bog down when too many things are happening at once.-Widget system isnt as robust and is missing a couple that were existent on my HTC, namely weather and data widgets. (there is a way to set a widget for data, but it takes you through the setting menu and requires too many taps instead of just \"on/off\")-Fastest data speeds are 3G. Not the end of the world, but noticeable if you're on the internet or apps frequently.Overall:I'd say I \"like\" this phone and it does what I need it to do. It's a cheap way to have an unlocked smartphone. Im saving HUGE amounts of money by switching to a prepaid plan and I was sick of AT&T; syphoning cash out of my bank account.

It comes unlocked from the factory, Kit-Kat (4.4) was really for download & install as soon as it was connect to wifi (and before I had a micro-sim) to insert.First, this is an excellent phone. Messaging and phone services work great. No $400 phone could possibly make us happier. I am ordering one for myself (I am setting up & test driving this one for my wife). The Renke flip case is an excellent fit, by the way. Second, Wifi is excellent and the Android is quick and powerful. Excellent Smartphone all around. Google bought Motorola early last year.

It obviously doesn't compare to the top of the line models, but for the price and what this phone can do, this could easily sell for 299 dollars. There are two drawbacks that come to mind though; However, not too major in my opinion. The battery is not easily replacable and there is no external sd card storage. That said, if you get your hands on a replacement battery and a t4 torx screwdriver, and have a basic knowledge on how to use a screwdriver you can replace the battery. As for the limited storage use, you have the option to get the 16 GB version. Or, as this phone is otg capable, you can connect an otg cable and connect a thumb drive to store or retrieve additional media or files. Also, you have free cloud storage such as google drive that can store quite a bit of GB's of files or media.

Sound quality is excellent, the screen is brilliant and a good size, it features KitKat, and adding a SIM to an unlocked phone takes about 90 seconds tops.  99 percent of the time, this is all the phone I'll ever need.  I was considering the Moto X, but that unit's whiz-bang features (voice wakeup, shake-to-shoot camera, and Moto Maker personalization), sexy though they seem, just wouldn't get used enough by me to justify the extra cost.No, there's no 4G LTE, but if you live & work in a wi-fi environment and aren't into extreme gaming or watching movies on your phone, who cares?  If you ARE into those things, then spend the extra $400 or tie yourself down to some overpriced contract.  16 gigabytes with no expansion slot is a possible issue (you shouldn't even consider the 8 gig unit given the $20 difference), but there are inexpensive workarounds and Google cloud storage.Even for the casual user there are a few minor flaws.  The camera is its weakest feature, and if you're really into using your phone for picture taking, it won't be adequate.  It's a no brainier to use, but it's only 5mp, and it likes to hunt and hunt for focus and never quite get there.  Then there's the layout.  The on-off button is on the side above the volume rockers, in a place where my fingers fall naturally when using the phone, and that makes it too easy to push the button at the wrong time.  The whole unit feels a little less-than-substantial in the hand, too.

As expected the phone the second I opened the box was already charming, and I was surprised by the soft design of its curves and the material of the phone because you can tell whether it is a compact stylish one the second you put your hands on it. Right after you plug it in it starts playing a beautiful presentation of which I am still not tired of, but as you may expect there was more to be impressed about, beginning with the 8gb of internal memory which in my case are more than what I need but if you need more space which is understandable you can buy the 16gb version by adding 20 dollars. As it is a quad core phone it can compete in terms of hardware with the high-end phones. When it comes to connectivity the phone has a really fast and smooth connection whether using 3g or WiFi network. The screen is just outstanding, it has a very good contrast and a very good definition as well, the notification light isn't a step back because it has a strong light which turns on and off slightly. Finally if there is something to complain about it would be the 5 megapixel camera which in my opinion it can capture the moment fine and you have the possibility to take a photo of an A4 sheet which in my case it is something which shouldn't be turned a blind eye.Having put all cards on the table I would like to add one more thing which is that the phone is perfectly smooth, it has neither crashed nor lagged, and the reason of this is the complete compatibility between software and hardware because as the Iphone this phone is made by the same company which has built the operating system, something which rarely happens.All in all I feel the need of contributing by recommending this thing and encourage the manufacturing and designing of this kind of polished gadgets which have a lower percentage of revenue and whose aim is to make the best available to the average population.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best price-benefit smartphone in the market!", "Author": "checho26", "ReviewID": "R1L0VG0VUAE287", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cell phone is the best in the market considering price-benefit relation.

Or so I thought. Had soaked my original one in milk, cleaned it out but no go. So I ordered this second one. I really like this phone. For the price, it does more than what I need, is inexpensive and allows me to NOT sign a two year contract. I pay a third of what my apple loving friends pay and see no benefit to having their phones.The few apps I really need are much better for this phone and are free at that and in fact, those high priced phones and contracts are a definite drawback in my mind, I will explain in a minute.As for durability? Let's look at the one I soaked in a bag of milk. I had opened it up, washed it out, sprayed it with contact cleaner and dried it. No go,,, dead, so I bought the new one. Lo and behold, a week later, I kept hearing a chirping and wondering where the hell it was coming from. Traced the noise to the counter where the original phone had been tossed and sure enough, there it was, telling me the battery was low. I charged it, popped the sim back in and voila, it works. So to say I am impressed with this phone is an understatement.  Now of course all the techie snobs will tell you to buy the latest, greatest (and super expensive) phone and sign up for one of those outrageously priced two year super contracts. But if you want a dependable, inexpensive, no contract phone, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this one.I mentioned above there is a big advantage to this phone and a month by month plan. Consider the original phone was only three weeks old when I thought I had ruined it. Financially, I was only out the $200 cost of the phone as there was no contract to fulfill. Now consider the superphone you get for \"free\" with it's  two year contract that goes with it. If you ruined that one after three weeks you would have had to shell out another $500-800 to purchase another phone or be left paying the remaining 21 months left on the contract with no phone to use. Or you could  pay the exorbitant early termination fee. Maybe you paid extra for a \"warranty\" against such accidents as I had? That's probably costing you as much as the Motorolla G over the life of your contract. No matter what choices you made, or how you do the math, you would pay far, far more for a \"free\" phone and contract over this phone and a month to month account. Your choice. Join the mass of sheep and pay through the nose or follow the path less travelled. Techie snobs need not apply (or reply)As a followup, I just switched carriers after four months, no early termination fees, and saved another $15/month, unlimited text, data, calling.

For e-mail and phone calls, Edge is OK, for anything streaming.... don't do it.The reason that I did not give 5 stars are listed here:- The phone froze 4 times during the 2 weeks in Germany. Two times during navigation on the highway :(( and two times when I tried to use the camera. It appears that the camera problem was a flashlight issue but the hang up during navigation is really bad.I used Navigator App and overall the results were amazing for a free tool. Whether the frozen phone (I had to reboot) was a problem of the Moto G or a side effect of the Navigator App, I can't tell for certain. As much as I like this phone and as much as I prefer Android over iOS, these kind of hang-ups were a new experience after the i4 and not a desirable one.- The combination of slow speed data transfer compared to my i4 and the couple times I had to reboot the phone, I cannot give 5 stars because reliability is my #1 priority.As for all the other features, great screen, loud speakers, good quality hardware, very little trash software pre-installed... that is greatly appreciated.Since I returned from Europe and haven't been using the Navigator App any more, there has been no system halt.If you want decent speed outside the US, you better purchase the international version of the Moto G.

I know some of the articles & videos scoffs at this level of responsiveness but I think it worked out the kinks!The downloadable content is pretty awesome which games are seamless and control friendly with great visual effects! Moving into the boring category, calls were pretty crisp, entering & exiting out of apps were super fast, and internet experience was just as great (although there's much faster online access out there like the LG G2).Overall, great phone for the buck! You will not be disappointed if you're looking for a phone that has strong impressionable features at this price point which I emphasize. If you're looking for a robust top-of-the-line smart phone this not your choice but this will satisfy many of the basic needs for a mobile phone and more.For phones under the $200 range, I will have to rank this as the best phone in the market. Over $200, it will fall b/n 10 - 15 rank but it's unfair for this comparison given the amount of features at the price point. You wouldn't necessarily believe that you'll have a $700 quality phone under $200 which is almost impossible to achieve in this competitive smart phone market.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!", "Author": "Edgardo Skakovsky", "ReviewID": "R27N1QM9SFUX9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very fast.

Updating to 4.4.2 was the first thing i did and I experienced absolutely no issues; everything worked fine. I don't have a single complain. What is amazing about this phone is that I spent less than half the money I did on my previous phone.... for an UPGRADE... how crazy is that? You think upgrading is always going to cost you more money right? Well, not with the moto g. It allows you to make that much needed upgrade by spending less and that is incredible.

Comparably, it is like buying high-end gaming computers for word processing and web browsing. Also keep in mind that performance directly correlates with battery usage, which means over-paying for specs will cost you in battery duration, too.To me, overpaying for processing and specs is silly, esp. given how fast technology changes and products become obsolete.The Motorola Moto G is a great fix and solution for average people who wants some games, e-mails, messaging, and phone calls.I do business on the phone, and by far Motorola has the best *phones* for conversations. I seriously considered Moto G, Moto X, and Nexus 5, after ruling out Galaxy after some serious consideration. The cost of specs was the primary consideration. Nexus 5 loses out on the speaker quality, and Moto X's screen sucks for battery power than Moto G's. Moto G also happens to be 50% the price. If you want a great on-phone camera in the budget/mid price range, Nexus 5 with its image-stabilized camera could be better solution for you.I wanted a smartphone phone that is inexpensive to replace and has great speakers and mic for conversations.

I had heard great reviews about the phone prior to purchase, but I was nervous about the price tag and any sacrifices Motorola had to make to get this price.It only took a day to remove any doubt from my mind.First off, I love the low clutter vanilla experience this phone offers. There isn't a custom motorola launcher or many (Only 3 apps) pre installed motorola applications. I received the update to 4.4 Kit-Kat almost immediately upon getting the phone, which only improved my already great experience with the phone.Second, The battery is phenomenal. Constantly I can go 2 days with \"normal\" use without a charge, something my galaxy couldn't do. I never have to worry about the battery being drained at the end of the day. (I will say though I'm not necessarily a heavy phone user, but my Galaxy S3 would die by the end of the day with my usage of it, while this phone lasts easily 1.5 times as long)Third, the phone build is great. I have dropped in multiple times without a case, and have yet to experience any damage to the screen and only have minimal damage to the side of the phone. The general feel of the phone is nice too, the screen, at around 4 inches, feels big enough to read and type on, but not too big to feel awkward while typing and doing any phone tasks.The one thing I can't testify to is how well the phone does in games or intense tasks.

Distorted loud speaker at high volume.5. 1GB of RAM which for the most part functions fine but every now and then stutters when switching between apps.6. The screen can be hard to view in direct sunlight since the screen brightness doesn't get bright enough to combat the brightness of direct sun.||||||||PROS||||||||1. Price - $179 USD Off-contract (+$20 for 8GB more = 16GB for $199)<---definitely recommend the higher storage capacity.2. Amazing Battery performance!3. Nano Coating (water resistant to an extent)4.

Motorola hit the spot", "Author": "Roman", "ReviewID": "R2KKH52J5MHGW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is great smartphone which delivers high end features at price of budget phone.I think Motorola packed perfect features into this device for more than reasonable price.It also fits the biggest needs of every average android phone user.-As of now (feb.  2014) there are absolutely no competition for this phone at this price point.  It's simple as that,  there are no KitKat phones at this price point.  There are no phones with such a good screen at this price point. No other smartphone has a comparable battery life at this price.  And in fact it has better specs and features than some $300 phones.-4.5\" ideal screen size that makes it not to big or too small and easy on most user's eyes.  300+ppi is ideal density,  because eye can no longer trace pixels on the screen.-battery life is great (around 5hr of screen time,  it might vary on use but its better than most phones) and its one of the important factor in smartphones-very quick and responsive.  Screen is very responsive to touches which makes it very easy to type fast.  Browsing around phone has no lag or delays.  Apps load fast.-OS might be unimportant to 90% of users,  but KitKat is what makes this phone so good.-Ok camera.  I would really love to buy a high end phone without 20mp camera just to save a few bucks.  And thats why moto g has an average camera,  because it's not the most important feature of the phone and it could be easily replaced with 5mp camera whithout too many users even noticing.  Nokia with 41mp camera has an insane price exactly for that reason,  mean while  rest of whone spects is nothing special for the price.-Micro SD slot is a handy feature,  but few free gigabytes on the phone is OK for most.  My guess would be it's most important feature for kids,  teenagers and early young adults because of all the music and games they \"need\".

The display is crisp and has good color rendering.- The ergonomics are great. The phone is the right size for me (I carry it in my front pocket) and the back has a nice curvature to it. The sides are tapered towards the front which seems trivial, but I really like how it feels in my hand.What I don't like:- I knew this phone didn't have 4G LTE, but I was expecting to be able to use T-Mobile's regular 4G network. Sadly, it is not compatible with the 1700 Mhz band needed for this. I know this is my own fault for not understanding the compatibility, but it is very subtle if you aren't up on these things. As it is I get about 3-5 Mbps download speeds depending on location.- The camera isn't that great. I knew it wasn't going to spectacular, but I was hoping for something a little better. I did install another camera app which is basically the standard KitKat camera app and it seems to have more options and take better pictures than Motorola's pre-loaded camera app. Go figure.If this is your first smartphone or you are looking for a smartphone on a budget, you really can't go wrong with this phone.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Longest Battery Life Ever!", "Author": "Sarah I Brown", "ReviewID": "RV7UIZYOQ3T23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit I was a bit hesitant buying this phone even though reviews were great.

I have recently committed to buying phones off contract and unlocked.  I finally got tired of the big guys controlling when I could buy a new phone and how many months (typically over 12) I had before I could shop for better wireless service.See below for the good, the bad and combination of phone and service.  I use a Nexus 5 as my primary phone.  I broke the screen 2 days before a business trip.  So i bought ordered the Moto G overnight shipping to get it in time to leave for my trip and send my Nexus 5 for screen repair.  My sister lost her Galaxy 2 months into the 24 month contract.  She also got this phone as a replacement and loves it.THE GOODThis phone comes unlocked and works immediately with any GSM service (AT&T; and T-mobile to name a few).I just had to get a Micro SIM card and pop it into the phone.  Immediately my plan and number jumped to this deviceThe phone is near stock android.  There is really no \"extra\" app installed (like the apps that come with the Galaxy line)The phone's cellular data is quick and responsive (although it is only 3G).THE LESS THAN STELLARI honestly couldn't find anything particularly bad about this phone.  There are a few areas that you should considerThe camera is not great... especially in low lighting.  For SnapChat or pic messaging, it's definitely fine; however, you're not going to be getting any 8x10 prints out of these picsOccasionally when I have quite a few apps running there is a bit of lag.  Nothing horrible, but when pushing the home button it goes to a blank \"desktop\" and the icons take 1-2 seconds to return.There is no 4G.  However, in my area the 4G networks are being strained and the 3G networks are freeing up space.  This has not been a problem for me at all (and i'm a data hog).WITH SERVICEAs with my Nexus 5, I use T-mobile's unlimited pre-paid plan.  For $70/month (taxes included) I get unlimited calls, text and 4G data.  At any point if I decide to switch carriers, all I do is not pay my next bill and take my number to any provider that I would like.  i was initially curious about the service, but it has been wonderful so far.  If you are considering a phone that falls on the bottom of high end and a 24 month contract with one of the big guys, it would be worth your while to consider this great deal and not commit to the big guys.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone great price not so great memory size", "Author": "German Lopez", "ReviewID": "R2P3WS1NXTISI8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Go for the 16gb version, dont make my mistake8 GB means that you'll only have like 5 or 6 REAL Free GBSo go for the 16 gb versionIt's a nice phone though", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing phone for the price", "Author": "Barret", "ReviewID": "R20HYBNHJX80GK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's hard to believe this phone is $200 off contract.

Not full HD, but whatever. My eyes couldn't tell the resolution difference from Nexus 5.-Performance: It's fast enough to do anything I do, including most of the 3D games-Reception quality: No complaints here too. Here in Toronto, Canada I get well over 7Mbps consistently. Ok it's not LTE, but theweb pages always loaded nearly as fast as my Nexus 5-Solid build-Battery life: Boy, this thing can last long time. After my typical day which consists of: 30-minute phone calls, 20-30 combined emails received and sent, lots and lots of IMs (Google plus and Whatsapp), 2 hours of music play through bluetooth while I drive to work and back and then some bed time game play and facebook lurking, the phone still has 20% left.Cons:-Camera isn't the best, but it does the job for snapping facebook pictures-Cheap back cover material (but it does feel solid, meaning there is no creaking or gaps or rattles)-No 32GB availableHowever I must be clear that I thinkg the 'Cons' I listed aren't really big issues, I'm just nit picking for the sake of writing a review.Overall, this is a fantastic phone that will handle any daily tasks without a hassle.

I did not want to be using 3G service through the refarmed 1900mhz towers since it is very limited. After doing more research on what 1700 (AWS) actually meant, it essentially means that it uses both 1700 and 2100. 1700 for upload and 2100 for download. So fellow T-mobilers, you're fully covered!As for moving from the Galaxy Nexus i9250, there's really only a few things that the Nexus has that the Moto G doesn't. That's NFC, and the few remaining radio frequencies that allows it to work with 3G service everywhere else in the world. But really, how often have I ever used NFC? Other than beaming a picture or two to my girlfriends phone.So for the price, it is an excellent phone!

The best bang for your buck, if you're with a GSM carrier (Works great with T-Mobile)-As of this review it's running Android 4.4.2 (kitkat) and is almost pure Android-Size, not too big, not too small-Gorilla glass 3-1.2GHz Quad core CPU (Snapdragon 400, which is the lower of the current quad core family at the moment)-Dedicated GPU-FM Radio, which is rare these days-1GB of ram (it's okay, but wish it was 2 so the phone was more future proof)-Great Battery life-Decent camera with HDR and slow motion features-With a flip case, it automatically turns on and off the display when you open your case-Many moreCons (not many):-It's a bit heavy and bulky-Accessories (ie, cases) cost too much. There weren't any cheap knock offs at the moment which was why I had to buy a shell from Motorola-Only HSPA 21+, wish it was HSPA 42+ (which competes with LTE)-Speaker could have been better-No NFC, which isn't a big deal-No room for additional micro SD card, which I don't care about anyways because everything is in the cloud these days-You can open the back and see the battery, but why can't we swap out the battery?Overall, I'm very pleased with the phone. I wish it was mine. It is super snappy. I still have my old Galaxy Nexus and don't need to upgrade it yet. I used to only buy Nexus products, but I will consider Motorola for future purchases because it seems that since Google took them over, they've been better with their support.

You have to give up something to get a phone down to this price point and it gets so very much right, but for me I knew the camera was never going to cut it.If you destroyed your phone and don't want to roll the dice with an eBay \"better\" phone to get you through to an upgrade, then this might just be the device you are looking for.

Didn't test the speed as I had no performance issues.- FM Radio (App needs a little work though)- Customizable colors (I opted for the colored Cruzerlite Droid case as it was cheaper and added TPU protection)Overall other then the loose fitting power and volume buttons nothing to complain about. Highly recommended!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value, some issues though", "Author": "rawr", "ReviewID": "R1TUWNCWSCG0CL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first pre ordered this from Amazon on Dec 2, however, the shipping date for the Global 16GB version was later (I believe 11th) so I changed my order to Motorola directly instead, probably a bad choice. Since they experienced a heavy snow storm, the product was shipped a week and a half after its \"week of Dec 2\" shipping estimate. Customer service wasn't as helpful as I liked (they had no idea when it was actually shipping), but they were responsive. I never got a tracking number from them, and my order says not shipped, but it arrived. Keep this in mind for those that ordered from Motorola directly as their entire system is extremely, finicky.Onto the phone itself, the device is built fairly well, except the buttons. They rattle when you shake the phone, type on the phone, when it vibrates, and when you just move/flip/touch the phone in anyway. Its not a huge deal, but it is the most obvious issue. Some have said that they got really good buttons, but the majority seems to get some rattle. For the price however, you do get an excellent screen, decent chipset (Snapdragon 400, quad core A7, Adreno 305), ample RAM, enough storage for the intended audience, and ultimately a clean, uncluttered Android 4.3 soon to be 4.4.There is however one pretty big software issue that remains to be sorted. Its actually ground breaking enough that I am now returning the phone and getting a slightly more expensive handset (in a rush, so an exchange wouldn't work). The Moto G, sometimes experiences a battery reading \"bug\". Say you are using your phone normally, anywhere between 100%->1% you have a chance of it suddenly dropping to 0% and shutting the phone off. What happened to me was after the first discharge cycle (to around 15%) when I just got the phone, I charged it up to 100% and shut it off for the night. The next morning, it could not turn on at all. Plugging in the charger did nothing but light up a white LED. Keeping it plugged in for an hour resulted in a screen showing up that says its charging, but only at 6%. The charger works for my Xperia Z, portable battery, and is rated for 1900mah. I also tried a lower, 850mah one and it resulted in the same issue. You can search online for many others experiencing the same problem. There is an issue with either the battery, the software detecting of the battery, or something else that remains to be fixed.The phone otherwise,+ Loud (remember to change the default ringtone!)+ Good build quality (minus the buttons)+ Customizable shell (I picked up a white one)+ Nearly stock Android, no lag, no garbage apps (there is a Moto help and transfer app, that's it)+ 4.4 planned to be coming soon+ Nothing comes close at this price+ Customer service is helpful, though wait times are a tad long (4 calls, ranging around 10-25minutes)- Battery bug/issue is serious if you have it- Button rattle seems to be common, and may be annoying to some- Camera performance is mediocre at best, only 720P video recording- Lack of 5GHz Wifi (Miracast as well)- Removing the back cover feels like you are breaking it- Battery sealed- System language support (displaying the menu in another language), but see below...There are very limited amounts of languages supported as another has stated. There are only English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. You can however, for those willing to experiment, flash the UK's firmware, which DOES have all the languages. It is pretty upsetting that they removed it from the ones sold in the US. The process is simple and should not void your warranty as you do not need to unlock the bootloader. People wanting Chinese, or a variety of other system languages should search XDA in addition to \"Install Moto G UK Generic Firmware/Stock ROM\", which should give you a nice step-by-step procedure. Flash at your own risk, but XDA users have reported it to be simple and that it works. I was planning on doing it, but my device no longer starts up.Unfortunately, I didn't have time for a return and gambling that a fix/replacement would work. Motorola's CS however, was very quick to issue a return + refund. While there is a fairly lengthy wait to get to a representative, they don't bother you with too many questions and are in general, offer a good customer service experience.So overall, -2 for the button rattling and the battery issue, but +1 for Moto's CS.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Yazhar \"yazhar@yahoo.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3ME0DZUECOUWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dude, this thing is awesome.Right price, right device.As the sun rises, I resolve to use the moto g for good, not for wasting precious time.", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it.", "Author": "Fernanda Calderon", "ReviewID": "R1ZL3JYRO1WXA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with my phone so far.

I was pretty happy, but the phone lacks some features like a flash for the camera and a front facing one too. The phone felt cheap, the screen and camera were bad, and the lack of popular apps made me ultimately decide to switch back to Android.This phone has a really nice, clear screen and it doesn't feel or look cheap. The cameras take nice quality for the price and calls are clear too. The battery life is also very good. It charges fairly quickly and last for about 10-12 hours before it was on 30% and need to be charged again. I spent most of the day downloading apps, surfing the Internet, and watching a video on YouTube and the phone did not slow down, nor did the battery completely drain.My only complaint so far is that using the new software isn't as straight forward as Windows. This is taking me some time to get adjusted, but I am really enjoying playing around with the settings and features on the phone.  This is definitely the nicest phone I think I've ever owned.Cons:1.

The days when buying cheap (- $ 200) phones meant being forced to endure older Android versions, slow performance speed, and terrible visuals, are long gone. If my Nexus 4 dies off sometime in the future, I'll purchase a Moto G, which hopefully will be a constant item on the future Motorola product lines.

Mandala \"mrdosa\"", "ReviewID": "R3EQSLXDOY3AKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Surprisingly like the other reviewer, I had to find a replacement for my iPhone 5. I have used iOS device only before I started looking for a cheap device to use for a while before I go back to iOS (I have way too many apps/devices on apple eco-system). I first purchased the Nokia 520 directly from Microsoft Store for about $65 including an extra back case. I returned the phone in a couple of weeks. This is my second purchase, Moto G 16GB. I thought I could post my views on these two devices. Since others have perfectly described the phone and its features, I am only presenting a comparison:Price:Nokia 520 beats Moto G at more than half the price of Moto.Looks and hardware:Both phones look good, I prefer the curves of Moto better. Both do have replaceable backs to change the colors. Both are 3G devices, but I found Moto to have faster web access speeds. Of course the Nokia has a lower processor speed and innards, and such sometimes felt sluggish, especially when searching or using cortona. Camera wise, both suck. At least Moto has a front facing camera that could be useful and a flash. Nokia misses both of them, but has a better Camera app.Nokia has user replaceable batteries, making it easier to carry some spare around. It also has an SD card slot, a necessity when you plan to use HERE offline maps. The phone comes default with 8GB should be adequate since there are not many apps you can download. LOL. Moto has a decent battery life, but is not user replaceable.The location of the microphone on Moto G is prone to find a hand covering it while you hold the phone. Which practically mutes the microphone.Screen:Nokia has a lower resolution screen. But is quite adequate. I disliked the glossy screen on Nokia, very difficult to read in sunlight plus a finger print magnet. Moto has a retina display equivalent screen resolution, very nice indeed.Software:Both phone adequately run their OS and apps. The Nokia is a windows phone and such has fewer apps, functionality. It probably is a good 1 or 2 years behind Android and iOS in terms of functionality. Nokia was updated to Windows 8.1 which featured Cortona. Windows 8.1 resembles iOS more than it does Android. If you use Google services, you would hate the Nokia. They don't play well with google. Even the browser web interface of Google apps on the phone look 2g-ish..remember the good old WAP and GPRS? However, surprisingly, it paired very well with iCloud. I could sync my iCloud contacts and calendar quite easily. There are some annoying feature omissions..for example, when you receive a new whatsapp notification and click on it, it just opens the app. It does not open the message thread. This could well be an app issue, but I would be surprised as it does work on other os'.Both have excellent mapping services. I prefer the offline maps on Nokia, but like the flexibility of Google maps.Final verdict:Nokia 520 is a great back up device, lacking in many key software areas, but makes for a great GPS unit. Lifetime free map upgrades. It is quite difficult to make it a daily use phone..unless you just need a device that does basic smartphone things. And if you don't plan to use Google services.Moto G is a capable device, that can be your primary phone. For more than 80% of the Android users, this phone would suffice.

Not a good phone for WiFi either.", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "RO3A6Y3Q6SBSQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, I knew this phone was not going to take very detailed pictures. I wanted to test this phone out and see if it would be good for music and decent with photos. Unfortunately it's not the phone for me.PROS-Amazing picture quailty- I was definitely surprised by the picture quality of this phone. This was stunning and good for the price. It was looking like a higher end $300 phone.Stock OS- This Kitkat android OS was pretty clean and fast. It has some Motorola bloatware, which I didn't expect to have. It was not too intrusive to be a con.Battery- Was just great, and I am sure the Motorola's software helps with the battery being so good. High end phones just end up draining quick with heavy usage, this does not.CONS-  WiFI- This seems to be a problem with this particular phone with others that use it frequently. It is just slower which causes streaming video apps to not display high quality videos. I also have had disconnections with YouTube and WiFi shutting off completely. I have tested multiple phones to make sure it was not my router/internet connection. This is one of the MUST upgrades for this phone since it has a fixed storage. If you can't fit a lot of media on the device your options are going to sway towards streaming.RAM- Only 1GB of ram and I think this causes some of my high quality 720p videos that I put on the device to be a bit laggy. You can barely notice it, but during high actions scenes I tend to notice. It could be the processor? but I am leaning towards it being a RAM problem.Music Audio- This was the biggest con for me, videos for MOST people wouldn't even notice the very slight lag. I am not talking about the speaker on the device either. I EXPECTED that to be bad, but the internal audio card was just a piece of junk. I plugged my Bose earbuds in this and I heard an echo sounding music. It felt weak and not fulfilling. I have an LG Optimus V which is an old android phone(that I have seen on sale for as low as $30) which had better quality music audio than this phone.  Movies and videos however, I thought the audio was good though(oddly). I have tried Pandora and downloaded higher quality music to test the phone out.Minor Con-Storage- is limited, will have to stream mostly. This is a minor con to me since I have internet everywhere xD. To some others I see this being a bigger con. In conclusion I gave this device 3 stars because of the amazing picture quality on the phone, the price, and just being a good deal overall. This phone is plain and simple- not for people who listen to a good amount of music or take a decent amount of photos with. I didn't list the camera as a con since it was to be expected decent(which it was). If they make these upgrades and bump the price a little, I am sure this phone would be just perfect. There would be very little reason for the causal phone user to get another phone. I recommend getting the Galaxy S3 for Virgin Mobile which is $220($20 more than 16gb Moto G) on Amazon for the 16GB version. The camera, music audio, and WiFi is FAR superior than this device. The con is that you would have to go with that specific carrier VM which uses Sprint. I live in a big city(no problem with lack of coverage) and they charge $35 for 300minutes+unlimted text+2.5gbs of 4G LTE(then reduced to lower speeds after that). Other carries did interest me a bit more, but I don't need better service.

Because of the new plan I switched to is prepaid, I am not eligible for the subsidy or payment plans that the carriers now offer, and was going to switch back to the post paid plans since I got sweet deal that fits our budget nicely.So, since we have no subsidy or payment plan option, a new iPhone or high end Android phone is out of the question.  Could not spend $600 to $700 on a phone.  So when I heard about the MotoG, I was intrigued.  It has decent specs, current OS and is only $200.  No subsidy, no payments.  Just $200!!The transition from iOS to Android hasn't been that bad.  My wife has always had Android, so it wasn't totally new to me.  They both have pros and cons, but this is about the phone not the OS.The speed is great.  Now take into consideration I am coming into this after a 4 year old phone, so apps took some time load on my iPhone.  I was impressed with how fast I was able to bring up Facebook and Twitter.  I can take a picture in a snap.  Checking into Foursquare is so fast now.If you read reviews of the phone on tech blogs, the message is always the same when it comes to this phone.  They kept cost low by leaving out 4G.  I don't do too much on my phone outside of the house that would really need 4G, so it hasn't been an issue so far.  Although, as I am writing this review, the newer version is being released with 4G and added an SD card slot.To wrap it up, I am pleased with this phone and hope you will be too.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for", "Author": "Tushar Bhandari", "ReviewID": "R1AHZ0N9R2B877", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to buy a cheap android smart phone for my mom and this was like the complete package.

The warranty is over (1 year IIRC, even if it's not I'm sure I voided it because I couldn't put up with TouchWiz and rooted and put CyanogenMod on it). So I really needed a phone, bought this on Amazon, had amazon prime so I ordered it with one-day shipping for only $3.99 extra (one-day shipping: arrive on Friday, two-day: arrive on Monday). It arrived as expected, and it's been great so far.For just $179.99 the value is just unreal. Here's a quick rundownPros:-High quality 4.5 inch 1280x720 screen-Quad core processor-Stock android 4.42-No bloatware-Ergonomic design (soft touch back plate, rounded to fit contour of hand)-Just $179.99-Good battery lifeCons:-No LTE (3G and HSPA+ though)-5MP back camera-No removable battery or microSD card slotThe cons are completely understandable for a phone that is just $179.99.This was supposed to be a stop-gap until my upgrade cycle comes around (Mid-August), I figured I'd sell it on ebay for $100+ to recoup some of my losses. However since it's so good I'm considering getting a new phone on my upgrade cycle, and selling that one brand spanking new on ebay for a $400+ profit (generally the $199 upgrades sell for $600+) . This phone is seriously that good. I don't need a bigger screen, or higher pixel density (329ppi already!). The only thing really lacking is the camera and 4G usability.At the moment it's inconvenient to break the upgrade cycle (group/family plan is more economical). However, this thing is a killer deal. I recommend this 100%.More detailed review for more smartphone aficionados:Screen:It's not the greatest screen, but it's outstanding for the price point. It's actually better than the Galaxy S3 screen in my opinion. It's a bit smaller in comparison, but I'm fine with a 4.5 inch screen vs. 4.8 inch. The main difference is LCD vs. AMOLED. The Galaxy S3 uses an AMOLED screen with the Pentile pattern (basically, the whites can look pretty crappy if you examine them). The max brightness on the GS3 is disappointing (bad outdoor performance), but the contrast ratio is great and the minimum brightness is better (good indoor performance). In contrast the Moto G screen has great maximum brightness with okay minimum brightness. I take that tradeoff anyday. Not to mention conventional pixel arrangement >> pentile.User Interface/Skin:So I'm not a big fan of Touchwiz. It looks crappy, it's overburdened with features I don't use. I am biased against Touchwiz, but I feel like most people already prefer close-to-stock android to touchwiz ever since Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). To have the phone already on stock android (and the latest version, 4.42, to boot!) is incredibly useful. Having to root and install custom OS's on my GS3 was both inconvenient in their lack of stability (early on versions) and in their toll on my battery life. There are some features of cyanogenmod/AOKP that I miss, i.e. more customization. However I am fine with stock android and probably won't bother rooting. The modest increase in usability doesn't outweigh the potential bricking and messing with stability/battery life for me. Also if I do decide to sell this phone on ebay when I get to my upgrade cycle, I think it would be better to leave it unrooted.Battery life:The battery life is 2-2.5 days with moderate usage from my observations. It's great for now, much better than my GS3 was, but then again the GS3 battery life was significantly shortened after rooting and modding, so I can't say that's a fair comparison.Camera:Haven't used much yet, but it definitely isn't as high quality as the GS3 or any other top-end phone. Once again, with a $179.99 price point, this is expected. If you want a premium camera buy a premium phone.TL;DR: Excellent phone, excellent price.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid as a rock.", "Author": "Journeyman", "ReviewID": "R3UQNLEPBN9Y4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are great, upgrade to 4.2.3 Kit Kat without a hitch.

Yanes \"ChowKaiDeng\"", "ReviewID": "RRLXSXEZKZTX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Both my wife and I own Nexus 4 and we got a Moto G for our nephew just a few weeks ago, so this review will mostly compare the Moto G againts the Nexus 4.The short story is: If the Moto G would be in existence by the time we got our Nexus 4 about a year ago, I would definitely preferred the Moto G over the Nexus 4. The reason: it's price.DESIGNThe Moto G design, although a little thicker than the Nexus 4, it's absolutely beautiful. Most $200 Android phones feel \"cheap\" but this is not the case. Materials are great and the curved back it's really great to hold. Buttons (volume rocker and on/off) do a satisfying \"click\" when they are pressed.Its screen it's a little smaller than the Nexus 4, but that's precisely a plus for me: I have regular-to-small hands and I can't completely reach the other side of the screen with my thumb when holding the Nexus 4. The Moto G feels a lot better in my hand and has a screen big enough to comfortably browse the web, read a book or watch a show.BATTERY LIFE AND PERFORMANCECompared to the Nexus 4, the Moto G battery life is WAY MUCH BETTER: With the Nexus 4, I need to charge my phone every night and sometimes even charging it a little bit via USB while at the office. The Moto G battery can easily reach 2 days without a charge... of course, this depends on how much do you use it, but I'm talking about \"normal\" use.About the performance, the Moto G does a really impresive job, almost as fast as the Nexus 4 (they both have Quad Core processors, but the Nexus 4 has +1GB RAM). You won't feel any lag, at all, while using this phone.CAMERAFirst, let's be clear about something: both the Nexus 4 and the Moto G have \"regular\" cameras. They do not have top-notch cameras as other phones. But on the other hand, they are also two of the cheapest (and better built) Android phones in the market. This phones have cameras good enough for everyday use. If you need a really, really, good camera, you could just pay more than three times the price of a Moto G in order to get an iPhone 5S or something like that.That said: The only thing I would prefer of my Nexus 4, it's the camera, which has more manual settings and a better interface than the Moto G. That doesn't mean the Moto G camera is not good: if I had a Moto G, I would definitely and happily live with that camera.PRICEDid I say it already? This phone has the price that a smartphone should have, accesible and proportional to a piece of hardware that we carry in our pockets, everyday, that we can easily drop and brake, and at the end, it will go obsolete and won't be up to date with for the software specs in about 18 to 24 months.If you need a good Android phone that works fast, but you don't have a large bufget to expend, this is definitely your best choice.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good phone", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3ROABUH5K77RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At this price, if you are reasonable, you shouldn't ask for more.If you want a phone that offers connectivity of various kinds, not a computer or a game console or a DSLR, then this is definitely good enough.If you are a heavy gamer, then you should probably consider more expensive phones -- a price any heavy gamer should pay, as you would do for your graphics card on your desktop.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "reasonable price", "Author": "Ranjan Kumar", "ReviewID": "RY6TAXGRPS04X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the phone looks good and and having most of the futures.

Then you will also need to download a Widget app called \"HF Button\" to be able to hear radio from its speaker phone.What I really like about this phone is its perfect size. It is possible to operate it with one hand. It is bit heavier than my Nexus 5, but feels very sturdy.My only regret is the quality of camera. Pictures are not sharp and light in the background distorts entire picture.

Haven't tried taking pictures outdoor as I have a camera I take pictures with, but indoor looks decent (5MP). The build feels solid and not heavy at all. Also, startup time is very fast, and I like the Assist feature. One downside: there's still no native file manager built in, so you'd have to install a file manager app (should be a quick fix), and installing customized ringtones can be difficult if one isn't too familiar with computer technology.

Or on another day, i called for 2-3 hours, text few messages and mails, listened for 6 hours of music from soundcloud (headphones, via edge/g3) and still managed to get home 12 hours later with 27% on battery (which is pretty damn decent imo)I rly loved my previous phone, moto defy, but it started to fall apart (hw and sw - i dropped it like 100times without anything breake loose, but the cover was pretty worn out...) and i really wanted this phone... And this device is really different class. The major change i've noticed (since my last phone) is that the wifi module does not drain battery like on defy did (i can leave it on all the time and still manages to hit 24 hours with ~40% of battery). The wifi module on defy rly drained power (didn't matter if it's connected to some network or not).Camera:About the cam, sure it's a weaker one, but i don't really care about that: 1) it's way better than it was on my defy and 2) i have nice nikon with good lences...Performance:It's unbeliveably fast (for it's hw)... For this cost you'll get something like last (cr)apple or nexus s4 (i'm not talking about performance in games - i haven't tested that, just normal multitask/swaping between apps, running music on backgroud, videoplayback etc).Back repro & calls quality:The repro is also good, thought it might be a bit louder (which might bother somebody). Sometimes i notice slight distortion in sound, but it happens only in 1 crappy game (and i think it's the games fault)Droid:It came with v4.3 and not even a minute after first boot up it asked me about v4.4 update (+ another small patch after that), so the ota updates works even in country without motorola support).I'm using this phone in west eu (czech rep), o2 provider and it works without any errors (i checked the frequencies).I hope my summary helped...", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast loud speakers", "Author": "Slayerpsp", "ReviewID": "R2FZ6SO7P6J8VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone works good on AT&T; May not be 4g but down loads are real fast nice screen just a great phone for the price", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "bang for bucks", "Author": "Kalpak Raval", "ReviewID": "R2X6ZYULYWLKFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice purchase; fit for our need.

I'll start this review by saying that i've read so many reviews and critics about this phone. So have you, I guess. But I'm writing this review after 2 weeks of hard core using this phone. This is what i think:1.- Camera: The camera is a good camera, better than any 5mp camera i've used. Nice perfomance at morning or high iluminated places. At night the perfomance is not that bad, it's true that it's not the same but the flash does its job. For social media: instagram, snapchat and all thoses it's just great :)  (With a 3rd part app like cymera the camera gets better) 6/10.2.- Battery: In these two weeks I've been playing Asphalt 8, reproducing music, using google now and chatting (WhatsApp and BBM) The autonomy of the battery has been \"enough\". I mean, i'd like a bit more, but we're talking 4hrs of screen display while playing such a core game like Asphalt 8. I have not tried how many screen hours it lasts w/o playing or reproducing music. But I assure you that if you're not a hard core user you will get 7 screen hours and of course, even if you are, by the end of the day your phone will be still alive :) 8/10.3.- Perfomance: Can't complain. I can play any game I want, I can run as many apps as I want, I can switch from any app to another quickly and easily. I'm not giving a 10 just because sometimes when I'm playing Asphalt, if I recive a phone call, once it is finished, The game app restarts and that's normal, but it's something that Android Should improve and not Motorola. (It happens even with Galaxy s3) 9/10.4.- Design: I like the fact that they designed a space on the back cover so we can put our finger on it and it's very comfortable. But I don't like the frames. I think that there's an useless space on the lower one and I don't like it. But this phone is highly accurate on its designed. I mean, the back cover is curved so we don't have to neccesarily put the phone upside in order to listen to music. (I'm missing more colors on the notification LED)  8/10.5.- Others (Display, storage..) The Display is the best thing about this phone. It is beautiful 720p that with a 4.5\" screen gives us a high quality view that some 1080p screens dont give to us. Storage? 8gb are ENOUGH for me!  I mean, this phone supports OTG. I have Asphalt (1.5gb game) on the phone, and more apps like Subway Sufers, Whatsapp, bbm, youtube, snapchat, dolphin, cymera, mega, marca and more...) and lots of pictures and i still have 1gb remaining. You have 50gb free on Google Drive and if you don't like drive you also have mega for android that does almost the same thing with 50gb free too. Recording videos will take all your memory, so you should move then to a sd card and take advantage of the OTG support.  If you want more, go for the 16 gb version, but 8 gb (5.5) are enough if you know how to use them.  10/10Conclussions:There's no phone in the market better than this one comparing prices. It gives the perfomance of a high end phone and you pay for a low range phone. If you don't need the best camera ever you should buy this phone.Extra:Moto G has nano-coating so if the phone gets wet it will not die. (You don't believeme, do you?) Search on youtube, you will see :):)More?Yes! There's more. Buy the phone and you will see. Im very happy, happiest person in the word when i received my phone and it was actually more than I expected. As i Said.

I will continue reviewing this phone in the next couple time using it.Second thing, the length of charging wire is quite short and I don't know why the input charger is not fit with the fone. Which means the phone not fit to the head wire input when I do charging, there still has a short distance between the head of a charger and the output hole of the phone.

(And no, T-Mobile doesn't sell them...)He said that you aren't going to find a more feature packed phone at such a low price than this. He said that Google (Who owns Motorola) is more interested in getting these phones into more people's hands than they are in making money from the phones. Of course the more people carrying these phones that are browsing the internet are likely going to product ad revenue for Google, so they do have their motives. They make their money off the back-end. Much like Microsoft and the Xbox. Microsoft actually loses a bit of money on each Xbox because they're counting on making their money on the games.The end result is that you can get a great phone at near manufacturing costs.I got the 16GB US version, and while I do wish it had more than 1GB of RAM, everything in the user interface runs quickly, and and the animations are very smooth. The display, while not huge, looks very good.

I recently found that no contract, prepaid plans are great if you do the right research, and this little phone is one of the cheapest unlocked phones you will find. I can do everything on the Moto G that I could do on my iPhone 4s. The battery is much better... with mixed usage I usually get 24-48 hours before I need to charge. The processor is pretty speedy and the screen is absolutely beautiful. The cons I have found is the camera is not the most spectacular and the phone does not have 4G LTE. Those are certainly two things you should consider with buying this phone. For me, the camera is not something that I use very often and if I do it's not for very important pictures. Also, I am on Wifi 95% of the time and my 4S did not have 4G LTE... so I don't even know \"what I'm missing.\" Speakers are pretty decent and I'm pleased when I hook this up to my auxiliary port in my car to stream Pandora. I'm not a \"power user\" as my games are really simple (Words with Friends, Matching with Friends, Candy Crush, etc). I don't stream Netflix. I personally find that silly and love my two Rokus for streaming. If I'm not at home, I don't need to be watching movies, but that's just me (as a full time nurse and part time student). I do use my phone to constantly keep up with work and personal emails, phone calls, Facebook, texting, and browsing. Unless you are a gamer, super streamer, or just need to meet the status quo, I believe that this phone would be fine for 90% of the population. However, you must do your research.Some other Android Perks:I love how the calendar app integrates with my Google Calendar (something I always wanted with the iPhone). Also, I can download and attach files in emails... I was either never able to figure out how to do that on the iPhone or you can't. Also, you can download your own apps to customize the phone to pretty much look however you want. Also, you can download a Do Not Disturb app that lets you customize different times for different days. I was never able to do that with iOS because you picked a time and it was set for every day. I work night shift 3 days per week, so my disturb hours vary depending on if I'm on a day or night schedule.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my choice and I will not be going back to iOS anytime soon.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "buy it.", "Author": "Jared Drury", "ReviewID": "R2X9O69T39ZP8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone for the price.

Suffice it to say that the OS is clean, free of bloatware, and has been running smooth as glass for me.On the hardware side, I want to give a big high-five to Motorola and Google for producing such as well made product.  This is a solid piece of equipment.  Buttons work well, touch-screen is responsive, no hiccups from the processor when running programs, etc.  I'm getting used to the screen size having come from a much smaller phone, but after only a few weeks it seems to be just right.  Form factor fits in my average size hands well.  Sound is great from speakers, and earbuds.  If I had to search for a con, it would be that the phone is a little more slippery than my last device.  No drops yet, but I worry.  If this is a concern for you it's a quick fix with the myriad of shell options either directly from motorola or from an after-market manufacturer.I hope this unlocked phone is the first step in the right direction on untangling the hardware from the mobile phone companies, allowing a greater freedom in choice (and lower prices) for consumers.

This was the perfect choice. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as the more expensive flagship phones but it does its job very well. It runs very smooth and all of my apps run fine on it. The only time it gets jerky is when I have six or seven things going at once, but usually that's a result of me forgetting to close out unused apps. It has wifi, bluetooth, a nice speaker for speakerphone, audio quality is clear for both incoming calls and outgoing calls (my wife has one as well and I hear her well when we speak). The screen is clear and responsive. It feels sturdy and well built.One thing I really love about this is that it comes with Quick Office. So I can make spreadsheets and word documents on the go. I usually track my expenses on my phone throughout the week until I have time to update my budget at home. The spreadsheet software has many basic and even some more advanced functions for people who like spreadsheets.The only thing I wish it had was voice control. It's difficult to call people when I'm driving because I have to search their name in the phone book via typing or use the voice search which works moderately well with names. This is not a huge deterrent to the phone but rather a better deterrent of me not paying attention to the road.The camera is not for photograph enthusiasts as it takes only mediocre quality pictures but it's good enough to just have a snapshot of the moment or to share on Facebook.All the complaints I have about the phone is something that can be resolved by buying a more expensive phone. But given my applications, it's not worth it to pay the extra $300-$400 for a more expensive phone that makes my life just a hair more convenient.Also did I mention that the battery lasts for over a day? From start to finish my battery has lasted up to 30 hours. That was with light to moderate use. I sent text messages the majority of the time, talked for maybe an hour, and used the internet for a couple hours at home and a couple youtube videos.Great phone. Huge bang for the buck.

The phone also has water-repellant coating, but don\u2019t read too much into that\u2014the ports are open, so it\u2019s not like you can use it in the rain. Drops don\u2019t affect the phone either. For most people, it\u2019s comfortable to hold it in one hand and use. But what bothers me are the large bezels. It\u2019s got a smaller screen than most phones at this price, but Motorola still insists on using virtual touchscreen buttons taking up valuable screen space while having a 1.5cm bezel under it that\u2019s just wasted space.The bezel and virtual buttons mean that you aren\u2019t getting the full 4.5 inches of promised screen space. That said, the screen is sharp and reproduces true colors. It has Gorilla Glass 3 scratch protection, and while it\u2019s not clearly legible in direct sunlight, it\u2019s not bad either. The Moto G can go toe-to-toe with any other smartphone in this price range.The Moto G is available in either 8GB or 16GB capacities.PROS:The whole package. Look at what the Moto G offers, look at its price, and then look at the other handsets which cost the same amount.It exceeds its rivals in several key areas, from the well defined 4.5-inch display to its 1.2GHz quad-core processor and Android 4.4 KitKat operating system. There's a lot to love about the Moto G for its price.You could easily be fooled into thinking that the Moto G costs the same as the Galaxy S4 Mini and the One Mini - even web browsing is impressive on the handset.CONS:It's simple. Motorola must have cut some corners to get the price of the Moto G so low, and the camera is one area which has seen the compromise.The 5MP lens is simply not up to the job and my photos either came out blurry, grainy or both, while the camera app itself will be far too basic for some.The lack of expandable memory will be a real bug bear for some, especially if you end up with the 8GB model and it's missing the more recent tech advances in the form of NFC and 4G.FINAL VERDICT:The Moto G is a top notch, low cost smartphone and I wholeheartedly recommend this as the best budget mobile currently on the market.I was genuinely impressed with the feature set on the Moto G, so if you're looking for a low cost phone you can stop searching - just go out and grab a Moto G right now.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "moto g", "Author": "jl black", "ReviewID": "R3ONZYS9406XN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best smartphone at its price, very good specs and snappy fast, good screen and had no problems with games great", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone", "Author": "JJReyes", "ReviewID": "R1EJ9KM8JUJHFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a Christmas present for my mom.

So much so, that I ended up surprising my dad with a Moto G as well.Spring forward 3 months and I am convinced this was an excellent Christmas gift. My parents love the phone. The bright screen is easy to read and the phone is fast!  It updated to Android KitKat as soon as we powered them on and the layout is easy to use. After helping them set up their phones (mom is on ATT Go Phone and dad is on Family Mobile) I was very impressed with their phones. I have an iPhone 4 and the Moto G put that to shame. When my parents visited in February I kept using my dad's Moto G instead of my iPhone. It was do much faster and handled Google maps like a champ!I read other reviews dinging the camera but my folks have taken some really good pics with their phones.

First, the phone was delivered like 3 days before the estimated date range which it was awesome. I can't believe this phone is 199 Dollars. Motorola did a great job with this one! You can't get something better even with 100 dollars more. I'm actually playing GTA San Andreas in this phone and every game runs smooth. The sound.. the sound is very LOUD and clear! It's the best speaker sound i've heard in an Android phone. I like the screen and it's so comfortable in your hands cause it's like a lil curved. It comes with Jelly Bean and as soon as connected to WIFI it updated to Kit Kat. 2 Days later i got an update from Motorola to fix little problems. You don't have to wait like Samsung Android Smartphones to get a newer Android version when they want to, this is direct from Google. It's fast! Quad Core, i would like it to have 2 GB of Ram instead of 1 GB but it haven't been an issue! I have played the most heavy games in this phone.A week later i lost it in a public transport. I was very upset of loosing this beauty but then i got it because the person who took it called me to deliver it back and she did.

This phone allowed both my husband and I to get a brand new smartphone for $400 instead of spending $1000+ or having to sign on to 2 year contracts with our provider.  As far as I can tell these phones are every bit as good as my friends and family's phones.  I'm still learning how to use to to the fullest extent, but have used the texting, email, several games and the GPS system and I'm very impressed.  I'm not an expert, but it does everything I want and amazingly well.  I was a little concerned that it only ran on 3G, but it's just as fast as my friend's iphone.  I'm told that it's due to the fact that the Moto G has such a fast operating system...KitKat?  Anyhow, I recommend it -- it has only been 2 weeks so we'll see how it goes from here!", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Smartphone for an Excellent Price", "Author": "Zachary Ball", "ReviewID": "R1ADQDYAE4QCFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is coming from someone who has never used a mid-level smartphone before, so my review may be somewhat biased when compared to those familiar the highest end smartphones on the market. I can say with complete honesty that I can find no major downsides to this device. It is a fantastic and powerful smartphone that would suit the needs of pretty much anyone looking for a good Android device.Pros :-Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Lower system requirements ultimately means a much smoother performance than previous versions of Android, and that is certainly true of the Moto G. I've yet to run into any major hiccups with this device in any apps.- Rock-solid build quality and design. Motorola nailed it with this device, taking the majority of design features from their flagship Moto X. Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 and Motorola's water-resistant nanocoding (watch a video here of the Moto G withstanding 30 minutes underwater with no damage : [...]) make for a quite durable smartphone that will hold up to some wear and tear.- Technical specifications. For as low as $179, you get a quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU with an Adreno 305 GPU, which, again, amounts to buttery-smooth performance with just about any app or game. Sure, it's not the Snapdragon 800 present in more premium devies, such as the Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but it is far from slow in everyday usage.- Battery life. With a 2070 mAh (non-removable) battery, this phone will last you through the day with moderate usage.- Unlocked. No contracts here, just insert an active compatible micro-SIM and you're good to go.Cons :- The camera (for camera-savvy users). Personally, I like the 5-megapixel camera on this device, coming from a device with a measly 2 megapixel shooter. The front-facing 1.2 mp camera and LED flash are nice additions too. However, users looking for excellent photographs with vivid colors and great low light performance may want to look elsewhere. For the average user, however, the camera will not be a problem.Overall, this device outperforms anything else in the price bracket, especially similarly-priced Samsung devices. Motorola hit the nail on the head with the Moto G, and I would recommend this device to just about anyone looking for an excellent smartphone at an excellent price.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I freaking love it!", "Author": "Pritam Sai Mekala", "ReviewID": "RC5TXJ4FREWJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a college student, that being said there is no need to emphasize on my terrible financial status.

Couldn't afford the X, so I bought the Moto G. What an excellent value! Ergonomics are very good. The phone feels good in the hand. Wish the controls on the side were slightly more rounded. Display is a very clear 4.5 inches. Not as big as the other flagship models, but still very good size. The rear facing speaker doesn't have a tremendous range, but the volume is more than adequate. Battery time is excellent on previous phones, I'd need to charge at some point in the day. I get a full day with a fair amount of time using text, email, Facebook.I'm not a gamer, so I can't comment on that. The camera is decent, but not great. In good light, it takes very nice pics. In low light it is very grainy and the flash makes pics look bad. Probably the biggest concern I had was the data connection. The Moto G only comes with G3 connectivity instead of the faster LTE. I find this really isn't much of an issue. Most of my time I use WiFi, and when I'm not, the G3 does just fine streaming video and music. For software, the Moto G comes with the latest version of Android, 4.4.2, Kit Kat. Where pretty much all the other phone makers have customized the appearance and functions of their phones, Motorola has a nearly stock appearance. You can tailor the appearance and functions to your taste.  Android has improved tremendously in recent versions. I especially appreciate Google Now. Since the Moto G comes direct, not through the carrier, there is almost no Bloatware. This saves room on the phone and doesn't slow it down. I strongly recommend spending the extra money for the 16GB version of the Moto G. The Moto G isn't the perfect phone. Its faults, though, are only minimal, and the speed, display, near stock Android experience, and exceptional price make buying the Moto G a no brainer.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am Impressed", "Author": "T.

Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice.

It feels good in your hand not too big, not to small, not too heavy, not too light.  The processor is very zippy.  I hardly ever experience lag even with several apps running at once.Very impressed with the value.  My last cell phone lasted me years and i have resisted buying a new one because I asked myself \"Is that really necessary?\"  The answer was no almost every time.  However, when this phone came out at this price.  It was just worth it.Pros:Feels great in the hand and in your pocket.Powerful Quad-core processorGood Battery Life.Looks great and customizableBest bang for your buck (No other phone comes close)Cons:No expandable memoryBattery is not-removableNo 4G or LTE (but was it even necessary in the first place? You can still stream movies with 3G. Why would you need more speed?)I feel like the cons aren't even bad.  They aren't really that big of a deal.  The camera is still as good as an affordable point and shoot.  16 gigs, which I believe is 10-12 gigs, after the phone's applications, is still decent.  I would not recommend the 8 gig version it's just not enough space. Consider the fact that it will probably be 4-5 gigs with the operating system.  Even having just a few apps will leave you only with a gig or two left over for any video/photo recording and music/movie content. You are only saving $20.  Not worth it at all in my opinion.I'm absolutely in love with this phone. 5/5 starsRecommended for anyone not wanting to spend $300-$600 on a new phone while still having something powerful in your pocket.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "cell excellent price / performance", "Author": "Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Torres", "ReviewID": "R1CNDOTMDHZ5SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "cell excellent price / performance, no complaints this updated version of android kit kat, goes very well in applications that probe, it may not require much", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cheap phone in price, but not in quality", "Author": "Guille Ynsfr\u00e1n", "ReviewID": "RVOSUCJ6AK7W0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is simply awe, you pay very little for what you get.

I read as many review as possible and finally decided to give Moto G a shot considering it is the cheapest among the three I have in my mind. My biggest worry about Moto G was that it comes with 3G where as the other two are 4G. My justification to go for Moto G (US GSM, 16GB) was that I do not use internet in my phone that much (mostly navigation, weather, reading, audio streaming, occasional Youtube and absolutely no game). To my surprise, 3G proved to be perfect for my need. Nevertheless, I checked the 3G speed (Queens, NY/ T-Mobile network) and I got download speed between 8-11 Mbps.Pros:1. Good call quality.2. Outstanding battery life. With wi-fi turned on for 50% of the time, and some average use (lots of software download/update, an hour of phone conversation), the battery lasted around 40 hrs.3. Free update to Kitkat is just awesome.Cons:1. No expandable memory (I find it hard to understand why a phone cannot have expandable memory).2. Several interface related aspects (Call, Contacts etc).

I pre-ordered this phone a week before it came out, and i got it the next week (bought directly from Motorola) and i am really loving this phone. For me having an unlocked phone has been going amazingly well. I have never had this phone freeze on me, and have not have had any force quits or ANYTHING AT ALL!!! that is amazing. Compared to my previous phone all of the specs were either an upgrade or the same hardware that i was used to (Previously had a Samsung Galaxy Fascinate, rooted and running AOPK 4.2.2 custom rom). This phone in the hardware department has been awesome, going from a single core cpu overclocked to 1.2 GHZ to a quad core cpu not overcloakced at 1.2 Ghz is a huge step forward for me. Also having a whole gig for ram is great for people like me that like to listen to FLAC files (FYI FLAC is a sound file like mp3 but FLAC is much higher quality) on the go. IN a summary I'd say for an unlocked phone with a quad core, more than adequate gpu, and a great battery life ( can go 2 days without charging with moderate use) this phone can not be simply beat.

This thing is light years ahead. I was worried about compatability with my network (tmobile) but it works flawlessly. I was also worried that not having 4G Internet speed would be an issue but so far I haven't noticed any difference. Even with speed test app it is still very fast. FYI this phone can be used to create a mobile hotspot. I had to cut down my SIM card to fit this phone. There are directions online how to this and it was not hard to do. I purchased a cheap rubber case for it because the phone is super slippery. I would definetly order something like this with the phone because you'll end up dropping it if you don't.Using the free Motorola app I was able to transfer all of my old phones info including photos to my new phone. Except some of my contacts didn't transfer. Luckily I used an online back up with my old phone so I just installed it on my new one and it automatically restored them. Would have been a major pain if I hadn't done this.Sound quality is a 9Camera is an 8Battery life is a 9 (so much better than my old phone)Design is a 8 (would be a 10 but the phone is very slippery and it's hard to tell which end is up on it)Value 10+I really can't see any reason why this wouldn't be all the phone someone needed.

My primary intention was to get an unlocked phone so I could ditch the contract paradigm, save money, and still enjoy reasonably good access to the Internet, email, and media while on the go. In the week since I've had it, it has managed to do all of these things (and then some) *almost* flawlessly.Yes, the battery could last just a bit longer - but 14+ hours off the charger is easily typical. The \"automatic\" setting for screen brightness is a bit dim in a lot of daytime settings, but one can always turn up the brightness when it's crucial, and the quality of the screen, as many reviewers have noted, is excellent. The quality of the camera is sub-par if you're comparing it to the typical point-and-shoot, but if you mostly use it for snapshots for sharing on social media sites, it's more than adequate. I have had a few apps crash or hang briefly when multiple apps are running, but in general, the navigation experience is silky smooth. I was just slightly bummed that it doesn't have a multi-colored notification LED, but that's inessential. Some people may find 16GB a bit small for non-expandable storage, but inexpensive cloud storage makes this much less of a concern.If it sounds like I'm making excuses for the Moto G, it shouldn't. I have been totally impressed with the performance of this phone from day one and consider each of these quibbles truly minor. Even at a higher price point, I would consider it well worth the money - but the fact that I've cut my monthly phone bill in half makes it a ridiculously good bargain, even though nothing about the Moto G from its build quality to its day-to-day performance feels like a \"budget\" phone.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awsome smartphone", "Author": "Noodlelover", "ReviewID": "RWXXFI3J3KWWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a grrrrrrreat smartphone which has everything you wish a smartphone owned.

I appreciate that it is not a 'flagship' phone--which, of course, is reflected in the price. If you must have the most powerful phone, then of course you have to pay for it. I was attracted to the idea of a 'pure Android' phone with updates as soon as they come available, and I was considering the Nexus 5. But I decided in the end that, for my use, it was really more phone than I needed. After researching the moto g, I decided it was just what I was looking for--and 3 weeks of use tells me I made the right choice!A little context--since one's user-experience of a phone is a relative thing. I was replacing a very antiquated phone, my first smartphone in fact--an LG Optimus V, circa 2011! (Clearly, I'm not a must-have-the-latest-gadget user.) The moto g is light-years ahead of what I'm used to, so it doesn't matter to me that I could spend 3 times as much and have an even faster processor, even sharper screen, or whatever. I'm amazed and thrilled that I can get this great phone for 200 bucks! The size is perfect (I find the Nexus 5 a little large), the screen is brilliant, the speed and smoothness of operation are great--even the camera, which I know is far from the best available, is a big improvement over my old phone. LTE is very limited in my area, so not having it is no real loss for me; and the greater power of the phone, over what I'm used to, makes 3G feel so much faster! And anyway, most of my day-to-day use is within reach of wifi.If you're looking for a new phone, you probably know what kind of user you are, how much of a premium you place on having the highest possible specs, or whatever. The moto g perfectly fills just the niche I was looking for!Btw, if you decide on the moto g and are looking for a minimalist sort of case, the Ringke Slim is really nice!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for this price", "Author": "viola chen", "ReviewID": "RZZ928VPML7I6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this cell phone and used for several days, it looks simple but beautiful.

Of course the trade off here is the price. Nothing can touch this phone in for price, it will cost you more to buy a used two year old Galaxy S3 than it will to get one of these brand new.

There's a slight delay when snapping pics, but not so much that it'd be a problem. The newest Android 4.4, KitKat is running so smoothly.  A feature I got to test out sooner than expected is the water-repellent nano coating. You see, I ordered a case and screen protector for it. When dry applying the screen protector yielded horrible results with bubbles, I decided to wet apply it despite it not being specifically a wet apply screen protector. I took some rubbing alcohol and and put it on the adhesive side, and then placed it on the screen sopping wet. I chose rubbing alcohol cause of the fast dry rate. I wasn't worried cause I knew of the water repellent coating.A word of warning though for T-mobile users who have a regular sized SIM card, this phone requires a micro-SIM card. I was pretty disappointed when I tried slipping it in, but I just took a trip to the nearest T-mobile store and they changed it to the micro-sim card free of charge(typically costs $10).

What Motorola pulled here is short of a miracle.If you're ordering this, you're basically getting a phone on a very similar magnitude as the Samsung Galaxy S3, (with half the ram if you're a US based customer, unfortunately- but Moto G's 1GB ram is still enough to do its job) with a lesser camera, no LTE and about double the real world use battery life. Due to the 'skin' on Motorola's version of Android being more or less nonexistent (it is there), they were able to pay more attention to things that really matter, like optimization of hardware components to the Android operating system. Which means in practically all real world usage scenarios the Moto G holds up quite admirably to anything you can expect from last-gen top of the line smartphones that still costs 500 to 600 dollars off contract.I'm what some people might call a power user. I always have a few heavy widgets, mostly pulling data from various mail/message/calendar/to-do service from the net running all the time on all my pages. Such services tend to be very RAM heavy and places strain on processing power and battery life. I also read heavily, text/email enough to write a small book per week, and have a nasty habit of trying to check out a new crop of Android games almost every week. Most modern smartphones doesn't really last more than six or seven hours under my usage pattern during a workday. Moto G, on the other hand, does not fall behind on the performance front, and still delivers around a full day- that's 24 hours, not a 'business day'-of usage, screen time around four to six hours, higher if I'm not doing anything too processor intensive, and remain within wifi zone like my work place.Granted, sometimes I miss the ability to download things at LTE speeds, but I think I'm willing to trade slower (but certainly serviceable) data transfer speeds over freedom of being away from charger as long as I want without nary a compromise.I've shopped around for quite a bit, and I'm pretty confident that Moto G is about the only phone that delivers such level of performance and longevity at the price point. Competitors from Samsung and Sony at $200 off contract price level can't hold a candle to what this little beast can handle.

After over an hour being wasted (35 minutes in a chat with some unqualified personnel then 25 minutes on hold to finally 5 minutes speaking with a Level 2 tech support) the response was the phone's software was corrupted and would have to be returned.Being an international customer this is a difficult pill to swallow but even hard resetting was unsuccessful. Fortunately Amazon's customer service was much better than Motorola's and my phone was replaced within a week unfortunately with the extra charges to ship and clear another phone I could have afforded something better.I found it unfortunate that even the technician said he does not encrypt his phone because of how unstable the process is. I find it pitiful to offer a service that isn't properly functional or tested. On my Nexus 7 the encryption was activated and successfully performed. Motorola still has some ways to go but overall the phone is worth the price just the caution and paranoia factor needs to be taken into consideration especially if you're an international customer.Hope to see bigger and better things from the company with Google backing it and let's hope my problem was a fluke and everyone else has a high performing product.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent Phone", "Author": "Marco", "ReviewID": "R1AC6WIMC9PAYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this phone.

I like unlocked phones because it gives me the freedom to choose phone carriers and not be locked in for two years.  The phone is good. I like the size, and the most important aspect is the making and receiving calls is clear and easy to hear.  I like phones that are logical and easy to use, and this phone after a few weeks is ok. I like the FM radio aspect to listen to News and music as well.  The camera is decent enough for taking not too complicated pictures. I'm an average phone user, and I noticed that the battery lasts about a day. The OS takes a lot of battery to run. Not too good!Google operating system is another issue.  I have doubts.  It reminds me of Mircosoft.  There are constant updates and it's tiresome, and tedious to reveiw each one and I usually just click yes to all of them.  I noticed that with the updates, I get spam mail. It could be from Motorola, or a third party somehow, but I believe it comes from Google.  It's annoying. I paid for a phone, not to have Google bombard me with unwanted adds.  I think is sneaky and low clase.  My Mac is a Closed Universe, and I rarely get updates and I never get spam.  Google is constantly trying to get me to sign up for Google plus, G mail, and Chrome. I see their reasoning, but I prefer not to be dependent with Google.  I was initially, before buying a Google software, an admirer of Google. The owners, the competitive edge, and ease to googling something.  Now, with the OS system, it's constant updates and spam.  I paid for a phone. I don't need sale pitches. I'm no longer a big fan of Google OS on cells. My service provider is AT&T; pay as I go.  It's  ok. I too get unwanted spam from AT&T.;  The service is good, and easy to use every month. No drop calls.Overall, Good phone, but bad battery in my opinion.

The dual sim 16gb version was not listed on Amazon.  It's a brilliant phone.  I wanted dual sim because I travel in Europe quite a bit and wanted both USA and UK or France pay-as-you-go sims installed.  The dual sim feature works perfectly.  While the camera isn't great, I don't use the phone as a camera except in rare quick shot situations as I use a full feature Canon G16 for the majority of my photography.The display on the Moto G is outstanding.  The sound is plenty good enough.  Added my three ringtones that I like and am good to go.If you don't need more than 16 gb (about 12 gb of which is available) or a high end camera, this phone would be very tough to beat for the price (or at any price).I am not a heavy app or music user, so 16 gb is plenty for my needs.  I have loaded up the music and apps I want and still have about 7 gb remaining. Poweramp is my music app and Power Casts is my podcast player.  Use DuckGoGo app for searching - love it.  Added the Currency app, a Paris metro router, and a London tube router.  Data Enabler app and Quick Settings app are must have (for me).  Easy Voice Recorder app and GO Contacts app complete my app lineup.LOVE this phone.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent phone.", "Author": "C.

I ordered this phone from Amazon and had my uncle bring it with him when he came home to the Philippines.On the evening I got my Moto G, I immediately turned it on and it upgraded to Kitkat right away so that saved me the trouble. I downloaded all my favorite apps and fiddled around with it a bit. The phone was snappy and very responsive and spent the evening watching Youtube and browsing through my favorite sites.The trouble started when I left for work and had to rely on my mobile data network. I would intermittently lose my 3G signal a couple of times an hour. When I get absolutely no signal, I would have to turn airplane mode on and off or I would have to restart the phone for it to work. This solution is only temporary though.The problem happens when I make calls too. The phone would ring for a bit before my calls drop and get a message saying that I am out of service area. Sometimes, I'm not able to make a call at all because I am told that my phone in in airplane mode even though it isn't. As usual, I had to turn airplane mode on and off before my Moto G becomes temporarily usable.I had my sim card replaced twice and changed my service to a postpaid one to try to fix the problem. Nothing happened.It seems that this problem is caused by the Kitkat upgrade, as evidenced by the number of people having the same problem after upgrading their android version.I bought a phone and got a crappy one. It's a fast and responsive wifi device but I didn't drop $200 for that, that's why I got a Nexus 7.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really good phone, especially for the money.", "Author": "Bill Bayard", "ReviewID": "R3S3FHRQM6NVUY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not the best camera and I usually have an aversion to phones that do not have removeable batteries, but due to the price & all the good things I kept reading about it, I couldn't pass this up and I'm glad I didn't. It's a good phone. Gotta say though that I was not impressed by the Motorola customer service. When I was exploring new phones, it took 2 weeks for them to get back to me to answer one question despite their site stating I would have an answer within 48 hours. A few days after they finally got back to me with a non-answer, I was sent a survey that asked, \"How are we doing?\". Not so good. After deciding to purchase it anyway, I was then repeatedly not able to purchase it through their website as they wouldn't take my credit card, though everyone else does. I almost went with another phone, but finally went with the Moto G and purchased it from Amazon with the same credit card that Motorola wouldn't accept. They still got my money, but they will never hear a good word come out of my mouth about their company or their website, though I will support this product.

I dropped my lg google nexus four and broke both the screen and the touch sensor.  Cost to fix? $220.  I can't be without a smart phone but I'm on a tight budget.  Asking around, I learned that this phone had just been released and I was able to get it shipped from amazon in two days along with a case for $230.  Most of my stuff was in the cloud, there are only a few pictures and mp3s missing.  I was up and running in no time.Motorola has left the stock android more or less in tact.  I was able to start talkback at the registration screen without sighted assistance and set up the entire phone eyes-free.  I don't use much of the bundle software and need to find a way to remove it.  For some reason, motorola is using all of the stock apps except for an email app which I haven't touched, and a calendar app which is almost, but not exactly like unto google calendar.  in the moto calendar nockoff, the appointment views are inaccessible to googles accessibility features.  I installed google calendar and all is well except for having redundant apps on my phone storage.I'm getting about 18 hours out of the battery.  My usage amounts to a tonne of phone and skype audio calls, constant tethering of several other devices using portable wifi hotspot, checking email about an hour a day using mail droid, and experimenting with apps for various tasks.  Right now I'm beginning to explore the idea of smart phone as a laptop replacement.  That's some pretty heavy use.As a blind user, I'm running talkback and acapella speech and using the entire phone eyes free with the screen brightness at 10 per sent.  The keyboard is just a bit slow, but that's the only performance break I've found so far and it was the same on my old nexus four.The camera isn't as good as the one on my old nexus but it's still plenty good enough for OCR and object recognition.  The one feature that is really missing which was the same on my nexus four, is micro SD support.  I have a few other accessories such as a tablet and an mp3 player that I want to exchange large files with using SD.  I think that even once I start adding accessories like a keyboard and micro usb SD reader this will still be a superb bargain of a phone.

Screen is surprisingly clear and bright, i would say better than any smartphones that are priced below USD300.2. Minimalistic - easy to use (could be a downside too coz many shortcuts are skimped too!)3. Good weight and good to hold. It feels like it costs USD400 at least.Cons:1. Weak camera, sucks bad in fact.2. Cheap and flimsy unlock and volume rocker button.3. Wifi receiver is a bit weak, im having 3 bars of reception (out of 4 bars) despite am just 2 feet away from my router. I have full bars with my S4 and iPhone 4 at the same distance.4.

Based on price, the Moto G competes with the low-end of smartphones, and outperformes them by far. Based on specs, it contends with the midrange and underprices them by far.I hope Motorola will release a 7-8\" tablet with the same philosophy in the near future.* Good screen. Auto-brightness works great.* Mostly smooth performance.* Solid build quality and soft-touch back make it pleasant to hold.* Tolerable size and weight.* Battery life: for me, with wi-fi on, mobile data off, a few hours of Feedly, Chrome, Gmail and cloud each day, it lasts 2-3 days. Though, in 4.4.2 Kitkat, the 'battery saver' option won't stay on anymore, nor does it activate automatically when it's supposed to.The bad:* Low capacity built-in storage and no memory card support is a bad combination. For this reason I still have to carry along my 32 GB iPod touch (I don't have unlimited internet access all the time everywhere to rely on Google Play Music). There's a dual-SIM version so there's room for a memory card!* Flimsy, rattly buttons that are also too thin. Chrome-painted plastic has always been tacky.* Horrible camera. The pictures look more like impressionist paintings rather than photos.* The three onscreen buttons at the bottom take up space; I'd rather have capacitive buttons outside the screen as for example on Samsungs.* Tweezers are needed to remove the SIM card.* Defects I found in my unit: Couple of hot pixels in the camera sensor that spoil every shot. Screen backlight bleeding in one of the corners.The ugly -- regarding Android:* The Android UI is unpolished, confusing and unattractive (the icon for contacts is just ghastly). There is an overwhelming number of settings scattered all over the place, it's hard to get a hold of it. Some transition animations are unintuitive, e.g. the 'back' button and 'back' icons point to the left, but the corresponding animations zoom out. Nearly all icons are outdated and fugly. Most areas of the UI are unwelcoming black with tasteless sci-fi blue accents, e.g. the launcher, keyboard, settings app, calculator, clock app, gallery; they look like something that was probably regarded as high-tech and cool in the '90s.* System updates are rolled out with delay and even then too slowly. 4.4.2 Kikat has been available for the Moto G in the US since Dec 19, my device got it on Jan 15.* Wakelock bugs (Phone app, Mediaserver) -- they can consume a lot of battery power. Could only fix them with factory reset.* Dodgy text selecting and jumpy scrollbars.* Native document support is severely limited.If you feel like my review is not helpful to you, feel free to comment on what you disagree with.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Suddenly Restarts", "Author": "andy emilio", "ReviewID": "R2BU8I0UAZP4QH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Suddenly Restarts and google now just open when  am watching a video.

It's responsive, call quality is good, apps run quickly and smoothly. It's a great phone.My one major issue is that the sound quality when plugging headphones or a stereo into the 3.5 mm jack is HORRIBLE. I use my phone a lot to stream music into my home and work stereo. I first plugged my work stereo into this phone and right away could tell that something was way off. Bass is too loud and very muddy, vocals are drowned out, entire parts of the music just seem to be missing. I thought it might just be the stereo, so I plugged in at home and got the same bad result. Plugged in a set of headphones and sure enough, sludge-y bass and no balance. I then went back and plugged in my old HTC Evo just to make sure it wasn't me. Nope. The Evo was crisp, clear, and well balanced.I've tried installing a couple equalizer apps, but nothing seems to get the sound right.So, buyer beware, if you listen to a lot of music through your phone, this may not be the one for you.EDIT 2/7/14:After playing around with the phone a bit, I discovered that there's actually a built-in equalizer with some presets. The phone comes shipped with the \"Bass Punch\" preset on, PLUS a sound effect called \"3D stereo\" AND a \"live\" surround effect. These effects sound TERRIBLE. But you can turn the effects off and then you have a usable music output. WHY OH WHY OH WHY Motorola would ship this phone with these awful sound \"enhancements\" turned on by default is beyond me. I was hours away from returning the phone before discovering these settings.I am not an audiophile, nor a music snob, the music quality is really THAT bad before you \"fix\" it by turning off these effects.Anyway, I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars now that I know the music issue is fixable.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1OIMQWEI2FI4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Moto G has a nice bright large screen.

You really are getting a lot for sub-$200: a fully-unlocked, well-spec'd, up-to-date (Android Kitkat is an easy download away), svelte-looking smartphone. And if you get the US version, you get the T-Mobile AWS band that gives you great data speeds in most US urban metro areas.Why only 3 stars? This phone has some issues that make using it day-to-day somewhat frustrating. Before I bought this I was using a Nokia Lumia 521 and thought the Moto G would blow it out of the water. But the Lumia 521 holds it's own against this pretty well.Biggest Issues with the Moto G:-- poor touch sensitivity. The Moto G is not easy to type on. Too easy to hit the wrong letter, link, etc. Yes, I did try alternate Android keyboards (I've settled on Swiftkey). Nonetheless, has me longing for the physical qwerty boards of yesteryear. I'm also spoiled by the Lumia 521 -- it far exceeds the Moto G in this regard. The stock keyboard is a joy to use, incredibly accurate, and is even very workable while wearing thick cotton gloves. Night and day difference.-- poor wifi sensivity. Moto G drops wifi connection while all my other devices (including Lumia 521) are showing full-strength. Or Moto G barely holds connection to the point that nothing (web, Google Maps) will load, yet it won't switch over to 3G data connection (which happens to be quite strong where I live). Not ideal. Again, very noticeable how poor the Moto G's wifi radio is.-- earpiece volume lacking. Moto G earpiece sounds very weak and tinny compared to that on 521. I still use my phone as a phone and simple things like earpiece quality matter a lot.-- misleading connection status indicators. On a recent road trip through some rural areas where t-mobile service is spotty, brought along Moto G and Lumia 521. Both had fully-enabled tmobile micro-sims installed. At times in moving vehicle I found that the Moto G showed a strong 3g connection, but then if you tried to load any website or speedtest, you'd get a timeout or other failure. In some of these same areas/conditions, the Lumia 521 showed a 2G signal that did indeed work for calls. My testing is a bit unscientific, but the Lumia 521 seemed to more honestly display and more frequently update mobile connection status, leading me to believe that it better handles handoffs between 3G/2G and doesn't try to hold onto a weak signal that isn't really there.(edit: after doing some searches online it appears this might be an issue associated with android 4.4 kitkat. there are many reports online of connection issues with the moto g after it is upgraded to 4.4)All together these Moto G issues add up. Hence only three stars despite this phone being extraordinary in every other way.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone until battery is dead, then it's a dud", "Author": "LovesAmazon", "ReviewID": "R3ASEVYTO0X4TW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Motorola Moto G - US GSM - Unlocked - 16GBMy husband bought me this phone for Christmas. I love it--except... the battery was dead and the phone would not turn on when plugged in to car or wall charger. My husband says, \"Having a reliable cellphone is a matter of life and death.  The Moto G is not reliable and will leave you stranded when you need it most.  When you perform an Internet search for \"Moto G won't turn on\" you will see what I mean.  When a Moto G battery discharges, it will not turn on.  At all.  Even if plugged into a charger for hours.  It will not charge and it will not turn on.  This means that if you have an emergency, you cannot call for help.  If you need to look up a phone number so you can borrow someone else's phone to use to call for help, your Moto G will not show you the number you need.  No text, no voice, no email, no contacts, no kidding.The secret to getting it working is to leave it alone over night, not plugged in, not charging.  After 12 hours of idleness, when you finally plug it in, it might begin charging.  At this point, the Moto G is still useless.  It will not turn on even though it has a few percent of battery life and is plugged into a charger.  Finally, when it has about a 10% charge, the phone will allow you to turn it on.  I have used cellphones for over 20 years and until now, I have never had a phone that will not turn on when it is plugged into a car or wall charger.  If the battery of a Moto G does not have a few percent of battery charge, it will not turn on.  Period.  Further, it will not begin to take a charge unless it is allowed to rest at least over night.  Some people report it must rest (not plugged in, and with no buttons pushed) for 24 hours.

Most reviews were in favor and it seems like a good deal at $200/16GB compared to other brands/features. Once I got it on Monday 12/16 and I played around for a while the disappointment began to sink in. Signal strength seems a bit weak compared to other phones that I own, the function keys take about 1/2\" or the LCD screen real state and that's very annoying specially with plenty of space on the bottom of the unit (outside the screen), it looks like a 4\" display instead of the advertised 4.5\". The OS/UI lacks a few features that most users are used to see in Android. Lack support for 4G is another downside, but I knew about this before purchasing. Overall it's a good smartphone, well made and the idea of having an unlocked device that you can use with different GSM providers is very tempting, but Motorola and Google tried too hard to minimized features and options on this smartphone, in the end came too short for my expectations.

You will have data - but no voice.  You can walk out to the front yard, where the T-Mobile network will probably work, it's just you can't do voice calls inside the house.  Or at least I can't.  You will data because you have (presumably) Wi-fi, it\u2019s just that your wi-fi won\u2019t give you voice with this phone and T-Mobile.Is that somehow my failing?  I don't think so.  The vast majority of other T-Mobile phones have a small but key extra piece of circuitry in them that will allow you to do VOIP - which is voice over IP - which means that the audio signals in your phone can be somehow translated back-and-forth between digital and analog (or something to that effect) so that voice calls can go in and out of the web - and to the person you want to speak to or who wants to speak to you.Some people will have thin and spotty T-Mobile signal coverage in their homes and so it may work - it's just not guaranteed.And there\u2019s a possibility incoming calls into the interior of your home may work but initiating calls from your own end will be more difficult.So there are trade-offs to getting a good Android smartphone at $200.  I would assume that the Moto X (is it even on T-Mobile?) would not have this problem and that\u2019s because the Moto X is another smartphone that if you buy it outright, it will cost you $500-600.  Not $200.Personally I'll probably and regretfully have to return the phone.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Phone i had have..

Despite being a slightly larger phone, LG L9 feels smaller in your hand and is much easier to use.
