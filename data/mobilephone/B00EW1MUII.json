It now randomly shuts off and reboots.  It also sometimes has a hard time finding a signal in places I absolutely know a good signal exists.  I had a Motorola Razor for 6 years with no problems.  Our phones should not start breaking after a year, it's unacceptable.  As a result, I will never by a Samsung phone ever again.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Liked this phone", "Author": "Mary Carr", "ReviewID": "R1GMRM5HMQGBWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this phone for my husband because I already have one and was very satisfied with it.  We just wanted another simplephone for our basic phone plan. It is easy to use and has a qwerty keyboard. It has different features and it is made well. It also has the reliable name of Samsung. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a basic phone with no fancy phone plans.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "does the job for me!", "Author": "Jenny Barringer \"Suns Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R2WXFR19O4X74P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "you get what you pay for, I do not use my phone often  for talking but text quite a bit. This phone is fine, also it is a good starter phone for a child and I had previously sent my 10 year old grand daugher the same phone . This is my second Gravity and this new one seems to have stiffer keys when I text. It does not text as easily as my previous, but again, it is fine and for the price it is as expected. I would recommend it to somebody who is not into high tech gadgets :)", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seller good, Phone So So", "Author": "Lucy Soldwedel", "ReviewID": "R65PNG8XG3NRV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A definite step down from my former phone (LG UX9100) Fairly good battery Life.
