{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Epitome of bum rap", "Author": "Johnny Applesauce", "ReviewID": "R11TH6QN0ENNNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone never gets more than 3 stars anywhere you look. It's a shame that it mega-flopped, as it is currently my favorite phone. It is not a toy, nor is it very pretty, but it's also not fragile. I consider it a tool, and it's always there when I need it. On with the review.This phone is locked. There is no unlocked version of this phone, and as of now, there is no unlocking this phone. It is ATT ONLY. I actually use it with StraightTalk on the ATT network, and this has served me well. Don't buy this phone thinking you're going to be able to use it with a non-ATT sim, and you won't be disappointed.I will admit, it is buggy. Not Windows ME buggy, just beta buggy. Now and then, my browsers do disappear, along with gmail. This happens to me least with Firefox out of the many browsers I've sampled. In fact, I can't recall it happening with Firefox yet. A couple of times, the entire GUI disappeared and it appeared the phone may have cycled power, but I checked dmesg which reported an error and immediately after everything starts again. There is another bug where the phone slows to snail-like speeds after pushing the power/activate button and it does not seem to recover until reboot. This has happened to me 3 times so far. It should be noted I use this phone far more frequently than an average Joe would and I've had it for about 2 months at time of writing. The downtime caused by these bugs is nothing compared to the downtime of a broken phone, and most other phones aren't exactly bug-free either.So, why the 5 stars? Well, I've used many phones, and so far the ones that have lasted me through the toughest times are the super cheap ones, and this one. I bought the Motorola XT560 and had it only for a week when it met its demise in a puddle of water. It is a waterproof phone, but the battery cover pops open when it falls making it no longer waterproof, and seeing as how most contacts with water occur on a drop... you get the idea. My Terrain has since been through the same scenario a few times (I am extremely clumsy) and continued marching. I mention that because there are only 2 waterproof smartphones with keyboard even in the same ballpark of prices - this and the XT560. The XT560 had directional keys and a phone button and hang-up button, which this phone would do well to have, but that doesn't make up for the fact that the XT560 just doesn't hold its own in any other way.This phone also has a decent amount of power. If you want to play games on it, you can do that, though it's really not designed for it (small screen and whatnot). I only play Words with Friends, and it is inexplicably not in the play store for this phone (along with many others). One must download the apk from the depths of the internet. Battery life is fair. It was poor when I got it, but there was an option deep in the menus along the lines of \"Search for wifi when screen is off,\" that upon disabling, I began to get over a full day of power. The keyboard is decent, although the default software keyboard is buggy. I installed \"Null Keyboard\". Unfortunately, something on the phone is changing the setting back to the original every few days.One last thing to note is the phone uses a micro-sim. I did not know that before buying it and had to chop my old sim to bits with a template printed off the internet. I recommend buying a micro-sim card ahead of time, and a micro-sim to sim adapter, should you ever need to switch to a different phone that uses full size sims.To sum it up -pros:good keyboardwaterproofrugged (important)decent speedpricescratch resistant screen (I keep it in my pocket and still have zero screen scratches)cons:buggylockedsomewhere inbetweens:surprise micro-sim slot!not too visually appealing, though not bad enough to be called uglyDon't buy it if you're looking for a top of the line toy. Do buy it if you intend to use it as a tool.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't get unlocked cell as I buy", "Author": "Cesar A.

Most apps, including ones that are pre-installed(?!?!) don't work. The battery life is a joke-5 hours at the most, and the speed of the 4GLTE on this phone is no different from 3G IMO. I used to be able to open documents via google docs on a previous phone, but not this one. It does come with google maps (and this app works, but can't be updated), and that's a plus for me. But that's the only plus, and that's likely only going to be a plus for so long.Update September 16, 2013:  I had to return the phone.  I didn't return it due to the negatives in my previous review, but because of things much worse.  Somehow the alarm function got screwed up, and the alarm would go off earlier than when it was set.  Also, gmail and the Internet would continue to close unexpectedly.  I'd be in the middle of an email or web search and the window would close.  This happened frequently and it kept happening until I restarted the phone.  When I went to the AT&T; store, the customer service employees admitted that AT&T; has gotten these complaints frequently within the last few weeks and that the phone was probably not ready to be put on the market.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "\u5805\u7262\u6027\u3068\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u306f\u826f\u597d\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u5148\u9032\u6027\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30e1\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u7686\u7121\u3002", "Author": "YOSUKE W.", "ReviewID": "R1497EBI8G2CGI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think that it is entering the smartphone choices sufficiently inexpensive keyboard with smart phone If you want an extent that is used for business use and SNS.
