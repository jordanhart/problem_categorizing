{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Capacitive multitouch screen is very responsive - The LG T375 is a very user-friendly dual SIM phone", "Author": "Jeffrey A \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R3C5CYKMFHROQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG T375-RED is a dual SIM phone with a 3.2-inch capacitive LCD color display, 2-megapixel camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM radio and multimedia player.This phone has an easy to grip style - with rounded edges and measuring 4.06 x 2.32 inches and just 0.42 inches thick, it fits perfectly in my hand.WHY BUY A DUAL SIM PHONE?You can operate two phone numbers on one handset - from the same service provider or different service providers.By putting both SIM cards in the LG T375 handset, it's like having two phones in one.The LG T375-RED allows me to switch networks flawlessly without having to switch my SIM card - and with two different numbers it's easy to keep work and personal calls separated ON ONE HANDSET!PROS:The LG T375-RED has 50 MB internal storage and a micro SD card slot (up to 16 GB)Capacitive multitouch screen is very responsive128 MB ROM and 64 MB RAM is more than adequate for basic phone functionsThe phones offer GSM/EDGE connectivity along with Wi-Fi. You also get Facebook and Twitter integration (I haven't used these social media features though)According to the Users' Manual, the standard 950mAh Li-Ion battery allows up to 528 hours of Stand-by and up to 14 h 40 min of Stand by time. With normal use, I usually charge my phone every 3 days.Like most phones, you need the headphones Stereo to operate the FM radio but the LG T375 allows FM recording - nice for making unique ringtones!Pairing devices using the LG T375-RED Bluetooth is easy.  So far I have used the Bluetooth to pair the LG T375-RED with a Sony VAIO E15 Laptop, a Motorola T325 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker and a Samsung C3222 Ch@t Dual SIM phoneCONS:The LG T375-RED connects via EDGE, GPRS - so, slow data means slow Internet browsing.The screen lacks an ambient light sensor for automatic screen brightness adjustment - it's a bit of a challenge to see the display in bright sunlight.The screen display is low resolution (240 x 320 pixels) with a pixel density screen of 125ppi.  This is only noticeable if I am doing a lot of Internet browsing.The camera is just 2.0 MP and it lacks autofocus and also no flash. These is fine if you use the LG T375-RED  phone camera only as your backup camera.Although my list of cons seem long, I rated this LG T375-RED phone 4 to 4.5 STARS.It's such a user friendly utilitarian DUAL SIM phone with a very responsive capacitive touch screen ... great for calls, texts and managing two phone numbers on one handset.Hope my review was helpful ...
