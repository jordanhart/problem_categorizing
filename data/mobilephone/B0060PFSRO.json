{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LG Beacon", "Author": "Brandy Allen \"Brandy1279\"", "ReviewID": "RK3YCOKY28YDZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you like to text a lot, than i would say that this could be the phone for you. The one thing i do like about this phone is that its a touch screen and it has the slide out QWERTY keyboard, compared to most of the androids out there that just have the touch screen keyboard. I personally like a keyboard where i can feel the keys and with the touch screen phones you don't have that. I would say that its more of a basic phone because it doesn't have a lot of different apps and games, though if you go with the 50 dollar plan I'm sure you can download them onto this phone, i went with the 45 dollar plan because i don't need internet on my phone since i have a laptop at home and i don't LIVE on the internet like some people do. It has the basic things that other phones usually have, its got a camera which is alright but sometimes it takes a picture too dark, but there is an adjustment on the phone and once you play with it a bit you get the hang of it. It has a music player, calendar, multimedia, alarm, tools which has your calculator, world clock, Ez tip calculator, it has a drawing panel if you want to doodle, which is an okay feature to have on your phone which i personally don't need. It has voice command, a notepad and you can have a blue tooth if you want that. Like i said its a basic phone, the call quality is alright, could be better but it all depends on the area you are in. The battery life is alright, if you text a lot and talk a lot through out the day then you will have to charge it up during the day so your phone doesn't die. Other than that, i personally like it, others might not but for the price i say its pretty good. I got a 30 rebate with the phone so i basically paid 30 dollars for it and when you get the rebate in the mail its a visa gift card so you can use it anywhere.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works Great!", "Author": "K \"K\"", "ReviewID": "RLPAPK6Y19P6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice phone bought 2 of them...

It can be decent in some areas but fails in others.-This phone turned slow after months of use. I found it froze at points so I had to turn it off then back on.-The battery life lasts 3 days at MOST. If you text even a few times or listen to music, it'll probably last a day or less. This is sad because even with minor use, the battery dies fast. Even with no use, it can die within a few hours.-In order to put music on it, you need your own microSD card. The sound-quality is good though, not great but not bad at all. I would prefer if it had EQ settings. The manual for this feature was very vague.-The picture-quality is very good. It's very crisp. I like taking pictures on this thing. Sadly, it does not take videos though :(-I enjoy texting on the slide-out QWERTY keyboard. But remember that this phone is smaller than average phones so it may be a bit harder to text easily, but I still like texting on it.If you're someone who isn't expecting too much from a phone, this would be for you. But if you want a more fluid phone with video-taking capability and long battery-life, I suggest looking for a more expensive brand.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Aquarius", "Author": "Aquarius", "ReviewID": "R2V4JZADTIWGP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Web freezes up at time crappy phne the scrollin sucks also i hve to keep tkin battery out whn it freezes up and the tlk time is crap i hve to tke my charger wit me", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Metro LG Beacon", "Author": "VW", "ReviewID": "R1C272197OK2IE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this phone as a gift on Nov. 24, 2012.

Also, it freezes up during a call, causing the call to be disconnected, friggen forcing you to have to remove the piece-of-crap battery and putting it back in, then restarting the blasted phone again!!MetroPCS claims that that's the way the new batteries work in all cell phones now. I say that it's bullcrap!!Then I sent in the forms & doccuments in for a $25 rebate on the phone, and they friggen refused to send me the rebate, clainming that I was too late getting it sent to them, when I sent it well before Chirstmas Day!!!Also, I hate that blasted Voicemail feature, because it is way too aggravating and annoying, and MetroPCS has no provisions for customers who don't want it to have it disabled!!!This is the end. I'm so done with MetroPOS!!!!! I'm leaving them the end of the month and I'm going with Boost Mobile!!!!!~Daquan13.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0060PFSRO"}}
