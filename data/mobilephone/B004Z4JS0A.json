I returned mine within 30 days for a replacement due to randomly shuting down. My wife has had to hard reset hers a couple times now because it wouldn't funtion properly or take updates. Have never been able to get either phone to link up with any computer reliably (rare occasions it will). Phone is very slow to react about 1/3 of the time, I've missed calls because it took so long to react to me hitting the answer button- heaven help you if your playing a game or something when someone calls. Like trying to program a shuttle launch on a windows 386. Things that help-I've eliminated allmost all \"apps\", cleared cache, I've found shutting the phone down and restarting helps, however sometimes I can't get it to restart- will just sit at the samsung screen for hours without proceding till I pull the battery and try again. Put it this way, I'm considering getting a land line again so I can be sure to get calls. So just buy a sting and a cup or anything else. Just waiting till I can get a new phone.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung SPH-M910 - Avoid at all costs", "Author": "M.

But almost useless as a phone in low reception areas, which is everywhere around here. Plus, in a call to say, AT&T; because you have to use the # on the keyboard, not a separate dial pad, the other end won't hear them most the time, so forget calling a major company, including Virgin Mobile from this phone, Or ever setting up or checking your voice mail from this phone, because you cannot enter a password. This was not a problem when this was a 2G phone, I still had a dial pad on the front screen then, but it disappeared with the 3G update. And oh, yes, Samsung has announced that this phone is never going to 4G, so soon it will be obsolete....It is a solid, drop-able phone.

About a week after I got this phone it started freezing up on me and I would have to take the battery out to be able to restart the phone. My phone freezes like this at least once a day. I cannot upload any photos from this phone to the internet nor can I send pictures via email with this phone which I HATE. The battery life is about 3-4 hours and thats with average use. If you use the phone more your battery life will not last more than 2 hours. These are common problems with this phone as two of my friends have this exact phone and have the exact problems out of theirs as well.
