The cell phone did look to be in good condition; however, it does not receive any incoming calls. There also is an issue with the internet viewing. It often has small and distorted writing. I am at a loss now of $25.00 and am forced to hunt again for a new phone.Regretfully,NariegirlVerizon Samsung Saga i770 No Contract 3G WiFi Global Windows MP3 Smartphone", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wish I had not!!!", "Author": "lucretia moore", "ReviewID": "R3ESG9DMPXMH8Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this phone for less than thirty days and it started rebooting itself. I called the samsung office to see if anything could be done and they want to charge me $70.00 to fix it. That's almost the amount I paid for this phone. I am very disappointed and to top it off, I couldn't return it because the time for return had expired. So now I have this phone that I wanted just sitting in my drawer. I even brought a case for it through amazon and now they both are useless to me. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this phone. It is crap!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tons of features! Great phone for the price!", "Author": "Michael M. Anderson \"Chastity\"", "ReviewID": "R3JFT2YYUHMKS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The capabilities of the HTC Touch Pro are extensive, and I found it difficult to fully appreciate everything the device can do in six weeks, let alone three or four.First, my hands and fingers are larger than average, but I've found it easy and quick to navigate using the touch-screens and buttons. I use the stylus from time-to-time, and my experience is that it is sometimes necessary to use it when objects are crowded close together on the touch-screen, but I found this to be an infrequent necessity. The keyboard is very good, though I initially found the odd placement of the letter \"M\" a little disconcerting, but I did eventually get used to its location. These are certainly things one can try out in any Verizon store, and don't have to be left to chance; the same with build-quality, which I've found to be very good, check it out to your own satisfaction.I use my Touch Pro mainly for business and am a heavy user of Microsoft Outlook Tasks, Calendar, and Contacts, so easy synchronizing these things with the same items on my desktop PC is very important to me; the HTC Touch Pro does this very well, though I'd have liked the Verizon Wireless Sync capability included with the basic data package, without having to pay extra for wireless sync. But I've gotten used to synchronizing by using the USB cable; it's quick and easy.Setting up the device to download my email from four different email accounts, and four different providers, was easy and quick. One just types in the email address and password (you only have to do this once at setup) for an account and the device software does most of the rest. I did not find it necessary to download any additional software for this. I just followed the directions in the user guide. For each account, you can choose from a variety of time-intervals for checking your email (5 min., 10 min., 15 min., 30 min., 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, or once per day), or you may check manually in just seconds.At first, I did find the operating system seemed to slow down or freeze from time-to-time. Invariably, this was due to having too many programs running at once, a condition cured with two touches on the main screen (with two touches, you can close any one program or close all open programs). Also, I found that getting photos and music off the device and onto a memory card resulted in faster operation. The device has a lot of memory, relatively speaking, but keep in mind that it has a lot of programs and capability. Re-setting the device (soft-reset, that is) is also a solution, but probably should only be done with the same frequency as you do it on your desktop or laptop--which is, hopefully, infrequently. If the device completely freezes, of course, your choices may be limited to a re-set. You may find, as I did, that once you learn how to get around in the device, moving more efficiently between and among its functions and programs, the incidence of freezing will drop to zero.This is a great device for business, though the 3D TouchFLO interface (an I-Phone-like experience) seems fun to use and may be easier for some to navigate to more frequently used functions; I don't use this interface much, preferring the--perhaps more boring--\"TODAY screen\" interface and the full complement of functions available through menu choices. In any case, I found there are a number of ways of accomplishing typical tasks, some easier and quicker than others. For instance, text messaging, of which I do a lot with my daughter, is as easily accessible as it is for a regular cell phone; just three or four quick touches will get you there with the Touch Pro. For receiving a text message, a notification link takes you to the read/reply screen with only one touch.In the end I've reacted positively to this device, especially for business. And I very much like the familiar \"Windows\" look and feel. Among those things for which I have less appreciation are: Cost (it's a pricey phone from Verizon); the highly polished, piano-black finish, is easily smudged with fingerprints; there is an atypically long delay in the phone ringing when a call comes in--the person calling will hear five rings while you will have heard only two--even if you're in the same room. Incidentally, in the event you plan to get your device from a non-Verizon source, you might want to check with Verizon to see if you might be by-passing some benefit (like \"new-every-two\" or a credit on a new phone when your plan expires--just a thought).", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005V69OK0"}}
