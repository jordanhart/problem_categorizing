{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Would be perfect except for the screen", "Author": "Michael Crouse", "ReviewID": "R2ON007C3JRQ4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To introduce myself, I had a Samsung Skyrocket S2 that decided to die on me at the end of last month, and then my backup phone (a cheap Chinese phone) decided to start dying too.  There's a phone I want to spend some money on coming out in the next few months, but I need something to get by and to act as a backup phone when I do make that purchase, so after some searching I settled for this one.  I listen to a lot of music on my phone, read email, do some app development of my own as a grad student, and occasionally watch videos on Youtube or use GPS to find some place I've never visited before.  All in all, barring development I'm a fairly gentle phone user but I also have some tech savvy to form a useful opinion.  When I looked up info on the Advance 4.0, I was able to find specs but not much in the way of useful reviews, so I tried to be as thorough writing this as possible.Design: The Advance 4.0 is bulky for a 4\" phone - it's nearly as large in length and width as my 4.5\" Samsung S2 Skyrocket, and it's thicker too.  The outside of the case is smooth plastic - it isn't slippery in the hand but it does attract fingerprints more than any other phone I've had.  However, the phone does come with an Otterbox-like case and a screen protector, and I'd recommend using both.  Inside under the battery are two SIM slots and an SD slot.  The SIM slots are easy to use and well-labelled but the SD slot frankly scares me.  It's flimsy and easy to bend and doesn't offer much protection to the card in the slot.  Add that to being under the battery and this isn't a phone for someone who likes to use multiple SD cards.  However, all of this is to be expected with a phone in this price range, and getting a case and screen protector included is a great deal.Performance: The MediaTek chip and 512mb of RAM in this phone might not be impressive compared to a flagship phone, but for day to day operation they perform admirably.  Multitasking is generally quick, Youtube and Google Maps load quickly and the phone is loaded with what is basically stock Jelly Bean, which is great.  There's no extra junkware to get rid of and the Play Store is ready to go.  I should note that I am not a phone gamer, but if you want a cell phone that can play high-end games this is probably not the phone for you.  Social games and the like should work fine (I only tried Angry Birds, hardly a tech demo game).Connectivity: The Advance 4.0's antenna is quite strong - I had trouble getting signal in my basement with my S2, but get 3 bars with this phone.  Bluetooth connectivity is similarly impressive - I was able to pair my headset immediately and had signal with my phone in one corner of the house all the way to the garage on the other side - 45 feet away through walls.  Data connectivity is flawless - both on wifi and 3g (the phone is compatible with HSPA+) are capped by my provider and ping was good per Speedtest.  3g tethering also works well - assuming your provider lets you do this.Battery: The Advance 4.0 comes with a 1600mah battery, which with the MediaTek chip should last a very long time.  To test, I unplugged the phone at 7AM yesterday, and for the entire day streamed music via wifi to my bluetooth headset - a double drain on the battery.  I also downloaded a variety of apps and podcasts and browsed the web some.  Then I left the phone on overnight, continuing to download more podcasts while I slept.  When I plugged it in at 7:30 this morning it still had 25% battery left.  For a budget phone this is outstanding.  I wouldn't normally listen to 12 hours of music like that, so there's no way I'm going to kill the battery unless I forget to charge it for two days.Screen:  ... and this is where the wheels come off.  The screen on this phone is just short of abysmal.  It's not that it's an 800x480 screen - I've had that resolution on other phones and they looked much better than this one.  The colors are distorted unless you are looking directly at the phone.  This isn't the usual complaint that reviewers have about viewing angles - you literally can't be tilting the phone at all or it's no good.  In addition, even if you are looking directly at it images and videos are grainy and just don't look right.  However, for normal phone navigation and app use it's adequate.  If you wanted to watch anything on your phone, you will be disappointed.  I'm lucky that my top use for a smartphone (streaming music) doesn't require much use of this screen.Conclusion:With a phone in this price range, something always has to give.  You either get an a phone that's still running Gingerbread, specs that are subpar, or a battery that can't make it through the day.  In this case it's the screen, but even that is really only so bad if you want to watch videos.  I expect later this year there will be a lot of competition for budget phones, but if you need a phone right now and only have $100 to spare this is not at all a bad choice.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great performance, great price!!!

I didn't actually have much of a problem with the Z990, except for one thing: it only had 130MB usable space for installing apps. Even 4 years ago (when I originally bought it) that was considered a minuscule amount of space. After doing everything I could to get around this problem, I finally gave up and decided to find a new phone.The BLU Advance 4.0 has 1.27GB of space for apps (the other 2.72GB is for the Android OS). I know that's still pretty small by today's cell phone standards but it's a HUGE upgrade to me. I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be able to download and install all the apps I want, plus some I never had the option of installing before. (I still use AppMgr Pro III. It lets me know what programs I can move to my external SD card. Out of the 26 apps I've installed, 11 were able to be moved to my SD card. At 37 apps I've only filled half the 1.27GB with the help of AppMgr.)I switched to T-mobile (from AT&T;) with this phone. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to touch any settings to get this phone to work with T-mobile. Call, text, and data all loaded automatically when I installed the SIM card. I'm told HSPA+ is 4G. If that's the case then this phone DOES get 4G (as well as 3G and 2G). Reception for cell and data are, of course, entirely dictated by location. I've been very fortunate thus far, all things considered (I live in Wyoming, lol).I was pleasantly surprised to see there was absolutely no \"bloatware\" on this phone. I LOVE IT. There's something immensely satisfying knowing that not one bit of memory is being wasted on an app I don't want. Other than standard Google stuff (which is part and parcel with Android), you only get the basics. Everything else you can customize and tweak to your hearts content. Fantastic!The screen is bright and crisp and it's 4\" (the \"sweet spot\" for phone screens as far as I'm concerned). The up and down viewing angle is horrid though. Just a slight tilt and the colors are completely washed out. (Right and left are fine though.) And, of course, direct sunlight makes the screen unviewable. (My Z990 did the same thing, so I'm use to that.) Straight on view, though, and the screen is lovely.Sadly, the only upgrade I got with the camera on this phone was having a flash. Otherwise it's the exact same as the Z990, if not a little worse. (The auto-focus/focus is middling at best on this phone. It doesn't seem to focus at all with things up-close.)The touch screen is fine. It's no better or worse than other touch screens I've used. That is to say, using a keyboard can be a pain. Swiftkey is how I get around this and I recommend others either get Swiftkey or an app similar to it. (I've heard people have problems with the stock dialer too, their cheek accidently hitting the end-call button. I recommend getting an alternative dialer if that's an issue for you. ExDialer is pretty good.)Speakers are loud enough. If you're in a crowded or noisy place you'll have difficulty (headphones or bluetooth headset might be in order). Minor complaint here: They have one of the worst speakerphone placements I've ever seen.They have the speaker in the lower back (!!) area of the phone... you know... the part of the phone you cover with your hand to hold it? So if you want to listen to music or have hand-free talking, you'll have to hold the phone from the top (!!!!!) or put it screen-side down. I have adapted but it's a very strange and inconvenient design decision on BLU's part.Battery life is OK. It really depends on what you're doing with the phone and how many apps are running in the background. I've not had it die on me yet, but I do make it a point to charge it at night and I have a charger in my car just in case. Also, if you're curious, battery replacements are available. Go to BLU's Amazon Store Front and check their Accessory page to find it.I got a screen protector, protective silicone case, and a earbuds with this phone (along with the standard charger and manual). I tried to use the screen protector but I didn't clean the phone well enough and ended up ruining it. Oh well. The phone itself has a slippery plastic feel to it, so the silicone case is useful as it gives the phone \"grip\". I haven't tested the earbuds but they seem sturdy and of good quality.Speaking of the outside of the phone... it's lovely looking. Someone mentioned it looked cheap in the reviews. I guess that depends on where you're coming from. Having used a Z990 for the last 4 years, the Advance 4 is practically a work of art by comparison. The back is particularly cool looking. (I wish the silicone case was the same color as the phone, or see-through, because it's a shame to have it all covered up.)At $82 this is a perfect phone. There are no \"deal breaking\" issues for me. All the minor annoyances I can either get around or live with. If this phone also proves to be durable (I haven't had it long), I'll be a BLU customer for life. :)", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "BLU Advance 4.0 Unlocked Dual SIM Phone (White)", "Author": "Lili", "ReviewID": "R18IBX7TSIHGAF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am in love with this phone.

It's priced just right and I have all the features I need plus more.I can call, text, take pictures, play games, browse the internet, get directions, download apps and so on. I can even change the background of my text conversations to a personal picture, live wallpaper, or regular wallpaper. I'm currently using an HTC Thunderbolt silicone case for my Blu phone and it fits plus looks nice (I did not receive a case with my phone). The case cut outs don't match but the calls are not affected and the camera cut out will take a slight adjustment and I just slip the case off when I'm charging my phone.I will never go back to a contract with any phone company, ever.UPDATE 3/27/14Although I still think this phone is nice for the price, there are some things I have noticed while using it more often. The phone has slow reaction at times. My \"demands\" are not always met with speed when texting or playing Bingo Bash, for example. Also, I cannot receive pictures directly in my text messages. I have to click on a link that takes me to an external source where my pictures are held for seven days, and that is if I can view them. I cannot seem to send pictures through text either (I have only tried once). Sending and receiving pictures through text is something I thought was standard on all cell phones but apparently not. I'm disappointed big time about that. All and all I still recommend this phone. It picks up my wifi with no problem and I can sync my email to it as well.

(I put mine on the lowest because I like conserving battery life).It's very vivid, bright.. but if you are looking over someone's shoulder at a weird angle, the screen is very hard to see.It actually hurts abit to look at the screen from an angle other than straight on.

It's like a web cam, basically.The regular back camera is good. Can take some pretty good quality photos (although not top quality).Touch screen:It's not very sensitive at all.

Its not too big, not too small and just the right size, the same size as a s4 mini. I just want to thank the blu company for hookin a sister up because not only is it a great price, it comes with a free rubber case and screen protector along with standard accessories. I paid less than $100 for a phone that can perform just as good as or even better than the name brand phones. I love the way its feels in hand, how loud it is, how responsive it is, everthing! I would say i have a minor problem with the keyboard's unresponsiveness (its the keyboard, NOT THE PHONE) . However i changed this problem by downloading a free app called \"a keyboard\". It allows you to choose either qwerty or a 3\u00d74 keyboard (which is my favorite) and you can choose backgrounds. Another thing i do not like is that the battery tends to die a little quick with playing games, watching movies, playing songs etc. and to solve this problem, i downloaded \"du battery\" app from the google play store. It tells me my battery's temperature, controls my battery power and creates a shortcut optimize button that i can press to stop background apps from killing my battery. The last thing i do not like is the screen resolution and viewing angles which seem to look a bit blurry looking from the sides of the screen. When watching movies or doing anything the screen has to be directly facing you for you to see clearly. Overall, i still give this phone 5 stars because most of my problems were able to be solved and this is way more than a bargain.

When I received the Galaxy, I really was not into the smartphone thing, so I did not use it and ended up selling it.

Most of the cheapie China-made dual sim phones are 2g GSM only, this one is 3g capable and works very well on my carrier which is 3g only (Mobilicity)- Comes with free screen protector, and soft rubber caseCons:- has an LCD screen so the viewing angle may not be as wide as the newer AMOLED screens.- only 1/2 gig of RAM. Sometimes a small lag may be experienced when starting up some of the bigger apps.- No USB OTG support, but neither does some of the Google Nexus devices.- Touch screen could be a little more sensitive.

IMHO (Wow! This is the first time using a hispter acronym, I embarrassed), I'd say you're better off with an unlocked Iphone 4 (craigslist $100 +) for traveling with Apple's build quality, unless again, you have a particular good reason (i.e. band) to get this.The packaging is nice enough -- comes with charger, ear buds, silicone extra case and screen protector, which I have yet to apply).Minuses: -s====================Compared to my daily cheap phone (a Motorolla Defy XT557) which is really quite solid, this is a much, much cheaper build.This (China) Blu is like my B1000 China phone that I previously used. Similar to the B1000, the touch screen is so-so responsive, good enough, but not up to the big brand minimum standards of both touch and build. Thus, if you had a phone like the B1000, this is not worth the upgrade unless you have a reason like I did (1700 band).Neutral: *=======================The back half doesn't look as cheap as the front.I kind of like itThe newer system (Android 4.2.2) doesn't feel as 'mentally' quick as my Defy XT. There is something about the spacing, coloring of the system access that seems off a bit. That's a really minor quibble by the way, and pretty subjective at that.Software used:====================1) I use Launcher Pro Plus (an antiquated but really, really quick launcher). I can't report yet on the voice quality, but the web browsing has been reasonable enough.2) I played with Talkatone for free wifi voip calls (and that's good until May, 2014 given the xmpp stuff that is being discontinued from google) and that worked pretty good over WiFi.3) I use Link2SD (after the one click root method described above) and now there's much more of the 1GB internal memory left.Other tid bits:====================The price is a bit funky; all the press releases advertise if for $89 but I ended up paying $94.99 with shipping (which I suppose is alright). I've also seen it going for about $10 more than I paid. I say funky because I would have loved it if the big brand stores and sites (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.) matched the scores of PR releases about the phone and then gotten free shipping. Atlas, not the case.Also, I might have bought the next one up (the Studio 5 which is pr'd for $139 but sells for a fair amount higher than that).I'll update once I actually use it as a phone.:)", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Parts not available", "Author": "Idaho Walker", "ReviewID": "RBB3ZX1I4OQGN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just acquired this phone, it being my first ever \"Blu\" purchase.

The phone basically does work: makes and receives calls and texts. The screen is sufficiently bright when looked at directly, but off-axis viewing is bad. Consider it a \"privacy\" feature, making it hard for anyone sitting next to you to peek at your screen. I found the touchscreen disappointing. The screen feels spongy - it deforms easily when touched, but more importantly, often times it takes an extra touch to get the screen to respond. Otherwise, the UI never lagged and the few apps that I tried didn't stutter.I knew it would have a stock Android build (Jellybean 4.1.2) with no or minimal improvements by BLU. Based on screenshots, it looks like the Cyanogenmod 10.2 (open-source Android OS) that I run on my Galaxy S2, and so I assumed that it would have all the features, configurability, bells, and whistles that I have. Unfortunately, it didn't. It didn't come with Cyanogenmod's powerful cLock widget or a keyboard that support gestures (think: Swype), though both could be downloaded from Google Play as the Chronos and Google Keyboard apps, respectively. It also came with very few options to customize the look feel - changing the number of icons displayed, removing the Google search bar, lock screen widgets, etc. Stock Android is not very pretty to look at so I had hoped to make the phone's interface more useful and less annoying.I returned the phone and purchased an LG Optimus F3 for $50 more. For the money, I got a better display, a better-feeling touchscreen, a much larger battery, and true 4G LTE support. (BLU's \"4G\" is based on those who say anything over 10Mbps is \"4G\", which IMO is fast enough to be usable. Others snicker and call that \"faux-G\".)

Other than this hiccup, the phone seemed quite sturdy, everything else except the sim card 1 worked perfectly,I will update my score when i get my replacement unit, and do a full review then. Just keep in mind that Blu is a new company, so there are prone to be bugs and quality control issues as with any new startup business. I will say the experience I had with one of their other products, the BLU Dash 5.0, was very solid (if a bit too big for my uses), so hopefully the replacement unit will be as solid as that device.UPDATE: I have received the replacement unit, and unfortunately, it was just as defective as the first. I have found the radio to be defective in the replacement. Besides dropping calls left and right, it also would drain the battery extremely quickly, indicating a short of some kind in the cellular radio. I did try and pop it into the second sim card slot, and while this did solve the rapid battery drainage problem nicely, it also started to short, and began to drop calls as well. I'm guessing this particular model has a manufacturing defect in the radio or sim card reader. For those who are wondering why the battery doesn't last as long, this might have something to do with this. Overall, I can't, in good faith, recommend this product. I instead returned this, and purchased a more expensive, but still excellent for the price THL W200S, which so far has exceeded my expectations. Be warned, for the price you /could/ get a good phone, but quality control appears to be nonexistant, so buyer beware.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "blu anvance", "Author": "ikonomidis emmanuel", "ReviewID": "R3K7FG6GU8DZCV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good phone, fast, very good price, good delivery time,but the screen is not so good, if this phone have a good hd screen you give 5 stars..", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK but glitchy", "Author": "tim", "ReviewID": "R1O1QOGVUFNBKU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "She likes it overall, but it has some glitches for us.Using \"straight talk\" service she can't send or receive pictures except thru e-mail", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "bad expirience", "Author": "Konstantin", "ReviewID": "R10YVTMYYDK0MN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "there are 3 things I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL, ONE, THIS PHONE IS ADVERTISED AS 4G, IT IS NOT.

Wright", "ReviewID": "R2S29IHK37E34U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I rec'd this phone on Weds after ordering it from Amazon. Out of the box was impressed by simple yet nice looking device and soft plastic case & earbuds it comes with. Inserting sim card and battery was a breeze although getting the back plastic off was a bit of a struggle.The phone itself is pretty basic and easy to navigate. standard android layout with everything Google you can poss think of pre-loaded. some of the apps don't work as well or seamlessly as they should though. weather channel app for example opens and searches for location but never seems to do anything so even though its my fave source for weather I had to delete it. never had this issue on other phones. Spotify works well and streams nicely although sometimes will quit and shut down. Speaker is loud and sound quality is good. web browsing is fine, but images and pages do look slightly pixelated (its an 85 dollar phone) battery seems really decent so far, but I really don't use my phone all that much it usually just sits idle.camera seems ok, not great but not terrible either. My main complaint so far is that the touchscreen isn't as responsive as it should be. also virtual keyboard is too small, that is the letters are small and too close together. I have small female hands and pretty small fingers and find typing on it to be a clumsy affair. often having to go back and delete/retype letters. also small complaint is that the power button sits on the right side at the top which feels like an awkward place to have it. that button should be on top where you can easily click it with index finger or if on the side somewhere near where thumb lands when it sits in your hand. I really find myself fumbling around trying to find it when I wanna lock or unlock it from being idle. Other than that the screen and colors are sharp and it's really light, feels nice to carry around and looks like a nice expensive phone. Got mine in white since that is a much less common color unless you have iphone, don't see many in this shape and color. no regrets even though I went back and forth trying to decide between this and the Samsung Exhibit which sells at Walmart for their prepaid plan or MetroPCs, and is compatible with Tmobile. They're basically the same with only difference being that Samsung has 4G and Blu doesn't and Samsung screen is 3.8 while mine is 4.0. Kinda wonder if Samsung would have been better quality but don't really have any regrets in buying this phone.May 17 UPDATEafter about a month and a half of light but constant use I have to say I am not that impressed with the phone's basic functions. Biggest complaint is *dropped calls* I can't tell if it is the sensitivity of touchscreen hitting my cheek when I talk but it is literally impossible to have a convo without it abruptly ending. it's not that fast even though I have Tmobile and could be enjoying 4G. its also pretty heavy, which normally I dont mind but it just seems way to bulky carrying it around. will always open windows and apps when its in my purse or pocket. I will try to sell online soon and switch to another phone with some real muscle.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "The value is not worth the money", "Author": "Ashley K", "ReviewID": "R3MT8SH7DTQ2BQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had an iPhone 4 which I absolutely loved. But I dropped it on tile and broke the screen. I couldn't afford a new one, so after searching online; I decided to go with this. And I'm not impressed at all.1. The back is a huge pain to try to take off. When I had to put my battery in for the first time, I had to pry it off with a screwdriver.2. The battery doesn't last long at all. When I had the iPhone, I could go all day on my phone and still have life left. With this phone, I have to charge it at least twice a day.3. You have to look directly at the phone to be able to see the screen. If you angle it, it just looks black.4. The camera is horrible. Not only is the lighting way off, but most pictures are constantly blurry. Going back to #3, you also have to keep the camera positioned a certain way (and in the light) or else your pictures turn out completely dark and horrible.5. It's very confusing to navigate. I've had this phone for a few months and I still can't figure out how to do many of the functions on it. So I really only text, play games and call the occasional person.The one good thing is that the speakers are loud. I love to listen to music in the shower. The iPhone 4 was super quiet. This one is pretty good at letting me hear the song and lyrics!Overall, I regret spending the $90 on this.
