No (vis-a-vis the product) and yes (vis-a-vis the seller).1.  I learned the hard way that when you buy the \"international\" version, the phone you get will be that sold in a different country from the US. This was an unlocked Vodaphone unit with instructions in Spanish. I had to hunt on the Samsung website, since the model number doesn't even appear on the US website. When I finally went to its regional site for Spain, I found the model number and got instructions in English.Hassle #1.2.  The international version of this phone comes with a charger with a European-style plug and an adapter for US outlets. I inserted my SIM and battery and plugged the phone in to charge it. Nothing happened. Zero. The plug adapter, in fact, nearly fell out of the wall outlet, it was so loose. Nor does the charger plug fit tightly into the adapter. The manufacturer could not have made them fit each other and the outlet more poorly if he had deliberately attempted to get it wrong.Hassle #2.I tried a different plug adapter and, after wiggling the charger plus around a bit, got the phone to light up. For a moment. But as soon as I let go of the plug, the connection was lost. Wiggle it one way -- on. Wiggle it another, or let it go -- off. On. Off. Mostly off.It is just a terrible, very loose fit. Bottom line: the charger and adapter that come with this phone are both garbage.In the few times that the screen did light up for a couple of seconds, I saw the word \"cargando\" or \"charging,\" in Spanish. This told me that all the menus were going to be in Spanish. Again: not what I expected.Hassle #3.UPDATE: I contacted the seller, HassleFreeCell, who was very apologetic and very responsive. At that point he sent me the link to the English language instructions, assured me that the language of the menus could be changed, and offered to step me through the process over the phone, once we got the phone charged.He sent me a new adapter, but that didn't work, since the problem was also with the charger. So HFC ordered me a new charger -- the US version -- from Amazon at no cost to me. Very classy. I was finally able to charge my new phone and make sure the SIM from my former T-Mobile phone worked. It does -- just fine.The instructions are poor. But this phone is probably as simple as it gets, so even though I had to muddle through a bit (I'm not a big cellphone user), it was fairly intuitive.Even though it's unlocked, it's a Vodaphone, so you see that logo every time you turn it on. No big deal. When that goes away, \"Welcome to T-Mobile\" comes on.Even though the phone said \"cargando\" in Spanish, all the menus, etc. have come up in English. Maybe the phone read the SIM, and changed itself? Don't know, don't care. (If it hadn't done that, I see how to change the phone's language and it's easy.)I do have to re-enter my address book from my previous phone. But this phone gives you the option of adding names to the phone or to the SIM (or both, I guess), so in future my contact names should transfer to my new phone.All the bells and whistles (camera, radio, etc.) are of no interest to me. I really just want the phone, and in that respect it's very straightforward. I can't really comment on battery life just yet, since I just started using it yesterday.Does this quad band phone work in Costa Rica? In theory, it should. In practice, maybe not so well. The best coverage in CR is 3G, not GSM. I did know that beforehand, but decided it didn't make sense for me to buy a 3G phone I didn't really need, just so it would work while I was on vacation. I'll rent a 3G phone while I'm in CR, and look forward to using this phone in Europe.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "menu in Spanish; advertised as English; hard to return", "Author": "Paul E.

The Stratus is sleek and compact, with a great slider feel and a cool Euro design. It takes about a day to figure out and implement all the features but once you tame this beast, it does everything you want--and more--for a basic call and text phone.Originally made for the International Vodaphone market, it ships with an two-prong plug and a USA adapter. Headset included along with a fairly shoddy user's manual. Turning on the phone activates the most annoying disco-techno button tones you've ever heard, but this annoyance is easily resolved simply by turning down the volume control until the tones are turned off. Although the initial phone setting were in Spanish, once I installed my T-Mobile Sim card, the setup wizard changed all the settings to English and it was smooth sailing after that. The feature list for the Stratus is extensive: MP3 player, FM radio, low-level camera with a lot of settings for different lighting situations, e-mail, browsers, apps, etc. But the neatest aspects are the design and the in-hand slider feel. T-Mobile's signal is strong in my zip code, so there are no issues with signal strength and dropped calls.  The Stratus just looks and feels great, with outstanding call quality for both the speaker and the headset. I couldn't ask for anything more in a basic, inexpensive mobile phone.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Battery.

There was no manual provided but you can always find a user guide online so it wasn't an issue.  The charger's not of US standards but an adaptor was provided so that was a plus. For a supposedly simple use phone, the menu option's a little tricky compared to our other samsung units. Even the graphic's not as sharp. Headset's included and my husband likes the FM radio, but the ringtones are limited.. not that it matters to him.  The camera's acceptable and the keys are enough for bigger fingers.
