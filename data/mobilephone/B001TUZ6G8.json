{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone, weird wired headset", "Author": "Cavehobbit \"tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2WUJSJY1VYHUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can't really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT's service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola's software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can't last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "E Series Style in a Great Slider Package", "Author": "Jared", "ReviewID": "R1QEMBS727X68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With the incarnation of the E75, Nokia successfully continues the E series ideology of enterprise-oriented phones while supporting a balance of personal life and entertainment.The E75 is the first QWERTY slider into the E series, yet maintains a pleasant thinness.  It is not as thin as the E71, but Nokia is fitting quite a bit of hardware into this thin slider body.  Nevertheless, the E75 is solidly built and maintains a great feel while being held open or closed.The QWERTY keyboard featured on the E75 is huge.  Coming from a narrower brick QWERTY, the jump to such a wider keyboard is impressive and helps make typing out messages on a phone less of a chore.  Those who may have bigger fingers may appreciate the larger keys as featured on the E75.  Unlike the E71 the E75 contains a dedicated Ctrl key, the E71's key only being a secondary function.  This dedicated key makes tasks like copying and pasting even easier.Response time from this phone is pleasing - loading applications is fairly quick, and any seldom noticeable lag is minimal.  Multitasking is rather simple, and having a couple applications simultaneously open does not significantly impact the phone's performance.Symbian S60 3rd with Feature Pack 2 is the operating system powering the E75.  Search contacts directly from the home screen is a valued feature - as the name of a contact is typed (even from the keypad), results are quickly displayed above providing shortcuts to call or message the contact.  Mail setup is a breeze and supports Exchange, and using the mail application is very easy and intuitive.  The home screen is highly customizable, and the switching between work and personal modes makes the interface even more flexible.Other benefits of the E75 are its wide range of connectivity - HSDPA, 802.11b/g, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.  Additionally, the phone's video record mode supports a VGA resolution at 30fps.  The phone also comes included with a 4GB microSD card and the slot is external.  Surprising was the quality of the included earbuds/mic - they aren't the best quality on the market, but for included earbuds they are actually nice.  A full 3.5mm audio jack is also onboard, opposed to 2.5mm.  Additionally, the E75 can charge over USB, though not as fast as the provided adapter.While the keyboard of the E75 brings advantages there are some drawbacks, though these are relatively minor.  Because the keyboard is so wide, it can take a few uses to get accommodated to the width - anyone used to a brick QWERTY will need to get accustomed to reaching further with their thumbs.  Unfortunately, there is no double quote character on the keyboard, not even as a second function.  Instead, the double quote character must be accessed through the Character key.  The absence of a left Ctrl key makes moving the cursor over by word practically impossible - both the ctrl key and directional pad are on the right side.  The keyboard could also have benefitted by finger finders to help assist with positioning, though this isn't a serious problem.The keys on the keypad seem a bit small, and this could hinder some accuracy when working with the phone at a quick pace.  However, to accommodate the E75's screen and physical size the keys had to be sized as they are.  While it would have been nice to have a larger screen, it really wouldn't be possible to accommodate one with the face keypad.  The N97 is Nokia's full-face screen model (lacking the dedicated keypad), and as such supports touch.  The glossy face on the E75 means it is a fingerprint magnet - both keypad and screen.  Be prepared to frequently wipe off prints.There are some mediocre aspects to the E75.  The battery is only 1000mAh, which will allow for about a full day of fairly heavy use.  However, for light to medium use the battery should last a few days before needing a charge.  Thankfully, Nokia included the charge over USB option in this phone.  Additionally, the camera quality of the E75 is nothing special.  And while the Nokia browser has been improved upon and supports Flash, it could use some more improvements in navigation and viewing.The perceived drawbacks to the E75 are essentially nitpicks however.  This phone has a number of positive aspects that make it very solid and a pleasure to use.  Nokia's E75 is an adequate powerhouse, fully capable of accommodating the aspects of an E series mobile lifestyle.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Totally love it!!!", "Author": "Ah Pui", "ReviewID": "RHUAB84CI80M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say is WOW!! I am totally impressed with it and believed that Nokia has come up with a winning product. I just owned this baby for less than a week but has already become addicted to it. Prior to buying e75, I have done research on various high-end phones on iphone, blackberrry, sony and even various other Nokia E-series and N-series phones and have also read almost all existing E75 cell-phone reviews on the web. Though there are mixed reviews on it, I decided to take the plunge and purchased it. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is definitely one of my best investments for the year, can't say the same for my other investments I have made :)===PROS1)Great great looks. stunning design. It is a really beautiful phone. I really liked a candy shaped smartphone that looks like a regular cellphone. Most of the powerful highend smartphone are much wider and have a bulky look. e75 has great dimensions and could easily fit inside a jeans pocket. great! The slide-out full-sized qwerty keypad is simply addictive! it is very easy to use, good-sized keys, slider makes a solid \"thud\" when opening and closing. amazing style and quality. love it!2)Amazing usability. In the first day, I already set up my email accounts(in a few simple clicks), browse the web, listening to both FM and internet radio, subscribe to podcasts, view office documents, download some latest apps from Nokia ovi store and use GPS as a tour guide. it is just so intuitive that I doubt you will need the guidebook and web reviews to guide you through using *any* features.3)Great build quality. It has a nice weight on it and feels like you are definitely holding something \"substantial\". I read about various people getting leaky keypad and such. No such issue with mine. As I said before, the sliding keypad feels very solid and snapping back and forth feels very secure with no loose ends. The silver-black and chrome combination makes e75 looks very upscale and all the keys are well-placed and very responsive. Some people are complaining about screen-size too small, qwerty layout hard to adjust etc. I find the screen size very sufficient to read email, browse documents and web. It is extremely sharp and is readable under bright sunlight and qwerty keypad works great. Can type out a long email in no time. Besides it also have a set of regular keys in front so you could do one-hand messaging as well. perfect!4)Good offering of applications. Web and office documents browsing and editing, great media player, easy to use GPS system makes it a fun-filled power business smartphone. A word about audio quality. The loudspeaker may not be as loud as someone likes but it is no worse than the samsung and motorola that I used to own. Call quality is superb. Reception is very good.===CONS1)Well, someone can quip about screen being too small, camera not being 5MP, screen not being the sharpest around, symbian too outdated, audio quality subpar, no touchscreen etc etc. but the ONLY complain that I think is valid and a very serious concern is the extensibility which may be what is stopping iphone users from crossing over. blame it on the App Store. Iphone is amazing not only because of its physical form and touch screen intuitiveness but on its amazing array of 3rd party applications. Sad to say, Nokia much touted ovi-store where we could purchase applications fall short, WAY short. I have browsed around for further-addon apps, very less offering and many are not free. well, even if they are free, i am not so sure i wanted them on. Don't even get me started on their Ngame platform. The games offering is simply pathetic. This lack of extensibility maybe crippling Nokia in the future where customers are very savvy and demanding and they want cellphones that have a long lifecycle and full of applications of anything imaginable not just what is offered by the manufacturer.2)A quick word about battery life. It really is pretty lousy, just as stated by various e75 review articles. You do need to charge it daily.3)I hate to state the obvious but the price tag is pretty hefty considering it didn't really offer any earth-shattering features that are not currently on the market or any out-of-the-world design.All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase. As long as you are aware of the limiting factors, e75 is an extremely well-rounded smartphone with great style and substance. Nokia E75 is everything that a business person would want and need plus much more.** I recently run into a refresh bug where my screen keeps on refreshing itself indefinitely. You may trigger this bug when your phone is running out of battery, and while recharging, you press on your email icon. I think the auto-syncing of email go crazy when dealing with this particular usecase. You don't have to send the phone back to manufacturer or even reset your phone, there is a nifty solution where you just have to press Control Panel->Settings->General->Personalization->HomeScreenMode->ModeSettings->Email Notifications->Disable then restart your phone. Your beloved phone will be functioning again.

So, when I saw a $50 online coupon, I decided to jump on it and buy the E75 for $250 directly from Nokia at [...].This is my first Smartphone and so I did lots of research online and offline/local in-stores & compared various brands including Blackberries, Samsungs, iPhones, HTC and Nokia E Series. I needed a phone that is deceptively simple on the outside for making voice calls but yet offers full Smartphone functionality inside for both business & personal use. I also needed a minimum of 3.2 Megapixel camera with a fast video recorder and be able to listen to music & radio. Finally, I needed a phone to make international traveling easier.The Nokia E75 seemed to fit my above needs as it is not too big or too small and offers ready access to a simple regular dialing keypad in the front and lets you use a QWERTY keyboard slide out.Updated review: Feb 15, 2010: After owning this device for about 4 weeks, I have lowered my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. Although it seemed to met my needs feature wise, its reliability seems to be questionable. Ocassionaly some keys seem to lockup during non-voice operations. Also, voicecall quality is becoming an issue. In fact I should have heeded to many professional reviewers who also pointed to questionable voice quality.Finally, I decided to return this back to Nokia for a refund and replacing it with a Nokia E72 model.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great features, great phone! Perhaps even better than an iPhone!", "Author": "M. Chu \"Ahchoo01\"", "ReviewID": "R1QSZ9Q53GXH5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased an unlocked Nokia E75 a few days ago. Since then I have been quite happy with the phone. While this is not quite an iPhone, the E75 shines in its own right with its lengthy laundry list of features.In fact, one software feature, Ovi files, makes this phone a top notch productivity performer by allowing you to download virtually any supported file from your computer at home to your Nokia E75 cell phone. MS Office files like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint can be downloaded with ease as long as your home computer is running the required software and connected to the internet. Once downloaded, these files can then be viewed AND EDITED right from your phone using Nokia's onboard office program. Edited documents can then be sent via e-mail to another individual. This feature alone makes this phone incredibly worthwhile for any user on the go who may need to access a file at a moments notice. Best of all, this software is completely FREE. There is no additional cost aside from the standard data charges assessed by your wireless carrier. There are no monthly fees to worry about or data restrictions on the number of files you can download. You are simply limited by the capacity of your memory card.As for the hardware, the full keyboard is probably the biggest selling point. Unlike other phones, the Nokia E75 keyboard is large and spacious, making it easy to type for both the smallest and largest of hands. The metal bar dividing the keyboard into two halves is an useful visual guide to remember where the characters are. Otherwise, the keyboard might look like a solid black (or red) block.The camera takes decent photos for e-mailing, web posting, etc. However, my favorite feature is the camera's ability to geo-tag photos, just like the iPhone. Any picture you take while out and about can be tagged with your exact GPS location at the moment the photo is taken. For those using Apple's iPhoto, when the pictures are uploaded they can be displayed on a map with a red pin indicating the location where the photos was taken.Finally, a short note about Nokia's Ovi Store - an online store where users can download applications. Compared to Apple's application store, Nokia's foray into the world of digital downloads is pretty pathetic. But quite frankly, given the phone's other features, many of which I clearly did not mention in this review, make up for the fact that you do not have access to thousands and thousands of applications, many of which are completely frivolous anyways. However, the store is adding new applications all the time so there may come a day when Nokia's Ovi Store may rival Apple's application store but that day seems pretty far off at this point.All in all this phone is fantastic. I am an Mac user and the Nokia E75 does a fairly good job at playing nice. There were a couple bugs here and there, but nothing severe.I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for an iPhone alternative with more productivity features.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "My 2 cents", "Author": "phone phreak \"dan mion\"", "ReviewID": "R1LTMWTXT5J1YU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this phone a few weeks ago...so here are my thoughts.Pros:Good call reception (AT&T;,NY region).Very solid build quality.Like the qwerty keyboard,great for text and email.Email set up a breeze.Fast user interface.

The HTC was a great phone but I had issues with it deleting contacts when it was sync'd which was completely unacceptable to me.I have owned several Nokia phones previously and the Symbian OS is hard to beat with its features. I'll agree with other reviews that state that it takes a bit of 'seek and destroy' to find various options and settings on this phone. On the other hand, it has a plethora of customization options.The phone is constructed very well and looks great to boot. Its ultra thin construction along with the extra length the front keypad add has made it somewhat difficult the find a quality case for this phone. The case included only provides bare minimum protection and it is not easy to remove the phone from it.The keyboard is relatively easy to use but takes some getting use to since it is completely flat. The buttons do provide good positive click feedback. I do wish the keyboard had a dedicated button to send text messages. As it stands now, you have to use multiple key clicks to send each text message.Text messages are not displayed in a linear, conversational format. Instead, they are divided into folders for Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc. It's not an issue for me but those coming from other smart phones may be bothered by this.The camera, as with almost all phones, is pretty lackluster. It will do in a pinch but it won't turn you into Ansel Adams by any means. It does have a built in flash which helps in dark situations.The Nokia PC Suite and included data cable make this phone a breeze to sync and tether.Battery life is excellent with Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off and entirely acceptable with either or both turned on.Sound quality is excellent at both ends of the conversation and the built in voice dialing feature works exceptionally well.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia E75 unlocked", "Author": "Blackquinn \"blackquinn\"", "ReviewID": "R2B2DAJ0TQY3XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my new nokia sometime after the first of June '09.

Stephan", "ReviewID": "R1V2VMJOC73ION", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First: The bad.I purchased this phone because my old phone, (a Sony Ericsson), broke. One week after I received the phone the internal screen broke/cracked on its own accord. I take amazing care of my phone and treat it with much TLC. I was very disappointed because Nokia phones are supposed to be the most durable and reliable. I talked to Amazon.com and they replaced it for free because it was in the first 30 days. Kudos to their customer service! Anyway, I received the replacement phone and so far the screen has not cracked. However, the 4GB MicroSD card keeps messing up. Sometimes when I slide the phone open to use the QWERTY keyboard it thinks that I've removed the memory card. It must be the jolt from the sliding action that is causing it to do this. I have to remove the MicroSD card and put it back in for it to read it. It is very annoying.The Good:As for he memory card problem; I formatted the card and since then it has only malfunctioned once. The OS for this phone is incredible. It's very intuitive and efficient. The phone itself is beautiful in its appearance. The QWERTY is the most comfortable to use phone-keyboard I have ever used. It is an incredible phone and even despite the bugs it has still been worth the money. Nokia really is the best. It may not be as beginner-friendly as, say, the iPhone but compared to the E75, most other phones (e.g. iPhone & Blackberry) seem so limited.I would recommend the E75 to anyone who wants a phone that can do almost everything that a $800 phone can, but doesn't want to spend a fortune.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent phone...but not at this price($399 AR)", "Author": "Yau Fong Chan \"Kylab\"", "ReviewID": "R2F1Y31XHH8C13", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought a E75 last Sat on Nokia Sale for $265 to replace my E51 that I really like.

Nokia phones have always been reliable, putting form with function nicely, and seeming to meet consumers' needs without going over-the-top with unnecessary whistles and bells.I've had the Nokia E75 for about 5 months now, putting it through its paces and using it to call, email, text, browse the web, find my way using Maps, record video clips, and send friends and family decent quality photos via email. It is fairly simple to get used to, and while some people may think Symbian is an outdated OS, I like it because I couldn't handle anything too complex. The best feature for me is the slide out Qwerty keyboard; it's just great and I am no fan of the touchscreen, so this is perfect. But because of the good design by Nokia, you can call and text with one hand if you need to via the albeit slightly cramped front keypad.The biggest drawback of this phone is that it has some software issues, and going by the discussion forums, Nokia isn't doing much about addressing these issues. The phone comes with a paltry internal memory of around 80Mb, but those Mbs soon get eaten up by the phone's own needs, and so by the time you've got the thing set up the way you like it, (and fans of Nokia won't be let down by how nicely you can customise the phone with how you want it to look/sound) you might only have around 20Mb spare, and that's even with all of your wallpaper images and music and tones stored on the Micro SD card! That 20Mb will gradually, mysteriously and frustratingly diminish to next-to-nothing, slowing the phone down and giving you 'low memory' warnings, and eventually you'll have to reset the device and start from scratch making it your own again. Nokia hasn't offered any explanation for this phenomenon, and I can't help but think that, if they'd not been so mean with internal memory in the first place and had given the E75, oh I dunno, 200Mb or even 1Gb, this wouldn't be a problem.But even with that, the phone is great. I love how it's so easy to send emails with photos, or quickly type out a text message. The Maps application saved my bacon driving around unknown parts of the country, and it's very useful walking around unfamiliar streets too. Speaking of Apps, the available ones via Nokia's OVI store are few and far between, and nothing like those available for the iPhone or Android, but to be honest, I just like keeping it simple anyway. I have Shazam, Flashlight (you never know) and a couple of arcade games, but apart from that, I am not too bothered about not being able to turn my lights off at home while I'm in the pub.As for battery, well I keep a second charged up in case I'm out and about all day, because with heavy use (calling, texting, GPS-ing and web browsing) the battery drains quickly by the end of the day. I have been caught out a few times when I have started the day off with 6 bars of full battery, and ended up using a payphone (!) to meet friends for an evening drink.The Nokia E75 is missing many of the super-cool new features that new smartphones have these days, but when it comes down to it, the E75 has what I want: a camera with a flash that takes decent pics and video clips, Wi-Fi for when signal isn't great, 3G capability (although not on my US network T-Mobile, but on Virgin Mobile UK), a good Maps application, decent WWW browsing, an easy-to-use calendar with helpful on screen reminders, superb QWERTY keyboard, and a useful Search feature, that dug out a phone number of a friend who had sent it to me in a text message weeks ago. Nice!Is the Nokia E75 perfect? Absolutely not. But it is a good, solid phone that looks nice and does the job well. I don't know how it would hold up in a really busy work environment with hundreds of emails coming and going each day, I wouldn't put my money on it being as good as say, a Blackberry. But for those of us who enjoy a top-quality device with decent features and not too many whistles and bells, the E75 has it.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost great", "Author": "Peter Argyropoulos", "ReviewID": "R30YYYYD4PJMT6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for about a month now. Previously I had an E51 which is smaller than the E75 but the phones are similar. The E75 has a bit more power under the hood from what I see and the larger screen is a plus. I didn't want a touchscreen for a number of reasons, and this is a perfect fit for useability.Overall, it performs well. Reception is good, visibility of the screen is good in all kinds of light, the buttons are easy to use, the keyboard is very handy (I have large hands and typical smartphone keyboards like the E61 are impossibly small), the camera is decent and the flash comes in handy at work (I sometimes need to take photos of parts in dark areas). The speakerphone is loud enough for me to use on most construction sites. The Wi-Fi functions well. The slide-out design of the keyboard make it more comfortable to use the internet since the screen orientation is better and the keys don't get in the way of what's on screen.The only real downer with this phone (and it's a big one so far) is how it reacts when it connects to the bluetooth hands-free in my truck which is built into the head unit. Every time I get in the truck and the phone pairs up it enters music mode and the music library screen opens. To use the phone, I have to close the music library first. This also seems to affect the reliability of the bluetooth connection. A few times after answering calls with the music library open and hanging up, the bluetooth system (also from Nokia) freezes and the head unit thinks the call is still active. This never happened with my E51 nor does it happen when I shut the music library before using the phone. The only way to unfreeze it is to shut bluetooth off and switch it back on a let the phone pair up again. Having to play with the phone this much while driving negates the safety aspects of using a hands free system in the first place. I called Nokia assistance about the music library starting automatically and was told that this is a built-in function that can't be turned off. I find that unacceptable in a phone designed for business use. The only other issue I'm having is with dirt getting under the screen protector. It's not a well sealed screen and tons of dust and even sand get in easily. Depending on where you use the phone, it might be a deal breaker.I'm happy with the phone and would recommend it to friends, but Nokia really needs to do something about the bluetooth starting the music library and they need to make sure that the screen is better protected.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great experience", "Author": "Paula Nunez", "ReviewID": "RR34QNM8ZQRKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great experience, cause I'm from Chile, and bought the phone during our summer vacations at the US.The first phone had a problem and AMAZON sent us a new one without having received yet the damaged one.Amazon makes you feel a VERY important customer, cause here in Chile we are not used to this client attention.So I recommend buying anything you need in AMAZON!!!", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Oustanding", "Author": "Paul R.

I upgraded the firmware, and now the Bluetooth asks me to connect.  There is no option to leave the Bluetooth always on (as far as I can find).  A plus is the keyboard quality.

I started up the device and had no problems, configured my e-mail started going through the phone's features and was very impressed.Unfortunately the devil is in the details with these devices, when I set up my mail for exchange it created two mailboxes, One called \"Mail for Exchange\" and one the name I chose in the wizard to identify it. I thought that was a bit odd so I decided to re-do it and removed both of the mailboxes and reset it up in the wizard, that was the last time mail for exchange ever worked. It retained old mailbox information that was uneditable, you hit change and absolutely nothing happened, it even survived a firmware reset via Nokia tech support. The mail log advised there was a ~System Failure and Nokia tech support advised me to return it.So great device mostly but major features not working due to what may be a software glitch on Day 3?
