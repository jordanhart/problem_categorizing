Its not a smartphone but I really don't want one.  I don't want to surf the internet on a 3 inch screen for a couple of hours.  I want to quickly check the weather or a movie time.  I want clear calls and above average pictures.  This phone delivers on all counts. Plus its kinda cool that it was used in James Bond movie.  Call me old fashioned but I plan on keeping this phone for at least 2 more years.  Then.....maybe a smartphone.. will have to see.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "it works for me, its ok", "Author": "Maikol Cortes Ezeta", "ReviewID": "R3GQWOIPEA94JL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "sometimes this divice turns off by itself, thats toooo bad. but anyway what can one do.v v v v", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Backup phone", "Author": "prakas", "ReviewID": "RCZ54C0Y90PHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Has good features but the sound quality is not as w700 series. key board is little tricky. have not used much just bought it have it handy as backup", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "not 2 happy", "Author": "carylon", "ReviewID": "R3IB8S7XGXBN41", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i dont know if its my phone but its turnin off by its self an when u send a call it has a 2 sec delay but other dan dat everything works dam gud", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$137.89", "Features": "2G Network - GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\nDisplay - 2.0 TFT, 240x 320, 256K colors\nAccelerometer sensor for screen auto rotate\nSound - Alert types Vibration; Downloadable polyphonic, MP3, AAC ringtones; Speakerphone\nInternal memory - 160 MB", "Name": "Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot C902 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HUoS1NYUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001AXDNBY"}}
