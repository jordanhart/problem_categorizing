Even worked with my fingernail, most have to have flesh touch screen. I went with at&t; because of the data plan. I bought a phone from them,in ONE day I was out of 50mb data, T mobile 30MB lasted a whole month. When my plan is up in 28days, I'm going back to t mobile and will be using this phone again. The only thing I would like is if it had a wider face on it. All and all very satisfied with this phone.Added 2/22/13This phone also can be used on the straight talk plan, beause it is a Tmobile phone. I really like this phone, it has a clock that will wake you up, even if you shut the phone off! It will turn itself on and ask if you want it to shut off again. Many phones don't have that feature on it. the camera is not bad, takes fairly good pictures. No front camera. Has a dedicated camera switch on side. The memory card as well as the sim card it put in on the side of the phone. So no need to remove the battery. It is not an android phone, so am not able to use play store on this phone. You need to go to nokia and download apps from their site.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "decent phone for the price", "Author": "Gerard0224", "ReviewID": "R3HEIJZ9TF44TQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this at a competitor for $129 to replace my Motorola W370 on my T-Mobile Pre-Paid cell phone account in March 2011. The pluses at the time was a) a touch screen phone for under $150,  b) a bigger screen than I had. The Nuron screen is 3.2 inches,  c) GPS navigation to replace my stolen TomTom.  A year and 9 months later, the phone is still going strong.  I've dropped it on the ground, in the water, and used it in the rain many many times, and it still works fine.  It did freeze up on me about five times when I first bought it. But once I stopped leaving multiple apps open and installed a micro SD card, it ran just fine. I also removed some of the apps I didn't need.  As a phone its a 5 (does what its suppose to, never dropped my calls unexpectedly)...as a music player its a 4 (sound is crystal clear)... as a video player its a 3 (this phone operates on 2G and 3G WiFi. And by now everyone knows that 3G videos will pause and show pixels. Also, now that most phone and data companies have invested in 4G technology, they will intentionally slow down your through put speed. But hay, now that I have a Kindle Fire, I don't watch videos on my phone much anyway...as a navigation device its a 3.5 (would have given it 4 if it had a bigger screen). It has two types of navigation apps installed. The first is Telenav GPS Navigation, which is a talking turn by turn system that is free for one year(at that time). Telenav will still be in your apps menu if you want a day pass at $2.99 or a month for $4.99. By the way, I just did a device update a week ago and now its going to give me 30 free days of Telenav. The other navigation system is called Ovi Maps and its free all the time but doesn't talk(its an app exclusive for Nokia). They are both accurate and the great thing about the Ovi map is that I can use my finger to move the map view to the left, right, up, or down, thereby viewing streets quickly even before I get to them. Also I can view my cars position in landscape or portrait. Still, this is not a TomTom or a Garmin, but it will get you where you wanted to go. I definitely got my moneys worth with this phone and just remember to buy a screen protector to protect from scratches since its not gorilla glass.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Durable as a brick", "Author": "J. Hartung", "ReviewID": "R1TNAM10JRDA2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for over 2 years now and can attest to the durability of this phone.  After about a year and a half, the paint started chipping off the phone, but only in very small amounts.  And mind you, part of that is my fault from dropping it, letting my toddler hold it, and putting it in my pocket with my keys.  I have dropped it from approximately 4 feet onto solid, tiled floor on multiple occasions, and the only problem I have had is that it now turns off randomly.  Not bad considering some phones stop working all together (or shatter) when dropped from that distance.  Also, the battery life has been pretty good over the first 1.5 years, but it now only lasts a little over a day and a half with moderate texting.  Probably just needs a new battery.My only major complaint is that the camera is pretty ho-hum when it come to image quality, and after taking a picture, it cannot be permanently rotated in the image gallery.  You have to access it via a computer to rotate it, and then you have to save the changes.  Not a huge problem, just annoying.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE ONE", "Author": "Olatunde Stephen", "ReviewID": "R2638TY9OBQN1N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LIKE THE CELL PHONE....

So if you think this is a good low budget phone, it completely is not. Let me tell you why I think this phones completely blows and why it shouldn't be purchased by even the people that are switching from flip phones ect. First of all it does come with a free Micro SD card with 4gigs which is the only plus I saw from getting this phone. Now I used it for quite a while and boy did it start going downhill from there. It literally freezes once your SD card is full and it become so slow and laggy. So what I have to do personal is take out the SD card and turn it on and then put it back on. The web browsing is a disaster. The screen resolution is so poor I think a gameboy advance has more clarity. I may be exaggerating a little but I can tell you there are way better budget phones that are ANDROID. This phone is not android just so you know. It is pretty durable since the screen is plastic, yes it is plastic. Takes decent pictures for its 2 mega pixel camera but when browsing picture, especially if there a lot, when loading the phone crashes so you have to take the battery out turn it back on ext. I would recommend a T-Mobile Samsung T679 Exhibit II 4G Prepaid Android Smartphone which is at 174 not much more money than this phone which is not even android so if your looking for a budget phone check that phone out which is android. The Nokia 5230 was an innovation for prepaid phones back in the days but now that it is outdated and still has the same HIGH price the best choice would be for a better phone. After a while of having it, it gets pretty annoying especially since the font and the layout is really outdated and looks more like the flip phones which I really despise. Over all I think this phone is horrible and again do not, I repeat do not buy this phone because of the price, because it is not worth it and I would suggest to go for an Android that meets up with its value even if it cheap. The T-Mobile Samsung T679 Exhibit II 4G Prepaid Android Smartphone runs at a price of 174 and compared to the Nokia which is at a surprisingly high price for its value of 130 I think sacrificing 40 more dollars is much more worth it. Well thanks and I hope my review is help full to those who are thinking of buying this phone.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good feature phone. Lasts for years. Compact.", "Author": "Danae Green", "ReviewID": "R1FL0R5M5K7TL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this phone for nearly 4 years. It is not a smartphone. But it does do a lot of things smartphones do. It is a good phone if you want something smarter than a plain phone but aren't ready for a full smart phone. (I jokingly called it my \"training phone\" since smartphones were a bit too complicated for me back then).  I keep it in my pocket with my keys. Never had a problem with screen damage. Now years later, the screen is a little less responsive on occasion. But no damage (And I work in construction and drop it ALL the time) I do have a little rubber/gel cover on it but no screen protector. In 4 years, I have had to factory reset it once because it was getting glitchy. Worked perfectly since. Most people don't keep their phones that long anyway.Pros:It is small. (Much smaller than a full smartphone) It fits in the pocket easily, even next to my huge keyring.The virtual qwerty keyboard is better than the ones on android. The shift key is your friend there too. Texting is a breeze.I love the manual lock button and the physical home, call and back buttons.It has some nice voice activated features.Tons of storage thanks tot he micro SD card.You can rearrange and shortcut lots of apps like on smartphones and the menus are pretty intuitive.The touchscreen works well even 4 years later. Notice the edge of the phone is raised - that protects the screen even when I don't have it in a cover.The address book allows for plenty of details per entry. Alarms and other features are well-done.Camera is very easy to get to and use. Does video and pictures, and does very well for just 2 megapixels.Easy to pull the microSD card and easy to connect to a computer for direct downloads.If you hate typing, there is a stylus and handwriting text entry option. It works very well if you want to just write notes. The American version doesn't come with a stylus built in, but you can purchase a new back cover with built in stylus for a few bucks. Totally worth it if you want to use the handwriting text entry. Same strokes as the old Palm/Treo etc.Cons:The screen and menus are easy to re-arrange but you can accidentally delete things forever in the process. So just be careful as you are doing it.The camera is 2 megapixels and has no flash. After you take a picture, you must hit \"back\" to take another. (Like most older phones)Unlike android smartphones you can't download apps as easily.The Ovi store isn't as good as google. But I did get some cool apps and games.The GPS never worked well for me.Internet is slower than on modern smartphones. But does work. (I only used it for a year or so, then decided I didn't need internet)Overall:I like the phone. It is a good, small size workhorse. I am now ready for a smartphone but am having trouble finding one this small. The few that are this small aren't worth the upgrade. I may end up keeping this phone for a good long while!", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "PHONE WORKS", "Author": "Paula Justen", "ReviewID": "RJYATWA75LT1C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "HARD TO FIND EVERYTHING ON THIS PHONE BUT IT WORKS OK FOR ME AND I USE IT FOR TEXTING AND CALLS", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "It sucks", "Author": "bryceb", "ReviewID": "R2NF2C3HN3Z74N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is constantly requesting system updates, which is annoying, and it started immediately closing apps and texting the second I open them.
