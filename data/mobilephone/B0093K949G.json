{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R2OGEPKOG362KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone since it first came out which was years and years ago. After having a ton of different smart phones, ect I always tend to switch back to this phone. I am highly addicted to getting new cell phones but I am very hard on phones. This phone has seen it's share of dropping in water, smashing off the ground, and occasionally smashing off the wall since it's my nephews favorite thing to do right now. It is still working fine as the day I bought it, although the look of it diffidently shows wear on it but who can complain after having a phone for years. This is the only phone that has not gone into the trash from being broke.Only down fall I have on this phone is the camera isn't the best. If you aren't worried that much about a camera and want something that's easy to use this is defiantly the phone for you. I have also noticed that sometimes the phone shuts off when I go into my pictures but this just recently starting happening. I am assuming from dropping it in water at least 45 different times since I have owned this is most likely the cause to this little problem. Other then that the phone still works great. I highly recommend this to anyone who is on a budget or anyone is is hard on phones like I am. My 8 year old nephew can easily use this phone as well. He loves to play the games that I have one it.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "My First Phone", "Author": "bobblelover", "ReviewID": "R3OM58NPHPUEH0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone was my first phone and i absolutely LOVED it. It was a great starter phone with a great touch feedback touch screen and a wonderfully easy to manuever keyboard. This phone was great and simple, everything anyone could  NEED in a phone. Unfortunately after 1 year and a month my microphone died. Nobody could hear what i said when i called them :( it was awful but don't be  discouraged because i think mine may have been defective. I would have probably used this phone for 5 more years if it weren't for this. Now i have the iPhone and i can't believe i actually miss this phone.

The keypad is very wide and easy to text with, really like it. But surprised by the answer buttons, they aren't actually buttons but are touch screen symbols. So far, a great little messaging phone!

She likes it, it is a little touch sensitive though which doesn't make it very easy for her to learn how to use a touch screen.  Seems durable.  I do like that the screen moves sideways when you flip open to the full keyboard.  Haven't figured out how to do everything on it yet, but it's a decent phone for the price.  Not a bad texting phone.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok butvworst touch screen", "Author": "sexy bae", "ReviewID": "R1GB0YNC3VKON2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone is good on sum things but the touch.

First it does not come unlocked and the touch screen was impossible.This a definite case of you get what you pay for! It's like other reviews you read that say for a little more money I could have a good product.

It's small, light weight, has a great touch screen, ok camera, a qwerty keyboard, and decent battery life and great reception. I use it more to text than to call. The charger port for this phone is bazaar though, only one other person I know has the same charger as I do and it's for a flip phone from 7 years ago.The worst thing about this phone is the reboot glitch. I've had two of these phones now. The first one worked great for the first three days and then whenever I tried to call someone the phone would reboot. I brought it into the store, they said they couldn't fix it so they replaced it instead. Simple and easy. However, three years later, the replacement phone repeats this glitch. Whenever I try to call someone or someone calls me, instead of working, the phone reboots. Every. Time. Texting still works fine for some reason, but say good bye to all your calls.I love this phone. I hate the new full touch screen phones that are bigger than my hand and can't fit into any of my pockets. If it weren't for the fact that this reboot glitch keeps happening to me, I would get this phone again.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only worked for a week!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R14QMBQ37I697C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter loved this phone but after about a week it started getting really hot when it was being charged and would get stuck in the loading screen when you turned it on.  Even taking the battery out wouldn't get it out of that screen.  I bought a new battery and chrger, thinking maybe one of those may have been defective.  It was fine for about three days, then the same thing started happening again.  I returned it for a full refund with no problem.  I have since read that others have had the same problem.  It's too bad because it would have been a perfect phone for my 13-year old.  :(", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0093K949G"}}
