{"Reviews": [{"Title": "misunderstood flaws", "Author": "Natasha Hardina", "ReviewID": "R1GM8WLJCIOCTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this phone for a year and I didn't like it for the same reasons a lot of other people didn't. It would make calls in my pocket and automatically change the home-screens without permission because the screen wouldn't stay locked in my pocket. Otherwise, I had loved the phone for being one of the few \"dumb\" phones that is still pretty up to date, like having a touch screen. I had dropped my phone a thousand times and it was still a trooper and worked every time. I reordered the same phone despite the problems I had and hearing that the home-screen \"magically\" stops working. When I programmed the phone I choose the setting that said \"Lock key only\" meaning the only way to unlock the front screen is to press the unlock button on the side of the phone and none of the front buttons will work which gave it the appearance that the front screen wasn't working. That setting (and understanding that setting) fixed all the problems I had with the phone and the ones I read on the amazon reviews. So the negative review on this phone (phone calls in the pocket, home-screen pictures changing, and flawed front screen) is really just misunderstanding how the phone works. I would give this phone 5 stars but it took me a year to figure out how to properly use the home-screen lock function.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Coool.", "Author": "MyPenNameOkayCool", "ReviewID": "R1AY7NBXXRRK9G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay so I've had this phone for about a year.In my opinion it's a trooper.I had spilt canola oil on the screen and except for darkening the screen,it worked fine.I'm very clumsy so naturally I dropped it ALOT,and except for the paint chipping a bit it worked lovely.The Cons are that it freezes if you overwork it or the graphics are a bit poor but otherwise it's great!I love my little trooper <3", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone according to son", "Author": "rgoodi", "ReviewID": "R1LSBVTK7ESE3V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to replace one just like it that was, \"ahem\" inadvertantly, destroyed.

As far as the use of the phone, the screen doesn't respond as well because of some of the scuffs, and in some places it wasn't responding for me at all. I couldn't get to the main menu or the messages at all, so I couldn't even program the thing to use it. I was buying this as a replacement phone because my current phone drops calls but I've had mine for 2.5 years and it's in WAY better shape than this.
