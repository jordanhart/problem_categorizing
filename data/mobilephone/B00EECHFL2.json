It was delivered on time, but when I got it the phone never came on. I thought the device itself was not functioning, however on having it checked by a technician it was discovered the battery is faulty. I live in the Caribbean and it would cost me too much money to send back tthe item. To date I have not been able to locate a battery, so the Phone is just sitting there.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EECHFL2"}}
