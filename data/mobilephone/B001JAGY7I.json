At the time of researching I thought this was the best windows based phone on the market. Keep in mind I'm upgrading from the Moto Q (for 3 years), and had the Treo for 2 months.First impression is its a solid phone and most of the weight comes from the battery that surprisingly does not need to be charged but once every 3 days even when I've used it for an hour a day of talk time. In all honestly I would not consider this a revolutionary phone but more of a evolution of the older windows based phones. Has all the basic windows features you would come to expect, ie mail, calendar, server exchange, phone basics... nothing really really exciting other then the touch screen that isn't that sensitive or functional. Lucky for me the other buttons are easy to navigate. I will also mention that the keyboard is very small and spaced close together so big fingers will hate this. (I read other reviews and saw this before buying the phone) All and all just a avg smart phone and slight upgrade to my Q. No kool apps like the Droid or Iphone so don't get your hopes up. And touchscreen is almost useless.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellet", "Author": "Victor Raul Castillo", "ReviewID": "R2YACCH3TKLCDO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "in spite the palm is very good, the seller sent me a wrong model, i say they sent a CDMA and i purchased a GSM model, so i lost my money, because i am iun vzla and in almost imposible to send it back.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "256MB Storage, 100MB available\n2.0-Megapixel camera with video capture\nPalm shortcuts for ease of use\nTouchscreen and full keyboard\nMicrosoft Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional Edition", "Name": "PALM 1065NA Treo Pro Quad Band GSM Smartphone - Unlocked", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/216CR7nCsaL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001JAGY7I"}}
