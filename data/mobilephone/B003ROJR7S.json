The screen, sure it looks small, but when you compare it to the Iphone it is just a little smaller, and does not have all the bulkiness that an Iphone has. Another thing do not be afraid of the words International Version, many of these phones will come from the middle east and that is why that term. Note, because they come from the middle east their android marketplace is restricted to nothing. Easy fix, many of the phones will come pre-installed with android 1.6 on them, so simply download pc companion on your computer by inserting the provided data cable into the computer, and then you have android 2.1, which also features the android marketplace, and a few other tweaks here and there. I would recommend getting some kind of skin or cover to prevent your phone from scratching, as well as screen protectors.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "What's their problem?", "Author": "Matthew Brenengen", "ReviewID": "R1KCAFJY2GYDBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't get the negative reviews on this site - they are not nearly as bad for other sellers.  I wanted to counter the negative because I really love my SE X10 Mini.  \"It's Small\"  Well, of course it is.  If you need a bigger screen, get a bigger phone.  I guess I have good eyes.  The text is tiny on the news readers, etc., but I don't have any problem with it.  It syncs with my Kindle automatically, and I don't have any problem at all reading books on it.  The resolution of the screen is not as good as an iPhone or the Samsung my dad owns; it would be nice to have better resolution, but it is good enough.\"The screen stays black when you are on the phone.\"  It has a proximity sensor, but if you hold it away from your head and count to two, it turns on.  Problem solved.\"The battery sucks.\"  I don't know how they are using it, and maybe from this seller, they don't have the same battery (I don't know, maybe it is a counterfeit or something), but if I turn my on at 7am, it still works at 11:30p (barely, but it does).  I am connected to Google Latitude, so it is sending out GPS coordinates every 5 minutes, which I have to think is taking extra juice - nonetheless, I make it for the whole day.  And actually, during the week when I am in the office, I run Napster off the phone and have it plugged in and charging, so it is never a problem.  BTW Napster streaming over my wireless network works great on this phone.\"The charger connector seems weak.\"  I agree, that the connector cover is the worst part of the phone, not because I think it will break, but because after I cut my fingernails, I can't get it open for a week and have to use a x-acto knife or get my wife to do it.\"It's hard to text with T-9.\"  This is all I have ever known, and I don't have a problem with it.\"No android market.\"  What?  Maybe that was a long time ago.  Trust me, the market is one of the default icons, and everything runs on this phone.  It gets \"lot's of different apps\" and \"keeps me entertained for hours.\"  BTW, get the flashlight app that turns the super-bright LED into a flashlight.  It rocks.  So does the Kindle software, the police scanner and the Places app.Again, I have to say that most of the problems the reviewers sited are because they hadn't learned how to use the phone yet.  I have been using it for about three months and LOVE it.  It is light and the Android 2.2 operating system works great.  So there.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone if you upgrade the OS", "Author": "Mixster", "ReviewID": "R19HZE34M6GY1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is pretty decent phone and considering I wanted a phone that is factory unlocked and works outside the US. My current phone is the iPhone 4 but is locked to ATT and I am not ready to pay enormous fees to ATT when I travel outside the US. I looked at many phones before settling on this one. Here are the reasons:1. Need a smaller phones, fits easily in any pocket.2. Good battery life (more on that later)3. Great features and capacitive touch screen (very important).Buyers beware that if you buy the international version of the X10 mini, the 3G frequency band is different and will not work with ATT on 3G. However, the phone will switch to the slower 2G (edge) speeds in the US. It may work with TMobile as one of the band is common. I did not test that.Now on to the interesting stuff. The X10 mini ships with the Android 2.1 and there are how-tos on the web that will let you upload a custom ROM specifically tailer for this phone! I am running Android 2.3.1 and gives me multi-touch and what not. The battery life is much much better. The original installed ROM is ancient. Sony Ericsson will not push a newer  update so look around and google for the updated ROM. The process is a bit involved but well worth it.Fior less than $190 on amazon you cant go wrong with this cell phone. Touch screen, Android OS, Wifi, GPS, Camera..you name it, it has it.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty decent tiny phone", "Author": "David Gohlke", "ReviewID": "R35NYWF87HQHII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a pretty decent phone.  Everybody is in shock about how small the phone is (smaller than a credit card, half inch thick), but it fits well in my hand for phone calls.  The screen is the same size as a Nokia N95, and bigger than any feature phone I know about, so I'm not squinting just to see what I'm looking at.  The 320x240 resolution does prevent some programs from being installed (notably swype), and forces T9 prediction as the standard.  Since that's what I was using previously, it works fine for me.  The screen looks good, and I haven't had any problems with it being too cluttered.The very first thing I did was upgrade to Android 2.1 through the Sony Ericsson software, so I can't speak directly about the OS as sold.  With 2.1 though, it does integrate quite well with my google account.The native browser isn't great, and this is probably partially due to the screen resolution (need to zoom for most every page).  Also, I've had a lot of sites send me to their main page, instead of their mobile page, though there might be a setting to change that.  It's definitely usable as is though.You can run 4 programs from the corners of the phone, as well as add several widgets for other programs.  The notification bar is easily accessible except when in a few full-screen programs.  There are a handful of programs that I will never use that I am unable to uninstall (without rooting the phone, I hear, but I won't bother with that).Because Sony Ericsson has limited their OS to 2.1, you can't install apps directly to the memory card.  The phone memory is a bit on the low side, and so I've needed to be prudent in my installations.  (For instance, Angry Birds + Angry Birds Rio took up about a quarter of the phone's space, so one of them had to go.)The phone comes with both the colored cover and the black cover, so they can be switched as wanted.There is no optical zoom on the camera, and the native software is incredibly low-featured.  Auto, Macro, Twilight and Sports are the settings, and flash can be turned on or off.I have 2G signal through T-mobile with this phone (it doesn't have the correct bands for 3G or 4G in the US).  I can see that I have 2G through AT&T;, as well, though no roaming agreement here.  The GPS gets a quick lock and the navigation recalculates almost instantaneously (went out of my way to check that one).For the most part I'm happy.  I've seen a few minor bugs, and a few things I'd like to change (multiple widgets per screen would be nice), but after a month it seems to be more robust than most other phones I've owned.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "javier castillo", "Author": "javier", "ReviewID": "R3IVVEKGS44NQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excelente producto vendedor muy responsable y el empaque muy bien preparado excelente producto vendedor muy responsable y el empaque muy bien preparado", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cool little phone, poorly produced.", "Author": "Dave B", "ReviewID": "R2TF0ADF3MOVZ6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this free with an 18 month contract in the Dominican Republic.

I googled how to manually install it and there are no options for that. Someone suggested AppBrain, i signed up for that, but once I try to go to the webpage, its an error code. Manually installing apps will be a hassle as you have to be somewhat familiar with rooting, flashing and whatnot far as the phone goes. I have flashed phones, and I can jailbreak and pretty good with the that stuff, but this is tiring, just to get ONE APP that was my sole reason for getting the phone in the first place. Getting this phone is like buying a Mercedes that does not have an engine. You get all the bells and whistles, but the STAR of it is missing. I wanted a phone where I could get lots of different apps and be entertained for hours on end, but this phone definitely let me down.I will be returning this first thing in the morning, as I dont have the time or the patience to mess around with various softwares and scour the net for files just to get the android market app. My advice to those who are thinking of purchasing unlocked phones, make sure you ask if the phone has the android market icon present.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Small and looks nice but the software is horrible...", "Author": "bool", "ReviewID": "R1UJOWM853R9X6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone based on my past good experience with Sony Ericsson phones. The fact that it was small and light made it attractive despite the cost.After a 30-day trial I can say that the software is flawed and it was a complete waste of money. The problems I encountered are as follows:- The phone has no ear-distance detector during a call. So if you need to access the keypad and bring the phone away from your ear, the screen stays black. Pressing the home or return keys bring the LCD back for a little while but then the screen goes dark again randomly in the middle of your entry! So annoying!- The battery is horrible. Being a new phone, I had to recharge at least once or twice a day or it would run dead.- The charger connector on the phone is protected by a little piece of plastic that requires you to push your nail on the edge and pull. I totally see this mechanism not lasting more than 3 months of use.- The texting software is a disgrace. Text predicting does not work to catch apostrophes and there is no way to ignore the suggestions and keep your input entry! The suggestion takes over upon you hitting the space key. Of course the multi-taping option is available but to me it is too time consuming and a thing of the past. The spanish version predicts words with accents which yield an error upon submission (accents are not understood by the carrier!)All said, the one positive I did find is the sound. After all it is a Sony! But sound reproduction does not make a good phone. At $300 this is an expensive option, when we have way superior phones like the iPhone and Droid selling for the same price(w/contract).My advice: DO NOT BUY!", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "A waste of money", "Author": "Kenneth", "ReviewID": "R3OE9ND8OTKP3H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I almost make a entire review for this phone but you know what it isnt worth it.
