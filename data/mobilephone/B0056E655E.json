Woodward", "ReviewID": "R3FG8JF9Q8R1WQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a smartphone with a small learning curve for my wife (an admitted technophobe) yet with powerful features for me. Windows Phone 7 seemed to be the right operating system, and since we are on Sprint, The HTC Arrive was the only choice available. After reading the mostly positive reviews online and checking into the OS updates (much has been improved since the original Windows Phone 7 was released) I got two of these as free upgrades. Setup was a breeze, but required some patience. The phones continued to detect and recommend updates to various apps as well as the OS itself for a couple of days. My wife (the technophobe) was able to set up her \"people\" hub to include all of her email addresses and social networking sites quickly and without help. The Windows version of the App store contains about 60,000 apps, which is more than enough to chose from, and navigation of the store and downloading apps are easy from the phone or a host computer. The phone comes pre-loaded with some useful free apps (including satnav) and is designed to work with Microsoft Office in all its iterations. Fans of the X-Box will find easy integration between that system, Windows Live, and Windows Phone. For managing files and media, the phone integrates with \"Zune\" (sort of a replacement for Media Center) which must be downloaded to a host computer. It works well enough, and it maintains separate accounts for each phone connected. It even gives the option to let someone log on as a guest, should a friend with a W7 phone need to do so. I had read that one could use MP3 files for ring tones and system sounds, however this is not as easy as it sounds. Files must be a specific size and length, and they don't automatically show up in your ring tones list. Fortunately a third party app called \"easyRingtones and Music\" makes the process simple. This was my first downloaded app. The phone's hardware seems solid and well designed, for the most part. The slide-out keyboard tilts so the phone may be placed on a flat surface, looking like a tiny laptop. The on-screen keyboard is logical and efficient, and a digital stylus is available for those who have difficulty with hitting the keys accurately. One design issue that I had trouble getting used to is the three navigation keys at the bottom of the phone's screen. They are, from left to right, a \"back\" button that takes you back one screen, a \"home\" button that returns you to main menu screen, and my nemesis, a search button that takes you a \"Bing\" web search screen. My nemesis because it's located in the lower right part of the screen, and I'm prone to touching it with my little finger when I'm holding the phone in my left hand. I can't count the number of times I've been doing something and suddenly \"Bing\" pops up. I believe this can be disabled and/or the sensitivity adjusted, but I haven't taken the time to work it out. Still, it's a minor annoyance and likely partially my fault due to the way I hold the phone. Call quality is excellent. It supports 3G but not 4G, however that's of little concern to us as there is no 4G service near us anyway. All in all, this is an great phone with a very usable operating system, and as a free upgrade you can't argue with the price. It's just the phone we needed.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "1 year later, it's still a great phone", "Author": "hysonmb", "ReviewID": "RBHX977OPLYR1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a Sprint customer and a fan of Windows Phone 7, the Arrive was my only option to get the OS I wanted on a handset. Luckily, at the time I wanted to stick with the QWERTY slider form factor so it was a perfect match. Being a Windows Phone 7 device, you know already that it is required to meet the guidance set by Microsoft for WP7 devices. This means a consistent experience that is always smooth and has very minimal fragmentation which is really only apparent in major updates as they roll out from the carriers. This is one area where Sprint has been great with WP7 as updates are released promptly.The hardware itself is well made for a professional device. It has a good look and feel though it is a bit heavy when compared to the average device on the market today. That is made up for in the stability of the phone and the great performance of the keyboard. It does not have a massive screen and typing on it can get cramped as there is very little screen real estate for the keyboard and whatever you're entering text into. This is resolved in a big way with the tilting screen which pops out of the way while you access the keyboard. One downfall, not the phone, is that not all applications are designed to recognize the landscape mode. This can result in typing in landscape while the screen is still in portrait. It's not a big problem and certainly not a deal breaker as the on-screen keyboard is still not a bad choice in portrait.Battery life is good. I could get through a full day to include playing music on the way to work and back, playing a couple of games, surfing a couple of websites, and taking a few pictures which were automatically uploaded to my SkyDrive. I work in an area that has low coverage and sometimes none so the phone used some extra battery power searching for service during the day as well.After seeing this phone, a few of my iOS and Android friends have decided to switch to Windows Phone when they are up for upgrades again. I personally only let mine go because my family decided to change carriers to AT&T.;", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon and Retailer did a fine job!", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "R14OWPSXMMOU6D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon and the retailer did a fantastic job as they described, provided I get my refund when they receive the phone back to them.  The phone itself is what I have a problem with. It would not allow incoming calls and Sprint could not connect it to data. I believe that the phone itself is outdated.

I really like having a keyboard to type on, rather than just a screen.  I bought this phone after owning a Galaxy S2 for that reason.  At first the screen tilt can be a little annoying, but I got used to it fast.\\The Windows Phone OS is really streamline and works without any glitches.  The only flaw is that the Microsoft app store is practically empty compared to the Android or iOS marketplaces.  And as one who listens to a lot of Pandora radio, I was disappointed to learn that there is no official Pandora app for Windows phones, and there are no plans for one to be made.  There are some 3rd party Pandora apps you can use, but they don't seem to work as well and crash a lot.Overall, good phone, good OS, nearly worthless app store.  Hopefully now that the surface and Windows 8 are out people will start developing more apps for Windows devices, but if not, it will be back to Android for me.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R1A5F9BGIG9177", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love the phone!

Other reviewers are right that this is a business phone, or put differently, a productivity phone. I am a mobile gadget enthusiast, but also an attorney who relies on this device as a workhorse for emails, simple document review, and a wide range of web-based information.  Therefore, despite the very attractive devices coming out now - Lumia 920, SGS3, iPhone 5 - I may stick with this phone for another release cycle and even beyond my contract term.Why?Reason #1 is the superb keyboard on the Arrive. On screen keyboards do the job but only with more fuss than a physical kb, and only while obscuring 2/3 of the screen.  The staggered backlit keys, dedicated number row, angled keyboard (lending to nice balance and viewing angle when typing), dedicated arrow keys, and clicky action represent the best of mobile keyboards.  This is a phone I can write with - type, edit, save/send.  The creation of text is not some afterthought, to be designed around with autocorrect and SwiftKey (both of which are good, and make onscreen typing bearable).  The on-screen keyboard is also fine, and I use that for texting and other short bursts of text.Reason #2 - the swappable battery (and good battery life in general). I haven't needed to take along an extra battery often, but it is an excellent failsafe when travelling. Removable batteries have given way to the race for thinness, and so most flagship devices have sealed-in batteries (Samsung is a notable exception). That's a shame.Reason #3 is that this is just a durable and competent device. The Snapdragon processor still keeps up, and WP doesn't get gummed up and slow down over time like Android devices of the same vintage have. This is also a hardy device that survived a 30 foot drop from a carnival ride on to a metal platform and a few other dings here and there (though I have taken good care of it otherwise).Reason #4 - this is a phone which MAY be able to get flashed from Sprint to a prepaid service on a much cheaper plan. At that point, the various economies of staying with this workhorse device become quite significant.Counterpoint (for productivity users): Windows Phone 8 does promise some strides in SkyDrive and Office syncing. There are promises of making these backward-compatible to Windows 7.5. If WP8 offers real advances in how phones sync with x86 computers, the web and other mobile devices (such as the forthcoming Windows RT tablets), then that's a consideration.Mobile tech is moving forward, but, it seems, more in the realm of media / web consumption and, to some extent, camera capability. But the complete absence of good physical keyboards from the smartphone market shows in part that productivity / business use has taken a back seat to an iPhone-led beauty contest. The Arrive modestly stands on its own as a remnant of a stronger business users' market and hopefully as a form factor that will return soon.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Jack Manfred", "ReviewID": "RS6B3Y3O4JIA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I switched to this phone from a Samsung Android phone, and there is simply no comparison in the OS finish and fluidity, stability and ease of use, leaving Windows 7.5 leaps and bounds ahead of its competition.  The Arrive's hardware/software integration is seamless, and on a par with any premium handset.Microsoft did a great job in partnering with HTC and ensuring the final product works effortlessly with all Microsoft/Windows software.  HTC's fit and finish is once again only at a par with Apple's, but much more to my liking with metal and high grade plastics rather than glass all over, which in the iPhone always made me feel like I carried one of my mother's glass/porcelain figurines in my hand, afraid of breakage at every turn.Make no mistake, this is a business phone, and definitely the best of breed at that.  The keyboard is excellent, and the total integration with Office, Skydrive, LinkedIn, Lync and multimedia/podcasting is astonishing.  I have used a BlackBerry in the past also, and this single model defies the relevance of both BBOS and the design concepts RIM has brought to market with sliding keyboards in the past, with keys smaller than their regular keyboards.  SMS and email integration is the bow on a perfect package for the business user, as well as a student, or any other user who values ease of use and extreme functionality.The HTC Arrive is a great bargain at this price, which is almost the same as one would pay for so many lesser devices today under contract.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of my favorites =)", "Author": "ALittleLoopy", "ReviewID": "RXKALET5HXTJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I loved this phone at first. I ended up replacing it with an iPhone 4s, which I half regret now. I still take this one out every once in a while, and think about going back. I adore the UI, the battery life is decent (far better than the iPhone's is, but that's not difficult), and it's fairly easy to add your own touch to the phone. I like how customizable the front screen is. Admittedly, I never used it for much other than texting and calling. It has no good apps, and not a whole lot of apps in general. But it's a nice phone, fairly light compared to older phones I've had, but heavy compared to my iPhone.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sprint HTC Arrive Windows 7 Smart Phone", "Author": "C.

I have not found any defects after almost a month of service. Windows 8 is taking some time to get used to. There were a few settings (e.g. font size and an easier on/off system) on the Blackberry Curve I had, but this phone is out of the Blackberry's league.One problem is the redial or flash to call area at the top of the phone's screen. I kept hitting it with my ear and hanging up on people. Another is the placement of the volume button. Your hand/fingers support the phone right at that button while typing and using the camera (any landscape use).Overall I think this is a fine product.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid smartphone for business", "Author": "CapnHands95", "ReviewID": "R74CSTZNLFSH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Solid functioning with slick and easy to navigate interface.  Comes with Microsoft office applications and bare minimum pre-loaded apps so there isn't alot of \"junk\" taking up memory that you find on other popular phone OS's.  No buggy issues or lock-ups to date after a year of use.  Quality physical construction with as perfect as they come touch screen operation.  Nice slide out physical keyboard for those of us who prefer that to touch screen keyboard.  Flawless bluetooth and Wifi capabilities..  Good sound and crisp screen resolution with nice camera picture quality.  Plenty of memory for pictures, videos and mp3s and solid interface with PCs.  Xbox live integration is a nice touch for those interested.Cons:As stated in other reviews, don't look for alot of customization of ringtones and sounds.  Color schemes are limited as well.  While there are alot of apps available for this phone I've found that many popular apps on other phones are not available for the Windows OS.  You will find bigger screens on other phones compared to the narrow one this sports.  Touch functions on the bottom of the screen are easy to accidentally hit.  The addition of the physical slide out keyboard means this is a thicker phone than some people might like.  This feature also limits choices of of protective cases and accesories in general are hard to just walk into a store and find.Overall:I feel this phone is more for the business minded person who needs basic functions for a smartphone and not a lot of fun \"bling\" to jazz it up.  Battery life is not super but you would be hard pressed to find a smartphone with phenominal battery performance due to the fact battery technology in general has not kept up with new battery draining tech.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "problems can be fixed", "Author": "Jared S McCarty", "ReviewID": "R3BWYHHHWROHF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am editing this review after chatting with a Sprint representative and resolving ALL of my phone issues (other than the battery not charging issue - hence 4 stars instead of 5, but I have a way to work around that problem).Although my issues were many, and it took several different chat sessions to get them all resolved, they were resolved, and I am now fully satisfied with this phone.  Here is my previous review for reference.  After seeing other (affordable) cell phones with horrible reviews, I found this phone and, even though there were a couple of bad reviews on this phone, they seemed isolated, so I assumed I would get a good phone. WRONG!! I guess it's a hit and miss though, because my spouse's phone has been great since the minute it was activated. My phone has been having problems since the minute I activated it. The Sprint store had a tough time activating it, and then once they got it through their system told me I could go home and it should work in half an hour - well, it never did connect, so I had to work with customer service the next morning to change something in my phone so it would work.

Other email accounts, such as Gmail, were no problem.  My Exchange server problem was that I wanted an SSL connection to my server and the phone insisted that I needed a security certificate and so no connection could be made without one.  I know that this is not correct because I use iPhones on my Exchange server without a security certificate.  When I unchecked the SSL connection block, the phone could not be detected by Exchange server and there was an error message that auto detect on the server was not working.  I tried entering all server data manually for manual detection, with many permutations and combinations of data, but to no avail.

I loved the new windows format then mango came out making things better. but I don't think this phone can handle the operating system. Some programs offered by windows does not run correctly or even at all on the phone, others you are told that the device cannot support them. There is one speaker in the top back of the phone next to the camera which sucks because the volume is always low and if you sit your phone down on it's back it will muffle the ring even on the loudest. Also there isn't much support for the phone. it's hard to find a charger that works being that you have to only use HTC chargers the sleep button on the top is either too sensitive and turns your phone off or too stiff and it's hard to push. also turning the phone to it's landscape view doesn't always work. But the worst part for me is that sprint has a tech support in their store and if you have insurance they will fix your phone for free. problem is since this is their first windows phone even their top experts couldn't fix my phone. they called customer service from the store and they couldn't help. no one knew how to back up my contacts or what was wrong with the charging problem. Sprint opted to buy me a new phone instead of fixing mine and I was told if i had any further problems to contact Microsoft. The phone has potential and with the keyboard, 720 camcorder, Nice camera, the phone is acceptable.
