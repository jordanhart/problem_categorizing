After all the buzz at CES 2012 I really wanted to get my hands on this device, however it wasn't available in the US until now. I used the Samsung Galaxy S II as my daily driver until stepping into the P1. the first thing i noticed was the size. it fits well in my hand and against my face while talking, not awkward and bulky like the S2. it's fast under the hood, and comes with Android ICS vanilla--so i don't have the bloatware from my carrier, and i can customize it how i like. the DLNA works awesome with my Playstation 3, and the graphics are crisp and clean. Best thing about it: Penta Band HSPA+!! I switched from ATT to Tmobile, and I can use the P1 on both! now I am out of contract using the phone i want. I'm pleasantly surprised...i will be keeping this one for a while.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Huawei U9200 Ascend P1, Unlocked Phone", "Author": "Larry Nolan \"GRUMPY G\"", "ReviewID": "RJM0AZA6GA66U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this Huawei U9200 Ascend P1 Unlocked Smart Phone for only 5 days, but my first few days of experience with it are great. I use Consumer Cellular for my mobile phone service. I was able to save all my phone contacts to the sim-card in my older smart phone, remove the sim-card and the mini SDHD memory card and install them in my new smart phone and was instantly reconnected to Consumer Cellular and able to make calls and use the music player and other features.  A feature that really impressed me, is that you don't have to open the phone up to install the sim-card and the mini SDHD memory card. There is a covered slot at the top where the sim-card is installed and a covered slot on the right side for the mini SDHD card. After installation, both slots are again covered and the cards securely protected. This was so easy to do and very user friendly. This phone is quite fast, comes with many apps, is slim, light weight and feels and looks great and the price was right. I am an Amazon Prime member and have access to all of my music and apps on their cloud server for this Huawei smart phone as well as my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 32GB tablet. I save enough on my mobile phone and data service thru Consumer Cellular that it was more cost effective for me to purchase this unlocked phone thru Amazon instead of Consumer Cellular or one of the other major providers. So far I love this smart phone and its many features and will update this review if anything changes.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Device!", "Author": "PhoneNerd", "ReviewID": "RHRG3003F2DPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so excited to see Amazon finally offering a US, fully warrantied, version of the Huawei Ascend P1.

I called 3 different times and spoke with 3 different people, the first two tech support reps told me they do not support the Huawei p1 in North America and told me to call their global support team. They did not even know what it was, their own product, the P1, they were clueless as to its very existence. When you do go to the global support website under English, guess what phone number is listed, the very same number I called in the North American territory(888.548.2934). Please feel free to call it and see how horrible these people are regarding assistance of any kind. Maybe if enough people call and complain, they will change their ways. The first woman I spoke with her name is Kimberly, she did everything she could do to not answer any questions and kept pawning me off to the global support team. The very phone I am looking at on their website and she is telling me she doesn't have any information on it. She did anything she could possibly do to not help me, including being rude. The next guy I talked to his name was Adam, he was also a complete a-- and would not help me stating the same thing, that the P1 U9202 or U9200 is not supported. I ended up hanging up on him because he was being such an a-- not wanting to help. So I call back a third time,  I get a female who is very friendly this time and acted like she did want to help me. I thought finally, she then contradicts both associates stating that the P1 is supported. Then I ask her my question and what did she tell me, LOL!!! I have to call the carrier, I told her there are not any US carriers that sell that phone, that it is an unlocked gsm unit, telling her that it's listed on Amazon and eBay and a few other websites. Get this , she tells me to call Amazon!! Are you kidding me, as great as Amazon is at customer service, the best in the business, obviously Amazon is not responsible.These people at Huawei support are incompetent employees that they put in front of a computer with a checklist of generic answers to deter and defer to anybody but the very equip.

Like this phone, the nexus 4 is unlocked, off contract and works on both T-Mobile and AT&T.; The Nexus 4 has a more up to date version of android, android 4.2 Jellybean versus version 4.0 ICS on this phone. for those that think this doesn't matter, Jellybean brings HUGE speed and fluidity improvements. The Nexus 4 is also a Google phone, meaning it will get future updates as soon as they are released, unlike this phone. The hardware on the nexus 4 is also much better than on the Ascend p1. The nexus 4 has a quad core snapdragon s4 pro processor, adreno 320 GPU, and 4.7 inch 720p HD screen versus the much slower dual core TI OMAP4 processor and less sharp 4.3 quarter-HD screen on the P1. for those that think the 4.7 inch screen is too big of a phone, its not, its similar in overall size to this phone, although this phone is just a hair thinner. I know from experience in using both of these devices that the nexus 4 is just an overall  faster, MUCH smoother, and better experience. and its backed by Google so issues will be fixed very quicklyand the biggest reason: THE NEXUS 4 IS $150 CHEAPER THAN THIS PHONE WHILE STILL BEING UNLOCKED AND OFF CONTRACT. you may have to wait a few extra weeks as they are currently sold out on the google play store, but it is well worth it. you are getting a much better, newer phone for less.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$198.15", "Features": null, "Name": "Huawei U9200 Ascend P1 Unlocked Phone - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KhgoJmMFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AJJ4VG6"}}
