Not much more to be said in favor of a 4 digit price tag...I read in an Article in WIRED magazine explaining the actual direct/labor costs to produce this phone and its HIGH markup for exclusivity. The demand, especially with Blackberry and an out-of-style limited edition phone, doesn't justify paying such an \"exclusive price\".**For a phone whose material and labor costs are so similarly equivalent to the assembly of the the iPhone 4S or 5, it has to be generously priced at the VERY least half of what these sellers are asking. -hope this helps, it's my job to know all about this!", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "My comment about Blackberry porsche P'9981", "Author": "Jakomod \"josephAkomodi\"", "ReviewID": "R1YC1RORC3JHW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do have the blackberry porsche.
