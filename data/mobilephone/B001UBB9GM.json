It would not re-start with soft and hard reset.  It continued to be locked up completely with unresponsive touch on a fully energized main screen (the first \"unlock\" display present and waiting).  The unit was taken to a local Apple Store (while we were traveling, Tampa Florida) and the Apple service agent checked the Apple database to discover that the unit was out of their one year warranty period by about 2 months.This phone also exhibited minor problems in use:  Screen colors were tinted slightly orange; Apple locator on Google Maps had trouble locating the unit.  We were willing to \"pass\" on these performance issues, but not now with a \"dead\" locked phone.  When we took this phone to the Apple store, the technician also noted that the red water damage indicator had gone off.  In the 6 weeks we had the phone, it was never in more water than the ambient humidity which further suggests to us that the \"new\" phone we purchased was indeed a used unit. The Apple Technicians will not go any further with service at this time.  We have a dead unit.Request:A request for a refund in full has been made, via Amazon communications to the company (The OEM Planet) or possibly a replacement unit.  Our problem is that they have simply sent a \"boiler plate\" return form, but the form clearly states a 30 day return policy.... there is no mention of what they will actually honor beyond the 30 day period (our case), and so we are presently stuck.  We don't seem to have a true email address by which to continue a dialog with this company.In summary: we were sold a supposedly NEW iPhone 3GS, but all internal appearances are that this phone was never really NEW, but rather an used phone albeit with excellent outward appearance.If Amazon or The OEM Planet wishes to they can reference communications:The OEM Planet - Amazon Marketplace  [...]", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "not the best", "Author": "T.

The company assured me that they were absolutely new, unopened, never used & in original Apple packaging & would indeed have the 1 year Apple warranty. To assuage my doubts this company offered to provide me with two new Applecare 2-year extended warranties. Based on this information we purchased these two Apple iPhone 3G\u2019s. After receiving the products I had to immediately travel overseas where I am now located (Germany).Today I tried to register the iPhones via the Apple website but the automated information given there - based on the Serial # ID\u2019s from the phones - explained that these phones had been PURCHASED in 2009. I then called Apple & tried to register the iPhones for their supposed original 1 year Apple warranty. However the Apple representative explained exactly what their website said which was;1. the phones HAD been purchased in 2009 & NOT by a wholesale reselling company (like Walmart) but by PRIVATE individuals.2. Apple would NOT honor the original 1 year warranty and,3. that even the two Applecare 2-year extended warranties were valueless & could not be honored or registered.This company \u2018Bytes of Deals\u2019 and their other FRONT company called \u2018iCellPhones\u2019 ] is selling through Amazon website and is telling OUTRIGHT LIES via Amazon. This is an outrage and AMAZON is responsible for permitting false advertising & lies on their website.

The seller's name E&H; Electronics. www.amazon.com/shops/A1Y1K73KS093WJI was in hospital and then recovering for a while so did not open box until past the 30 days allowed for returns. Two days later, when I tried to reset to factory settings, the phone went completely dead. Still on but the screen completely black.I took it to an Apple store in Woodland Hills, CA. They looked up the history and said the \"NEW\" item I was sold was actually purchased by the seller in 2008. Apple would not provide any help and wanted $149 to fix it.What was most amazing was the Apple employee's attitude: arrogant and insolent. \"It's your problem. You didn't buy this from us... Can't help you... You should've known.\"I wrote to Amazon and E&H; Electronics. Neither replied back.Here are supposedly titans of customer service - Apple and Amazon - and both performed no better than a street hustler.Amazon fronting for a fly-by-night seller who made no effort to warn me that YOUR PHONE IS BRAND-NEW BUT HAS NOT WARRANTY! - who could've predicted that? A phone that goes dead after 2 days of use. A total jackass 20-something Apple employee who had the audacity to blame me for all this. And a company (Apple) that knowingly dumps old phones to third-parties, of course knowing many buyers would get screwed.Corporate America has actually managed to change the meaning of \"new\". It now could mean new with zero expectation that it will work past 30 days.This paper-weight will remain in my possession as a reminder of the dishonesty and arrogance we have to tolerate everyday.
