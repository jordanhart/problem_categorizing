{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Had to return it", "Author": "david", "ReviewID": "R3LQ7KOG9XPWI9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When the package first arrived, it contained a watch instead of the phone.  I returned it, and the phone was sent to me.  However, the glass screen had numerous cracks, the entire phone was scratched, and the port cover on the bottom (where charger attaches) was missing.  As one of the main features of the \"Active\" model is that it is waterproof, the missing port cover rendered it useless.  Since I really did want the phone (it was purchased as a gift for my son), I was willing to pay to have it fixed, and in fact made several attempts to find a local place to repair it.  NONE of the places I checked with, including Radio Shack, would fix it.  Some of them said they would fix other Samsung phones, but not the \"Active\" model.  At first the seller tried to say that the description on Amazon said that the phone was cracked, and that it was \"as is\" and could not be returned.  However, I immediately pdf'd a copy of my actual order, which said nothing about cracks and described the phone as in \"very good\" condition.  I then returned the phone and received a refund.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EAYIBMG"}}
