I signed for pay as you go at 2c a minute and text at 5c with no time frame limit. I had to call customer service few times and they were quick and prompt!!al and all its a very good phone for a light user who doesn't want to be locked in an expensive contract.i give it a thumb up !!", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Cellphone", "Author": "Franz K.", "ReviewID": "R3078995PQ9Y9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every thing was very good nothing to complain about I bought 8 of these items and everything was great and with no problems!!!", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "2G Network: GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900, 3G Network: HSPA 850 / 1900\nLarge 2.4-inch display and Message Reading Support\nBuilt-in 1.3MP camera with camcorder\nText-to-Speech messaging, Bluetooth wireless technology for hands-free calls and more\nBULK ITEM, NO RETAIL BOX, MAY BE CARRIER BRANDED BUT IS COMPLETELY UNLOCKED, INCLUDES: Phone, Travel Charger, USB Cable, Rechargeable Battery, Earpiece", "Name": "UNLOCKED LG A341 Quad Band Flip Cell Phone, Camera, Bluetooth, NEW, BULK PACKAGED, 2G GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHZ, 3G HSPA 850/1900MHZ", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410lJZkaW3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EUNIIPC"}}
