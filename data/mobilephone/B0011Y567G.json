{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some love it;  Some hate it;  Most should wait just a little longer", "Author": "Nicholas Christo", "ReviewID": "RID1LQT3V9DK2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "On paper, this phone has superior hardware and technical specifications compared to most other phones.  It also has a current price that's much more than the iPhone and many other phones or pocket PCs.  Unfortunately, with this phone, the software provided doesn't come close to taking full advantage of the hardware.The video and other processing performance is sub-par and worse than earlier models of HTC phones.  Though they supplied the hardware, HTC didn't include the driver software necessary to take advantage of this phones high-end processor potential.  Primary processing speed is slower than many other phones (even when compared to phones with slower and cheaper CPU's) because of the driver issues and the fact that the new iPhone type user interface (called TouchFlo), is first-generation-clunky.  If you aren't particularly interested in watching a lot of video on your phone, the video driver problem is of no consequence.  However, the slower TouchFlo interface may be an irritant (four taps on the icon to open a program instead of one). For such an expensive product with a relatively fast processor, it should outperform every other phone on the market . . . but it doesn't come close.Initially, HTC wouldn't commit to providing updated software to solve the performance problems. Very recently an HTC executive noted that HTC had changed its mind and will eventually provide \"video acceleration software,\" as an alternative to providing better video drivers, and software as an update for the Touch Cruise.  Unfortunately, when I called, HTC would not provide an estimated release date for the updates.I'm not a big Apple fan, but with the iPhone 3G due out in July of 2008,I think most that are interested in this phone should wait a little longer to spend so much money.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "HTC Cruise Review - awesome phone", "Author": "M. Roberts \"Gadget Guru\"", "ReviewID": "RE75NXLWJL2YV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent phone.  I did a lot of research looking for a smart phone.  I narrowed it down to the Moto Q, Samsung Blackjack, and the Cruise and am very happy with my choice.  Before this, I had an HP 6515 - my favorite features were the reset button and it's heft - you could use it to settle a dispute or prevent a car from rolling down the hills of Portland.** The Cruise has been a very stable phone.  It fits in my pocket, I can turn the LCD sideways (soft key) to get a landscape view.  A Resco keyboard makes data entry simple and straightforward (although a wee bit less accurate than a hard keyboard).** My biggest concern was compatibility with my carrier (as this is an unlocked phone).  I was amazed that it worked out of the box with T-Mobile.  Phone service works fine.  EDGE (T-Mobile) in US is ok.  But, best of all, this phone works very well in both Japan and Korea where they have proprietary protocols (PHS, PDC, Docomo 3G, and CDMA) - so this is truly a world phone.** It gets better.  Last week, I used Google map to walk around Shinjuku, Japan and Chaechon City, Korea.  Got right to my location.  Built-in TomTom GPS works great (one free city, others cost).  I live in Portland and use this feature extensively.  WiFi, Bluetooth (mono and stereo), FM radio, etc. all work just fine.  Battery life is ok, but needs to be managed.  The interface is a bit clunky, but can be programmed, so there are work arounds.** Overall, I rate this phone very high - it beats the iPhone, Moto Q, Blackjack, Blackberry and other smart phones by a mile (my personal opinion).  I am very happy with this product.", "Date": "April 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Everything you need", "Author": "Alex Rodrigues", "ReviewID": "ROQRSTSOCF28A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this smartphone to replace a lot of devices I used to carry on my backpack, guess what...
