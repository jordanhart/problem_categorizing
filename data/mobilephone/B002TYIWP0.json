I am on amazon looking for a different phone. This is THE WORST phone I have ever owned. You cannot do anything with pictures. You can't find the menu. You can't change the backround from preset pics. You cannot delete your sent or recieved text messages. Entering your contacts is a nightmare. I would NEVER recommend the purchase of this phone to anyone. At $75 its a rip off. This is a $10 throw away phone.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outdated phone, DO NOT BUY", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R3LTX65A4RMQTL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is horrible, I've had it for about a year, and it was horrible from day one! First off, the phone itself is awkwardly shaped, it feels weird in ur hands... the button placement sucks, the camera cant take a picture of anything with clarity... basically, if you reached into your junk drawer and grabbed a phone fron 1995 out of it, that phone has more features, is more reliable, and prolly has a better camera. On average about 1/5 of my voice calls went through even when I had perfect service.. Text messages would send 2-3 days after you tried to send them.. people texting you might get a text after 8hrs or 2 days, which obliterates the idea of text messaging.. Honestly the phone sucks, theres no other way to put it, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONe", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "No longer supported...", "Author": "D.

The price on this phone is outrageous; maybe it's worth no more than five dollars for a two-year old who likes to play telephone, but not any more than that.It's eye openning that Amazon would even carry this dinosaur on its product list.I feel ripped off even spending time writing about how bad this phone is.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "smky78", "ReviewID": "R38IDK7SUWC4EF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone and returned it within a few days.  It constantly dropped calls, battery wouldn't stay charged more than a few short hours, texts took forever to send and receive, sporadically, like sometimes it would send right away, sometimes it took a day or two.  No thanks.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone.  Even if you just talk and don't text, it literally hung up on everybody I talked to.  I would take it off the charger, go to work for 5 hours, and the battery would be dead or almost dead, so I would charge it again and it would be dead by the time I went to bed.  And that is with very minimal use.  Usually it was just sitting there.  I can't imagine how it would do if someone was on it 24/7.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "dont buy it unless its for a 5 year old", "Author": "Jesus Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R28UIFLMWD7E2A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "WELL WHEN I FIRST STARTED WITH BOOST MOBILE THIS WAS MY FIRST PHONE AND IT DID ITS JOB I USED IT FOR TEXTING AND I LOVED THE WALKIE TALKIE BUT GOING ONLINE AND ALL THAT SOCIALIZING IS NONE EXISTENT.
