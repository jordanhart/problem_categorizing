This time I was making a maiden purchase of a Unlocked phone in US.Over a year I have seen innumerable Smart Phones of different makes & of different statements for individuals but I wondered how many of us actually need a Smart Phone.Do you need to browse google map while driving on a FreeWay??..In 24 hrs we are connected to internet for 18 hrs either thru laptops,desktops,tablets OR ubiquitious phones. Hence, I thought..lets give it a break.I needed a phone which was presentable, strong & capable to many activitied at the same time not provocative to my restless fingers. Lot of brands offer multiple phones..at range of $110-$200 & they are all basically entery level advanced phones..after evaluating all others for their look, style, comaptibility & speed NOKIA was again undisputable choiceX3-02 is Sleek, Slim, Super Battery life, Awesome Display & Camera...& Quite sufficient for those who do not need data plans( OR Free Way plans :) ) but are happy with Wi-Fi at hotspots/home..This phone is For you..You can watch Youtubes,work on Facebooks & likes..( although display might not be comparable to iPhone)Do not compare to Smart phones of Apple,Samsung or > $200 range..if you like superfast,high resolution GUI & Apps go for iPhone..This Phone is not for you", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice compact feature phone...a few caveats", "Author": "OrlandoPants", "ReviewID": "R71YYAKI6VDAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty sharp, especially for such a small phone (as compared to today's standards for touch screen displays).  Part of me wonders why I feel like I need the physical keys - my cell phone experience might be more enjoyable if I opted for a full touchscreen - but in the end, I'm weird and I love having the physical keys, even though it's t9 entry and not qwerty. Anyway.  If you don't want to read this all:  Low priced phone with plenty of features, not a true smart phone but has enough to keep most happy, provided that you have small hands and do not require the extreme polish and power of the highest end phones.Note: I have not set this phone up with a plan yet, so I cannot comment as to call quality and such.  I will comment on everything else that I have experienced.Handset has a solid, polished feel. Lightweight but not flimsy. Smallish unit, not for people with sausage fingers, fine for me. Size of display is respectable, considering the size and configuration of the device.  Keys are enjoybly clicky.  Clean, attractive design.  I will say that I knew it was a small phone, but I hoped it would be slightly bigger.  At least it fits into any pocket or armband!The layout is a simple candybar, but hybrid style: physical keys plus touchscreen, no slide out.  An odd combo or a match made in heaven, depending on who you ask.  I like it, it's one of the main reasons I purchased it.  On the negative side, it totally contributes to the smaller size of the display.Battery cover is metal.  A little tricky to remove sometimes (you have to simultaneously press two rather small buttons at either side of the bottom part of the phone to release the cover), but just enough so that it should never come off on its own in your pocket or wherever. MicroSD slot is unobstructed by the battery, which is convenient (see power up comments!). Cover is easy to close, you just have to make sure you get both sides at the bottom fully snapped in, or you may welcome dust and dirt inside.Headphone jack is standard 3.5mm.  A must, far as I'm concerned.  From left to right as you view the face of the handset, this jack is at the top, next to the micro usb port and the charger jack.  To sum it up, physically, this phone is attractive and user friendly for individuals with accurate and slender fingers/small hands.Power on the handset and...of wait, IF YOU HAVE THE MICROSD CARD ALREADY INSERTED, half the time, the screen flashes and the handset refuses to come on.  If this happens to you, no worries, I've figured it out.  The phone does not like coming on with the microSD card inserted, sometimes.  Weird, annoying, probably enough right there to warrant a replacement if you're under warranty, but it's endurable, check it out: if this happens to you, remove the battery cover and press the microSD card to release it, and you will be able to power on your phone.  Then, press the microSd card back in and all is well.  Everything is peachy keen once the phone is on. When turned on, it comes to a standard home screen which is of course configurable.  I like that you click the time to get to the alarm clock, and I'm sure almost every phone in the world does this, but I love being able to set any sound that you record (or video, I think) as your wake up call (or ringer).  Anyway, you can set the home screen as you like, putting whatever you want in a set number of spots arranged a la typical nokia home screen format, or going with the grid display.  Definitely makes things more convenient for the individual user depending on what you use the most. I have mine set with my music and radio at the bottom, WLAN search above that, time and calendar above that, and fav contacts above that.  Whatever you do, though, what you want is never more than a couple touches away.The vibration feedback is quick and just enough feedback, and you can of course turn it off to save power. Accuracy of the touchscreen sometimes seems off, but again, it's a smallish display.  Also, you can calibrate it, of course, and that does help if you happen to have certain patterns in how you place your touches (i.e. if you tend to go low).  That helped in my case. Also, compared to other touchscreens, you will sometimes kind of have to actually press it, as a light touch doesn't always do the trick.  Swiping across the screen makes everything move as it seems it should, just make sure your initial touch is firm enough (note: I recently downloaded facebook for the device, which is different than how fb operates if you just go into it from the browser, and in this version, screen swipes barely move the screen.  Weird.  But visually, it's still more enjoyable than the stripped down standard browser version).Display is sharp, clear. It's not an HD tv, though, in case that's what you're expecting.  Decent view in the sun, not amazing, as with most phones.You can play with this phone quite a bit without having a voice plan.  I use my home's wi-fi to access the internet, which is a somewhat limited and of course small version thereof, but totally useable.  Not a bit deal for someone like me who doesn't play on the internet much.  Videos are surisingly enjoyable, in my opinion - clear enough visually, good sound, no delays or jumpiness that I've experienced yet, though I'm sure especially high traffic sites and/or longer vids would cause that.  With videos, you can opt for \"full screen\" (horizontal) mode, which of course helps.5mp camera, without flash.  Slight shutter delay, which is annoying, and I think the delay is what led to most of my early pictures blurry, since I get impatient and move. But once you are able to chill out for a couple seconds, you can get pretty good pics, as long as the subject is more than a foot away and the lighting is ok.  I am somewhat surprised to say that even relatively low light pictures aren't horrible...but again, there has to be some amount of light, since there's no flash.  Pictures look less amazing on the phone than they do when uploaded onto your pc, as is generally the case with cameras and camera phones (this is because the display is a lower resolution than the actual picture).  I'm surprised at how many people don't realize this!The music player is pretty nice.  You might have some difficulties synching up from Windows Media Player or whatever (via usb), but once I decided to just synch to my microSD directly (with the adapter to the reguar size of an SD card), it was a snap.  Playlists apparently don't tranfer, however.  At least not from Media Player.  When I synched, it pulled EVERYTHING onto the microSD card, including my wife's (no offense) awful music.  Good thing I opted for the 16GB microSD card.  :)  Anyway, creating and managing playlists from the handset is a breeze.  The one thing I haven't quite fugured out is if there is a way to remove songs from a playlist that is as easy as adding them.  I haven't spent much time on this yet, but it doesn't appear that it works as easily in both directions, which may mean that you would be better off starting a playlist over if you accidentally put the smae song in twice, as I did.  Or, just skip it when it comes on the 2nd time!FM radio included.  Cool.  Have to have headphones inserted, though - they act as antenna.  And I believe there are apps available if you want to listen to practically any radio station available in the world.Sound quality is good.  Sound distortion with external speakers at highest levels, duh.  Not a problem with the headphones though.  There seems to be a pretty low limit on max volume, compared to what I expected.  It's plenty loud enough for me, even when I use it while excercising, but you may be disappointed if you are someone who likes to blast your headphones so loud that your neighbors can hear it.  I recommend special earbuds like yurbuds (seriously, look these up) or something if you find the headphone volume too low for you.  Equalizer is a nice touch.The included games are kind of lame.  I mean the memory games and such are very simplistic but fun for dorks like me, whereas what you'd think would be the \"fun\" games, like the breakdancing one, sucks.  Guitar Hero is a nice included game, sort of, but trying to move quickly and accurately on this size of display is difficult. Whatever, I barely play the games anyway.  You can download many more games and apps from the ovi store.Summary: I sort of love the handset, physically.  It's just about perfect for me, ergonomically, and everything is easy to use in general.  The power on/microSD conflict issue can be really annoying if you are in the habit of turning on your phone while on the go, but I can probably manage, or see about an exchange.  I know that I signed my our fate when going for a phone with this type of hybrid layout, but the screen could stand to be slightly bigger.  Also, this phone is so slim and small, they might have done better with the physical keys on a slide out.  Nokia has models like that, but to me, they were not as attractive as the x3-02.

The Nokia X3-02 is perfect for those who are still avoiding the Smartphone / PDA / Blackberry / iPhone / Android craze (VIVA LE REVOLUCION). It has a nice little touch screen that comes with a full touch QWERTY keypad. You can use a stylus (not included) with it which I recommend since the screen is smaller than other touch screens. The resolution is great and sound is near perfect. The Bluetooth functionality is a little spotty, it disconnects from my car's bluetooth link up randomly but works perfectly on my Jawbone bluetooth earpiece. Configuring the SMS and Web functionality was a bit confusing but the WiFi function makes up for that. You can be within an open WiFi singal and connect without having to go through your Network provider which is a major plus.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect phone", "Author": "Tdrawe", "ReviewID": "RXPN0E6F40JRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others, I have been a long time fan of Nokia phones, they are not always the most high end of phones like the current Iphone or androids but I myself dont really need to carry around a $400 dual-core processor android phone all day. That's what my laptop is for! I have gone through many phones with T-mobile and the prices of phones just get more expensive and they are just cheesy phones, In my opinion. When I first saw this phone I knew it was love at first sight. Something about the simplicity of the candy bar style design of nokia phones just intrigues me, especially with the design of this new x3 touch and type. Its refreshingly new and sleek. and almost as slim as my 4g Ipod touch which makes it easy to carry around in your pocket with no hassle. not like all those other heavy touch screen phones that mimic the Iphone. Its almost weightless, yet heavy enough to remind you of the quality. The quality of the touch screen is not high definition by any means, but very good considering it's a Nokia. Being able to text with the keypad and use the touch screen to navigate through menus and settings and such is a perfect combination on this phone. You really have to hold it in your hand to experience it. And its a nokia so the battery life is awesome of course. I read a few bad reviews on this phone before I bought it, but if your looking for a simple yet smart little phone that is very easy to use and reliable then this nokia is the phone for you!

ALL of them -would not- allow me to call my WIRED TELEPHONE ANSWERER and pick up messages.  These were called SMART PHONES but they -would not- allow me to punch in a code for the answerer in order to retrieve my messages.The SMART PHONES just would not allow me to enter the numbers and pick up messages.  I'm no dummy and tried every way I could to retrieve messages.  It seems they block key entry when calling.This phone has a KEYPAD -and- a TOUCH SCREEN.  You can use EITHER, so you are not -locked out- from pushing numbers after calling, yet you can use the TOUCH SCREEN to do other things.The phone is VERY intuitive and allows you to do SMART PHONE things if you want.The battery life is good, similar to my old Motorola.The 5 mb camera/video is good but not excellent for a cell phone.CONS-The USB port -charging- is funky. The TOP indicator (on the phone) indicates you are CHARGING when connected but you may NOT be unless your PC -recognizes- your phone.  So you have a CHARGE indicated on the TOP indicator but the phone POPS UP a message saying PHONE NOT FULLY CHARGED, kind of weird.The Nokia PC software like Nokia PC Suite or OVI Suite are IMHO pretty much useless.  They don't seem to work with this phone and get DRIVER ERRORS when I installed them.  I contacted Nokia with no help.The plus side is you can connect the phone to W7 and MANUALLY transfer most things.  I'm not sure how this will work with my CONTACTS -if- I ever want to RESTORE them to a phone.  The Motorola allowed me to do this very simply.  I could keep a backup on my PC with little effort.Except for the CONTACTS BACKUP - this is a great phone.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unreliable thanks to new firmware incompatability", "Author": "A.

Light weight too, so it fits easily in a shirt pocket.- Very good voice call quality.  As good as my iPhone 4.- Decent battery life.  What a breath of fresh air when compared to the power sucking smartphones that have brought in the age of cellphone cases with battery packs.  The initial charge on this Nokia led to a standby time of over a week.  Now, it averages about 3-4 days between charges.  This is with mild use since I use my iPhone more.- Quite a configurable user interface.- It has a immediate screen locking button to prevent inadvertent activity via the touch screen.Cons:- I'm not convinced the touch screen really improves usability and was likely included as a gimmick to improve sales or potential buyer interest.- The touch screen is just ... OK.  The sensitivity is just acceptable and I often end up selecting items while trying to scroll.- Unfortunately, some features are accessible only via the touch screen.  I wish this weren't the case but....- Working with the address book can be tedious since I can search only via the first or last names depending on how you choose to list names, i.e., first then last as opposed to last then first.Overall, it's a pretty good phone.  I purchased it since I didn't need two smartphones and it has delivered in its light weightedness, simplicity and longer battery life.  However, I can't say that I'm impressed with the touch screen feature.  I'm happy to see that simpler phones are still in circulation.

This was an upgrade from a candybar style 5130c XpressMusic which served me well for basic voice service, SMS, and a music player. Battery life was ~7 days with light service. I travel internationally 3-4 times a year and so wanted a phone to accept the regional carrier sim cards or ideally the ability to make VoIP calls.Here's a breakdown of the X3 features.Fit and finish: *****Compact and well built. Metallic case and nice size buttons.Documentation: ***Printed manual with package was in German but found the English edition easy enough online.Battery life: ***When the WiFi automatic WAN connection option is enabled battery life is less than 2 days. With WiFi and BT disabled ~5 days. My charging routine is to use the USB cable to re-synch calendar and contacts with my office laptop. This also recharges the phone.Voice/SMS: *****Works as expected. Like the threaded-discussion style presentation of messages.VoIP/IM: **I have not been able to make internet calls yet with the phone. I may have a home firewall issue. I've tried ippi and FriendCaller service providers without success. IM via WhatsApp did work for me between Japan and the States. This was a nice upgrade over the old 5130. VoIP is something I continue to troubleshoot. Other mainstream/popular apps for VoIP from Skype or Vonage are focused on the iOS and Android markets and so do not currently offer Symbian support.Camera: ****Big upgrade for me to go from the 2 Megapixel 5130 to a 5 Megapixel X3.Media player: ****Works. Nice short cut controls and volume rocker on the side of the phone.Personalization: *****I like to customize my interface and the X3 provides lots of theme and screen organization options so you can put your preferred tools at the level and order you prefer.Apps: ***The practical app selection is low for the X3 and the bulk on the Nokia OVI store depends on the Nokia Xpress Web Browser to run instead of standalone Java apps. Many apps appear to be cheap excuses to display banner ads. Most of the city guides are oriented to metro areas of India. I could not find a good map application and without GPS or cell tower triangulation apps with geo-location will not work. I did fine a few helpful apps that certainly raise the value this phone over the most basic voice/SMS: WhatsApp for IM, e-mail (Yahoo and POP), Weather Channel, Opera browser. The Xpress web browser is a bit awkward and does not handle website redirect pages very well. Not sure if it's Javascript handling or what the root cause it. I find myself having to do lots of page refreshing to get pages to load completely. I like to use the Panera cafes in my area for long lunch / work sessions and the log-in and redirect process to get online causes pages to freeze under Xpress. I believe Xpress must be used as part of the WAN connection process (instead of Opera or UC Browser alternatives).", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "aragua11", "ReviewID": "R1UZ60Z2B0ZFDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great, the best undoubtedly brought everything indicated by the publication, is great quality, has exceeded my expectations.

Screen is not high end smart phone quality; I do not use this phone for the Internet, texting/IM, though you can.  I wanted a phone that will not slave me to a master.

Not interested in buying a new phone after a few years because of marketing schemes.  For those who like to operate a cell phone device with one hand, this Nokia is perfect.  The freedom of AFFORDABLE unlock phone with this mid-set quality is limited to this one only!  For the price, the quality, and most importantly the freedom of being a free market consumer instead of a locked-down-hog-tied one, this phone is wonderful; this phone is perfect for my use.  We need to move away from being brain-dead consumers and stop allowing ourselves to be dragged around by businesses telling us what we want, what we need, what we can have, what we must do, what we must pay for.  Why are they dictating our wants and needs?!  Unlock phone with an affortable price point should be encouraged; in fact, after we've finished dishing out thousand of dollars for our c-phone contract, our phones should be unlocked/unlockable so we are free to use the device as we chose.

I'm a long time Nokia users and still getting used to the 4 key wide keypad but so far so good.You can configure most of the display on home page with ease. Joining wireless network was easy. The touch screen is a little \"touchy\". Sometimes when you are scrolling it enters a menu. Other tmes it goes two deep yet most of the time it works well. I figured thats just me getting used to it but will see over time. This unit has 5.65 I called Nokia support and V6.0 should be available for my serial number phone in less than 4 weeks. This update reportedly helps the touch screen be more consistent. Will report an update on that if and when...The menu structure is pretty straight forward. As with any new device it takes a few days to get to grips with where everything is. Im really happy with how the OS works for exmaple if you miss a call you can touch and hold that notification and it will give you options to call back or text the person etc. Well thought out although if you are like me and dont read the manual it took a few times expermineting to find these hidden gems.Call quality great. Bluetooth connections easy and functional.OVI store is inconsistent but I didnt buy it for web browsing so that may be my lack of familiarlity and need to explorse/solve rather than a phone issue.Keyboard is a little stiff.
