Most Play-store recorders record only one direction of the phone call.- Multi-touch does not work in many applicationsI hope for many improvements when Jellybaen becomes available for this device.Conclusion: It is a good deal for its price, especially if you want a \"non everybody has\", Samsung...", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "is a great phone for Series One!", "Author": "carlos mendez", "ReviewID": "R22NRRFBFMKN3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "is one of the best phones that HTC has manufactured, Series One is the most accessible having virtually the same features of one x y s.after trying it, grab all 4 bands, the wifi goes well because it never stopped, calls listen well, battery lasts me one day, the ram gives enough to handle the applications you want", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "battery and data issue", "Author": "NRC344", "ReviewID": "R281IA6AQERDV5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the ONE V since August.  It was a great phone and I was very happy with performance.  The issue of battery life was greatly increased by a setting for WIFI.  Under WIFI select menu, then advanced.  Select the option for WIFI while the phone is in sleep. By turning off WIFI while in sleep, my standby time increased from 1 day to 5 days.Now to the problem with data.  Had great performance with my unlocked phone that was built for China use. AT&T; worked great and I had 3G or HSDPA data up to last week. There was an HTC firmware upgrade that disabled WCDMA capability on this phone. I now only have access to GSM and 2G data.  AT&T; uses WCDMA for 3G and HSDPA.  When the data option for GSM plus WCDMA is selected the phone goes dead.  HTC said \"too bad, we don't support AT&T; on an unlocked phone\".", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheaper On Virgin Website", "Author": "Kitty Kitti", "ReviewID": "R1S6YYATU787LG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "geesh...I was just pricing it to see if I could get it cheaper than the $99 on Virgin's site.
