{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Serves the purpose", "Author": "gunnydo", "ReviewID": "RNXIKS79IT9JA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The dual SIM feature of this phone is the basic high point. It is sleek and lightweight. The screen is difficult to see, especially in bright sunlight. I have not attempted to use a screen guard for sunshading. The touch features are not very sensitive despite calibrating again and again. The camera does take good photos. Texting is difficult due to the touchscreen issues and the fact that the letters are basic abc, def multitouch. There is no keyboard feature. This phone serves its purpose in general but next time I will buy a higher quality phone with a better touchscreen.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Network: GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900.
