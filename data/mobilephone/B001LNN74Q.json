{"Reviews": [{"Title": "pretty good after all", "Author": "Pablo Castro \"Man of Surprises\"", "ReviewID": "R39ZC087O5VCE0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i am writing this review from the xperia: that's how much i've been using it lately, and that's how easy it is to use for typing, browsing, editing and reviewing important documents. the touch screen is great and the phone has a sturdy, heavy metalic feel that i personally love. but there ARE some shortcomings. You need to fiddle around with it BIGtime before you get its battery to perform decently. And the camera could be better (my old nokia n82 took far superior photos and even more so for video).Overall a very impressive mini laptop disguised as a phone, a trend in design many others are already following, such as the n97. Running on WM 6.1 pro opens up the door for so many great programs, ive had it 5 days and ive downloaded 11 apps: audio recording, tweaking, barcode reading, chat, skype, facebook, media players, maps, gps, security, etc.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great style, design, hardware specifications.  Windows mobile is horrible.", "Author": "Ernst Blofeld \"kidgib1\"", "ReviewID": "R15MADGLV21CZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like many tech fanatics, I eagerly looked forward to the release of this phone over a year ago when it was first announced.  But after all that wait, I must say that I am a little disappointed with the final product.  Sony definitely delivered a great looking and solidly built cellphone.  However, the choice of using Windows Mobile on the Xperia X1 is the real failure of this phone.If you have used the iPhone (OS X) or the HTC G1 (Android) and then you used a Windows Mobile phone such as the Xperia X1, you will be blown away by how poor an operating system Windows Mobile is.  It is slow, buggy (even after its been out for ages), prone to crashes and restarts and not designed for finger touch.The panel interface does little to mask the ugliness and user unfriendliness of Windows Mobile.  With the exception of the sbp panel and the Sony designed media player panel, most of the other panels that are available at this writing are nothing to write home about. At the end of the day, the panels are just eye candy and are not enough to improve the user experience significantly.That said, the phone is well appointed with GPS, a beautiful screen (800x480) resolution, nice keyboard, FM radio and a very handsome design.  The screen clarity will impress you.  I was able to watch a Divx encoded movie on the Xperia X1 and I was thoroughly impress with its clarity.In my opinion, this phone would be better served if it ran Android (Google OS) instead of the crappy windows mobile operating system.Pros:1. Great design.2. Very stylish and will grab positive attention.3. Excellent screen. High resolution (800x480) Crystal clear, excellent for movies.4. GPS, WIFI (802.11b/g), bluetooth.5. Very good battery life.Cons: (all the negatives are due to windows mobile)1.  Sometimes slow and buggy.2.  Archaic user interface.3.  Poor finger touch implementation (forces you to use stylus).", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Huge Disappointment", "Author": "DH", "ReviewID": "R12UQ3JM08IMYF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone was hyped, even came with a \"butler\" service, a dedicated helpline for the owners of the X1.After using it for 1 year I can say it has been the greatest disappointment in my almost 15 years of using mobile phones.Unlike other phones, you can't simply use bluetooth to send/receive all your contacts from another older/newer phone, you need to use Microsoft Outlook.Also, it seems Microsoft hadn't heard of people having 2 cellular/mobile numbers, so if you have a contact who has more than 1 cellular number you're out of luck, there's only 1 entry for a mobile number.  You can't even create a 2nd mobile number entry in the contact menu.I could go on and on, but I'll also mention that just after the warranty expired the slide out keyboard stopped working, ie you slide it out and the screen goes dark.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent phone encumbered by poor OS", "Author": "Bobo", "ReviewID": "R2A27NC7FELISB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great piece of hardware. For comparison, I've got it's older brother the W800i and also an iPhone next to it. The X1 is nicely built, there's no doubts about the quality, no \"cheap bits\" here.The screen is fantastic, though to be honest, due to the UI/software, it's not easy to see the difference between this and the iPhone (lower resolution) screen until you hit the websites and see the difference in readability of small fonts.The keyboard, while solid, is not great. But that's probably because I'm expecting too much from a phone. It's still better than the iPhone virtual keyboard (for me). I think I will get used to the keyboard, it's okay. The only glitch is that it can be hard to hit the top row of keys sometimes because the screen doesn't quite slide out far enough.Now to the griping:- Startup time sucks, it's like over 1 minute while the iPhone and older W800i are ready to go in about 20 sec (that's before even the SE logo disappears from the X1). On the flip side, I guess one never expects to have to turn it off...- Inconsistent response times. Some have complained about the \"lag\" in UI. Most of the time it's okay, but occasionally, something takes so long to respond, you think you haven't clicked it. The old iPhone is solid, always consistent and fast.- Windows Mobile is NOT made for finger touch screens. That much becomes painfully obvious very quickly. The stylus is there for a reason. This is my first Windows Mobile device after years of other cell OS's and it's not leaving a good impression.- Navigation: The optical d-pad in the center works well, but is very sensitive, so takes time to get used to. The d-pad buttons work okay, except the lip in the screen makes it hard to use the \"up\" button, so I stuck to the optical.The Panels are a good idea. If they could spit out more of them, they could almost hide most of Windows Mobile and it would be a GOOD thing. As it is, they need to work out some kinks in performance and useability.As for calls ... well, what's to complain about? 1 hard button to take you to the calling screen where you just punch in the numbers. It works, no fuss.Right now, I don't regret buying this phone. Not yet anyways. However, I'm not sure I would give it a clear recommendation either, not for this price. Hopefully SE will work out some of the kinks in the near future.iPhone still provides a MUCH better experience, and the old W800 was good too, missing only WiFi and keyboard (else I would've stuck with it).", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "M.
