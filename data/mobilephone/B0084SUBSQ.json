{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great but resolution is not great", "Author": "G. Keck \"Sugarfree\"", "ReviewID": "RLRE7OXIV3401", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No problems with this out of the box. Works just as well as my spouse's Samsung Galaxy. The real disappointment is the screen resolution which is TFT WVGA 480X800. Even the screen saver was pixelated. Samsung Galaxy has a resolution of 1280X720 and that is on a smaller screen. The difference in screen resolution is very obvious. But the positives are: big screen, my unit came with two batteries, it cost a couple hundred dollars less than a Samsung, and the speaker seemed fine even though my hearing is not the best. This is the real deal as far as I can tell - it works as advertised and the only real negative is screen resolution.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looking for large screen GSM phone? This is it but some caveats.", "Author": "Michiganian \"Michiganian\"", "ReviewID": "R1ERLBO4SZY881", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "5\" screen size is great. Resolution although same as 4.3\" phones becomes a bit of an issue because of larger screen size. The CPU is single core so the phone is slower than dual core ones. It show if you are used to the dual core one. For price, hard to beat. Do keep in mind that once you cross the 4\" size, the phone progressively gets harder to use by one hand. It then becomes a two hand device unless one has large hands. After using this phone you realize why Apple insists on 4\" phones. The standard control buttons are not on screen so that leaves full screen for display, unlike most other 4.0 and higher Android phones. So a big plus. This has 4.0.3 Android version. Camers is OK, nothing to rave about. You will have to buy a SD card, does not come with one. Battery is 3200 mah. You need it because of the large screen size. You have to charge every night even with moderate usage unless you want to swap the battery. The colors are not that great when you compare against AMOLED phones. The 3G will not work on T-Mobile so you are stuck with 2G unless you want to use Wi-Fi. There are many other makes/models of similar phone on Amazon - Star N9000 or similar for example. The best part is that with larger screen size the keyboard entry becomes much easier than the 4\" phones. Plus easier to read.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Android Note rate", "Author": "Jesus Landaez", "ReviewID": "R3U0E9U60TG7X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Me llego en los tiempos estimados, el producto es el que en realidad habia solicitado y  sin da\u00f1os. por ello lo considero un exelente servicio", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "not hapy", "Author": "Mamon Uddin", "ReviewID": "R1QD925DKWFBYP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "they phone looks very wounderful but tuch screen are very slow. i am not hapy to use that phone. thanks", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone.", "Author": "pace", "ReviewID": "R1ARS8DROKM4KV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this product for over 90 days and it has not failed me yet.

There's different makes and models but make sure you buy the one with Android 4.0.4 , because the one with Android 4.1 has a lot of force closing, glitching etc. However, the black one is the best and is so sleek and smooth you'll be ecstatic! I get compliments where ever I go and my husband, who has the actual Samsung Note 2, says mine is smoother. Buy through Amazon, I've had two good experiences through them and one bad one from EBay attempting to order. I downloaded my own keyboard and dictionary too, because I saw a few people had problems with spell check issues but I can honestly say, I've never had a problem. I don't have a single complaint. The battery life rocks, I'm not even sure why they send two batteries but I'm not going to complain! ONLY GEL cases for Samsung Note 2s fit, not the hard ones. Otherwise you need to order an actual Star case. The flip cases rock and I've ordered hot pink  white and black. The black one actually is stamped with NOTE and is made of real leather. White is cheap made of plastic and gets gross fast. Pink is real leather and beautiful but not stamped with Note! Yeah... that's all I've got to say except, this phone is worth EVERY penny and then some.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "i cant really rate it yet but i have some info for everyone", "Author": "prophet fred r", "ReviewID": "R1ABQWY9IO4G5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "here is the some up to date info on the star note n9000  .i went to the mall to talk to a t mobile rept i told them that my phone was on the way as we speak i just didnt want 2g /edge .he informed me that there is no more edge/2g on tmobile .he pulledout his phone he said i had edge on mine showed me the bars and the bar said 3g . he said the net work has been all upsdated to just 3g and lte . i didnt want at&t; or straight talk but i didnt want 2g either so i am very excited to get my phone who will be running on  true 3g april18,2013 @0805the only thing that i didnt like was i tried to contact the seller with no response .", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "New 5.08\"Unlock Android N9000 Smartphone", "Author": "Nugejoy \"nugejoy\"", "ReviewID": "RDBCE7DM0XFXQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a Samsung Note 7000 clone and this came close.

I tried to plug in my Bose headphone to this N9000 to listen music. But the N9000's headphone jack (earphone port) is recessed deeply and causes the headphone connection loose. I have tried my Sony headphone and got the same connection problem.  I cannot use any headphone with this N9000. I am very disappointed with this faulty design. I have searched the web and found that there is no adapter available for this kind of recessed headphone jack. Another problem of this N9000 is that its Bluetooth sound quality is terrible and bad for some old Bluetooth stereo headsets (e.g. 2007 made). This means you need to upgrade your Bluetooth headset too if you have old Bluetooth headsets. Buyers should be aware about this problem.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Clone phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3NG71CP0VKRWV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HoHum.
