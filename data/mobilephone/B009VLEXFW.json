We use this model at my job where I service office machines at customer sites and therefore rely heavily on this phone. Also, I am right handed and hold the phone with my left hand while selecting functions with my right. My revue is based on these experiences.First off, if you plan on making more than four calls a day and plan on using the GPS more than once or twice, the battery will only last about four to five hours. I have had it last for seven hours, on occasion, before getting the \"15% battery life\" warning, but this was with minimum usage. Once you do get the 15% warning, you have about fifteen minutes to find a charger or this phone will shut down on you. So, if you decide to go with this phone, get an extra USB charger cable so you can plug it in to your car radio or computer.Secondly, and something I find very annoying, is that you have to be careful how you hold this thing so that you don't activate an application. For example, see the button sticking out from the side of the phone on the bottom right? That button turns on the camera. Holding this phone in my left hand, my left ring finger rests on the camera button and quietly activates the camera. I've taken countless pictures of my feet, lap, and hands because of this poorly placed button.Next issue would be the volume button, which is placed right where my left thumb rests (top left). The volume button is every responsive and I have accidentally turned the volume down more than once and inadvertently missed calls because of this design.Another quirk to watch out for is the GENIUS voice recognition feature button, located on the front screen, bottom right. I turn this feature on constantly with my thumb when trying to pick up the phone while being careful not to push any mechanical buttons on the side. There is just no good way to comfortably hold or pick up this phone without fear of turning something on.As for the touch screen, the My Touch phone is \"touch and go\" at best. Sometimes you can barely touch the screen and a function opens. Other times you have to press an icon several times before you get a response. Extremely aggravating.As for coverage, I live/work in the North West Indiana/Chicago area and our coverage of T-Mobile is very poor. This phone has multiple dead spots throughout the area (no particular part of town). You can be in a dead spot, literally walk ten feet and suddenly get five bars. If you get more than 25 miles out of the Chicago area, you lose coverage all together. When that happens I have to use my old AT&T; flip phone to call the office. Very sad.Initially, I was very excited when I got this phone. Unfortunately it has turned out to be the major cause of tension throughout my day. I am actually considering buying another phone to use for work and paying for it myself. This phone is that frustrating to use. More than once I have considered throwing it out of my car window. Cell phones are supposed to make our lives easier, this particular model does not accomplish that feat.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish I had done more research", "Author": "AndyR \"AndyR\"", "ReviewID": "R23KETQCAPLYX3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As my previous phone was shattered on it's 2 year anniversary of ownership, I went to T Mobile to pick out another phone. These places have so many plans all over the place. I settled on one where my usage rates are low, or unlimited, though I bought the phone through a payment plan.If I could go back in time, I would have paid up just a bit more for that Samsung I was debating against this.First of all, the screen is unreliable. I can't tell you how many times I had to wait for the other person to hang up because the screen wouldn't respond. Now matter how many times this thing accidentally opens up some application with some odd combination of me just grabbing it, the screen hardly ever works. Sometimes rebooting it helps.Second, I can't open any attachents in my email. I get a message that says \"The attachment could not be downloaded because the device is full.\" I rarely run any apps, even rarer that I download any. Also, when I take a picture, the picture disappears from the scroll. I don't get why it started to do that. I go back and use a google app to revisit them. Why this stupid thing can't show a 5MB photo is beyond me. This is actually what brought me here to review. I'm searching for a solution online.Third, and this one is completely my fault because I could have known better, I would never ever buy any Huawei product again. When I saw the box at the store, I had a bad feeling about buying this brand. Later, I learned that Huawei uses stolen technology, and I absolutely hate that I supported a Chinese company that has been banned from so many deals in different countries. I won't preach here. You can do your own research.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen froze completely", "Author": "Ashlee Sterns", "ReviewID": "R3AZPDUES47M3Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The screen stopped working after 1 month just froze completely and i didnt even drop it.

I chose it for the qwerty keyboard because I was forever making typos on my husband's iPhone.  I wish I had researched this more before making my purchase.This phone locks up regularly, resets itself for no reason in the middle of the night when no one is even near it and that's just the beginning.  I'll go to sleep with all my notification options set to one thing and wake up to it having decided it doesn't like my choices so it has changed them.  The battery on it is beyond weak.  It runs out in next to no time.  Keep the gps off unless you absolutely need it.  I have had this phone lock up to the point of having to wait until the battery runs out so it will reset before I can use it again.  Which is probably the only good reason for having such a terrible battery, at least I didn't have to wait too long.At first it was a nice phone.  About two months after owning it though, the problems began.  It locks up if I receive a text while I am typing one to send. I can no longer send or receive pictures via texts.  The camera function takes terrible pictures.  And if you are trying to take a picture in a dim room, expect the entire thing to come out black.  I am forever getting Genius Button errors when I don't even use that option and have repeatedly had to turn it off completely.  But because it is part of the phone, every time I reboot it automatically comes back on.Unfortunately I could go on, as I have many more such stories about just how poor it is.  I really have nothing nice to say about this phone.  It's a waste of money.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Esteban", "ReviewID": "RAR8MAID1XLUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone has no problems,love the sound ,and the touch works great,and battery hold a good charge but i bought a extra battery just incase.i would recommend this phone .", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "White My Touch q U8730 Its in perfect working order,no software problems,it has 2 small scuffs nothing big,it has small chicken scraches on screen it could be cover with a screen protector,you could see pics.comes with box and usb cable with charging adapter,nothing else.", "Name": "TMOBILE Mytouch Q (Huawei) Cell Phone", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yl0bIiO-L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009VLEXFW"}}
