It works great, is very user friendly, and a perfect size.  The vendor delivered it promptly and even put it in a plastic case with a screen protector.  It was unlocked and I just had to put my new TMobile sim card in it to have service.  I watched a YouTube instructional video this 12-year-old kid made at home showing me how to upload my contacts.  I found that to be funny--if you want to know how to do something technical, just watch a kid's video or ask a kid.  At any rate, I highly recommend this vendor and am very, very happy with my phone.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very angry customer", "Author": "shannon cochran", "ReviewID": "R2J3W6MJ7ODCCK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because it said it was an iphone 3gs when I got it.
