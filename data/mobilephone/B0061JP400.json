{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone for world traveler", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2R6NJGL0AAPLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality phone for a good price.Pros: Unlocked for use around the world except on Verizon and Sprint in the US. Good call quality and data speed. Adequate storage with expansion. Processor is as fast as Motorola Droid3 dual cores. I can simultaneously listen to music, play Angry Birds and be downloading a book with no lag in any of them. Implementation of Folders allows a compact presentation of most of your apps on a single screen for quick access. Good quality screen of good size. Slim and light. Battery life is adequate for heavy usage. RAM memory size is adequate for what I do and is plenty fast. The internal storage and the removable microSD card are used as a single storage system. Some downloaded apps can be moved to the microSD card using an included feature to extend the small native app storage. I replaced the included 8Gb microSD card with a 32Gb one. I just used my laptop to copy the included data on the 8Gb card to the 32Gb and everything works fine. I have over 3,000 songs, 2,900 pictures, and more than 60 apps on the combined cards with 7Gb free (but with just 65Mb free in the dedicated app space). The phone is light in weight. On screen keyboard is much better than my Droid3 with bigger keys in landscape orientation. Good Android Gingerbread implementation with ICS coming.Cons: Can't add an extended life battery without ruining the slim style case with a big bulging alternate cover in the back. The screen is the biggest battery draw. 10-12 hours of continuous screen usage can drain the battery. But that's far better than my LG Quantum Windows 7 phone and a bit better than my Droid 3 was with the OEM battery before replacement with an 1800mA hour one. Under normal usage of the Experia it's about 2 and a half days before I have to recharge the battery.Other:  I bought this phone as a world travel replacement for my Motorola Droid 3 which only roams data if you pay Verizon's high charges. The unlocked SE Experia Arc S is not tied to any particular carrier. It works anywhere in the world for both cell and data. I'm using 3G for Internet and email on MTN and Airtel in Ghana. The cell quality is good for calls within country as well as to other countries in Africa and to the US. Data access is just as fast as what I'm getting on my laptop using an MTN cell modem. Often the Experia is faster than the laptop since it has to transfer less data to fill the screen. Wireless performance is good with good signal sensitivity. The Droid3 camera is junk. So the Experia camera is a welcome relief. The software implementation gives adequate camera control for a phone. I haven't used the 3D feature and never will. Audio quality is very good for playing music using the Poweramp app while reading library books on the phone - great for the plane. This phone is a bargain for world travel.Update 11/18/12I've used it for six months and the Experia Arc S continues to be my favorite phone. It's upgraded to Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich and I've now had a chance to use a couple of other features.Bluetooth: Works great. I use it to transfer pictures to my tablet using the Bluetooth File Transfer app. It's handy to be able to both make backup copies of my photos while away from my home computer and to copy pictures over to my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus for showing to family and friends.Wireless Hotspot (cell modem): I used this in Bangladesh where I didn't have wireless available at my guest house. I had in my phone a BanglaLink SIM card with data plan which I had picked up at the airport. I just started up the Hotspot in the Xperia Connectivity Settings. Then I was able to use the phone as a wireless router. I connected my laptop for sending long emails home and downloading documents from the Web. The hotspot actually was a little faster than using a USB cell modem in my laptop. The data usage was quite spare. I'll use it again when I return to Bangladesh early next year.I use this phone everyday. I hope it lasts a long time. I don't want to give it up.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Xperia Arc S great phone!", "Author": "Customer", "ReviewID": "R2Q0VN23E7FWE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the purchase of this phone, the company Wireless Experts Inc. kept me informed on shipping procedure and resolved all my doubts.

Lovin' It...", "Author": "Dr KrwL", "ReviewID": "R26P2BETC0M3W3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One month update...I REALLY liked this phone \"out of the box\" but felt I needed to come back and take a star off; as I \"get it loaded\" with the apps and background programs I like, I find it lagging to keep up sometimes.  This is especially true when first waking the phone or after shutting down a game.  I personally don't see it as a big issue, but wanted to update the review to reflect these issues.  I have ICS loaded which may be a contributing factor.-----------------I did a bit of research on getting my GoPhone technology \"up to date\".  I had been using an LG Thrive and year-and-a-half ago it was great, but I found myself needing more phone speed/capability for the apps I wanted to run.  I haven't physically checked out any of ATT's direct offers yet but looking at the specs on their site...they really stink...and NOW ATT wants to force you on the $50/mo plan for the better phones.  I use GoPhone for ~$15/mo. and didn't need to spend any more.  So I started looking for \"unlocked\" phones. Having the confidence this one would work as intended I went ahead and purchased from Amazon; local stores in my area had it \"on sale\" for ~$100 more with a WHOPPING 15% restock fee if I returned with broken seal.At any rate my experience has been GREAT so far:- Plugged in SIM card and phone instantly recognized my ATT account.- Loaded SONY PC software, connected phone, and instantly recognized and installed ICS (that's Android 4.0.3).- The 3G data DOES NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX but it is an easy fix.  Most of the You tube videos are out of date, all you need is:-->Settings > \"More\" under Wireless & Networks > Mobile networks > Access Point Names (APN)> Use setting button to +New APN  > Enter the following:NOTE I HAVE EDITED THIS FROM MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: the settings I had (with no username/password) did not allow for secure connections to some sites.Name: MEdia Net (can be anything, this is what my old phone had)APN: wap.cingularProxy: <Not set>Port: <Not set>Username: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COM (must be CAPS)Password: CINGULAR1 (must be CAPS)Server: <Not set>MMSC: hypertexttransferprotocol colon forwardslash forwardslash mmsc.cingular.com/  (you need to use \"http\", I spelled it out to keep Amazon's blocker from blocking it).MMS proxy: wireless.cingular.comMMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: <Not set>APN type: <Not set>- Signal quality has been as-good/better than my Thrive; I work in a dense, isolated building where ATT signal is best of all the suppliers, Thrive would drop off in interior rooms, but XarcS has not dropped anything I've tried thus far.- ROM could use some work, not as slick as the Virgin EVO V I tried out (returned it due to POOR signal quality).- The \"hard\" buttons on the phone have a cheap feel to them and takes a few tries with my fat fingers to activate them.Thanks,Kevlar", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really nice Phone :)", "Author": "Gil", "ReviewID": "R2QJNVKDK742VX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a phone with a decent camera, android system and nice look, this phone fit the required specifications and then some, as other reviews this phone has a beautiful screen resolution to watch your videos or movies in HD quality, sound its clear and loud, no speakers needed if your in a close room.

Tikhomirov \"kalistrat\"", "ReviewID": "R1M7XYYKSQNKUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am giving this phone 5 stars! It's a great phone and my first Sony Ericsson since 2006. My last one was a \"flip-phone\" type, which I carried for a long time wherever I went. I traveled heavily through the U.S. and Europe (both Western and Eastern), and the phone worked always great. Then, Sony Ericsson had a very poor streak with their phone design for a few years. I had to switch to Samsung. But, Xperia Arc is wonderful. It is at least a light year ahead of my previous Sony Ericsson phone. It has a very stylish and sophisticated design and a lot of nice features that are very easy to access and use. In my humble opinion, this phone beats an iPhone when it comes to its looks and practicality. It connects very easily to any device you have and is very intuitive running applications. The only complaint I have is actually about the upgrade to Android 4 software. When I opened the phone and used it for a day without the upgrade, I really enjoyed all of the beautiful applications that were pre-installed and the looks of each application on the phone. Then, I decided to upgrade to Android 4 via my PC at home, hoping that the new upgraded software would actually look and function better somehow. Unfortunately, after a quick and easy upgrade process, I was disappointed with the looks of the new user interface and loss of some cool gadgets that had pleased me so much during my first day with the phone. So, don't upgrade! It will work just fine without it.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed / decepcionado", "Author": "Alonso", "ReviewID": "R2JJW03CTGRESB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone w/ the highest expextations ever...

I have also tried the connection on Widnows 7 and it's less than smooth, but Sony promises to update the software soon. Other than that, using it for about three weeks now and still can't get used to how sexy it looks and feels, very light, thin and oh, that great display.Edit: after two months of use, still very happy with the purchase, especially since the price went up a LOT; it was just meant to be, got it at the right time! :) Sony Bridge for Mac has since been upgraded to version 3 and syncing is now completely smooth.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome !!!", "Author": "sa", "ReviewID": "R2K2NOGQKHB7EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife bought this phone for me as my birthday gift.

I now can pick up my buildings wifi signal in places that the iphone did not! the camera is great outdoors. not as good indoors as I would like and sometimes its slow and I have even had a few freeze ups while using the cam. Ice cream sandwich is good too although it has its clunky moments prob due to the phone being single core. the on-board memory is lacking also.

The spelling check of the words in any language, is most times wrong and messages have to be corrected 5-6 times before they become correct. A lot of intensive keying, much more than with a normal dumb phone.The worst phone I've ever had, very low quality. It was a waste of money (more than 300 Euros, 380 USD), that could have been used in a quality product from the competition. The Android system doesn't help, as most of these problems are a combination of hardwarde and software flaws. Applications are resource intensive (lots of memory and processor hungry) and low quality in general. I bought three Xperia (two ARC S and one Xperia X) for the family and it's the same low quality and problems all over. Also due to the ARC design, the phone cannot stay flat on a table. When you press the screen it moves and doesn't stay stable (but this is not the reason why it doesn't accept the key entries. The permanent errors with the key entries happen when you hold the phone and it's stable in your hand).This review applies to both Xperia Arc S and X as I have both.Also it turns off by itself many times, suddenly and without warning.

Continuous use may go up to 10 hours, but when you ARENT using the phone, the battery actually depletes a lot. I literally charged it up to 100% and left it in a backpack, came back to it 6 hours later and it was at like 17%. It's pretty messed up. Oh and charging it is another hassle. I must of used at least 4 chargers, and on every one i have to move the phone to a specific location for the charging to start, therefore i cant use the phone while it is charging. The battery is so important, which is why the problems with it let alone make me give the phone a 3/5. Second, the phone usually either lags for 10 seconds each time i try and text as fast as i can. It just locks up the whole phone and i have to wait. Ocasionally, the phone even shut of for a few minutes. However, if you actually get to use the phone it is amazing.

I LOVE Sony products. I think they are so beautiful and work so well~! I just really adore Sony. I went out of my way to get a Sony phone because I want to support my favorite company as much as I can. I already own a PS3, a PSP, and a PS Vita and now I have a Sony phone to match! XPWith that being said, I couldn't be happier with my phone. I got in during an Ebay auction for $172, so I'd check there before buying it on Amazon, unfortunately. I love how sleek the phone runs and Ice Cream Sandwich looks gorgeous on my phone. I especially love the Media player, the camera and Timescape, which shows the pictures of everyone who sends you a message or something. It's actually really cool to scroll through and see all your texts in little boxes, IMO.The one downside, which I can't blame anyone but T-Mobile for, is that my phone actually only uses 2G speeds. It can connect to 3G, but it constantly cuts in and out, which I discovered when I tried to make a call using the 3G service. It will drop the sound, though the person on the other end can hear you, then cut back in. So yeah, just stay with the 2G, it's really not that bad.

The phone has a dedicated HDMI port (samsung is yet to make such a phone) and USB on-the-go - great for connecting keyboards, mice, even wireless bundles. However, to connect USB mass storage devices like flash drives, cameras, other phones, you need to root the phone.The SONY firmware is very close to pure android and I prefer it to Samsung and HTC alternatives. The only flaws with this phone are 1)the lack of dual core processor - some lag in gingerbread noticeable and now constant that I've upgraded to Ice Cream Sandwich, and 2)low onboard memory - some apps cant be moved to the sd card, so storage becomes an issue if you have too many such apps.
