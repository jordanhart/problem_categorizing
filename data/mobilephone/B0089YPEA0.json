{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Phone Specs But Not Working As It should", "Author": "Anne Feedback", "ReviewID": "R21RD89PA01T0C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The technical specs and features on this phone were good when presented online but lacking when the actual phone was recevied.  The audio player was not working and showed memory card 'empty' when songs were played.  Also very crucial is the fact that the default factory setting was set in the Spanish language.  In the United States, the default factory setting for equipments or devices is English and this information should be made available on the ad.Another factor to consider is that the manufacturer BLU Products will only accept items for warranty repair TRHOUGH the distributor.  This will normally take between 4 to 8 weeks to be completed.  This means that your cell phone will be out of commission for about 1 to 2 months, which is quite long if you do not have a backup phone.Lastly, was very dissatisfied with customer service by UnlockedCellPhoneKings.  Sent a customer service follow-up inquiry on seller's initial reply regarding defective audio player \"It should play your songs from your memory card once it is correctly formatted\".  When inquired what exactly was meant by CORRECTLY formatted, seller NEVER bothered to respond.This could have been a very good budget phone had it worked the way it should.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works Fine", "Author": "M1911 Guy \"m1911guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3HKZ9WW4SH1SO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good basic phone. good for overseas travel. the memory is very small basicly about 20 kbytes. on the phone. but you can add a mini sim card. and have tons of memory. but i did not by this phone for memory and music. thats why i have an ipod or regular cell phone. this is good for basic use. and works great in latin america.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Shawny", "ReviewID": "R1AJ6J2CUTEKAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The longest I've gotten out of the battery was 17 days I believe.

The phone is great in a lot respects but you can't adjust the time or the menus are incomplete in the software.
