So, I have a great little phone, looks great, sound, texting, imaging.. photographs are fantastic.. And I cannot charge it..  If you buy the phone new.. you will be very pleased, but buying it used .. you take a chance on the sellers lack of total honesty.  Now, the only option is to find another version of the phone that has the same battery size, and buy a new battery..  Good luck..", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fair", "Author": "Jean Green", "ReviewID": "RQJQFA4A85HQE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I Chose this rating because I didn't like the phone it was smaller than I thought it would be the condition wasn't good I would say fair", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Question", "Author": "Eveline", "ReviewID": "R3KELKR8PLEUGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does it have 2 (two) or 1 (one) camera.
