{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent phone for the price", "Author": "Christopher J. Jurado", "ReviewID": "R3PZGWB6FWONFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had better phones - but they were far more expensive phones. Now that I'm running with tablet PCs my need for a smart phone has lessened. This little wonder does very well for the price. No slowdown - though I do have to restart it every other day for stability reasons. (Not a big thing since I had to do that with my iPhone and Androids in the past as well) Being that it is unlocked I've been able to experiment with different carriers. First T-Mobile and now H2O Wireless. Call quality is great and the SPEAKER IS LOUD.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall a good bang for your buck", "Author": "Hinotori", "ReviewID": "R8TR7C7DIWRM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really liked this phone, for this price, it is a steal, my girlfriend wanted one smartphone that was not huge, and she is particularly fond of fun colors, so, this Cyan tone was perfect for her.This phone has a good camera with a LED Flash, frontal camera for those Skype / Chat needs, NFC, dual core, it is really fluid and easy to use.Why not give it 5 stars? WP8 still has some way to go, it is amazing, for example, to find out that you simply CAN'T set the alarm volume, it will alarm at maximum volume and that is it, it doesn't even have a way to set the alarm to increase the volume gently as it is ringing... There are other small things to nag about, i.e., facebook messages are not received/sent unless you are online, if you are invisible in the chat (so you do not get bothered by people using MSN/Skype thinking you are ready to chat)... I would expect that you at least would receive messages, and, your messages should be sent ASAP... But that is not what happens...But, again, for this price, unlocked, can't think of a better deal, you could get an used and really dated iPhone 3G, or, an Android Phone that doesn't have enough CPU/RAM power to run the system.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BIQXW1O"}}
