It does significantly increase the field of vision of the existing lens, but the distortion is also significant. This is a fairly fun effect for the first few minutes and it might let you get a reference shot that would otherwise be missed, but doesn't really lend itself to much day to day practical use.The lens is attached to your camera via a sticky ring and it can be put on and taken off very quickly without leaving any residue. It is useful to have the camera on and view the placement on the LCD to make sure the lens is properly placed and not obscuring the existing lens.This might not be for everyone but it is small and fairly inexpensive so I carry it with my small camera just in case I ever find a use for it.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Jelly Lens for iPhone", "Author": "JustAGirlNamedJess", "ReviewID": "RQX3FJPA6OAJ6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You get what you pay for. It was cheap in price and was cheaply made. It is suppose to \"stick on\" over the camera hole. Which it does the first time then it loses the \"sticky\" and keeps falling off.

Kershaw", "ReviewID": "R31PK852MZJ60K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not sure what I was expecting, but I bought the lens hoping to use it on my Kodak Zi8. The first thing I noticed was that all but the centre of the image is fuzzy. The second thing I noticed was that the sticky part of the lens only held it in place for a couple of mins before falling off, making it totally unsuitable for use. The glue's not even strong enough to hold the protective cap in place for more than a few mins.Pretty much worthless to me. Will only use if I need a specific wide angle shot and I can hold the lens in place.On the other hand, it was $3.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the price.", "Author": "UnTaiMaiShu", "ReviewID": "R1XSAISPW1GDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great concept and it works.  Using the Jelly Wide Angel Jelly Lens along with a Kodak Zi6 and the LG Env2 camera phone.
