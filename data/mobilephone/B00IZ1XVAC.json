No BS Apple move.The feel of the phone is the best of the series. Yes it's plastic but it is definitely more upscale feeling to the touch while maintaining a light weight, and aesthetically both the front and back look great.The screen is the best I've ever seen on a smartphone, crisp, colorful, and bright.The camera is an important feature for me and I'm happy to say it doesn't disappoint - it's fast, takes great photos, the live HDR mode is awesome as well. The only thing i'm not sold on is the 16:9 aspect ratio being the only mode at 16mp. You can do a standard 4:3 aspect but at 12mp. But still not necessarily bad since mega pixels don't mean much compared to the actual sensor used.The speaker is loud and clear, reception for both the phone and wifi is great too. Better than my S3 with the 4.3 update, on that note Kit Kat is awesome!One last note, the IP67 rating/ water resistance and dust resistance is an amazing and welcome feature.In summation:If you're coming from an S3 then your contract is probably up this year, and this is an amazing upgrade to a phone I loved. It really wasn't even a question for me. Size, aesthetics, features, adding your own memory, and still being able to replace your own battery made this a clear choice over the HTC M8, and others.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "can't go wrong with this phone", "Author": "Joseph Johnson", "ReviewID": "RIKIENOBZLJ4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took a while to decide what phone to upgrade to. When the HTC one m8 came out I was positive that was the phone for me, I was very unimpressed with its camera. When thever s5 came out, I was disappointed in the gimmicks Samsung took with the phone. However, there are so many features on this phone that truly do improve the experience. Customizing the operating system is fantastic, and many of the internal software features come in handy often. I actually have grown to like the one handed use feature which shrinks the screen to what ever side your tub is on. Samsung does include useless other features, but they all work as advertised.The camera is fantastic, I had an 8 mp camera on my last phone and this is truly better.  Plus many of the features on the camera are fun and very useful. In deciding which phone to choose the camera was one of the most important to me and I am happy with the performance of this one.Anyone who reads this should know that buying a flagship device will most often be an improvement over previous devices. I owned a motorola Droid bionic for 2 years, it served me well, but going from that to my Shiney GS5 feels like I moved from a record player to an ipod, or a pinto to a Lamborghini,  or apartment to mansion.  If you are moving off a two year contract like I did, any flagship device will be a vast improvement,  justhe find features that are important to you and decide from there.As a side note, I'm finding the battery life is excellent,  batteries themselves have not changedone much, but management of power usage has and the gs5 manages the power exceptionally.

The charging port has a door, which is located at the bottom of the phone.  This makes it impossible to use any type of charging dock with the exception of a wireless dock, which by the time you get a new back for the phone and the charging pad, is another $100.  I would pay the money, but that also means that I can't use a case for the phone unless I take it out of the case every time I charge.On the bright side, the camera in this phone totally rocks.  It has downloadable effects (filters) that you can use, the capibilities are endless.  I like the \"private\" mode and the \"kids\" mode.  Both work with the fingerprint scanner. Private mode allows you to put things like your Christmas shopping list, or photos etc, in an area that no one else can tell is even there. Kids mode allows you to choose what the child has access to.  The camera filters for children are adorable!  They have age related games for children of all ages as well.  What a plus when trying to keep a child busy or quiet in an unexpected situation!Charging is quick and the battery life is good...yesterday I went the entire day using only 18% of the battery...went to bed with 82% left. Not bad in comparison to the S3 I had.On the whole, I totally recommend this phone....its pretty cool :-)", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Currently the most technologically advanced phone", "Author": "gnef", "ReviewID": "R2K77DEH2JRCJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been up for an upgrade for many months, but nothing piqued my interest until this phone and the HTC One M8 came out.It took me a while to debate between the two phones, but here is what eventually sold me on the Galaxy S5:-Wireless charging option. I plan on getting the replacement back cover and a wireless charger for my desk, as well as a wireless charging car dock-Camera. Higher Megapixels and faster focusing. Low light is still not great, but an improvement. This phone takes pictures very quickly.-Fingerprint scanner. Not as convenient as on the iphone, but still a nice way to unlock the phone.-Battery is replaceable and of significant mAH.-IP67 ratingHere are some other thoughts:-I liked the HTC one M8's dual front speakers, but it added a significant length to the phone, which frankly, all these phones are on the large side already.-I like the aluminum back of the M8, but I know that I would scratch it quickly, it doesn't allow for wireless charging, and is not easily replaceable. In this regard, I actually like that the S5 has a plastic back that is replaceable.-Both HTC and Samsung has some nifty software features with their own flare, and Kit Kat is also nice - on both phones.-the infrared port is fun to play with to control the tv and bluray player, and works quite well.I do plan on adding a tempered glass cover to try out and see how well it works. I am undecided about cases, especially since I intend on wirelessly charging, and the replacement back cover isn't available yet, and most likely will add some thickness. I want to get the wireless charging cover before I look for cases. With the Qi standard, it should be able to charge through the thickness of the case.One reason why I want to wirelessly charge, is to keep the USB 3 door cover closed at all times to retain the IP67 rating, and not have to worry about that as well as wearing out the charging port.Other factors that I generally like about the S5, but were not the deciding factors:-heartbeat sensor-usb 3, faster transfers if I directly connect the phone to the computer, as well as compatibility with a greater number of cables (both 2.0 as well as 3.0 now)-All current wireless standards (including mimo for ac, dual band, etc.)-2.5 Ghz processorThe Galaxy S5 is not THE best in every aspect (I wish it had a better speaker, more abilities from the lock screen, came stock with the wireless charging back, more Ram, etc.), but it is excellent (if not the best) in many areas, and overall for me, was the best option and compromise from what is currently is available.I keep my phones for at least 2 years (my last phone was the Droid Razr MAXX), and I expect to be able to hold on to this phone for at least that length of time considering the features of the S5, especially the battery which tends to be the shortest lasting part of any phone.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Samsung Evolution", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R2GTBEC9R9MUVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the \"natural\" setting, as the \"vivid\" and even \"standard\" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the \"back\" and \"menu\" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59\" x 2.85\" x 0.32\"(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury \"F\" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and \"Google Street View\" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Specs - Average Phone", "Author": "P. Lundberg", "ReviewID": "R26C8E0T39UHAJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is frustrating.  It has top of the line specs and most all the features you could ever want in a phone.  Yet the overall experience is lacking.I bought this phone for a few reasons:  Expandable storage, optional inductive charging, and water resistance. This is the only phone on Verizon to offer all of this.Physically, this phone is light although a bit large for the screen size compared to the LG G2 and Nexus 5.  I have read this is due to the water resitance.  If so, it's a compromise I can live with.  The back of the black (dark charcoal) one is dimpled and slightly soft-touch, which I like.  The white one I looked at in the store was NOT soft touch.  I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else.  There is a plastic chrome strip going around the outside.  Normally I don't mind chrome, but the ridged edge on the S5, combined with the plastic chrome volume and power button and dimpled back looks tacky.  There is also a door you need to pry up to access the USB port.  I don't mind because I like the water resistance and plan on getting an inductive charging back for it.  It generally looks nice, but not nearly as nice as most of its competitors.  It doesn't creak and make noise when handling as Samsungs have been known to in the past.  Online drop tests seem to indicate it is a durable design, so personally I don't really care about how \"premium\" it looks. I much prefer a grippy soft touch plastic to slippery metal that is prone to scratches.The home button/print scanner is a physical button rather than capacitive.  At first I didn't think I'd like it, but then I realized it also turns it on which is nice.  I still don't know if I like it, but I don't mind.  There are also capacitive back and multitask buttons along the bottom.  I do wish they weren't invisible when not lit up and swapped like on other Android phones, but I am glad they are there rather than just having on-screen buttons that take up screen space like on the Nexus 5.The screen looks nice.  Frankly, I think 1080 screens are overated and find 720 screens just as nice.  I don't hold the phone up to my nose after all.  In regular use, I don't find the resolution to be much if any improvement over my old EVO qHD screen.  Brightness and color are much better though.On to the features.  The main selling points of this phone over others seem to be the water resistance, heartrate monitor, and fingerprint scanner.  The heartrate monitor requires you to be still and quiet.  In other words, it's pretty useless and should not factor into your decision at all.  The water resistance is a great feature I think every phone should have.  I don't plan on torture testing it but there are videos online of it surviving an hour under water, a pot of boiling water, and a washing machine.  This is an important feature for me as I spend a lot of time outdoors.  The fingerprint scanner is good enough that I continue to use it.  I have both thumbs and a finger set up.  It would be nice to have one more finger available to use to cover all the ways I hold the phone.  It's a bit picky that you swipe straight down, keep contact with the button, and don't go too fast.  But once you get it down it works OK.What really lets this phone down is Samsung's TouchWiz interface.  While it offers a lot of features, some more useful than others, it is also laggy, clumsy, arguably ugly and overall just not an elegant interface.  Yes, I can use a launcher or root it or whatever, but then I'd lose the features it offers.  Two years ago that kind of thing was acceptable on Android, but I don't feel it is today.There's no getting around the lag.  I don't understand how anybody can claim it doesn't lag.  Scrolling is often not smooth.  There is a slight pause every time you select something.  All around you will find random stutters and jitters.  The camera is especially bad, often taking 6-7 seconds to snap a picture when first starting up.  This is not an Android thing as the MotoX, G2, One M8 and Nexus 5 all do not suffer from this. I wouldn't call it terrible, but it really puts a damper on the overall experience.  That's not to say this is a slow phone.  It's very fast once it does start to do something.  But there's a difference between fast and fluid. This phone is not fluid, especially compared to an iPhone or Windows Phone.  It always feels a step behind in its reactions.  If you look on forums you will find a lot of complaints about this and also a lot of \"fixes\" that include reducing or disabling animations.  I've done all that and it really doesn't matter.The tradeoff of course is all the features TouchWiz gives you.  There are a ton of customizations you can do to make it function just the way you want.  Oddly though, you cannot change the color scheme from the default teal and pastel.  This is the first cell phone I've owned in the past 10 years that didn't allow that, which is puzzling considering the point of something like TouchWiz is to make the phone more customizable.  It was also a bit complex getting everything setup the way I wanted.  Not very cohesive.  That could just be unfamiliarity with TouchWiz.The default email app, for whatever reason, tells you to use the Gmail app for Gmail.  I'm not sure why this is.  I setup Gmail anyway on the default app and it seems to work fine so far.The IR blaster is kind of neat but not real useful.  The \"Smart Remote\" to use it is lacking.  It can turn things on and off, adjust volume, and do other basic things but it's not going to replace my Harmony remote.  Or any of my remotes.  It's pretty weak and needs to be pointed almost directly at stuff to work, which is understandable when you see the size of it.The camera, once it gets around to snapping a picture, is fantastic.  Easy to use, great quality, just great all-around for a phone.  Plenty good enough to replace my old point-and-shoot Sony camera, but not my DSLR of course.  The trouble with lag seems to be worse when opening the first time in lower light situations and it can be aggravating.  I saw there is a patch to address this but I don't have it yet.All around phone funtionality is good.  Radio strength, sound quality, speed, contact functionality are all good.  Maybe not the best out there, but pretty solid.  Speaker quality is OK but not as good as some other phones.  It's good enough that I don't have trouble in the car with it.  The virtual keyboard is the best I've used.  It's accurate and does swype, predictive text, and has an extra row on top for numbers.  Contact dialing/texting is fast and easy.The S5 does support inductive charging which I plan to use.  It should come standard though and not require a new $30 cover.  The charging cover also adds a bit of bulk, so that the camera is recessed a bit rather than raised.  So if you get that some cases may not work with it.Battery life has been OK.  It makes it through a day fine with my use.  Probably average by today's standards.  There's no way for me to compare it to any other recent phone with my personal use so I won't try.  The USB3 charger charges it in about 90 minutes which is great.  What's not as great is you can't use the included USB3 cable on older microUSB devices.  You can, however, still use standard microUSB cables to charge the phone, so that's not a big deal.There are a ton of features on this phone so I won't keep going on and on.  The bottom line for me is that this phone offers the main features and functions I wanted but Samsung needs to do a lot better with the overall cohesiveness and fluidness of TouchWiz.  There's really no excuse for it with Android KitKat.As for other phones, I like the MotoX but the muddy camera was a dealbreaker.  The LG G2 was nice but water resistance and conventional buttons on the side rather than the back won out.  I didn't like the slippery metal case and on-screen buttons on the HTC One M8.  iPhone was never an option, way too small and I hate how simplistic iOS is and how closed their ecosystem is.  Nice, but not for me.  Also looked at a Nokia Icon since I love Windows RT on my Surface.  Windows Phone OS is slick and the phone is just very nice all-around.  Windows has certainly come a long ways, but it's not all the way there yet.  Things like the phone dialer and email aren't all that great.  Ultimately it was the features and Android ecosystem that Samsung won me over with.  There are just a lot of good phones out there today, which is why I give this an average rating.  I got it on sale, I probably would not have paid full (contract) price for it over a MotoX.  For a hundred dollars more it was worth it, but only because I wanted a good camera to take family pictures with.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone!", "Author": "Matt 55 \"MC\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZSBL84UHG55J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely love this phone.  I switched from the iphone 4s and am very happy.  I was nervous about switching since I have been a long time iphone user but I can say from what I have experienced so far I feel confident I made the right choice.So far I have found a few little things that have made me really enjoy the switch.  The obvious screen size and resolution on the Galaxy S5 are a huge upgrade from the iphone.  The camera and video quality is also far superior on the Galaxy S5. The keyboard that appears when entering text is highly superior to the outdated iphone version.  It may sound small but it is one of my favorite features.  The keyboard has numbers across the top which saves me time from jumping from an alpha keyboard to a number keyboard, which is extremely helpful when entering passwords etc.  Also you have the ability to access other characters such as commas, questions marks, dollar sign, @, and colon from the main keyboard by holding down the corresponding letter, which is another huge time saver.  The auto correct and suggestions based on what you are typing is much better - it is easier to select suggestions, the suggestions are more relevant and also include previous entires such as email addresses, and it is easier to decline the suggestions or auto-corrections.  A few other small things that I really enjoyed was the ease of manipulating photos for wallpaper/background.  I have trouble cropping and using an image on my iphone but was easily able to accomplish it on the Galaxy.  I also found the alarms much easier to set, customize, and create a recurring schedule for.  I haven't gotten to test everything yet and I do have to set up and get used to using Double Twist (downloaded app) to replace itunes for my music but so far I am so happy with my switch from an iphone.Obviously people have different needs, opinions, and biases on what they want in a phone but I am very happy with the features and ease of use of the Galaxy S5 over the iphone.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice toy.", "Author": "cifrank", "ReviewID": "R32HIMW82FES7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Galaxy 5 really is a good piece of equipment and yes it is very fast but what a power sponge it is.

Durability - I relied on the professionals to test the durability (cnet, etc.). However I do know that the phone is at least as durable as the S3 which I dropped on the concrete several times at 3' to 5' and the gorilla glass never broke and the phone worked normal, also used it in the rain with no problems. The phone is one of the most durable excluding construction phones available.2. Signal strength - the same as most phones, only older non smart phones that have extended antennas and phones that allowed you to connect to signal boosters and external antennas will get you a better signal.3. Voice Quality - Tried speakerphone, Bluetooth, headset and regular mic. everyone I spoke to told me the voice clarity was very good. On my end I found the volume a little on the low side and had to use the increased volume option in a noisy environment.4. Camera - The quality of the picture in still - auto mode, panorama and movie mode is excellent. The delay people experience is the camera compensating for the environment so you get a good quality picture. The picture quality in my opinion rivals a good non-professional digital camera.5. Screen - Screen size is one of the largest available on a cell phone. Screen clarity is amazing and you can even see images and use the key pad in direct sunlight a great improvement from older phones.6. Surfing the internet - I tested the phone on WIFI and received up to 57mbs. (The fastest speed my provider had), the phone processor is as fast as a good computer. People that complain about the connection speed in my opinion are having a carrier problem not a problem with this phone.7. Heart beat monitor - Yes it works, but it is very sensitive and you may have to re-take the measurement several times.8. Music - no problems with clarity.8. Battery Life - Over 24 hours with \"normal\" usage. Normal being texting, music, voice, camera in still mode, use.9. Overall Impression: Very well constructed, options work as advertised. I believe you will have a hard time finding a better quality phone. In my opinion the only real negative was the volume during calls; it was \"ok\" but in my opinion should be a little louder in normal mode.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing screen, sweet power sipping mode, IR blaster, great camera, fingerprint secured, and water and dust resistant!", "Author": "Brian Herro", "ReviewID": "R253V5OW1G3EWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE CHARGERPlease note that while the S5 has a special looking port for charging (a USB 3.0 port) you CAN use the old charger from one of your other Android powered devices!  It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so.AMAZING SCREENThis display is nicer than any I have ever seen. It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye. It's also bright, very bright! It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky. In really bright conditions, the screen boosts the maximum allowable brightness when the auto-brightness feature enabled! So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled. Unlike in previous iterations, it is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless. I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the 1080P resolution, the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed).  The Super AMOLED screen seems to have been perfected in this device!  You have to see it to believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful 1080P display that knocks the competition out of the park. The size of the screen is a big plus in my opinion, as well and is especially fantastic given its...CONVENIENT MULTITASKING CAPABILITIESYou can run two programs on the screen at the same time, in a split window arrangement.  The really fast processing ensures that doing so doesn't cause lags.  Even with two apps sharing the screen, the phone's operation is butter smooth.  And the 5 inch display means that you have plenty of real estate for both apps.INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODEThis thing is for real. With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day. The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens in which a black pixel is really just a pixel in which the backlight has been blocked. Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons.  This means that a tiny fraction of the pixels are powered.  This mode also reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the phone's four cores, reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web. You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps. Basically it turns your phone into one of those old brick phones that lasted forever. That's pretty sweet in a pinch!At 100% power, activating ultra-power saving mode gives you 12 DAYS of standby time!  I figure with regular use I'd get a week. You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally (calling, texting, and some web surfing) and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it. I'd love to test that theory. But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger.THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNERIt takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use using my thumb, and after a week, it registers on the first try just about every time). No one else can access my phone and should I try and fail to unlock the phone too many times, I can then enter a password to unlock it. I had to do that a few times the first day of use. But with frequent use, I quickly learned to unlock my phone on the first attempt. I am a huge fan of the fingerprint scanner.IR BLASTERI can use the IR blaster to operate my TV. Along with Bluetooth and WiFi, the infrared blaster basically gives you the chance to make your phone a universal remote!WATER AND DUST RESISTANTI love that you could accidentally drop the phone in a puddle or have it fall out of your shirt pocket into the toilet, sink, or bathtub and you'll be just fine. It's nice that a downpour won't short-circuit your phone, and it's pretty spectacular that if you forgot to take the phone out of your pocket before doing a load of laundry, you'd likely retrieve a perfectly operable phone from the washing machine. Not sure about dust resistance, I never had a phone die from dust, but I'm guessing it's happened before and it's nice that it won't with this phone.CAMERAIt's a behemoth. It's a 16 megapixel camera that takes beautiful and sharp pictures. It takes great low-light pics without the need for activating the camera flash. I used it during my Nephew's baptism recently. My aunt saw the pictures on my screen as I took them and reviewed them. After the baptism, she looked at my phone and said, \"Your phone takes such beautiful pictures! I'd rather have a phone that takes pictures like that than this thing (she was holding up her really nice digital camera)!DESIGNIt's functional. The S5 is made of a nice looking textured soft-feeling plastic that I think looks quite premium and is reminiscent of perforated leather (although the plastic is panned in almost every official review--I like it). Mine is white and looks fantastic, but isn't quite as soft as the black variant--which is actually a dark grey rather than black.  Nonetheless it feels nice in the hand and doesn't get as hot or cold as metal gets. It has better grip than metal, and that's important to me. You don't want to go around dropping a premium phone. And because it's flexible, the plastic cover pulls right off the back of the phone so you can replace the battery (which isn't really necessary with Ultra-power saving mode--see above), or add some extra storage with MicroSD card slot.  My only complaint design-wise is that the \"chrome\" side of the phone is painted plastic.  I've dropped it a few times and the chrome paint chips off very easily, and on this phone it serves a very important purpose.  The screen is slightly recessed, so the chrome takes a beating if you drop it.  It should be a durable unpainted metal that doesn't chip or scratch.THE NEGATIVEThe only negative I've seen, besides the painted chrome plastic part of the phone that chips really easily, is the loudness of the speaker. It doesn't get all that loud. Some people complain about the plastic back cover.  I love it.  It's functional, grippy, and attractive. I prefer the textured plastic to just about anything else. Others actually complain about the port cover! To them I say BOO-FREAKING-HOO! Oh no, a cover that lets your phone survive a tumble through the freaking washing machine! How truly awful!THE VERDICTUltimately the S5 looks really nice, stays alive forever (as far as modern smart phones go, anyway), can be used as a universal remote, has an incredibly bright and stunningly beautiful display that is readable in the direct light of the sun, has a fantastic camera, has a really convenient and pretty sure proof security system with the fingerprint scanning set up, can survive a tumble through the washing machine as well as lots of dust, and has a plastic design that allows for the immediate and screw-less opening of the device for the swapping of a battery or the addition of a MicroSD card! Five stars? Well, since you can't give 4.8 stars (minus 0.1 for the speaker that isn't loud enough and another 0.1 for the plastic chrome painted side that chips too easily), yep!", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've owned", "Author": "Mortimer Littlepaw", "ReviewID": "R1OIVB3QBCNL1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "....and I've had it for 2 days.

He is also REALLY attached to the physical Qwerty keyboard of his old Env3 type flip phone (Env3 in 2014? See what I mean?) especially for text messaging (usually to YELL AT ME IN ALL CAPS!) So imagine my surprise the morning the Galaxy S5 launched,  to be awakened FOUR Hours before Verizon even opens to be told WE ARE GETTING S5s. Seriously?  WE?! It's MY account.  We? I've been holding out 2.5 years for Motorola to get off its behind for the Droid 5, WE are getting S5s?Did I mention that my Archie Bunker has a partially paralyzed hand AND peripheral neuropathy? He has very limited sensation in his hands....I'm smelling disaster.  Four whole hours. Til Verizon opens. We get breakfast.  We stalk Verizon.After the kind store manager gave us an S5 to play with for awhile,  I reluctantly ordered a black and white matched pair.  Grreat. Now I had all weekend to await the arrival of my dreamship while fear began to engulf me.  What have I done?! What am I thinking?!  We are talking about my Archie Bunker here (no!  I am most certainly NOT Edith!)The phones arrived.  We're activated. I set up his Google account and calendar (forgetting all about his stored contacts on his ancient phone...), and began hunting down the most crucial apps and laying out his desktop in an orderly fashion - Gmail, clean sweep, advanced task killer, the weather channel, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Hulu+, TED, Kindle, etc. Widgets,  can't forget those!  I also installed a screen protector and leather case.  (hint: have your technomage spouse or technogeek grandkids do this for Archie types!) It was time to turn him loose. I cringed in fear.A month has now lapsed.  I'm ready to write this review.Wow. Despite the hand issues, he has figured out ways to make the touch screen respond appropriately. He's become a regular on Facebook, even at 3am from bed! His adult kids are angered because he stopped communicating as much (note: we eventually realized the S5 shows ACCOUNT names on incoming calls,  when he sees his 'ex-wife' calling he obviously isn't answering lol!) and without that physical keyboard he's all but forgotten texting exists...  Even to reply to me. ::sigh::But what has he learned to do?!His LinkedIn is now over 1200 connections,  he's all over Facebook day and night even from the car (passenger of course) and waiting rooms, hitting Like hours before even I see the post! He's found the camera,  our poor German Shepherd Dog now cringes at the sound of the 'shutter' click knowing that bright flash is blinding! Poor Aiko! At least Daddy hasn't yet been posting his candid furball mugs all over Facebook (that's my job!)He's so attached to his S5 it goes with him everywhere! Even to his metal desk in the basement,  which remains our cell phone black hole...

There are plenty of positive reviews that reflect what a solid phone Samsung has built. I'd like to address some of the special merits this phone has now that I've spent a couple weeks with it. *I'm upgrading from a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, therefore I can't speak to what makes this phone different from previous versions.*1. Expandable storage - Yes, the phone only comes with 16GB of internal storage. I use a 32GB card and have no space problems with all of my favorite apps installed. Almost all apps that I've downloaded can be moved to the card. I also use it to store photos and videos. All of my music is stored in Google's Play Music cloud.2. Removable battery - This is a unique feature now that I find helpful. It's worth it to buy a back up battery that you keep charged for times when you don't have access to a charger or an outlet. This is especially useful for long trips. I've found that with moderate use the battery lasts about a day and a half after a full charge.3. Disabling apps - Android phones notoriously come loaded up with software, both from the manufacturer and the carrier. Between Samsung and Verizon there are probably a dozen apps that I don't need. Samsung has a feature that allows you to disable apps you don't use. Although it doesn't remove the app from the phone, it removes it from the app drawer and prevents it from running in the background. Out of sight, out of mind for me.4. Fingerprint scanner/heart rate monitor - Okay, these are definitely more on the gimmick side of things and not phone essentials. However, when used correctly both can be useful. I do high intensity interval training and heart rate is a major part of that. I have a Polar heart rate monitor that I use, and I found that the phone is incredibly accurate for measuring BPM by comparing results from the two. There is a companion app called S-health that allows you to keep track of diet and exercise. In an increasingly health conscious world I find that very helpful. The fingerprint scanner is a good layer of security, but make no mistake, if someone is determined to get in your phone they will find a way. It's more of a safeguard just like having a password would be.5. Vibrant launcher (Touchwiz) with lots of customization - Having owned a few Androids the one thing that always bothered me was the \"coldness\" of the launchers they typically come with. This phone is very colorful and that makes my eyes happy. It's evident that Samsung put a lot of thought into the design of this phone from a software perspective. If you prefer the simplicity of pure Android you'll want to install a custom launcher (there are quite a few awesome ones for free in the Play store) or root the phone.6. It's made of plastic - I immediately put a case on my phone so I honestly don't care what it's made out of. The hardware in this phone far outweighs the material the back cover is made from. However, if aesthetics are a huge concern for you it may not be to your tastes.7. Battery saver - This phone has a couple power saving options. One of these options converts the phone to gray scale and severely limits the amount of processes running to prolong the battery life for days. This is a great feature for people who need their phone on, but don't want to waste battery juice when charging won't be an option for a long time.8. Easy mode/blocking mode/private mode - Each one does vastly different things, and it speaks to the fact that Samsung is appealing to all types of users. Easy mode for people who don't want their smartphone to be TOO smart, blocking mode for turning off pesky notifications during certain times (e.g., turn off phone ringing between certain hours except for certain contacts), and private mode for securing your phone just a bit more. None of these options are on by default so if you don't want to use them, you don't have to. I really like that Samsung baked these features into the phone without making them intrusive. These aren't apps, they are settings.Those are just some of the obvious ways the phone stands out to me. I'll quickly run down a list of things that this phone has that other reviewers love as well: great camera, good battery life, big screen, fast processor, user friendly, good call quality (if anyone is actually concerned about that anymore).If you're already an Android user, this phone will not disappoint. If you're an Apple user thinking about making the switch I suggest you read the return policy (I believe Verizon gives you 15 days). It may not suit your tastes because it is a completely different operating system with a learning curve. I prefer complexity with my phones, but there's a reason iPhones are so popular - a lot of people want a phone they don't have to fiddle with at all.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect size", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIP3V089C8507", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Note 2 was a tad bit big, but this size is just right and still offers a lot of screen space.

Called verizon tech support but they couldn't do anything.2) battery life is okay, but not great.  Granted I use my phone a lot, but I expect a phone this big to have a battery that will get me through the day and this often does not.  Why can't Power Saving Mode or Ultra Power Saving Mode be enabled when the battery reaches a certain %? It has to be manually enabled? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose?3) the volume is low. Can barely hear folks on speaker in my car.

My lady was the S3..now an S5. I frankly looked the heft of the S3 better. I know some think lighter is better but I do not think that is true. For this reason I bought a Zenus case that matches my galaxy note 2014 edition case. For me I have found that in cases you get what you pay for and Zenus is my favorite. Unfortunately they are only made for certain models. The phone handles beautifully except for setting up Microsoft exchange. It told me that I had 10 device limit already. However I am not sure if that may be a server issue holding on to devices not used any longer and I never had 10. All in all I agree with those that say do not pay attention to plastic body. I always use a case. To me it is how the phone functions and this one is great. I really am an android fan and the new galaxy is just what I am liking for. My one and only complaint is the door where the power charger hooks up. It feels flimsy and I always feel as if it is going to break off. It is hard to open without a spare pin or something to get into the place where you open it.

The phone is very fast with minimal lag running any high resource hogging apps.

The processor and ram speed, plus the camera and camera software are the most notable improvements. Pictures have a very fast focus speed and many shooting options available.

I had the S3 for several years and was very happy with it.1) The day after I received my phone, I stopped receiving text messages completely.  I worked with the T-mobile rep to rectify it.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone.  Although I never received my missed texts, it seemed to work after that.  I was told that the phones were shipped with faulty software that Samsung was aware of.  Texts have worked fine since them.2) The speakerphone is a half-duplex instead of full duplex.  That means that when the other person was talking or making noise on their end, they could never hear me.  I was never sure if they were hearing what i was saying or if it was actually going through.  For example, if I was talking to someone on speakerphone who was in their car and had a lot of noise on their end, they would never hear me.  As someone who uses speakerphone a lot, this is a major problem.  My Samsung S3 was full duplex.  I never had this problem.3) My email never properly synced with my server.  If i looked at emails on my computer, they would still show as unread on my phone even AFTER I hit the sync button.  I would delete emails on my phone and after I synced, they would re-appear.4) I would choose a specific ringtone for different friends and it would only work SOMETIMES.  One time I might get the ringtone that I specified and another time I might get my generic ringtone.  No rhyme or reason.5) Because I live in NYC, some subway stations have cell service and others do not.  If I sent a text when I didn't have service, it SHOULD simply send when I got above ground or to a station that had service.  It wouldn't.  The text would just sit there and never send.  I would have to copy/paste it to a NEW text and send again.6) I used the map service to find a friend who was several blocks away.  I had an address and when I put it into the phone, it sent me in the complete wrong direction.  In fact, the map started spinning as if it had no idea how to locate where I was or where I was going.7) There was a serious lag because of Touchwiz.  It's almost as if the phone is thinking about what it needs to do.I'm being shipped a new phone but I'm not sure if it will fix ANY of these problems. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to choose a new one. Samsung REALLY rushed this one out.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's good but....", "Author": "David N. Jorn", "ReviewID": "R2SSNS0HJTNL4M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, the S5 is replacing my HTC Rezound.  No matter what I would have purchased, it would have been better than the POFS Rezound.  The S5 obviously blows the POFS out of the water but there are still some issues. I have had numerous smart phones beginning with the Motorola Q and moving on to the Palm Treo 700W, Blackberry Touch, HTC Incredible, POFS and now the Samsung S5.  First off, the camera takes really good pictures but is still really \"grainy\" when I zoom in.  I have not tweaked any of the settings in the camera, even though I have had the S5 since April 11th(opening day).  In the 22 days that I have had it, it has turned off 3 times on its own.  Once, I was listening to music on the Amazon MP3 app and I answered a phone call but when I ended the call, the phone rebooted on it's own.  It boots really fast so it's not much of an issue.  Two other times, I was downloading apps, and opening/closing certain other apps and it just decided to reboot.  These are not deal breakers.  One of the things that is complete junk on this phone is the \"fingerprint scanner\" security option.  Maybe it is because I have really big hands and fingers, but it would not work at all, period.  It registered my fingerprint but it would never allow me to unlock the phone, using that same finger.  I turned that option off and just went back to the typical \"pattern\" security option.  POFS wouldn't even work when I tried to install Go Launcher Ex so I was looking forward to using it on the Samsung S5.  Nope!!  I downloaded Go Launcher Ex and was using it for a few days and everything seemed to be working well.  I had it on my nightstand, one evening, and when I picked it up, I noticed it was extremely hot.  There was a notice on the screen that said that it was overheating and was shutting down most everything on the phone but the bare minimum until it cooled off.  Yes, I have a task killer installed and it is running constantly so I do not think that I had too many apps running.  The phone was just sitting on the nightstand. I uninstalled Go Launcher Ex and I have not had that issue again.  The Health app is pretty cool but I would trust it about as much as our current dictator. This phone uses USB 3.0 chargers but also will work with your older 2.0 chargers and chords.  One of the greatest things about the S5 is the amount of time that a charge will last.  POFS got about four hours before it died.  Yep, four freaking hours!!!  I regularly get about sixteen hours of use before the S5 dies and that is on days where I am using it on regular basis.  Today, when I hardly used the S5, I unplugged it at 530AM and after almost 12 hours the phone still has 59% available.  As a contractor, one of the big things that drew me to this phone was the fact that it was waterproof but the fact that it is \"dustproof\" is my favorite.  There is a \"charger cover\" that seals the charging port and keeps the phone \"dust/waterproof\".  I am not sure how durable this little piece will be but it seems to be holding up so far.  All in all, this is a good phone and most everyone will be happy with it. I would rate it as 3.51 stars.
