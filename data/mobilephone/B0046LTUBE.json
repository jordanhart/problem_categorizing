{"Reviews": [{"Title": "E7 - Solid Symbian^3 phone. Why should you consider it?", "Author": "Muhamad Yassir", "ReviewID": "R2PPHQWWF8J7PE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update - 27th May 2012It has been a year plus of using this phone. I have been tempted to change to another phone but some things keep holding me back. Maybe I am just sentimental. Maybe it is regret that Nokia decided to prematurely abandon the platform, which is actually pretty good.But mostly I just loved the fact that I can tether it to my laptop to access the internet without paying extra smartphone tethering plan / jailbreak / etc.. (for some reason, some telco considered this phone a dumbphone - thus I can use the unlimited data plan for dumbphone. Which is cheaper. WIN!!)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This is a good phone. But no gadget is perfect and I will go into the pros / cons. Hopefully this will help those who are on the fence to make up their mind.(Really, the Symbian / Nokia users need not much convincing and are already very aware of the phone; while the android / iOS fans will probably just stick with what they are comfortable with).First, I have been a Nokia / Symbian user for a long time. My wife has an iPhone; so I can appreciate both. Played a bit with android but did not spend too much time with it to give a fair opinion on it. On to the review:What about the Hardware?First, the hardware is very nice and is a major selling point. The OLED screen with 'Clear Black Display' really looks nice on the eye. If people are impressed with 'Retina Display' they should be equally impressed with E7 screen with the vivid color and unparalleled contrast. OLED also draws less power and have tricks with the sleeping screen (check Nokia Beta Labs - Sleeping Screen app).The form factor is another reason to consider E7. For those like me, who prefer a hardware keyboard... Let me say that the keyboard is one of the best. The slide mechanism is solid and impressive too.The GPS function can easily replace a dedicated unit out there. Especially since you can sideload map from all over the world free using the OVI Suite.USB on the Go, HDMI output, QuickOffice offer great flexibility in sharing / viewing / moving your files and media. The media / music player is an included standard feature as well.Do I need to mention that the E7 cover all the international variants of GSM / HSDPA frequency band? This means you can access 3G pretty much all around the world where they are available. (Most other phones cover all the GSM frequency variants but not HSDPA.)In a nutshell, the hardware is a solid five. Some may disagree on the camera though. Being a fixed focus with EDOF (Extended Depth of Field), you will not be able to take close up picture. This is a trade-off for the slimmer body. Still, the picture is usable (I suggest to change the color to vivid and use sharpest setting - the camera processing seems to produce a very subdued picture). You may want to check Nokia N8 if camera is more important to you than a hardware keyboard.What about the software?Symbian^3 is a major step up from the earlier version. Still, to really enjoy it, one has to actually go into it and learn the intricacies. So yes, it is not as intuitive (simple) as iOS. But some may actually prefer the flexibility that comes with this. Here is a couple of tips (things I always do when I get a fresh Symbian phone):- Give accompanying OVI suite a try (try the beta version.. it's faster). I mostly use it as an easy way to tether my laptop (yes sir, big reason why I love unlocked Nokia phone) but some of the other features are nice too.- Update all the firmware / apps.- Reorganize the icons into folder structure that make sense to you. It is a hassle the first time but will make a difference as to how you use the phone. (Option > Organize)- Play around with the setting. (Seriously..)- If you really have to have iOS style interface, you can customize multiple shortcut widgets on your 3 home screens. Frankly, I never see the need to do this.- The search widget is quite useful... but do go to the setting to exclude items that you don't want it to index.Here is a tip... touch and hold is like a mouse right click. It brings up context menu for many items in the phone.What about the apps?Sad to say, this is a major con when it comes to Symbian. If you come from Android / iOS, the first thing you will notice is actually the lack of it. This is especially a concern now since Nokia announcement to transition to Windows Mobile. It makes for less incentive for software developers to further develop apps for the platform.That said, thus far, I am still seeing new apps every now and then. And Symbian is feature rich enough that you don't necessarily miss them. Still, here are a couple apps you should get if you do get the phone.- Opera Mini / Mobile : Trust me, this will make your browsing experience much, much better. Nuff said. (also, please tinker with the setting.)- Swype : You don't really need it for this phone because of the hardware keyboard. But if you are lazy to flip it open.- Gravity : Facebook / Twitter client- JoikuSpot : turn your phone into mobile WiFi HotSpot.- Nokia Internet Radio / Tunewiki : Good for listening to Shoutcast radio.- Try out any of the apps from Nokia Beta Labs / Check out Ovi Store...- If you are adventurous, scour the net for various app out there in the net too (I typically go to allaboutsymbian.com for tips, etc)Frankly, there is not much essential apps to mention for now.. I do wish we have a kindle app for the phone (are you listening Amazon?). Maybe Evernote. And maybe more games too. Again, here is an area where I have to say that I envy my wife and her iPhone.What about the performance?So far, the phone is snappy enough. The only time it sometimes seems to freeze is when I am installing new apps (it will resume to normal if you leave it, I just feel apprehensive whenever that happens).So there you have it. The phone does have potentials. Whether it will meet your needs or not is another. I am done tinkering with my phone for now to make it works the way I want and am quite happy with it.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Geob1", "ReviewID": "RDUR7MOE2HV0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I want to say, this is my first Symbian OS phone and it has it's issues. The UI is not as intuitive as an iPhone for example. There were several times I had to read the Help guide in order to figure out how to do some relatively easy things (like adding a non-predefined shortcut to an App onto the home screen). There are fewer apps available for Symbian and there's no SD memory slot. However, once you get used to navigating the Symbian OS's settings screens and get the 3 home screens setup the way you want, this phone cannot be beat. It is relatively quick, the switching between 3G and WiFi is flawless, the calls sound great, the video quality is the best I've ever seen on a phone (try uploading a digital copy of a blu-ray movie) and the keyboard is a joy to type on. Battery life is better than most and the 16 gig memory is sufficient. The Exchange integration is excellent and the OVI maps are awesome (The Trip Advisor integration is a nice touch too). It feels solid and looks great. After using various Android phones and an iPhone 4, I have to say this phone has them beat by far. Yes, there are some things that Android phones or iPhones do better, but overall, feature for feature, this phone is simply the best smartphone on the market at this time. If you want a phone just to play games on, buy an iPhone. If you want a phone that's more than a toy, buy the Nokia E7.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Most Elegant Business Phone yet", "Author": "Jay Busari", "ReviewID": "RO1N54TYEC1MW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Combined touch screen and full slide-out keyboard...Nokia has put elegance into this form factorThe slide-out keyboard is quite comfortable. I can also touch the screen to get the cursor where I want, no need to tap the scroll keys or reach for a mouse.Push mail is now more convenient than ever (use multiple email accounts, choose Ovi Messaging, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Mail for Exchange, Lotus Note Traveller, IMAP or POP).Maps works even when you are not connected to any network (just pre-load maps of the geographic areas you need).Camera gives excellent quality 8MP pictures and HD video. The lack of auto focus simply means I can't take close-ups of documents or displays.MS Office documents can be created and edited (.doc, .xls and .ppt) while waiting at airport terminals and on airplanes.Now I don't need to carry my laptop around for meetings and presentations.Just an HDMI cable to connect to LCD TVs or projectors.E7 can connect to external HDD...I have not yet been able to get it to work with my HDDs, but that may be due to my HDD partitioning scheme and filesystems.Nokia looks to be at a crossroads of the mobile mindshare.If Nokia wants to improve the User Experience or UX...they should seriously take a look at the MOAP UX used on Japanese Symbian smartphones.In 2007, a long time ago in mobile mindspace, these Japanese phones with MOAP UX wrapped around the Symbian OS, had rich media, DVB-TV and push email.The Nokia E7 shows that Symbian can still beat any phone OS available today with features like:  - Networking  - Multitasking  - Efficient CPU and Memory Usage  - Longer Battery Life  - Multiple form factors (touch screen, QWERTY keyboard, T9 keyboard, or any combination)There's a lot of BS going on about Symbian being 10 yrs old technology.Technically, most \"modern\" mobile operating systems are repackaged with graphical interfaces wrapped around \"old\" operating systems.Very few companies can claim to come up with a \"new technology\" mobile phone operating system...a lot of the \"innovation\" is the user interface.Under the hood, Symbian is a solid tried and tested truly mobile phone OS kernel.If Symbian is 10 yrs old then...  - Android is even older (with the 20 yr old Linux kernel)  - Apple iPhone iOS is 25 yrs old (iOS contains the Unix Mach/BSD kernel)  - WP7 is 15 yrs old (WP7 contains the Windows CE kernel)Besides putting in great graphics, animations and eye candy for the GUI...Nokia certainly need to take better care with doing a \"task analysis\" of the user interaction on each phone model (since Nokia have an abundance of phone models that are most likely designed, built and shipped by different groups within the company).This should help bring about consistency with the key press and screen taps for ....different operations for related user actions ....steps to perform similar types of operations.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hardware exceptionally good, software is a problem", "Author": "DJ Patrick \"patrick78418\"", "ReviewID": "R3J3JLD1ENSQJ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is a best looking phone on the market right now. I was so excited to get the phone and I set it up similarly to my N8, which I decided to keep as a backup. The hardware on this phone is exceptional - better than any phone I've had before and it puts the iPhone to shame in terms of its looks, beautiful flip up screen and amazing keyboard which is so easy to use, but the O/S on this phone is not nearly as smooth or user friendly as it should be.Basically the problem is that they have modified Symbian^3 from the Nokia N8 for this phone and whoever has done it has made a real mess of it. Once you have a decent number of apps on the phone ( - incidentally much less than I put on my N900) the phone constantly lags, and even after a hard reboot, unless you turn off the online widgets freezes and needs rebooting all the time - on average I am rebooting it 6 times per day with the widgets on. After hours on the phone with Nokia support they really can't offer any solid suggestions.Until Nokia gets their act together on their O/S I would say that this phone will only serve a niche market - and that really is a shame because it feels wonderful in the hand and has a marvellous display, but without a decent O/S it basically doesn't completely do what it's supposed to do!Note: I have revised this review as I realized that the problems I was having relate to using the online widgets in a non-3.5/4G environment - I will still keep this phone for the moment but will likely upgrade to the new Meego Nokia N9 phone when it appears.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "True Nokia quality at its finest; definitely worth a serious consideration!", "Author": "E. polus \"e.p.\"", "ReviewID": "R36OT250ADP4OL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who's had a Nokia epiphany with the E71 (some time ago) and a somewhat muted (at least, at first) yet ever-growing blast with the E72.Essentially, the jump from a non-touch ~2\" screen to a truly gorgeous 4\" AMOLED touch screen (and the wonderful freedom it allows for Symbian to finally let loose) is just short of life-changing, and thus, if you're making the leap into the touch screen arena for the first time, you can expect to be just as -- if not more -- blown away as I am now. For those of you who've been playing with touch screens for ages now, even I can admit (and, so far, a good number of iPhone and various Android users, too) that this screen's size and brilliance is definitely at or near the top.One more thing before I cover a few, select details: I had heard that Nokia's earlier ventures into the touch screen market didn't quite measure up to the fast, responsive, and flowy moves of iOS (e.g. N97, X6). This was a major worry, because I just couldn't imagine anything worse than being stuck with a physical button-less screen that jolted and froze as I poked around the Symbian interface. However, due to the difficulty in finding independent retailers that had any of the newest models of touch screen Nokias available for demos, I took a very cautious step out, bought the E7, and was most pleasantly surprised! It's a breeze, and even after the wonder of the screen's beauty wares off, the sensitivity, responsiveness, and class (yes, it's classy) will continue to make you ponder how Nokia's E7 could possibly still even have one of the best mobile keyboards ever built!! It's overwhelming...Now, time to be short and sweet and name just a few ups and downs:- The fact that Nokia managed to squeeze the keyboard and screen into a mobile device whose hardware (as usual) is impeccable and truly some of the best Nokia's ever put together (which is saying something, trust me), and whose form factor is as fresh, slim, and eye-catching as a concept phone that's come out 6 months too early, is just unheard of in today's somewhat mundane mobile marketplace. And plus, the whole brick-like \"communicator\" style seemed to be out, but now Nokia has given it more than enough new and improved life to make the E7 also an incredibly unique piece. Tired of having to come up with new tricks and apps (what is that one.. Swype?) to type on a virtual, touch keyboard...and dealing with an unfortunately steep learning curve (which many times doesn't have a top)? Well, why don't I just pop up my screen to this curiously comfortable 30 degree angle and type on a real keyboard! How refreshing...- As always, phone's tend to seem they could use a bit more power. And, like any phone, I wouldn't complain if there was just a little more kick here as well. It's fast, but you'll notice just the tiniest inkling of lag when you're installing new programs (and, ofcourse, new software updates and whatnot, as mentioned by another reviewer here). I have to admit -- being used to Symbian -- I have become patient and understanding when my phones have seemed to freeze for a second or two when introducing new software to them, but it's not the end of the world.- Now that Nokia's officially jumping ship (or \"platform\"....) to Microsoft's mobile OS, one would (reasonably) assume that Symbian's essentially dead in the water. This idea went through my head for a second, but I've put it behind me. First of all, I think Nokia's done a really good job with Symbian^3, and considering that I've only come onboard a few months after the E7's release, there've been a good handful of serious software updates, and I have had nearly zero problems at all with the OS thus far (with only a minor problem installing some updates to Ovi maps and the Symbian search: they'd download, but would continue to fail in installation...but nothing a restart of the phone couldn't fix ... which tends to be an easy and simple fix for most things when it comes to Symbian). Therefore, I have a good feeling that this switch to Microsoft's WP7 will not be much of a problem at all (considering the following Nokia has in the Symbian world), at least, not as much as what it will probably bring to the OviStore (which is also debatable). **UPDATE: Symbian \"Anna\" will be available for the E7, sometime soon (as of April '11)**- Also about Symbian: for those of you who know the OS, I think Symbian^3 on the E7 will be a lot of fun; although I'm definitely used to the ins and outs (however, I'm surely not a pro), I still had to do a little internet research for the usual hidden tips and tricks, and some basic how-to. Those who know Symbian will know what I'm talking about. Symbian isn't about dumbing things down so that everything is as clear as day (and simultaneously taking the customization and uniqueness to the chopping block). There is no one place for all your phone's preferences, for instance. So if you can't find how to change something, don't give up. It's part of the fun and once you figure it out, it'll slowly all make sense, and a wonderful map of a world known as Symbian^3 will slowly form into a coherent, simple, straight-forward and truly logical OS.I'm still discovering plenty on the E7, and I'm still doing double takes at it's distinctive elegance, refinement, and true artistry, as it sits on my table with it's slightly tilted, thin, brilliant face looking up at me over a streamlined keyboard and award-worthy body. If you have yet to jump into the world of Nokia, this is the top of the top and one hell of a place to dive in. For those of you who have anything at the level of an E72 and below (essentially anything but the N8, C7, and, perhaps, the C6), this is definitely a worthwhile upgrade.I'll be back with some pointers!", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "great out of the box", "Author": "Brad", "ReviewID": "R2PDE838W1RZH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok, maybe the screen doesn't move right under your finger like iphone 'magic' BUT these are the reasons I stick with symbian:Pros:free side-loadable(meaning no net connection necessary to use) voice guided navigation and on a nice screen like this really is just as good as any dedicated gps unit out there.again side-loadable content, you can just plug in USB and drag your music, pictures, videos onto this phone and they are there, eat your heart out Itunes.user accessible filesystem, i.e. you can download stuff from the web, pdfs, whatever, make folders, just like you can on a normal PC.out of the box support for viewing and editing and saving locally office documentsout of the box pdf readerintegrated SIP client that works over 3gthe nokia internet radio app, yes, been using it for years, love it. freeintegrated webdav client (remote drives)integrated syncml supportintegrated support for just about every bluetooth feature there is.very awesome GSM support for frequencies and standards, I like delivery reports on sms and even read reports on mmsbattery life is really good compared to android and iOS(depending on your use of course)the graphics processor unit is a beast.uhhh, USB OTG.

Puscau \"Tarzan\"", "ReviewID": "R380OP3WDDS3JX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rarely write reviews, especially for products that majority of people know they are good products.  Nokia, though losing marketshare slowly, is still a big player and with many tricks up its sleeve.  The fact that they design a phone for the end users not the networks, is what keeps it a good phone in terms of customization and controls (privacy, tracking, sharing location, etc).The phone is very slick in terms of being a business phone, a bit bulky..but even with forced feedback touch screen, I still have a hard time using the touch screen to type..even on my wife's iPhone..and the iPad...I guess our ability to sense touch compared to sound is better..so I prefer forced feedback (tiny vibration to let you know you are touching the screen as you type).  So bulky...but that's the beauty..it has a QWERTY keyboard with Ctrl+V+X+C functions (copying and pasting stuff for documents, emails, etc).People complaining about the Ovi app store not having enough apps compared to App Store or Droid Market? Well...all of them offer crap apps anyway..so you won't be disappointed.  If you like crappy free apps, or to pay a premium for \"better ones -aka no ads\" then buy a an iPhone, or Android phone.If you like functionality, business use and ability to still have some fun with your phone...buy this phone.  Great camera (no auto focus....but if you need details up close...buy a real camera).  8MP, HDMI out,  720p video recorder, micro USB to  connect memory stick, office suite (full)....plays all kinds of audio/video formats, it has full version flash (unlike iPhone..who push people to develop apps to display ads..not through flash on sites).The phone itself has many built in security software and other software to keep you buys before buying any apps (tracking, security, locking, etc)Overall...if you remember the communicator (great business phone), this is definitely 100% improvement. And get the Otterbox case for it...you don't want to scratch it:)  Apple and droid have great marketing skills and presentation...but Nokia steals the show....their Symbian OS will be replaced by Windows mobile soon..I am not looking forward to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to login to the phone, but it's not a bad mobile OS.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone if you are a Nokia enthusiast.", "Author": "SAH", "ReviewID": "R216SL5VY8IAMI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 12/12/2011: I have been having trouble with the maps lately. It would not work no matter what. Also the phone died all of a sudden today.I have been using Nokia phones for the past 15 years approx. I have used 3301, 3510, 3510i, e63, e71 and now this. I also have used Android phone for over a year. So I can say I am not new to smart phones and definitely not new to Symbian. I have had this phone for 2 months now.I bought this phone because of my confidence in Nokia. They make amazing phone designs and solid build. Nothing can compare to the build quality on this phone. Nothing! The screen is big and very very clear. Keyboard is out-of-this-world awesome. The design is killer. You put this phone of the conference table and see the eyes rolling, it is that kind of a beast. So I give 10/10 points to Nokia for their design sense which almost all other phones (except iPhone) lack.Phone has a less powerful processor but that is because Symbian does not need high processing speed. Android requires a high processing power so those phones have higher speed processors. You will not find any delays on the phones but the whole Symbian OS is slow when installing new apps. Once installed, they run fine. The menus do not have any noticeable lag even with their animations.I'll put down the pros and cos now to make it easier for you to decide if you want to buy this phone.PROS:The KEYBOARD (10/10) is unparalleled. You will not find a better keyboard on a phone. Period! One thing to notice however, is that slide out keyboard is at times less convenient but on board virtual keyboard is there for you in such situations.GPS (10/10) in this phone beats Google maps by a long margin. It is one of the best navigation devices I have ever used, and the count includes GPS only devices as well. Remember, it is in a phone and what you get is a fully functional voice guided navigation through world largest map company, which is now owned by Nokia. You can have navigation speak in your voice or in many languages. You will also be able to use the GPS if you go abroad since Nokia has navigation and guided maps for a large number of countries, compared to competitors, that have it for US and Canada only.The SCREEN (10/10) is very clear even in bright sunlight. It is seriously clear. It adjusts itself so if you are inside it will be less bright but if you go to well lit area or under the sun it go's brighter. Many phone these days can not be used in direct sunlight. This one can be used without a problem. Clear black is Nokia's technology that makes black look like black on the screen. It is a really good addition. You will love the blacks on this phone.Best MULTITASKING(10/10). You can close an app after using it since all apps have an \"Exit\" option in the menu item which removes the app from the memory.One of the best EMAIL CLIENTs (10/10) that you can find on any phone. It almost looks like outlook in your hands. Very smooth, fast, efficient and connects with Exchange like a charm. You can have upto 10 Email accounts linked and you can set different sync frequency for each one of them. For the main Exchange account you can tell your working hours and the phone will remain in sync (all the time) for your working hours and then you can set it to sync every 15mis/30mins/1hour, as you like, in non-working hours. I think it is simply wonderful.BATTERY (8/10) on this phone is okay. It will get you through the day with heavy use easily but you can not remove it yourself.This phone SAVES YOUR DATA (10/10) since it downloads all the maps on your phone and then, even if you do not have a data plan, you can still use the GPS. It rocks! You will notice a decrease in your data usage once you shift to this phone.CONS:The BIGGEST(06/10) downside to this phone (and I hate to say this) is Symbian^3 which was later upgraded to Symbian Anna. I am not an Android or Apple fan for many reasons. One of the biggest reason is that you do not have much control on the device on Apple. Android gives you that control but it does not have good phone functionality. After all, what you want is a phone first. So, Symbian gives you a good phone with one of the best wireless stack out there BUT an outdated interface. It restarts often. Sometimes it gets annoying. I hope this will get better with Symbian Belle update but only time will tell. Symbian Belle is supposedly coming to the US around January (unofficial). Nokia will now be shipping phones with Windows OS so many people are afraid they will stop supporting Symbian but I doubt since millions of Symbian phones are out there and Nokia will lose their reputation if they stop supporting Symbian. I think they will keep up the support for at least 5 more years. That is just a guess.Many people use a lot of APPS (04/10). I don't! So I do not mind much if there is a pathetically low number of apps available for this phone. Nokia needs to pay banks, insurance companies and other giants to get apps made for them. This can easily be the biggest setback for many people. The installer was down right lazy and slow when I started using the phone but with Anna update and another updates few days ago, installer is better, much better!!!Overall, this is a great phone. If you buy it, give it few days and it will grow on you. You will not want to return it afterwards. BUT if you are app-crazy, this phone is not for you.

Just give the keyboard a try - the virtual iphone one is \"usable\", the tiny Blackberry keys are \"okay\", but the writing experience on the Nokia E7 is just amazing. The large tilting 4\" Oled screen gives you just the right angle of vision and stability, much better than that of undifferentiated mass of Chinese Android Qwerty sliders.Another killer function is the free offline GPS navegation. The iPhone doesn't have it (you have to buy TomTom or Navignon solutions which are good, but not cheap) and the Android phones consume megabytes from the data pack while navigating (and its turn by turn functionality is limited to North America). Nokia owns Navitech, so they are one of the technology leaders in this field - you really don't need a secondary GPS device any longer. The US comes preinstalled, and you can download from the device (no need to connect to a PC) any other map worldwide while you are still under fast and free Wifi coverage.Another important feature is that it is an open and truly international phone. I am traveling regularly to Europe and Latin America. Even an unblocked, jailbroken iPhone is not easy to adapt to different SIM card settings, but this one is a no brainer: slip in a local prepaid SIM card with an local data allowance (which is much easier and cheaper to buy in Europe and Latam as US carriers are still reserving competitive data packs to their contract customers) and voil\u00e1 - the phone updates all settings automatically so you are online in a breeze at low costs, wherever you are. Additionally it is the only nine-band phone I know (5 3G bands, 4 GSM bands), so it works anywhere in the world with high 3G data speeds, guaranteed).Just one minor thing: I like reading news via RSS. The E7 can do that, but the functionality is buried in the menu of the web browser. Also, the contact management could be streamlined a bit, It works, but iOS has better implementations.In summary: after years of Blackberry and, more recently the iPhone, this Phone is the best solution for anybody who writes a lot (SMS, emails, notes, whatever - writing on this phone is MUCH faster produces less typing errors than any other phone I know), for anyone traveling abroad and for anybody who uses the phone as a car/bike/walk navigator.

Chen", "ReviewID": "R1YHNYWPK7U3S0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I've had this phone for about a month now and here my impressions so far:Design:Great build/materials. This was my motivating factor for purchasing this phone. The metal casing, weight, and solid hinges really make this phone feel durable and elegant at the same time. I frequently get compliments on the phone. The keyboard hinge is spring-loaded and feels very rugged and able to withstand time. I would say the build rivals that of the iphone and is definitely superior to the vast majority of android phones I tried out. Most android phones are too plasticky and feel too light/cheap. I like my phones to be heavier with a more solid feel.Software/OS:symbian was my first smartphone OS so I am familiar with its functions (and malfunctions). My old phone was an N97mini, which ran an older symbian version -- this version (^3) works much much better in terms of reliability, usability, and aesthetics. The three customizable homescreens are awesome and allows me to dedicate each to a specific task (I have one for quick contacts and date/time, one for apps, and one for content updates like email, RSS, and notifications) while being very easily accessible. Having different wallpapers for each is also a great feature.As other reviewers have noted, there is definitely a relative lack of apps for the Symbian platform. That being said, I've been able to get all the apps I need for daily use (although I'm not a huge app user). The only apps I use are: the Opera browser (highly highly recommended), Skype, Joiku hotpot, google maps, and youtube. The best part is these are all free.There have been a few instances where my phone has reset due to some crash, but it doesn't happen often enough for it to be a huge issue. The applications all run smoothly with little lag. There's also a multitasking feature (similar to a system tray in windows) that makes running multiple apps easy.In sum, the OS runs well enough and even though there aren't as many apps on Symbian, if you're not a heavy apps consumer it is a non-issue as essential apps are available. If you're heavy on apps then obviously go for an android or iphone.CameraThe camera is definitely the achilles of the E7. Although it's 8 megapixels the fixed-focus lens really cripples the E7's ability to take macro pictures (close-ups). It simply can't resolve clearly things within 8-12 inches of the lens so these objects turn out blurry. In other words, the camera is farsighted. However, I've found that the camera works great taking pictures of things further away such as taking a portrait of friends or capturing some scenery. I haven't used the camcorder feature, but it does take 720p video.ScreenThe AMOLED screen is incredible. The colors are very vivid and the blacks are very true. This is my second favorite feature of the phone (second to the design). I often find myself just looking through pictures on my phone because I'm mesmerized by the vibrant colors. It really makes watching videos and looking at photos a joy.My only complaint about the screen is that it's relatively low resolution for a 4\" screen compared to the iPhone and android phones. This isn't a huge issue and is only problematic when using an internet browser at times since it can't display as many pixels.BatteryThe phone easily lasts a day with heavy use, but I keep a charger in my car just to be safe. I haven't had any problems with battery longevity.Other issuesThe phone does'nt come with a USB connector (only a USB on-the-go connector) so if you want to transfer files from your computer you will have to buy another cable.Conclusion:If you're looking for a simple phone with great build quality and an awesome screen but don't care much about apps or the camera (if you have your own HQ camera) then this is the perfect phone for you. It does the fundamental smartphone functions such as web-browsing, GPS, email, video, and calling superbly.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Elegant Business Phone", "Author": "Jay Busari", "ReviewID": "R339K8O4H20K9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Combined touch screen and full slide-out keyboard...Nokia has put elegance into this form factorThe slide-out keyboard is quite comfortable. I can also touch the screen to get the cursor where I want, no need to tap the scroll keys or reach for a mouse.Push mail is now more convenient than ever (use multiple email accounts, choose Ovi Messaging, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Mail for Exchange, Lotus Note Traveller, IMAP or POP).Maps works even when you are not connected to any network (just pre-load maps of the geographic areas you need).Camera gives excellent quality 8MP pictures and HD video.

I've used other mobile platforms, having owned an iPod Touch 4g, an Android 2.2 phone, and a Windows Phone 7 phone... so if you are considering to switch from one of these platforms you're better off just giving some homeless guy on the street your $400. Don't get me wrong, Symbian is definitely nicer than dumbphones can be- it's just not as flashy or easy to use as other mobile platforms. Personally I'd save my money for when Nokia puts out their WP7 line of phones in the first quarter next year.To be specific:Negatives--The \"multi-tasking\" works but lags when you have more than 2-3 apps open.

I do not use Facebook, Twitter, or generic text messaging. My contacts and calendar come from Outlook, and it's vital that all the detail kept by Outlook for calendar and contacts items be shown on my phone. I strongly want a physical keyboard, but also like a big touch screen. I travel a lot, both nationally and internationally, and am often in rural or other non-major-city areas.Given all that, I've been A VERY happy user of an HTC Tilt 2 (still avaialble used from Amazon at HTC Tilt 2 Touch Pro Unlocked Smartphone with 3.0 MP Camera, 3G, Quad-band GSM/GRPS, WiFi, QWERTY Keyboard, MicroSD Slot) operating on AT&T; Wireless. This operates on all the GSM and nearly all the 3G frequencies used around the world, has a big, sharp, responsive touch screen which slide across and tilts up when I want to use the phone's excellent keyboard. It looks nice and has good battery life. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi work reliably and solidly.The operating system is my favorite of all I've tried, the late and as-yet-unequaled Windows Mobile 6.5. This provides the best-yet-seen compatibility for Outlook and Office, along with compact, efficient, and (in many cases) nicely customizable UIs for the apps (good enough that I turned off the HTC Sense UI that came with the phone), a decent range of commercially available third-party apps, and a generally clean, rational method of operation for those who don't need violent graphics and boredom relievers. My one major customization was to install Opera Mini, an excellent browser which WM was willing to recognize as my default browser.Unfortunately, my Tilt 2 has become a bit creaky, occasionally dropping voice calls after a few minutes even when signal is good. It is also not as plain old gorgeous or as slim as the Nokia E7, which is what I decided to try after finding so few current phones with large slide-out physical keyboards and no other business-oriented GSM phone with a tilting screen.Despite really wanting one in dark grey (available in the rest of the world but not with a US warranty), I bought a new silver E7-00 from Amazon (who delivered it promptly as always) and proceeded to try it. Startup was easy; I simply took the SIM card out of the Tilt 2, put it into the E7, and had connectivity as soon as the E7 started. Syncing contacts and calendar items from Outlook was easy. After trying both, I found Nokia's PC Suite much preferable for my needs (I don't need the entertain-the-kids aspect of Ovi Suite and don't want my info stored on Nokia's server, but I do need regular automatic sync when the phone is connected to my desktop via USB) and quickly had all my many contacts and calendar items on the E7.Except I didn't quite, to a degree that has become unacceptable. The Symbian^3 contacts app does not recognize all (and misinterprets some of) the phone number fields of an Outlook contact. Also, if you use the \"Extension\" field in an Outlook contact, Symbian^3 concatenates the extension onto the phone number, resulting in something AT&T;'s network can't understand at all. Worse, the Symbian^3 contacts app simply can't cope with a long \"note\" in an Outlook contact. After losing much of some valuable long notes in some of my key Outlook contact items and finding no way to scroll through a long note in a contact on the E7, I realized I just couldn't use the E7 as a mirror of my Outlook info. The Symbian^3 calendar app similarly does not properly or safely handle Outlook calendar items.There are more disappointments. Ovi Maps looks great on the phone, works fairly well, and is to be commended for storing the maps on the phone, greatly reducing data consumption during a trip, but keeps losing GPS signal in places where the Tilt 2 never had trouble, and thus is very busy and noisy frequently recalculating the route. QuickOffice is OK, but nowhere near as compatible with MS Office as is the version thereof on WM 6.5. The E7 freezes every day or two, often by showing a frozen and diagonally smeared version of the last screen that operated. It also hangs up and becomes unresponsive to input for several seconds at a time now and then (with few if any open apps).It's possible the new Symbian Anna release might address some of this, but Anna is not yet forthcoming in the US.All this makes me sad indeed, because I've gotten quite fond of the look and feel of the E7 hardware and of the moderately customizable home screens. If I could work around the problems listed above, I'd happily keep the phone even though the Nokia-MS deal may very well supplant it by sometime next year. However, at least for me, the E7 is at best a prototype, with very rough software, of a phone I'd like to own when they finish it.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nokia's Symbian Masterpiece", "Author": "Andy H.", "ReviewID": "R1MX9AVCVK09ON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nokia E7 is probably the most beautifully designed phone, ever. Everything about its physical appearance simply oozes quality and class, with its smooth lines and curves and the 4-inch Gorilla Glass display. The full QWERTY keyboard hides under the beautiful, bright amoled display, and is revealed by pushing the display into a useful viewing angle. The display moves up into position elegantly and smoothly, not in a stiff, clunky way some other phones might. The Clear Black Display technology that Nokia built into the screen offers up really deep blacks and vivid, bright colors. One can easily use it in bright sunlight. The whole device really is a thing of beauty, and you can fully appreciate how much effort the Nokia designers and engineers put into this phone.CAMERA:  The E7 comes with an 8MP camera that is capable of shooting 720p HD video, although its EDoF (Extended Depth of Field) camera does not, unfortunately, allow good close up photos. Macro is out. But high quality photos, especially outdoors, are most definitely in. There are some good photo and video editors built-in as well.HDMI:  By connecting the included HDMI adaptor to your own HDMI cable to your HD TV, you can watch videos (or anything else) from your E7 on your TV. Amazing.USB and MEMORY:  By connecting the included USB adaptor to your USB stick, you can transfer files to and from the E7 to the USB drive. This is a really useful option and allows you to store huge files (such as movies for that long train ride) outside of the phone to keep it quick and snappy. The E7 does come with 16GB of built-in storage. That may not sound enormous, but I have 250 songs loaded on from iTunes via my Mac, a season of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and the History Channel's 'The Presidents' and around 2 dozen photos which I haven't transfered to my Mac yet. I still have 11GB free on the E7, so I'm not concerned that it doesn't have a slot for a MicroSD card - I wouldn't use it. It's all about space really. In order to have a whole season of TV shows on there, each episode needs to be reduced in size - remember a 4\" screen is a lot smaller than your 56\" plasma TV! Having files that are the same size as the originals is just silly. So you get some free software and transcode those movies and shows to fit the device your using it for. Simple really. Just common sense.KEYBOARD:  The keys are perfect in shape and spacing, and it is an utter pleasure to type on the E7's keyboard. Yes, you do have the option to use the on-screen keyboard; if Swype is your thing, download it for free and go for it. 99% of things you type out (SMS, emails, documents, etc) would be most likely be done on the keyboard easiest, so you'd be silly not to utilise it. It is without doubt the best keyboard I've ever used on a phone.NOKIA MAPS:  Nokia is soon to ditch the \"Ovi\" brand and focus on Nokia being Nokia, which seems to make more sense to me. The Maps software is as excellent as it always was, but the newer versions are more accurate, easier to use, and a fantastic free addition to the E7's capabilities. Voice turn-by-turn is great, but more useful is the fact that once downloaded, you can use the maps to navigate OFFLINE. Going abroad? Use Maps without using data. For free. You won't find that in many other devices! Finding your way, either on foot or by car, is an absolute pleasure using Nokia maps. A brilliant piece of software.APPS:  Out of the box you get QuickOffice, a superb office program that allows you to create and edit documents in Word format. In fact this review is being typed out on my E7, in a QuickOffice doc, which I will copy and then paste into Amazon's review section on the Web, because the E7 allows all of the versatility of document creation, in a similar way a desktop PC/Mac would.  As for other apps, the Ovi Store offers over 50,000 apps, both paid and free. I'm aware that isn't quite the same as some other app stores, but there really is everything you need in there, from games to useful utilities. And it's growing all the time. Of course, nobody wants to download 4 million apps (or 50,000 for that matter!) - nobody has that much memory in their phones! Pick and chose the ones you are really going to use. Some highlights for me are: Angry Birds Rio, Kayak, fMobi (facebook app) Shazam, Skype, YouTube Downloader, Opera Mobile, Nokia Movie Trailers. Out of those, only Angry Birds wasn't free, but it was only $1.99. Also, by visiting the Nokia Beta Labs, you can -for free- try out beta software such as Nokia Drop, Live View (awesome) and the Sleeping Screen. Google them and have a look, it's good stuff going on in the background for Nokia users.SYMBIAN^3 OS:  Much has been said about Symbian, usually in direct comparison with Android and iOS. Is it perfect? No. But no phone software is, so therefore it still gets 5 stars from me. The problems with Symbian are ones of personal taste and preference. It does everything I need it to do, it zips through the menu system, it is pleasant on the eye, and it seems (to me) to make sense. The multi-tasking abilities could be snappier, but they work. It does the job it needs to do. Call quality is outstanding, email and messaging are a breeze, the menu system is a bit outdated but still very accessible, the phone allows many customizing options for wallpapers and ringtones - use your own - and any really annoying aspects such as the Calendar not being up-to-date are all being addressed with the upcoming update called Symbian Anna. It will then be updated once more in the near future with Symbian Belle, which seems to offer even more in the way of UI overhaul, much to great benefit of E7 (and N8) owners. So the future looks good, for now.OVERALL:  I am extremely pleased with this purchase, the Nokia E7 does everything I need a phone to do, and does it all from a design that is elegant and practical. The phone gets 5 stars because, while it has a few shortcomings, these are 1) being addressed in upcoming updates, and 2) ALL mobile phones have their shortcomings.Nokia is now moving away from Symbian to focus its smartphone efforts with Windows Phone. I don't have a problem with that, because realistically I'll be ready for a new phone in 12 months anyway, and by that time Nokia Windows Phones will be very much part of the mobile landscape. If they bring out an E7 lookalike packed with Windows, I'd think about it. But that's for next year, or later. Right now, I'm extremely happy with my Nokia E7, and I know it'll be fully supported for at least the next year or so.I'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't follow the pack. You have a choice!

I was trying to find a deal on Black Friday, but there were none. Seeing that it's a Nokia, I actually expected that, but maybe I could've gotten lucky. Anyways, I bought this phone for $405. Which is A LOT cheaper than the $499 price right now. My mom told me to sell it and make a good profit, but why would I when it's so good?PROSGreat system: Very quick. And the home screens are customizable, so there are a million ways to improve the system. That's all I have to say. Score: 5/5Apps: There are actually many apps available for this phone. People who are used to an iphone or android will probably feel an extremely low amount of apps, but who wants so many useless apps anyways? Angry Birds, Need for Speed Shift, and GT Racing Motor Academy. These games are very good. Asphalt 5 is good, but I don't think that the processor is fast enough. The game lags a bit on this phone. Other than these apps there is Skype, Whatsapp, Nimbuzz, and all the other good ones that are available on Symbian. If you are uncertain about an app, go to the Ovi Store and select the Nokia E7.Another thing about the apps, I would like to add, is that you can download all of them signed online. So, you don't have to pay up to $5 for good apps. You can get them all free, and you wouldn't have to jailbreak your phone or be in danger of losing all of your content. Score: 4/5The screen: This is a MAJOR PLUS POINT. A 4.0\" AMOLED touch screen. It's very responsive. There is almost no glare compared to other phones. Great vibrating feedback as well. Score: 5/5GPS: This is a major plus point. It is beautifully made.. It works very well. It is probably much better than up to $150 systems you can buy from Garmin or any other company. Another thing is that Nokia owns a satellite system, so these maps will be free forever. You can also download maps through wi-fi for any country in the world. I would like to add that it sometimes takes about 20-30 seconds to start, so don't get worried. It does work though. And it works great. It got me through Atlanta and Saint Louis very well. Score: 5/5Qwerty Keyboard: Another major plus point. It is great with good feedback. Good opening action. It takes a bit getting used to because the keys are somehow placed akwardly. Maybe because there are four rows instead of three. Score: 4/5Body: The aluminum body is another plus. It seems very sturdy and the screen is made of gorilla glass, so it feels indestructible as well. The body is for sure a 5/5.CONSI seriously haven't found more than one. The phone freezes up sometimes for about 15 seconds. But, if you leave it alone, it will come back to normal. This happens more frequently when you use up to 3 apps or more at once. It also happens when you download many apps at once. It's not a big issue and it shouldn't drive you from buying this phone. It is quite worth the $500 as well.One thing I haven't really tested well is the camera. I have noticed that the camera's flash is way too bright. So, in plenty light, the flash is way too much and it sort of ruins the pictures. It makes my brown skin look pale. So, it's a bit weird.

I have a N8 my wife uses as well which I allowed the firmware to be updated as well (Anna).Well this update caused the N8 to begin to reset after a few days. After a while it would get to a point where it would reset every 5 minutes. This has to be the firmware upgrade which caused the E7 to do the same. The N8 was working without a single problem until the firmware update. Nokia allows no way to return to previous versions. I sent the E7 back, after multiple suggested retries to update the firmware from the data connection or the Ovi Suite.

I just bought it last week. I bought this phone because of its design and physical keyboard. I can purchase an Android phone but I can't find any phone with physical keyboard. Motorola Droid 2 is ok but it does not get many positive feedback.Pros- Beautiful design- Good physical keyboard. I've never got familiar with virtual keyboard. With the physical one, I don't need to look at the keyboard when typing.- AMOLED screen- The most interesting thing is that you can connect mouse and keyboard with E7. I have a Razer mouse and keyboard for gaming connected with E7 via USB to go and it work great.- E7 will get the update of symbian anna and belle...soon, hopefully. Sym Belle will be published in December; however, US users may be the last ones receive the update. Until now, I have not received update of anna yet while users in other countries already got it. But I'm sure that E7 will update to Anna and Belle.- Another interesting thing to do with E7 and Symbian 3 OS is hack phone.Cons- Sometime the phone just got freeze. It's really annoyed if you use many apps at the same time. Don't play game and open another app at the same time, the phone will absolutely be unresponsive.- Notice: US users will not get the update of symbian anna yet.

It is not perfect, but nothing to do with all the bad press about Nokia and Symbian.Comparing Side to Side to the iPhone, well, iPhone's 4 screen resolution is significantly better, but the E7's screen is larger. I was a bit disappointed with that, because I had been using the Nokia C7 Astound before and the resolution of that little one is awesome.However, for me this is not critical. I love the sliding keyboard and the design. It let's me operate like a mini-computer when I'm traveling. Great to answer emails and even check some power point presentations and PDF documents on the go.Quality of the camera is excellent for both pictures and video. I have not yet used the HD output though, but friends with N8 have used it and if you like those things, then you are fine.I was surprised that E7 doesn't have Micro-SD memory card expansion slot (at least I didn't find it). I didn't expect that, so you are locked to the 16GB internal memory (not too bad).Battery is as one can expect from a Smartphone like this. If you use it a lot, it may not last over the day. But keeping it connected to USB cable to my laptop keeps it charged over the working day.My Apple follower friends will say that it is because I'm not used to iPhone, but the performance of the operating system doesn't seem too bad to me. I downloaded a few applications which are a must for me. Maybe less options than with iPhone, but who cares.One must is \"Opera Browser\": Nokia's browser still lacks a lot in performance. But if you install free Opera Browser you have a decent browser with not much to envy from Safari. BTW. You can play flash and watch videos inserted in newspaper's web with both browsers. Even played some online flash game (although a bit slow). Try that with the iPhone ;-)BTW. If you don't need the big screen, or the keyboard, and you want something smaller & cheaper but still great. The Nokia C7 Astound for me is GREAT. The form factor is \"Perfect\". Very good resolution, incredible camera and good battery life. You don't even feel you have it in your pocket, but still has a decent size screen. For a small portion of the price of an iPhone.

I've had this phone 6 days and will probably return it in a week if it doesn't get better.I am a long-time Nokia customer, most recently the E71.  The E71 is a great phone and although I wanted a bigger screen, I might just buy a new one if this E7-00 doesn't work out.This is my first touch-screen phone and all the reasons I didn't want a touch screen are present in this phone.  The saving grace is the keyboard, which has a good feel to it and is very easy to type.  The touch screen is so sensitive that I could blow on it and the keys activate.  Very annoying.  I read somewhere that the sensitivity can be adjusted, but haven't had time to find out if this is true.Upon receipt of the phone on Saturday, I immediately updated to Anna, thinking that would prevent the problems that others complained about.  Unfortunately I think Anna comes with its own set of issues and I don't think that Nokia Customer Care is very forthcoming about.I have played around with the setting for the past few days, getting everything set-up and MAY be using it more trying to get everything setup than I would be as a regular user.  I am trying to justify why the battery life has gone from 36 hours the first day, down to less than 8 on the 5th day.  The only thing that I have running all of the time is Bluetooth.  Wi-Fi is not continually on, internet use is maybe 30 minutes daily, may have 45 minutes of phone conversation daily and send at most 10 texts a day.....That should not account for the ridiculous battery life.I deleted the 3rd home screen and have tried numerous suggestions found on the internet to help with battery life, but so far it is getting worse every day.The biggest problem that I have with this phone is that you cannot hear the wonderful navigation system through the Bluetooth headset, nor apparently a Bluetooth car-kit.  My own research over the past few days tells me that this version of Nokia Maps was designed this way, either listen over the E7 loudspeaker, or the wired headphones that came with the phone.  As I usually have a few kids in my car, it is not an opportune environment for trying to hear anything, especially if you have to hold the phone to your ear, as the loudspeaker is not really loud. And why would I want to have a Bluetooth in my ear for calls and have to connect a wired headset to my other ear to hear the navigation.When I called Nokia to ask about the Bluetooth and Navigation issue, the rep didn't appear to know anything about it.  After allowing her to link up remotely and resetting the phone (losing all of my settings, but not the data) she said that the problem was with my bluetooth and that I needed to get a Nokia Bluetooth headset in order to hear the navigation.  This bothers me on so many levels, the first being that Bluetooth connectivity should be standardized.  Secondly, I don't have the problem on my E71 using any type of Bluetooth.  Why would a higher level and higher priced phone give you fewer options?  Third, why are there so many complaints about this issue, but I have not once seen anyone offer that a Nokia Bluetooth headset will fix the problem.Although I am planning to buy a new Bluetooth (my new Jawbone is soooo uncomfortable), I would be pretty upset if I go through the trouble of buying a Nokia Bluetooth and it still doesn't work with the voice navigation.The Bluetooth issues continue as it is very difficult to pair with this phone.  I've tried a new Jawbone, 2 month old Motorola, and various other Bluetooth from friends...same problem.  It might take 9 or 10 tries before the pairing goes through.  That is unacceptable.And finally the phone is resetting itself on a continual basis when I drive in certain parts of the city.  It might reset 5 or 6 times within 10 minutes.  I don't know if this is the phone, carrier or just my bad luck, but it is very annoying.Update 11/17/11  Phone just died.  Phone is getting hot, cannot power off nor are any of the other buttons active.  Nothing happens when you hold it down for 8- 15 seconds. Screen is white with black lines, almost like an old black & white TV when the horizontal tuning is messed up.  Back it goes to Amazon.  Hate it even more now.

I would still use this phone for some of the functions  like its Ovi maps and document and file management which is still far superior to anything buy android or apple. Blackberry is the only thing close to business and file management. Only downside is its rather slow response while trying to do multi tasking. Works rather well when the ram is freed up and does not have tons of stuff overloading the cache. It's basic flaw is its rather small RAM/ROM size. If only it could be upgraded to something larger this phone would have the potential to be much faster!For the price, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good reliable business phone.

The Nokia E7 has some good hardware but the current software presents some issues. After I got my phone it offered me an update for my software and phone would not download the update. I tried downloading it through Ovi suites and over the net and it would not work. I contacted Nokia, and they told me to contact my phone carrier (who would have no clue how to help me). It eventually downloaded after putting my phone in offline mode and connecting it to the computer. The phone has at times just restarted for no apparent reason, and at other times, it has just locked up. The battery life is not that great. If you use the phone from the start of the day until the evening, you can hope to have 30 percent battery life.Symbian Anna should be coming soon and I hope this takes care of most of the issues but Nokia has constantly come to the table with incomplete offerings. The N900 was a great product that Nokia did not fully back nor did they use some the great break throughs to include in there other N series offers.Some of the plus sides are the Email application, the social networking is pretty good, Ovi maps has approved. The camera works pretty good, the HD video is really good, have USB to go works well, and the HDMI out is pretty nice to have.I give this a 7 out of 10, but I will likely keep it for the next few years as long is the updates help stablize the OS.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy Nokia anymore -  warranty not honoured", "Author": "Greg Munyard", "ReviewID": "R1NDZ0O7EMWHP8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone in May 2011 and was generally very happy with it (although my friend, an IT expert had so many problems with his that it had to be replaced within the first week).I liked the large screen and the key board and the software on mine (unlike my friend's) was OK although occasionally a bit slow.  In short, I was happy with the purchase for 5 months.  HOWEVER things went terribly wrong in October.The screen stopped operating (but the phone could still be turned on and off) so I took it into NokiaCare in Western Australia for warranty repairs.  They denied warranty, saying that the phone had been subjected to \"liquids ingression\" and \"corrosion\".  I told them I had NEVER spilt liquids on it of any kind, had never lent it to anyone else who could have done that and would provide a sworn statutory declaration to that effect but they said there was no need for that and that \"Your warranty is void\"!At my request, they sent it to their \"independent\" testing place and I got an email, with photos, showing 2 separate areas of distinct corrosion.  I am not a corrosion expert but it seemed to me, knowing that the phone had NOT been subjected to liquids ingression in the 5 months I had it, that Nokia must have had a problem in the manufacturing of this phone which has led to later corrosion, since:1.  one corrosion spot was very small and discrete - looking like one of the chips had been touched in one corner with perhaps one drop of something very corrosive;2.  the 2nd area was different - more extensive and diffuse - and appeared to have been there for a long time.Nokia could not tell me what caused the corrosion or how long it had been there, nor would they explain the differing appearance of the 2 areas of corrosion.I have never made a warranty claim on Nokia before.  My only experiences with Nokia are:(a) I was previously a satisfied customer of several of their models; with no complaints;(b) my wife's Nokia has an intermittent fault and she (coincidentally) recently made her first warranty claim on Nokia, and Nokia rejected that claim too - saying the warranty did not apply because they alleged the phone had been dropped - but it hadn't!I will never buy a Nokia product again (nor will my wife).

(I still have the phone)>>>>>> AN IMMEDIATE STOP TO CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF THIS PHONE is Nokia's non existent support to addressing the bug that makes SMS messaging completely unreliable (see Bads section)Good:- Screen can be used in direct sunlight- Physical keyboard is excellent.  Tactile feed back is better than blackberry or T-Mobile G2.- Off-line maps.  Usefull when you don't want to use online maps when roaming (data roaming charges are expensive).  Better than Google maps because it provides \"recalculation\" of directions if you go off course.- Penta band 3G, It'll work in any GSM or 3G carrier (will not work on CDMA)- Ring profiles.  Very detailed preset profiles for volume/ring/vib/etc settings can be easily switched between.  Android (T-Mobile G2) does not have this level of customization or ability to switch between profiles.- Notification ring tone can be set to a an mp3 (Android, or at least G2 can't do this)- Sound quality from mic is very good, just make sure you aren't let down by a half-duplex voice carrier like Wind Mobile.- Front facing camera... but see cons side...- Reception is good, but not the top 10%.- Plays most video formats i've tried.  Can't play MKV and some AVI files.- now able to EASILY turn WIFI, Bluetooth etc on and off easily via the pull down status window blind.- design and build, it has a sturdy & premium feel when you look at it and hold it in your hand.- works with perfectly with LG bluetooth headset HBS-700, Plantronics Voyager Pro, Plantronics Voyager Pro+Bads:- Nokia's SMS system will sometimes not send msgs and leave them in the \"Outbox\" and not attempt to resend.  This happens with about half or two thirds of my SMS's.  When the \"Outbox\" SMS's are manually selected to re-send the recipient will get it, but on rare occasions it will be received twice.- I would not say Symbian Belle is 'clunky', but Android offers a more intuitive user interface & experience.  Try activating bluetooth or any other phone related function during a phone call... it's extremely hard if not impossible because the phone's screen pauses and stops during calls.  Also, The dialing buttons are VERY small (vertically), yet at least 1/3 of the same screen is unused!!!  Seriously, what's up with that screen Nokia!?!?!? Many more examples like this!- App market is very limited.  Prior to purchase i didn't think it would be an issue, but after using a T-Mobile G2 it is a major issue.  For instance, there are no banking applications for Symbian.  The Tunein radio app is not available & the free Nokia Internet Radio app is horrible.- Offline maps: can't get transit info/next bus times from maps.... but you can install google's online maps for that...- Nokia's support: Nokia has done NOTHING to solve several major bugs, one of which is well known since at least 2010 (see next few examples)- Nokia's program to sync MS Outlook's calendar with the phone pushes some re-occurring appointments one day forward.  (embarrassing to say happy birthday to business colleagues on the wrong day, one day earlier).  this bug is known since at least 2010.- when listening internet radio, the audio will skip/pause when you scroll the screen, rotate the screen or start to anything else.- Battery life is quite poor.  I must charge at least once a day.  With full charge, listening to internet radio through stereo bluetooth lasts about 2 hours at most.  Talk time from full charge is about 3.5 to 4 hrs using bluetooth.  T-Mobile G2 battery lasts significantly longer, for instance internet radio through bluetooth lasts 4-5 hours.- GPS is not as accurate or fast as other phones (not confusing with Assisted-GPS).  It takes several minutes (sometimes never) to obtain a GPS location fix.- the front facing camera is poor quality, even for VGA.  Other than Fring, and MS Lync, no programs are available to use the front camera for chat.  However, who uses Fring?... and MS Lync is only for internal corporate clients who have a MS Lync server.  Skype video chat is not available.- My carrier (Wind Mobile) does not \"support\" (disabled) the built in video calling.- the rear 8mp camera is also of very poor quality.  5mp phone cameras are superior.  Photos closer than six to ten feet are almost always out of focus (either totally blury, or background is in focus but not the subject in foreground is not in focus).  Photos of a paper with any size writing are an embarassment.  Photos further than six to ten feet are sometimes blurry, but always do not have sufficient detail.  All this is because the phone uses a software based focusing system.- not able/safe to use phone as wifi hotspot. Joiku spot app for $15 can turn phone into wifi hotspot, but it only uses the cracked we encryption protocol.Summary: DO NOT BUY.  Despite an excellent build quality, keyboard & a good screen that can be seen in direct sunlight, I would not get this product again.

So I bit the bullet and ordered the E7.  Let me tell you up front it is a very attractive design with a stunning screen viewable outside even with the brightness set on low;  many times i have been astounded by the wonderful visibility of its Clear Black  AMOLED Display and the 4 inch screen makes a big difference for me in comfort and usability.I do not want to waste time rehashing info clearly described in other reviews so lets get to the meat of the situation:1 -If you take any type of up close / macro shots on a regular basis you will be terribly disappointed. The camera is just not good for that type of imagery.  All other photography is great in most well lit situations even with out great lighting you can get decent shots.2 - The Wifi is quite finicky on these phones so you maybe reconnecting a bit (OK, a lot!).  I thought it was just my unit but it seems many users are having this issue.  It's not bad enough for me to not want to use the phone but it might be for you.Nokia really screwed the pooch on this magnificent phone; just adding a 5mp auto focus camera would have been sufficient and not cannibalized the N8 sales. The Wifi issue is not that big for me and could probably be easily resolved with firmware.I am writing this for people who already know about the Symbian OS and understand its strengths and limitations. I believe Symbian Belle is a very good OS and a pleasure to use; Iphone and Android zombies might not be appreciative of any Symbian phone regardless.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia's smartphone with keypad", "Author": "S.

I had bought this phone exactly a week ago. When I first held it in my hands, it felt perfect. Although I have read a few bad reviews about this phone, I had complete faith in Nokia. Therefore, I went ahead and purchased this Nokia Phone mainly for their great build. I have to admit I have been using Nokia for the past 10 years, except for 2-years when I had to switch to Samsung (I hated it). Some of my friends suggested to me not to buy Symbian based phones anymore but I think they are wrong. It is still very good and as far as I am concerned, this is one of the best phones available in the market.Device set up:The initial set up for the phone was easy. Even I was able to transfer all the contacts, texts and calendar from my other Nokia phone to this phone through Bluetooth.Design (9/10):The design of this entire phone is excellent. It fits perfectly in the palm. One can operate the phone with one hand with ease. There are three home screens and one can easily customise it to your requirement. This you will not achieve in Android or iphone.Keyboard (10/10): This is perhaps the finest QWERTY keyboards I have ever seen so far. The keys look elegant and evenly spaced, including the touchscreen QWERTY keyboard.Screen (10/10):This phone has 4\" AMOLED screen with excellent displays. The touch sensitivity on this screen is brilliant, which is mainly a feather touch. I played a couple of 720p HD videos from you tube and the quality was impeccable.Speaker (9/10):This phone is equipped with Dolby Digital surround system, which is equivalent to home theatres. Due to this, you would not miss a beat. The important part of the phone is the call quality, which I found to be excellent in this phone. I have not had any problems in call quality since I bought it a week ago.Software (8/10):Although many people think Symbian is dead, I certainly think otherwise, especially after I purchased this phone. The software is a huge upgrade if you are a Symbian fan. Once my phone updated to Symbian Anna, it works very well. It did work very well even before the update! The software in this phone runs as smooth as one would find it in Android or iPhone. Still, there are rooms for improvement.Map (10/10):The Ovi map is by far the best I have used in the past 6 months (including my old Nokia 5800 xpressmusic). I also own Garmin ($150) and had used Google maps but they failed to beat Ovi maps. The best part of Ovi maps is the turn-to-turn direction guidance. Furthermore, Ovi maps have maps for more than 150 countries and can be used offline. Moreover, you can use your own voice for directions!Apps (9/10):There are hundreds of apps available for Nokia but I do not use that many apps. Whatever I use, works very well in E7. Anyway, who wants 1000s of apps on their phone?Games (8/10):There are as many games available for Nokia E7 as in Android or iPhone. I have played a couple of games in Nokia, just to test it, and it works brilliantly in E7.Camera (4/10):The Camera in E7 is not good, unless there is enough light. I have my own DSLR camera, which nothing can beat. Therefore, I am not worried about the camera in the phone.Update: An update on camera. This camera is certainly way better than the camera in iPhone or Android phones. It takes very good pictures, if there is enough light. I did shoot a few HD (1080 p) videos a few days ago, which looked excellent. Even my friends who own iPhone and Android were amazed at the quality of this video.Office/Adobe (10/10):Nokia E7 comes with pre-installed office (Word, Excel and Powerpoint) and Adobe PDf for free. Any iPhone/Android user has to pay some money to get office/Adobe on their phone. This is a huge advantage for any person who writes/edits notes or spreadsheets often.Battery (6/10):This is probably a major drawback in this phone. I do not understand why E7 comes with a short battery time, when it has so many features. I fully charged the battery in the morning and used a lot features (more than usual). The battery lasted for 13 hours. This is not bad but I wish the Nokia had used a better battery for this phone.Overall, this is the best phone one can get in the market now. It is worth the money and you will not be disappointed. I hope Nokia does not stop to make Symbian based phones, now they have joined hands with Mircosoft.I had bought this phone on 47% ($369.00) discount from Amazon (one-day shipment). Thank you Amazon for this amazing offer.UPDATE: Here is an update after 3 weeks of usage. I am beginning to fall in love with this phone. This is just fabulous, especially Anna. I believe Belle has not reached N. America yet. So, I can't comment on it. I have looked at Android phones but I don't like their small buttons and Android UI is not as  smooth as Anna. Who said there are not good Apps for Nokia? some of the apps that I use on E7 surprises my Android/iPhone friends! If you are used to Symbian, you will love this business phone.Final Update: I am loving Nokia more after Nokia Belle update. It's better than Android, certainly in speed. I never had any glitches in Belle. Even the battery seems to last longer than the previous software editions. Thank you Nokia. Keep up the good work. We would like to see more software upgrades similar to Belle.

I have had many phones with the symbian O.S. and have gotten used to it.When the phone arrived it was not the US version. I called Nokia and they informed me that the phone serial number wasn't listed and I would have no warranty. The first hint was the European charger and the sticker over the original label on the box.I called Amazon and expressed my feelings about the situation. They quickly issued a return label and said they applied a refund.  The advertisement clearly stated a US version with warranty.  Buyer Beware is all I can say at this time. I am still waiting to be informed if Amazon can supply me with a phone as advertised.Very dissapointing purchase through Amazon which will make me think twice before making the same mistake again.I have to be honest and revisit the original review.Therefore first of all, Amazon is excellent, but this phone has a very poor camera and is useless for using for recording pages of manuals, spec sheets and anything small. The previous Nokia N97mini was excellent for that purpose and I was never without that capabilty and now I am.  Also, the speaker phone is virtually useless also because if there is any background noise whatsoever people can't hear you on the other end as well as the volume is very low and you can't hear them either. This makes it useless when driving for handsfree by itself.

I will abstain from making a definitive verdict at this moment however, this update appears to have cured all the problems I experienced during the first few months of ownership.Some things I like about the phone: Gorgeous display, HD video and great picture quality, I use often and really like the OVI maps program even though I am a die hard TomTom fan. Bluetooth connectivity is not limited to certain items like the Iphone plus I can sync with Nokia Suite or Microsoft Outlook including the calender...Nice! I also use media monkey for syncing my music, podcast and videos without issue.

I was using Nokia N97 Mini and it was too small when I surfed the web then Amazon has this E7 on sale for $359, I took my chance and bought it right away. There are some kind of inventory shortage of Nokia E7 on Amazon since the price jumped up to $430 couple weeks ago. The Nokia E7 has similar functions as my N97 Mini except bigger screen. I like it very much.Cons: Battery seems running out more than my N97 mini, I have to charge it every night. Sometime it is frozen for a while when I have several applications opened at once. Other than that, it is a great looking phone and everybody keeps asking what kind of phone do I have.
