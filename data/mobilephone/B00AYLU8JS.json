Look it up online on how many people have faulty power button and having issue turning on the phone.  I've dealt with it using apps that turns the screen on using proximity sensor, but even then, when you run out of battery, you have to battle with your power button for 15 minutes to turn it on.  After a while, it wont respond anymore, so your phone is turned off forever.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "LG myTouch T E739 T-Mobile Branded Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 2.3 OS and 3.8\" AMOLED Touchscreen - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CjGlpcx6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AYLU8JS"}}
