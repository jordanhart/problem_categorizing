{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best way to get this great phone without AT&T; contract", "Author": "priyananda", "ReviewID": "R10X5YL80TM830", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Phone works perfectly on T-Mobile's 4G Network. And with T-Mobile's simple plans, you save a significant amount of money as compared to a 2 year AT&T; contract. The device doesn't have any carrier markings on it, and comes with a non-US charger, but they also send a US-compatible socket adapter, so there are no problems there. There is nothing on the product or packaging that indicates country of origin, but I'm assuming Malaysia since that was what was default when I booted up the phone.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not work in Brazil (it is not 4G 2600) and does not accept system updates - HELLPP!!!", "Author": "Fabiane", "ReviewID": "R373NU3LBUU5SS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The descriptions states:  RM-820 4G Network LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600.  It DOES NOT WORK ON 2600!!!  I travel a LOT for business and bought this phone to be able to contact clients and keep updated on emails and whatsapp. I travel to Brazil frequently and it DOES NOT WORK ON LOCAL 4G networks. I tried to update it and be able to set maximum speed to 3G (which shoukd work) but it does not allow me this option (blocked by ATT). FRUSTRATING as it states a 4G 2600 network and does not allow the user to set max speed to 3G (tha would work). RESULT: cannot use it in BRAZIL and other countries!!! wasted money...can anyone help??? MERCHANT: can you offer me a solution??? PLEAAASEEEE!!!! Otherwise, I love the phone!!", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent phone", "Author": "Burn", "ReviewID": "R2UVATNJ8S4MG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "took some time to get the phone.
