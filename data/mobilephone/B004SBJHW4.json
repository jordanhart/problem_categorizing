{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buyer beware", "Author": "the truth", "ReviewID": "R2UOYI2FCTEMT0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can only speak to the version sold by Accessory Distributor (there are 10 or more vendors offering \"new\" phones) but exactly what flavor of \"new\" this is I am not sure.  It came in a generic Motorola box, no model number or other labels, and contained no warranty, safety, or manual documents, at all.  Battery, back cover, and phone all came separately wrapped and \"looked\" new.  But clearly this is some sort of re-packaged or perhaps re-furbished phone.  Worse (as I found out when the screen started to time out and not wake up using the power button at all -- battery pull and reboot required every time the screen times out for 1st time) Motorola has no intention of honoring a new warranty on these phones.  After hassling for 3 days with Motorola tech support via chat messages, phone calls to some Caribbean country, and multiple case numbers, I was finally told that the IMEI for this phone had a warranty which expired in July, 3 months before I bought the phone.  No Motorola service even for an out-of-box problem on a \"new\" phone.  Motorola would not honor an Amazon original invoice.  Accessory Distributors said they would grant a 30- day warranty and repair the phone, with all shipping at my cost.  Amazon offered arbitration with the vendor, but ultimately my only recourse was to accept having a non-authorized vendor repair the phone up to 30 days out, then I was on my own.  A service plan would have cost $130 a year.  OR return the phone.  The only good thing about this deal is that the vendor accepted the return (not the shipping, but Amazon picked that up except for the return).  My theory (no one said this) is that these are bundled unsold OEM phones from 2011(new or refurbished) bought from either Motorola or ATT, unlocked, and repackaged without an original warranty, and that Motorola has no desire to keep 1-year old models on the market cutting into their new-model Atrix sales.  And ATT likely has no interest in doing favors for people who plan to use the phone with service from a competitor provider (as I did).  I emailed 6 other vendors in the Amazon list selling them as new and none would include a Motorola warranty. This being advertised as \"new\" doesn't mean much, and there is no proof they are.  So after all was said and done, I was out $6, plus about a week of hassle with Motorola, the vendor, and Amazon (latter was the only easy one to deal with -- I am still an Amazon fan).  Plus still looking for a non-plan smartphoneMy recommendation is to avoid this particular phone deal unless you find a vendor who promises a 12-month Motorola warranty, as all new Motorola cell phones are supposed to have.  I am OK with people selling used or refurb items without a warranty, but to bill these as \"new\" without such a warranty is deceptive consumer advertising and should be an FCC issue.  I am surprised Amazon allows it, even on purchases they fulfill.  C'mon guys, repair this ad.  These are <<not>> new phones.Addendum: as also observed in other reviews, the phone also came with a 1500 mAH battery not the stock 1930 mAH one that came with the original phone.  Whoever repackaged this shaved about $10 off the cost of the package by cutting this corner on a power-hungry dual-core big-screen smartphone", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really Nice Android Phone", "Author": "Thomas M. Taylor \"runman\"", "ReviewID": "R1AR0MGC82VCR7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first saw the Atrix, I was mesmerized and had to wait a few months to get my hands on the phone. The specs of the Atrix is awesome and I have hope that the phone will live up to the promise that has been made. I have never used an Android phone before this one, but have used the Iphone since it came out and have the Iphone 4. I have used the Palm III, treo, BlackBerry ect... you get the point.What comes with the phone? You get the phone, USB cord, A wall plug and the HDMI cable, instruction manual and battery. Everything one need to step off into the Atrix Android world.One thing the iPhone user will notice that the Android software is more difficult to use. It may take a few hours just to get the basics down, but after the few hours a whole new world starts to open up. Unlike the Iphone who's software is easy to operate, the more you learn about Android, the more powerful the phone becomes.Just a quick comparison Iphone 4 VS Atrix, the Iphone 4 display is way clearer and the screen is a little more responsive. The Artix has a user replaceable battery and the phone can be taken a part and fix for a lot less money than the Iphone. Now, I have never tried to take apart either phone, but the instructions and professional review of the taken down is on line.One thing I would like to say is that the finger print reader works very well.The world of Apps...In Apps, Apple wins. Not much else to say there. The Apps that I use mostly are iHeart Radio (does not work on Atrix), Scrabble (Not found on Android store), Farkle (Android has but quality is lacking), Bloomberg and Fox News.Wall Paper...Android leaves Apple in the dust. The active wall paper cannot be beat by apple, you can have multiple home screens with live wall paper. I love knowing the time, temperature and forcast. If you are like me, the Android system, cannot be beat.Ease of use...Apple is a lot simpler to use. Just like pen and paper is easy, but if you are in the computer world, than a pen and paper just won't due, and this is where the Android system comes in. I cannot honestly say which system is best, Android or IOS. If you want simple, but lacking power, Iphone is the way. If you are a person who likes to play, Android is the choice.Display:The display is bright and colorful, but the diplay is not nearly as nice as the iPhone 4. The lack luster display is noticed especially noticed when reading texts and PDFs.Camera and Flash:The camera takes pretty good pictures. The LED flash works really good. I was able to take a picture in a nearly dark room and the subject came out clear and in focus. The LED flash filled the entire room. As a side note, there is a forward facing camera. I have not used and more than likely won't.Speaker:Very loud and clear when using to make calls, talk radio and listening to music. It is a small speaker so you will not get a lot (if any) bass from this little speaker.Operating System:I have never used Android before, so I have ability to describe between the Android, the Moto Blur, and if ATT messed it up I can't tell. The user of the Atrix must use the one app store that ATT backs, and the icon for the store comes preloaded. It would be nice to have more access to more stores, like Amazon, but if you get this phone, you are going to be stuck. The few apps that I have downloaded all seem to work fine and most of them were free. It would be nice it ATT did not pull the apple store garbage with this phone though.The Atrix comes loaded with lots of software, commonly known as bloatware, but you get a lot of it. The software that runs on the computer is called \"Motorola Media Link\", this is kind of like \"iTunes\" in the sense that the Media Link software is a way for your computer to communicate with the Atrix. This nifty program will take you itunes music (Not DRM protected) and place the music on your new phone. You can also transfer your pod casts too. The Media Link is automatic and does not need to be messed with. I had no problems with the installation or use of the software. The Software is stored on your phone and will try to load on any computer that the Atrix is hooked up to.Some of the really things about the Atrix that I like is the Micro SD slot (32BG max) for added memory and the user can remove the battery without having to go find apple support. I was also able to keep my unlimited data package, although a lot of AT&T; customers have not been so lucky. AT&T; also offers their $5.00/ month warranty on the phone as compared to the Iphone, and you do not have to hook the phone up to a computer the first time you use it. You do need to sign up for a MOTO account, nut it only takes a few seconds and you are able to use you new cell phone.Things I do not like. I do not like the feel of the phone. My Iphone 4 feels better constructed and feels like it will not easily slip out of my hands, unlike the Atrix. I have not yet dropped the phone. The battery seems to take a long while to receive a charge too.Big minus for the phone is the Lap top that you can purchase with the phone. I cannot see why I should spend 400.00 for the \"dock\" that is nothing but an empty screen. And then you have to pay ATT and extra ten per month for \"tethering\" the dock that is nothing but a screen to you phone. The price is too high for the extra ten you have to pay per month. You can can get a netbook that has more power and does more things for the same price.Why did I give the Atrix only 4 stars? The Atrix is a good phone, but the lack luster construction of the phone and the steep learning curve do not make up for the other great features that the phone has to offer.With the construction set aside, you cannot just load apps on your new phone. Like Apple, you can only purchase your apps from the included application on the phone. One reason for me gettig rid of my Iphone was the Apple store that you have to use. Well, thanks to AT&T;, the owners ofthe Atrix are stuck too. You cannot side load applications eigther. A real star looser for me.Update: 02/28/2011:I have now used the Atrix for a few days so it was prudent to give an update.Battery life:The battery life is not to great. After getting the battery at 100%, I then took the Atrix to chuch where I used Bible Reader app as my bible. At the end of Sunday school and main service, the phone was down to 60%, after the evening service, the phone was down to 10%. Lack luster battery life is normal. The Iphones have poor battery life, and the Atrix bettery life is even shorter. There is a lot of heat build up during use and when charging. The phone charges slowly when charging from a computer USB with the display off, and does not charge at all it seems with the diplay on. I purchased a Micro USB car charger and it works wonderfully.GPS Function:I do not use the AT&T; navigation, but the \"Navigation\" function that comes with the phone. The Android device does a wonderful with the GPS. Apple's GPS function and mapping capabilty always made the Apple Iphone a lst choice in trying to use as a GPS. The Android does a very good job with GPS, it is not on the level with a stand alone Garmen, but I do use a GPS alot to find customer houses and I would not hesitate to use the Atrix as my main GPS device. The GPS also has an option to use voice for the inputing of an address. It does work faily well, but the voice input for a destination (restraunt name)does not work as well.When traveling to your destination, you can turn the screen of the GPS off and you will still get voice commands. If you are using the media player function through your cars stereo system, the music will mute and the directs will come through your car speakers.DLNA ServicesIf you are like me, you have tons of videos sitting on your hard drive or network attached storage. The Atrix will find the media and play the media. I was able to stream several videos of differing formats with no problems at all. Honestly, I really do not think you will be uising the device as a 3\" television set, but it does work. Apple does the same thing, but you must have iTunes and/or AppleTV.A nifty little function that I have notice after owning the phone for several weeks, the DLNA service will try and link to your home media server where you are within the range of your \"in house\" network..Ring Tones:You can use and song or sound loaded on your phone as a ringtone. Easy to use, and it is free.Update 3/9/2011I tried to get Netflix on the phone and much to my surprise, Netflix does not have an App for the Android devices yet. So as an Atrix user, I am stuck paying an extra ten dollars to AT&T; for their TV service. According to sources on the internet, Android will have an App adventually but it will be a marketed to new phones. You will see the phones labeled as \"Nextflix compatable\". BummerUpdate 03/16/2011Phone is still owrking great. Had to turn the phone off and then back on yesterday. For some reason the phone would not update web based apps like stock market, bloomberg and weather. Turning the phone on and off solved the problem. I also purchased the otterbox defender for the Atrix... sweet phone case.The Atrix does appear to have better reception when placing calls. i could not make a phone call at my work using the Iphone 4 but no problems with the Atrix.Update 3/23/2011Took the phone on a trip of several hundred miles to see how the GPS would function, the phone did a great job. The phone did stop responding when trying to accomplish several tasks quickly. I was not able to turn the phone off to reset the phone. I actually had to take the battery out. You can look at that problem as a possitive and negative. The battery had to be removed to reset the phone, but at least the battery is user accessible unlike the iPhone.The phone was plugged into the 12 volt power in the car, no problems with the phone over heating or even the phone filling warm to the touch.I am pleased to announce that iHeart radio now works.4/3/2011 UpdateI have updated the firm ware in the Atrix to 4.1.57 a couple days ago. The firmware update does help a lot with the battery not lasting. I can now get 1.5 days of use out of a full charge instead of having to monitor the battery constantly, and keeping the Atrix plugged in while at work.ATT bandwidth problem is still there and the radio inside the Atrix is still disconnected thanks to ATT, but the update coming in April is supposed to fix those issues.4/21/2011 Update:Still waiting for the AT&T; update that is coming out this month. Phone is working wonderful. No major problems.If you read the complete summary above, you may notice that I included that the phone feels like it would easily slip from my hands. The phone has on several occasions slipped from my hands, but i have been able to catch the phone before it plunged to the floor. Good thing I have the AT&T; warranty.I did some side by side tests to see if the Iphone was faster loading/running programs than the Atrix. The Iphone maybe a little faster. I have run into CPU speed issues with the Iphone 4 that I have not seen in the Atrix. So my conclusion on the speed of the phone CPUs with launching and running application is this; while the Iphone does appear to launch programs faster most of the time, but running the programs (apps), the Atrix appears to be a constant and steady winner. When Android 2.3 comes out it should make better use of the dual core processor.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is how Android should be known.", "Author": "Tiago Malburg", "ReviewID": "R2RV1V3FO6OKCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is so awesome, I don't know where to start!SIZE:I'll compare it to iPhones, since it's what everybody seems to want. I have an iPhone 3GS and they're almost same size, the Atrix is just a bit taller (2 mm) and wider (1 mm), although the screen is much larger (4 in, vs 3.5 in on the iPhone).It's thinner than the iPhone 3GS (10.95 mm vs 12.3 mm on the iPhone), not as thin as the iPhone 4 (9.3 mm) and not nearly as incredibly thin as the Samsung Galaxy S2 (8.49 mm)! I've played around with the Galaxy S2, it's amazing, beautiful huge screen and unbelievably thin, but that's another review!DISPLAY:Beautiful 4-inch TFT, qHD (540 x 960 pixels), capacitive multi-touch screen, 16M colors, protected by the scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass! Awesome for web navigation even on non-mobile websites, if you can see well, you'll be able to read anything!BATTERY:Capacity is of 1930 mAh, which is a pretty large battery for a phone. Talk time of about 7-8h, stand-by of about 200-400h (that'll depend on your settings, such as push notifications). I carry one spare battery around, but I'm a heavy gamer (lot's of Galaxy on Fire 2 lately), and you'll probably be too (at least occasionally), once you get to know the awesome power of the Tegra 2 chipset. Even so, I don't usually need the spare, it lasts me my whole work day (I leave home at about 10 AM and return at about 8 PM). Obviously I don't play much during work, but I do use it constantly for check-ins, web navigation, email, google talk, Facebook and Google+. Lots of people complain about battery life, but that's what you pay for having a smartphone with the processing power of a laptop computer.SOFTWARE:Unfortunately, it still packs Android Froyo 2.2 (at least as I write), with no predicted date for an update to Gingerbread 2.3 or Ice-cream Sandwich 2.4. 2.2 is still pretty good, runs very smoothly and has nice features such as WiFi tethering natively. I've never seen Android OS run as smoothly on any other phone as it does on the Atrix, it's beautiful! It comes with Motorola's Motoblur UI, which is pretty interesting, but I did use home replacement Launcher Pro, making it even snappier and quicker.CAMERA:As a photographer and filmographer, I barely use my Atrix's camera, I always carry my Canon around, but it has a 5 MP camera with dual LED flash, autofocus and geo-tagging. It captures video at 1280x720 @30fps and is supposed to have a firmware update that unlocks 1920x1080 recording @30fps. It isn't the best camera I've seen, even on phones... I've tried the Sony Ericsson's Xperia Arc, and it seemed much better than the Atrix, specially in low light situations.It has a VGA front-facing camera which I've barely used, since I've never video-chatted with anyone, but I can let you know that the quality isn't great either.CPU:This is where the Atrix shines the most. It's packed with a Dual-core 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9 processor, ULP GeForce Graphics and the Tegra 2 chipset. It'll run smoothly anything available for Android (as I write)! I've been playing all of the Tegra 2 games, such as Dungeon Defenders, Backbreacker, Fruit Ninja THD, Great Battles Medieval, Pinball HD, Riptide GP, Samurai II Vengeance, Galaxy on Fire 2... am I forgetting any? =PYou definitely need to see Riptide GP and Galaxy on Fire 2, they'll easily blow your PSP out of the water!A lot of people ask me this: yes, it runs Angry Birds... smoother than on the iPhone 4. \u00ac\u00acIf that last part got you interested, consider buying spare battery!It has HDMI out, but does not mirror the phone, it simply goes to a sort of media center Motorola has preinstalled, where you can watch your movies, photos and displays album, artist, song title, etc, as you listen to music (great for parties). You can sort of mirror the phone on the Webtop functionality, which is when you dock the phone, plug the dock to an outlet and HDMI out to a TV or monitor. It will run another OS based on Linux where you can run Mozilla Firefox among other things, and you get to see your phone's screen on a window based view. You can maximize your phone view, sort of mirroring it to your TV, but you'll get performance issues on some apps since you'll be running this Linux based OS on top of your Android/Motoblur.You can actually connect a USB keyboard and mouse while connected to the dock, and use it as a desktop PC. Otherwise, you can still connect a bluetooth keyboard to the phone by itself.I'm extremely happy with this phone, I've always dreamt of Android running as smoothly as iOS, and this is how it happens.If you want to know anything else I haven't mentioned, just let me know in the comments section below (YouTube anyone?). ^^", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Android Phone and Possibly the Best Phone Period", "Author": "Jackie W. Mullins \"kb5ynf\"", "ReviewID": "RPWXLBK2YGE1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a corporate smart phone user and IT Director of my company.  Consequently, I actually oversee the cell phones for our company and get the chance to try out a lot of good phones.  To date, the Atrix has been the best I've ever used (that includes iPhones by the way).  I don't dictate what phones our users carry because I see that as a personal choice; I just make suggestions as to which phones work best with our backend systems.  Because of this openness, I see almost every high-end phone that hits the market at some point.  The Atrix has been the best up until the recent release of the Atrix 2!  Both are excellent phones.I use AT&T; Premier to manage our phones and one of the benefits is I sometimes get new phones before the actual release date; that was the case with the Atrix.  I got my hands on mine a week or two before the official release and I have nothing bad to say about it.  When it first released, there were a couple of annoying limitations that either AT&T; or Motorola had implemented.  For one, they had disabled the standard Android side load feature and the other was a limitation on the hot spot feature that caused it to only work when the phone had a 3G connection.  A subsequent firmware update removed both issues.  Neither issue was a major concern for me (I could still use Android ADB to load apps and I am almost always in a 3G area when I need to use the hot spot) so I was very happy with the phone and even happier with later improvements.  The only other somewhat negative attribute of the phone to me was that the back plate was very slick when I first got the phone.  I'm a person who basically never drops my phone but I dropped this one twice early on because it was so slick.  My previous phone was the Nexus One which had a rubberized feel and I had to get used to the Atrix's case.  Again, not a major issue; I mentally and physically adjusted to the phone and haven't dropped it since.  Plus, over time, the back has gotten a little scuffed which resulted in nullifying the slick factor.I didn't read all the other reviews here but I did notice that most of the key features are covered, system specs and such.  I'll try to avoid repeating stuff that has already been covered and give you my impressions and responses to some negative comments I've seen concerning this phone.  At the time I'm writing this, I've been using the phone for well over six months and know it very well.This phone is an excellent phone and at the time of release, was in my opinion, the best Android phone on the market... possibly even the best cell phone on the market.  Obviously, I haven't used every phone available but of the many that I have used, the Atrix takes the top spot.  The specs of the phone were a step above everyone else at release and it has been an excellent phone.  The call quality is great and operation is smooth and very robust.  I have a bad ear and have struggled for years to find a phone that is loud enough for me to use comfortably; this has been an issue for me pretty much ever since the industry switched over to digital cell phones.  The Atrix is the first phone I've had in years that I have no problems hearing; it is quite loud enough for me to use comfortably.  And other than the two issues I listed above (which were corrected), this has been the ideal phone.Some people complain about the camera on this phone.  I find the camera to be perfectly adequate.  I don't buy a phone for its camera and there's probably not a phone on the market today that doesn't have a camera that would satisfy me.  I know others put more stock in cameras than I do and that's their prerogative.  The phone takes very good photos and the video is very good as well.  I have no complaints here.I've heard people complain about the battery life of this phone.  Well, the battery life is actually one of the areas where this phone absolutely shines!  I've been using smart phones for a long time and as long as they'll get through a full day without dying, I'm satisfied with them.  Every smart phone I've had and/or setup or supported over the years has had to be charged every day (with one exception besides the Atrix).  This is usually a shock for feature phone users who get their first smart phone because feature phones can usually run for several days on a single charge.  The difference is that smart phones are constantly updating over the internet throughout the day which drains the battery and most have massive touch screens these days that also drain the battery; so, you pretty much need to charge them daily.  Very few will run for 24 hours and most will die well before the 24 hour mark; but I regularly get 36+ hours of life out of my Atrix and that's without using the night saver mode.  I still usually charge it every night, but when I forget, I don't worry too much because I've only completely ran it dry once or twice since I've had it.  Most of the time, it's still running when I plug it in at bedtime the second night; that's roughly 40 hours!  That's pretty awesome from a smart phone.  Keep in mind that battery life is totally dependent on how it is used and each person will have a different experience but I can say without a doubt that this phone has one of the best, if not the best, performing battery on the market.However, I have helped several people who complained about the battery life on this phone and they weren't exactly wrong in their complaints.  What I found is that if you don't fully charge the phone when you first get it, before initializing it the first time, whatever your battery level is at the time you set up the phone will be the max you'll get out of it.  The phone apparently assumes the phone is fully charged when you set it up and the battery manager uses that initial charge level as the base level for a 100% charge.  This may have been corrected in a later firmware update.  But using the initial firmware the phone shipped with, if the phone was at 40% when you set it up, it would show 100% after the configuration was complete and start counting down from there.  I have read comments from other users who state that the battery manager will adjust itself over a series of charge cycles.  But if you will charge the phone to 100% before you configure it, I've found that you won't encounter this issue.  If you already made this mistake, you can correct it by charging the phone overnight and then do a factory reset (Settings/Privacy/Factory Data Reset) while it is 100% charged.(Notice:  Performing a factory reset will erase everything on the phone; you'll lose any text messages and call history and anything else that you don't have backed up somewhere else, including apps.  I find resetting an Android phone to be a simple task because I can quickly reload the apps I use and I don't really care if I lose old texts or the phone logs.  My contacts and e-mail are all restored when I reconfigure the phone.  There is always a period of reconfiguring apps and custom settings that can take a little time but I don't find it to be much of a hassle.  You should be aware of what will happen before you do a reset and make a backup if you are concerned about losing anything important.)Another area I see people put down about this phone is the screen.  They usually compare it to an iPhone and say it looks washed out or something along those lines.  It doesn't look the same as an iPhone to be sure; but the screen looks great to me.  And the automatic backlight brightness management on this phone is better than any other I've ever used; most of the time I turn them off and manage the brightness manually because phones usually do such a poor job managing the brightness themselves; but I leave the Atrix on automatic and never have a complaint.  I've compared the Atrix to an iPhone while outside in bright sunlight and while I've never seen an LCD perform well in this situation, the Atrix does seem to be more usable in sunlight to me.The Atrix runs MotoBlur and a lot of people complain about Blur.  This is probably the biggest complaint you see about Motorola smart phones in general.  The Atrix is the first MotoBlur phone I've used for any period of time but I replaced a Nexus One with the Atrix and can say confidently that there is very little difference between MotoBlur and the stock Android interface.  A lot of people prefer HTC's Sense UI over both the stock Android UI and MotoBlur but I've always liked the stock interface better myself and I found the version of MotoBlur that the Atrix runs to be pretty darn close to stock.  There are definitely a few customizations but I've not seen anything to complain about.  Motorola apparently reduced the MotoBlur impact before the Atrix came out so I can't argue about MotoBlur of the past, but the Atrix has a nice clean user interface.  Keep in mind that user interfaces are subjective and everyone has their own ideas about them; this is just my opinion.  And MotoBlur's Exchange integration is one of the best I've seen.  I used to use TouchDown because I didn't like the stock Exchange e-mail app that Android provides, but the Atrix messaging app is excellent.Another area of complaint is bloatware.  Bloatware consists of apps that the carriers puts on phones to push their services and some manufacturers will install their own apps as well.  This phone does have some; but almost all of it can be uninstalled under Settings/Applications.  That's a nice touch and a change from past experiences.  There are a few that can't be uninstalled but I haven't had any issues with any of them.  I don't use them and they don't take up much space; so I tend to forget they're even there.I've seen comments from people claiming that the Atrix is cheaply made and they usually compare it to an iPhone or possibly a Nexus One or some other popular phone when saying this.  I disagree; I find it to have a solid, quality feel about it.  And having dropped it pretty badly a couple of times (once it hit my foot while I was walking and was kicked across a room to land on a concrete and tile floor), it came through without a scratch!  One of my co-workers and a few of my personal friends who use iPhones have dropped them only to see them shatter when they hit the floor.  I know one guy who has had that happen twice!!!  In my opinion, the Atrix has a good solid design and the Atrix 2 only improves on that build.All in all, in my opinion, the Atrix is an exceptional phone.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blows any other phone right out of the water", "Author": "SuperSlugger2134 \"Tiki\"", "ReviewID": "R2PORD55V199YG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some background as the type of user that I am. I text a lot, don't really talk all that much, I am active social networker (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and I also surf the web a lot! Previous to this phone, I have never owned a smartphone at all. When my upgrade came around, I really wanted to get a smartphone. I almost got the iPhone but after doing some research, I was conviced that the Atrix is just a better option. Almost a month later, I can honestly say that I don't have a SHRED of buyer's remorse. This phone really is as good as advertised. Simply put, its the best damn smartphone on the market, period. And now, my impressions and annoyances about the phone!Pros:1.) Fast. I mean really fast. That dual core processor real ups the computing power on this baby. I put down all of the widgets and options that I could fit on to the screen to put it through its paces and the phone still moved from screen to screen with smoothness and no delay. The web options are also really quick assuming good connectivity to the network/wi-fi.2.) Lightweight and not very bulky to feel.3.) The display is a qHD display meanings the pictures and colors are very vibrant and the graphics are amazing. Although, I do have to admit, not quite as good as the iPhone's, but nonetheless still very, very good.4.) Quick sync-up with all of your social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIN, etc) and email. It's actually kind of scary how quickly the phone does that. Plus if your friends on facebook have their numbers on their profiles... it will show up in your contacts... which I thought was kind of cool and a bit annoying.5.) The fact that it runs on the Android OS. Honestly... the customization ability of the Android OS is what makes this phone really work for me because, unilke the iOS (iPhone operating system), no two Android phones are alike. With the iPhone everyone's iPhone does pretty much the same thing, but with this Atrix, no two Atrixes are alike and you can really customize as you wish. The flexibility is such a plus and the Atrix also really allows you to play with that flexibility!6.) Great for texting/social networking w/o the annoying autocorrect crap!7.) Voice command is just freaking amazing. You can pretty much do anything with the built in voice command call people, text people, write emails, search using Google... just about anything. There is also a third party Vlingo app (which you can't unistall) but is still really handy!8.) Nice 5 mp camera plus a front facing camera if you are into voice chatting! Plus you can take 720p HD video with the VGA camera... basically its a very nice picture quality if you don't know what that means.And now for the bad parts, as amazing as this phone is, there are those as well.Cons:1.) Battery life sucks. Like it's just terrible. If you use the phone for the day, it will pretty much suck the battery life right down to zero. So you should be carrying a charger with your everywhere you go... in ther car, at work, at home, etc. When you have such a powerful phone as this, its totall unavoidable... the battery will get drained really quickly2.) The Motoblur thing is really annoying and it doesn't always integrate things properly, but you can't get around it. You have to deal with it.3.) Not a super intuitive phone. If you have never had a smartphone before, your goign to have to spend some time to try to get to know how this phone works. It took me literally three days of non-stop tinkering and internet searches to figure things out and I'm a techie! I'm still finding out new things about this phone after a month!!4.) Volume controls are a bit lacking. Things are either reallly really loud or very very soft... and not much middle ground. But I got used to it.5.) There is some bug issues. During my first week, once my phone just randomly rebooted itself, with battery full and everything. It happened while I was surfing the web... so idk if some webcontent forced it to shutdown or if something is actually wrong with the device. But since then it hasn't randomly rebooted itself... to my knowledge. IDK what it does while I am asleep.In conclusion. This phone, by enlarge, rocks. There are some minor details and issues with it, but nothing that is so detrimental that it will ruin the phone's experience or the functionality of the phone. You just can't go wrong with this phone!! All of you who are out in the market for a smartphone... do your self a favor and strongly consider this phone, because it really is a fantastic smartphone!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best Phone Ever", "Author": "Alexis Ferraz", "ReviewID": "R170QPCSYVPB4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the best phone I've bought so far, I've tried Blackberry Bold 9700, Sony Ericsson P1i, Nokia N900, iPhone 3G ... and I can say with certainty that this is the most comprehensive smart phone, fast and long battery life have ever tasted.

Great volume, durable, loved the pictures, video and wifi. Come October though, my phone especially started having major problems, and I had to spend $100 to get the touch screen (digitizer) replaced. This helped for about two more months, but the problems are back and my wife's phone is having major problems of it's own. Sometimes I can't unlock mine, then other areas won't respond on the touch screen. My wife's speaker phone and mute come on, all the time now. So we have had the phones about a year, and they have become almost useless. Because I still have a year left on my contract, we have to pay full price for two new phones, or take a chance that we can spend less and get the phones fixed.

I've dropped it quite a few times (never over 5 foot drops) and it has never come apart/restarted/cracked the screen.All of the applications and games I've thrown at it work flawelessly, no staggering or lags at all, whenver the phone starts to lag it's generally from a lack of signal. The Atrix also has no qualms about playing 720p video files which is a nice upgrade from my previous phone.I can usually get 1.5 days out of a charge, this varies depending on if I use the internet heavily or talk a lot.The camera is decent, it's not going to amaze given what else is on the market now - but it's a very competent camera nonetheless.One bad thing I can report on this phone is it will restart sometimes of its own accord. This is generally when you tap out the RAM by having too many apps running at a time or an app that gets stuck and has a memory leak.Things I like:-Responsive-Thin Design-Amount of apps that can be run at the same time-Media options (micro-HDMI port and media server options)-Good call volume-Decent battery life-Durable (construction isn't easy on electronics)-Forward facing cam (great for video conferencing)Things I don't like:-Random Restarts-Position of unlock button (personal preference)-Camera shutter speed can lag at timesOverall I really have liked this phone.

Also I like Sony a lot, but none of their devices were having Tegra Processors and I am not a Nvidia Fanboy but lets say since I have given them my preference over graphics processing, all have been excellent so far, not to mention their CUDA technology, which they will implement soon for mobiles. Also games tend to \"look\" much better.Battery---------------------Battery has been quite good, although I do know there are people complaining about it, for me it would last around 18 hours even average using Waze and HDSPA+ Internet and Playing a bit of Bard's Tale. If I do not play that much with it then it can achieve around 36 hours. Also battery has been getting better through usage. Its important to mention that I use Easy Battery Saver application which manages it when it is iddle, really recommended.Performance---------------------It has been great so far. I got some screen protector, body protector and base for my car and it became my full fledged companion. I even check the stock market through internet and it browses at very good speed. The graphics with the games are amazing, the phone speed is really good and the signal, altough not that good is on average quite acceptable.Final words:------------Just some final words:Pros:- Tegra 2 processor- Good 4G speeds- Good on average Battery- Good built (of course please do not compare it with the IPhone, apple boys).- Fingerprint is amazing!!!..- Sound is quite good in calls and the ringtone volume as well (Alarm always wakes me up!)- SD expansion slot- Removable batteryCons:- Camera not the best, specially as I was comming from an XPeria model, which takes better photos and videos with smaller sizes.- Sadly Motorola would not update it to IceCream Sandwich Android Version (4.0), so you are stuck with either 2.3.6 from factory or 2.3.7 using Cyanogenmod in my case. Motorola would not free drivers for Camera and Tegra processor, but there are lots of nice projects, specially the Emerson Pinter one that gives us some hope:[...]- I did not get a HDMI cable included, also the Webtop application needs the extra devices, although its possible to modify the phone at your own risk to make it available upong HDMI connection.Overall I am very very happy with my phone and even if its not the most powerful one in the present, it has given me so much improvement for the buck that I do not hesitate to recommend it to everybody, specially as it is 3 times more affordable than the companies flagships.Hope this helps to decide if this phone is for you or not :)", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Drop Apple and go 4 Atrix!", "Author": "Dane007", "ReviewID": "R1XAOYLACVEZ5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 4 years with iPhone, I got rid of Apple and switched to Motorola.

I took very good care of my phone and did not break it, drop it from any great height, or incur any water damage. After six months, I sent it in to AT&T; for a new phone because suddenly nothing I did on my phone had volume. Luckily, the phone was still under warranty so they replaced it.I though nothing of it until six months into my new replacement phone the wireless stopped working. Instead of any wireless connections options, the phone wifi feature under settings will simply say error. Google \"Android Matrix Wifi error\" and you will see what I am talking about. The issue has been made apparent to Motorola in over 3,000 complaints on Motorola online support forums and yet nothing has been done to fix it. In fact, according to one user in a online Motorola technical support forum I read, the Android Matrix is now the number one phone returned to AT&T; centers due to technical difficulty. I spent over three hours on the phone with AT&T; customer service who referred me to Motorola customer service. Motorola customer service's only fix was to tell me how to do a hardware reset on the phone. In fact, despite doing the hardware reset twice, it didn't work and actually made the problem worse. Now, instead of just having a phone that can use my data plan and not any wireless networks, I now have a phone that randomly restarts itself every ten minutes.When I explained the problem to Motorola customer service, they wanted over 100 dollars to fix the phone. Newsflash, as you can tell the phone is only worth around 100 dollars. Plus, due to the sheer amount of people that are having the same issues as I am, I do not understand why I have to pay for an error that obviously has something to do with the phone's programing and not user error. If Motorola will not stand by their products, I am switching brands.Also, around the same time the wifi on my second phone broke, a piece fell out of the headphones so that I can no longer plug any headphones into my phone at all. Now that I have a phone that can't be used as a music player and can't be used to surf the web on the wireless internet I pay for. Essentially, after six months expect your smart phone to turn into a glorified brick that sucks money.Bottom line, I have owned two of these phones and I can tell you that this is not a sound investment.

It's size, fingerprint reader (keeps my son off of it!), removable battery, and responsiveness are perfect for me.  I also have three docks and a couple carrying cases that allow me to use my phone in every way I need to.  I'll tell you my whole journey to keep the love alive with my ATRIX so perhaps you can avoid my pitfalls, and weigh whether this particular purchase is for you.My old phone's screen started acting up about 3 months ago with poltergeist touches and random screen freeze ups.  I limped along for awhile and then a month ago when my contract was up w/ AT&T; I went into their store to get a replacement.  With the industry tendency towards upsizing screens (if I wanted to do that I'd carry my tablet as a phone!), the newest phones were not of interest to me.  The new ATRIX *completely* changed, making all my docks and cases obsolete, not to mention its poor reviews on battery life and bulkiness.  (This is where the iPhone market has an edge over Android, third party vendors on accessories can design to adapt to the slight changes of a single line of phones and the phone supplier actually considers that in transitioning form factor.)  With the ATRIX 4G no longer sold by AT&T; I moved to online purchasing.I first tried to replace the touchscreen digitizer using a YouTube tutorial published by Repairs Universe, the supplier of the digitzer.  BEWARE!  Not until you go to put it back together do you find there is NO SUCH VIDEO showing you how to, and googling will show the many who have gone before you in their failed attempts and ultimately ruined the new part (which is really easy to do).  The supplier's guidance?  \"Just do the reverse of the take apart video\" ... NOT!  I'm pretty handy with electronics, and it is definitely not a job for a non-pro.  Not to mention the quality of the part was substandard (you could see lines on the touchscreen when the phone is off). $60 some buck down the tubes.Then I decided to save a few bucks and bought a phone on eBay that was advertised as \"MINT\", and sure it was cosmetically perfect, but several features didn't work and I finally determined it was because the seller had upgraded to ICS OS which the ATRIX is not compatible with (be aware of that before you purchase one if upgrading to ICS important to you -- it's not currently to me.)  I was not able to use this phone, or get the downgrade to GB OS to work.So that's why I'm here.  I decided to pay the premium and buy a brand new after market ATRIX 4G from a highly rated seller on Amazon.  What I expected was to get an exact replacement for the phone I had, but I didn't quite get that.  Yes, this phone has GB installed and everything was new-in-box.  Yes, the features I absolutely need all work.  But the phone was built for the Asian vs. US market (based on the firmware version 45.31.0.MB860.AsiaRetail.en.03). What I got was an older version of GB OS (2.3.4) with no OTA updates enabled, cheaper construction of the phone (evident in the brittle polymer on the SD card band and cheaper plastic of the body) and power cord plugs for non-US electrical outlets.  Sure it came with an adapter, but this projects the charger plug about four inches out from the wall!  Of course I still have my old chargers so that's not critical, but I did pay a premium for new everything.Overall I am happy with the performance of my new phone.  The fingerprint reader actually works better than my old one (gets it right on the first swipe most times), and I've no performance issues of running on an older version of the OS.  The only thing I have not been able to restore to my old ways is the email notification icon ... and it really does bug me.  The icon is red, and it looks way to much like the missed call notification icon.  I really really want my gray back, and I've searched for a solution on the Android forums with no luck.  I'm sure I will get used to it, since in my searches I found plenty of complaints about the 2.3.6 upgrade taking away the brilliant red notification and replacing it with the dull gray.  We get used to stuff, which is why I've spent so much effort replacing by ATRIX 4G rather than jumping on the next new thing!I really don't know if there are any \"new\" phones left that were built for the US market, so maybe this is as good as it gets?  Overall I'm happy I am not dealing with resurrecting my ATRIX anymore.  Not sure what I'll do when this dies ... I know I'm just delaying the inevitable \"upgrade\".", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Seemingly great phone but could not use", "Author": "Thomas E.

It came in a generic Motorola box, no model number or other labels, and contained no warranty, safety, or manual documents, at all. Battery, back cover, and phone all came separately wrapped and \"looked\" new. But clearly this is some sort of re-packaged or perhaps re-furbished phone. Worse (as I found out when the screen started to time out and not wake up using the power button at all -- battery pull and reboot required every time the screen times out for 1st time) Motorola has no intention of honoring a new warranty on these phones. After hassling for 3 days with Motorola tech support via chat messages, phone calls to some Caribbean country, and multiple case numbers, I was finally told that the IMEI for this phone had a warranty which expired in July, 3 months before I bought the phone. No Motorola service even for an out-of-box problem on a \"new\" phone. Motorola would not honor an Amazon original invoice. Accessory Distributors said they would grant a 30- day warranty and repair the phone, with all shipping at my cost. Amazon offered arbitration with the vendor, but ultimately my only recourse was to accept having a non-authorized vendor repair the phone up to 30 days out, then I was on my own. A service plan would have cost $130 a year. OR return the phone. The only good thing about this deal is that the vendor accepted the return (not the shipping, but Amazon picked that up except for the return). My theory (no one said this) is that these are bundled unsold OEM phones from 2011(new or refurbished) bought from either Motorola or ATT, unlocked, and repackaged without an original warranty, and that Motorola has no desire to keep 1-year old models on the market cutting into their new-model Atrix sales. And ATT likely has no interest in doing favors for people who plan to use the phone with service from a competitor provider (as I did). I emailed 6 other vendors in the Amazon list selling them as new and none would include a Motorola warranty. This being advertised as \"new\" doesn't mean much, and there is no proof they are. So after all was said and done, I was out $6, plus about a week of hassle with Motorola, the vendor, and Amazon (latter was the only easy one to deal with -- I am still an Amazon fan). Plus still looking for a non-plan smartphoneMy recommendation is to avoid this particular phone deal unless you find a vendor who promises a 12-month Motorola warranty, as all new Motorola cell phones are supposed to have. I am OK with people selling used or refurb items without a warranty, but to bill these as \"new\" without such a warranty is deceptive consumer advertising and should be an FCC issue. I am surprised Amazon allows it, even on purchases they fulfill. C'mon guys, repair this ad. These are <<not>> new phones.Addendum: as also observed in other reviews, the phone also came with a 1500 mAH battery not the stock 1930 mAH one that came with the original phone.

Spare batteries are a must. The USB cord for charging & connecting to a computer is super short. Charging can prove to be difficult if you want to use your phone while it's charging because it's so short that something as simple as sitting up straight is nearly impossible.  Also, it slips out of the phone really easily. One little bump and you could disconnect your phone from the charger without even noticing.The rumors:Q: Can 4G Smartphones connect to AT&T;'s data network on a prepaid plan?A: Yes.

Pickett", "ReviewID": "R1748UEJPK9HJ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone with the intent of giving the Android operating system a try since I just came from an iPhone 3GS.  I liked the idea of a SD slot for added memory, and a removable battery since my iPhone had locked-up on me several times and there was no way for me to shut it down, instead I had to wait for the battery to drain.  Unfortunately I found out that this phone had many more problems than my iPhone 3GS.  Here is a list of the major problems I've had with the Motorola Atrix 4G.1.  It reboots itself for no reason about 2-5 times a day.  When this happens usually the skin covering the battery is very warm.2. When playing music, the phone skips like other reviewers have said.  It doesn't matter what music player I've tried they all have this issue.3. Wi-Fi connectivity is intermittent at best.  I've had the phone lose connection 3 times in 1 minute.  When the phone loses connection to Wi-Fi, it also loses connection to the mobile network.  This can happen over 100 times in a single day.4. After a year of use the battery is complete garbage.  Although my 3 year old iPhone 3 is still ticking away with the stock battery.5. The phone has a mind of its own.  At random it will surf the net on its own completely ignoring what you typed in the search field.6. If the phone is plugged in and charging the touch screen does not work properly.  It is almost impossible to unlock the phone when it is plugged into the wall.There are other issues, but they are trivial compared to the ones I listed above.  I believe this phone needed a lot more testing and development before it was released.  If you need help exercising your patience then I think this phone is perfect.  If you need a phone to make calls, send texts and surf the web, my suggestion is to look elsewhere and forget that you ever heard of the Motorola Atrix 4G.Please note, my phone was not submerged under water, dropped from any great distance, or carried outside of a case.  As a matter of a fact, if you remove the phone from the case it almost looks brand new except for the minor scratches on the screen where dirt found its way between the case and the phone.  Next time I will use a screen protector before encasing my phone with an otter box.Best Regards,", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Purely amazing", "Author": "chris snapple", "ReviewID": "R2048W78YLDXG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being the runner up for most innovative device at the last T3 awards, this device not only is fast but is packed with cutting edge features too.

I can easily go through my working day without worrying about charging my phone to have battery juice while I get back home.

The MotoBlur interface is quite messy for handling Social Networking, but its excelent to manage email accounts/SMS. In fact, I don't use the Social Networking part of MotoBlur, I prefer the standard twitter, facebook apps. The size is perfect for 1 handed use. It also fits in my jean's pocket without any problems.In a short, it might not be the fastest phone around (the Galaxy S2 is faster), but I can't feel the difference between both in speed (my wife has an S2) in day by day use.

I had owned several Motorola cell phones over the years and stuck with them because I thought Motorola knew how to build a dependable phone.But, mine did not even make it to the two year point for a discounted replacement phone. Within the first few months of use the black plastic applied to the main on/off switch peeling off. This, however, did not seem to affect the functionality of the phone, so I ignored it. Later down the road the blue tooth function stopped working, and shortly thereafter the Wi-Fi function stopped working. A little web research uncovered that this is a common problem which can only be fixed with a new main motherboard.I continued to struggle along without those functions, but then the speaker for the ear end of the phone died. Again this turns out to be a common failure.Besides these reliability issues, the much hyped Atrix accessories like the laptopish dock, media dock and car dock turned out to be poorly thought out and poorly supported. The pseudo-laptop could only run a few outdated applications, and nothing new ever became available for it. That expensive accessory turned out to be little more than a novelty.Another recent problem is that Motorola has never upgraded this phone to the latest Android release, and consequently useful applications like the Paypal blue triangle for taking remote credit card payments will not work.Motorola was once the leader in cell phones.

Consumer Cellular doesn't require a data connection for smart phones, allowing the use of wif-fi instead; however they offer a small 3G data package at a low price...for those times you happen to not be near a free wi-fi.Because I already had one of their phones, I was able to add a \"New APN\" through the phone's menu (Settings, Wireless & networks, Mobile networks, Access point names, menu) by coping what was in the Bravo phone.

The MMSC web-link above includes the words \"mmsc.cingular.com\", after the usual \"http...\",Getting voice connections only required removing the sim card from the Bravo and putting it in the Atrix.So far, I'm very happy with this phone, with the Atrix being an improvement over the Bravo, having a better camera with a flash, faster processor, more memory, an added rear-facing camera, slightly larger screen, and the Gingerbread 2.3 OS.  After 3 weeks of using the phone, I have never had to reboot it, as I sometimes did with the Bravo's 2.2 OS.I've now purchased the AT&T; Laptop Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G - Retail Packaging, the Motorola Standard Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G, and the Motorola HD Multimedia Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G-Motorola Retail Packaging and found a use for each. The standard dock turns the phone into an excellent, inexpensive clock and radio for my desk.  On trips, I'll always take with me the Laptop Dock.  Although it doesn't have the full capability of a laptop, it is so close that at times I could not tell the difference; yet it is so small and light weight that I'll certainly enjoy the convenience of it...plus it boots up much faster than a laptop.  I found that I could attach the Multimedia dock to my TVs and use their large screen as my monitor, but you need to purchase a HDMI to HDMI Type D Micro Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 M).  The included bluetooth mouse and keyboard and also work with the lapdock, especially the mouse making a nice accessory for it.  The USB ports on the two docks provide added capability to the Atrix 4G, including the ability to use any USB/wireless mouse. Both the lapdock and multimedia dock allow watching web-based video on a larger screen; however, there is a noticeable, but acceptable (if it is your only option) uneven motion in the video.  However, both video, music and photographs stored in the phone play very well from the phone onto the TV, with the phone making a very nice control device.Now if I can only find a use for the Motorola Vehicle Dock for Motorola ATRIX 4G with Rapid Car Charger - Retail Packaging...Update: A reviewer on another site pointed out that \"older SIM cards (maybe 3-4 years old)\" may also need to be replaced with a newer SIM card for the data connection to work.  After 3 months, my Atrix 4G continues to work great, with the Standard and Laptop Docks being my \"must have\" accessories.Update2: Be careful and not get the international version of this phone....I could not get it to work with Consumer Cellular.  I purchased a 2nd phone for my wife from Unlocked CellPhoneKings (recently changed their name to Breed), and they shipped the the only version they said they had in stock...the international version.  My first Atrix 4G also came from CellPhoneKings.  The international versions comes with a Great Britain Plug, an adapter, and an Android 2.3.4 operating system  (vs 2.3.6 for the US version).  I could not get it to work with Consumer Cellular which doesn't support international use on their network.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "TOTALLY WORTH IT", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2H3IOKOZ8Y2HM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, it is just an amazing cellphone. I Highly recommend NOT to buy the at&t; unlocked version, it's better to get the european factory unlocked cellphone. Away from that point, it really is an amazing machine. It gets almost no lag even though you have every screen with multiple live widgets, It's a monster when it comes to storage capability, with its default internal 16gb, it can be expanded 32gb more with a microSD card, making it a 48gb cellphone. It can be customized with either the android widgets or with the motoblur ones. Motoblur sometimes is a little messy, but it will become a powerful tool once you get the hang of it. It has a 5MP camera with dual led (the flashlight app is a blinding light!) gets quite good pictures.If you want a phone that can be your great storage ace, this is it. A powerful machine processing data and an even more powerful one in the storage department. Also if you want a secure phone, the biometric lector for the fingerprint works just fine, and will make your phone a mobile fortress. I highly suggest to get the otterbox commuter for this phone, it will become much more natural feeling in your hand and will protect it from ANYTHING, since it comes with a screen protector also.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent android phone!!", "Author": "javaez", "ReviewID": "R3LC3JLZXDXPJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 3 months with this phone, I could say it's a great gadget!!!

Unfortunately I found the phone slightly warm one day sitting on my desk on the charger. It was off (oddly) so I turned it on and found that it hung at the splash screen \"Rethink Possible\". Warranty replacement, fine, except about a month later it failed in the exact same way. So now I'm on my 3rd phone (same model), and yesterday it started turning itself off after 2-10 minutes of being idle. The timing appears random, and the battery indicator shows 90%. It's doing the same thing this morning after a full charge, and I'm using the Motorola charger and battery that came with the phone. I hope Motorola will replace it with the newer model (Atrix 2), and I'll have better luck with that. If not, I'll just eat it and get an Iphone - ugh.I do not recommend this product to anyone unless it's a gift for someone you hate, and they live at the end of a long, precarious drive with no guardrails in an area where it would be a long time for a passerby to recognize they went off the road hundreds of feet down a ravine because it was so rainy they could barely see the road and coincidentally their driver's side windshield wiper was intermittently malfunctioning and they had to use their cellphone to call for help in order to save their life because they were pinned under the steering wheel but when they went to use their Motorola Atrix 4G it would suddenly reboot and get stuck at the \"Rethink Possible\" screen and that would be the last thing they saw. Under those circumstances I would rate this phone 5 stars and highly recommend it.I'm on my 4th phone (my employer pays for my phone) - been quite a while with no issues, but I still hate it.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Atrix 4G Will Not be Upgraded To Android 4.0", "Author": "C.

I loved my Razr, it was always dependable and everything always worked on it. One day the inevitable happened and it fritz-ed out and died. Based on what I knew about the Motorola phones by experience. I did my research on what Motorola was offering through my carrier. I did not consider other brands because I had either personally had a bad experience with them, or a family member had a bad experience with them. In the end I came up with the ATRIX as the android based 4G phone to get. I stopped into my friends AT&T; store and against his attempts to get me into another phone, I purchased the ATRIX and renewed my contract for another 2 years.I had never owned a 4G phone before and there is a learning curve to get used to the features they offer and how to use them. I liked the idea of an App market place where a variety of android based applications was readily available. I had my ATRIX for about 3 months and all seemed well. I was at a picnic and was waiting for the festivities to start and decided to try out my new App for learning German. I had a full battery, and went at it. After several lessons, the phone would freeze. I was forced to remove the skin and pull the battery to get out of it. This continued to happen, and as time went on it became more frequent. It finally got to the point where the phone was unusable. Everyone was telling me to lose the App, so I removed it. I decided to download a few games instead. A short time later I had another opportunity to spend some time and tried playing the games. The same thing happened that did with the German language App. After a short time of playing the phone would freeze. Removal of the skin and battery was required. Freezing occurred more frequently as time went on. Then one evening I placed the phone on the charger and left it for an over night charge. The next morning I took the phone and left for work. A few hours into the day I noticed that the phone was beeping and when I checked it it was indicating that the battery was low and it needed to be charged. That evening when I got home I put it on the charger and left it charge over night. The next morning when I checked the phone it was very warm and although the screen said it was charging, it was frozen. I decided to take it back to the AT&T; store.The AT&T; store replaced the phone for me instead of forcing me to deal with AT&T; returns and getting a re manufactured one in return. I set this phone up and downloaded my Apps again including the German language App. The phone worked fine. I thought this was the end of the problems that I had just gotten a defective phone. NOT! At about the 1 year anniversary of my owning the phone I noticed that the battery would drain within a few hours. I would leave it on the charger over night and never get a 100% full battery, and by the time I got home around dinner time it was a red flashing sliver. I was not happy and did not want to have to buy a new battery for this phone already. I nursed it along for a few months like this, until one day I dropped the phone and the skin popped off and the battery fell out. I put it back in and snapped the skin back on. From that point the battery charged fully, and did not run out within a few hours. But, this only lasted a few days until the battery drain issue appeared again. I have to remove the skin and battery, and then charge and it would be fine for a few days to a week at a time. This cycle still occurs to this day. Now other symptoms are appearing. The phone will not ring when the ringer is ON and volume UP. I'll get no messages either, and my wife will jump on me for never answering my phone or messages. The phone is now possum freezing. It looks like it's working, you can slide the lock over and select the phone function and go to your contacts list and select a number then Call and the Call button goes red like its making the call, but in reality nothing is happening. Again, the removal of the skin and battery will rectify this issue and the messages and missed calls log will immediately appear. Too late.So in conclusion, I like the reception, the phone has always gotten good reception. I have no complaints about dropping calls as its extremely rare. The fit and feel of the phone is solid and durable. When it held a charge properly it would be for days. But the phone has serious issues. Its constant battery and App issues are not only annoying, but an inconvenience. Thankfully its a simple fix, but we should not have to do that. The ATRIX is a big disappointment. My wife recently gave her old Propel to our son and we purchased an iPhone 4S and I have to tell you I am impressed with that phone and the features it offers. I have to wait another year or pay a higher price for an iPhone 4S, so I'll have to try to nurse the ATRIX along for another 10 months before I can get an iPhone 4S. I cannot recommend this phone to someone, its just not reliable.UPDATE 6/8/2012Last evening a major accident was tying up roads to home. My wife was out on the highways and I wanted to give her a heads up. I pulled out the Atrix and it was in Possum Mode again. I've dubbed the term Possum Mode as the phone looks like its on and working, but in reality its locked up. When its in Possum Mode you cannot do anything and you receive no messages or calls. YOu have to pull the skin and remove the battery to reset the phone. I was still constantly getting land line calls from my wife wondering why I was not answering my phone, because the calls were never getting to me due to this turd of a phone. I pulled the battery while driving which was dangerous but there was no pull off so I had to go with it. I pressed the power up button and the Motorola Duel Core symbol came up and there it sat. Frozen again. I had to risk life and limb again trying to pull the skin and battery. I finally got it to start but it hung again on the AT&T; Think Possibilities flash screen. By this time I was home and my wife was not home. I pulled the battery again and finally got the phone to start. I called her and she had seen the back ups and went a different route home and was safe. I sat the phone down and went out to cut the lawn. An hour later I came back and picked up the phone and it was dark. I had to pull the battery again and got it to start finally. It had 1/2 battery charge, but I put it on the charger anyway. After a shower we went out to dinner and when I came home and pulled the phone from my pocket it was dark again. I started it and the Motorola Duel Core flash screen appeared and there it sat. After some time I started getting a modem error and that it was starting RDP which it never did as it was frozen again. This was as far as I got after several attempts at resetting the unit by pressing the reset button in the battery compartment and removal and replacement of the battery. I left it sit that way over night and this morning the phone was 100% dead. I tried to place it on the charger for two hours and its either not accepting a charge or its totally hosed. I'm done with this total turd of a phone. I'm going out this evening and getting an iPhone 4Gs.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome but sometimes heats and resets or turns off", "Author": "Sussumu", "ReviewID": "R1R9DZJWM5S7ZV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Awesome but sometimes heats and resets or turns off.

Internal memory capacity is good, and is expandable5. Great speakers6. I love the fingerprint reader - it gets me in quickly and I have a great time rubbing that feature in my friends' faces7. Good battery life - my phone gets no more than 5 minutes rest with me, unless I'm sleeping. I also spend a great amount of time reading from it and it can withstand my heavy use for hours.8. Great display - the resolution is fabulous. The dimmest light setting is still pretty bright; this could be a pro AND a con depending on how well your eye handles light.9. Good camera - takes up to 5MP and, with a bit of editing with apps such as Aviary or Pixlr Express, can make 5MP look much higher; the camcorder can record HD videos (however, recording doesn't look great in low light).10. I love the positioning of the power/fingerprint scanner button. Some persons posted this as a con, as the position is a bit unorthodox, but whenever someone picks up my phone, I have fun watching them futilely try to even turn on the display. It's a great deterrent for nosy persons.11. Notification light - it isn't much, but I love the notification light; it saves me the trouble of turning on my display to see if there's a notification. My brother, who uses a Samsung Galaxy S2, is jealous of this little feature.12. Good microphone that's great for voice recordings and the speech-to-text feature.There are probably more pros, but these are the ones that come off the top of my head!Cons:1. Hard to see in bright sunlight - you can rectify this by upping the light setting, but that pulls much more battery life.2. Sometimes slow response - this MIGHT be because I've downloaded too many apps or use too much RAM. It can get frustrating at times so if your patience is already low, be warned.3. Music lags when doing other stuff - while doing other stuff, the music tends to lag and sounds jumpy; I don't know if others have this problem. My best friend also has this phone and has told me this has never happened to her. I just avoid using my phone for music and stick to my iPod. Music pulls a lot of battery anyway.4. Sudden shutdowns - doesn't happen often, probably once every two weeks, but it's still annoying when it DOES happen.I read in the manual that you should restart your phone periodically, just like you would with a computer, but ain't nobody got time for that!5. Takes FOREVER to restart - after those shutdowns and restarts, it takes my phone about 3-5 minutes to start back up, then another 30 seconds or so to start running smoothly. If you're someone like me who's constantly receiving messages, texts, emails, and updates, 5 minutes can seem like a lifetime.6. Display gets twitchy after calls - whenever I put the phone to my face, after calls it begins acting up. I'm guessing that's because of the natural oils from my face gets on the screen and makes it seem like a touch. I have to put my phone to sleep then clean the screen before it gets back to normal. I don't know if my screen protector has anything to do with this too but it's still annoying and a bit scary. I just use my headphones on calls and avoid this problem entirely.I'm looking at my phone now and trying to come up with more cons, but I just can't! It really is a great phone. I'm not the type that wants the most expensive phone with the most updated OS; I just want one that works well, looks good, and that didn't cost me and arm and a leg. Coupled with an Otterbox case and a screen protector, this phone can compete with many of the more popular, top-notch phones at a fraction of the cost.On a side note: this phone came with a multimedia dock and headphones with built-in microphone; perfect for those days when you want to watch a movie on your phone without having to hold it up for an hour and a half :)My bottom line: get this phone!", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android phone for the price", "Author": "Luke W", "ReviewID": "R31C4WAPFI377M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it through AT&T; for a penny, and bought a second when I ran over it with my car.

POBRE. en la noche es imposible sacar una foto a mas de un metro de distancia con el flash. olvidese de sacar fotos de noche.si usted quiere un celular con una buena camara use un nokia ..... lastima que symbian lo hayan descartado ... sino seguiria con nokia ...segun el fabricante la pantalla es fabricada con GORILLA GLASS. pero la verdad lo dudo que sea asi. en menos de una semana ya se habia rallado en varias partes.. nada que ver con mi antiguo N8 que aun despues de mas de 2 a\u00f1os sigue intacto en la pantalla.Aparte de eso es demasiado lento, cuando abres varias aplicaciones se cuelga y muestra mensajes de que no puede abrir la aplicacion y debe cerrarse. a veces pienso que en vez de android este celular viene con windows  PUAHHH\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1lo unico a favor de este equipo es un sistema de desbloqueo mediante huella dactilar, y una base que trae , que sirve para conectarlo a un tv. mas un teclado y un raton, mediante conector usb.del resto este equipo es fatal. increiblemente lento.NO LO RECOMIENDO...(PD. VIENE SOLO EN INGLES , ES IMPOSIBLE PONERLO EN ESPA\u00d1OL MEDIANTE ACTUALIZACION)cell is a buy it thinking it would be the best, but nothing is further from reality, Motorola decided to start not get a software update for this phone. It stays with android 2.3.1. gingerbread. DO NOT UPDATE TO 4.0 ICE CREAM OJOOO. what a shame, really not anyone thought of motorola, but I think the worst of the plays that could make the users of this and a number of teams that can not actualizarce Motorolas.Another thing I like is the fact that sometimes hangs when receiving an incoming call, there is no way to unlock the screen. have to wait for it to release the call screen. software that is defect. ..As for the camera in no comparison to my previous NOKIA N8. uffff .... nothing to do. As we say here, NOKIA es NOKIA  ....The colors are poor, the image quality is poor. POOR. at night it is impossible to take a picture of more than a meter away with flash. skip taking pictures at night.if you want a phone with a good camera use a nokia .....According to the manufacturer the screen is made of Gorilla Glass. but honestly I doubt so. at least one week had already been shredded into several parts .. nothing to do with my old N8 that even after more than two years remains intact on the screen.Other than that is too slow, when you open multiple applications hangs and displays messages that can not open the application and needs to close.

It was my first smart phone, but being a computer-savvy person I had no problem figuring out the interface. I have seen quite a few reviews stating that you have to use the Motorola or AT&T; branded apps, which is absolutely not the case. You simply must change your settings to allow third-party software.PROs:-This phone is FAST. Startup takes about 20-25 seconds, but once it is up programs open very quickly and it multitasks well. I am frequently downloading, web surfing, playing Words, and answering emails/texts all at the same time with no perceptible slowdown.-The Android OS gives you the freedom to do pretty much whatever you want. I often find myself explaining to incredulous iPhone users some of the things I can do (...I just plug the USB into my car stereo and it charges while playing music from the SD card...I connect my phone to my TV through USB and watch home movies or view pics straight from the SD card...etc). In addition, mt fiance has a Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. It is a gorgeous phone, but it still can't do many of the things the Atrix can do.CONs:-The screen is not as sharp as the iPhone or the Samsung Galaxy S2 (which really is breathtaking). It gets the job done and responds well, but just doesn't pop.-Battery life. I get about 5 hours. As a disclaimer, I constantly have multiple apps running. If you don't do as much as I do, you will get much longer life. I tried turning off wifi and GPS, and it nearly doubles the battery life.-Motorola docks. I have a car dock and an HD dock. The hookup is awkward and takes some getting used to. Also, there is a docking screen that automatically pops up, and you can't disable it. It is a minor complaint, but it is nevertheless annoying.In all, if you are a believer in form following function, this is for you. I would choose processing power and cross-platform multifunctionality over screen brightness every day of the week and twice on Sundays. If you are an iPhone user and don't mind exploring an OS, you will be blown away by the things you can do with Android on a powerful piece of equipment.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "franklyn cueto", "Author": "Franklin CUETO", "ReviewID": "R3M9MYZ0UGWQ8K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have only one problem with it, eventually reboots itself and has some applications at & t to which I can not agree for lack of an account can help me fix this?", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this phone Lot.

Jones \"Andy\"", "ReviewID": "R6JS2MFFM230X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Atrix 4g boasts an impressive set of features, solid performance with it's snappy dual-core processor, and great battery life (I've had it run for 5 hours straight with streaming music and GPS tracking both going).Unfortunately, the software on this phone is extremely both buggy.  In the 6 months I've owned this device I've had to perform (at the insistence of Motorola tech support) 5 full factory resets due to software issues (random crashes, loss of data, phone wouldn't boot, etc).  I did not 'root' the phone, 'sideload' any apps, or perform any other questionable installations, I just ran the stock device.In addition to the software problems, the hardware of the atrix is very unreliable.  I'm actually on my 4th device, having returned 3 already under Warranty.  I'm very concerned about what will happen when my warranty runs out.  The first phone would not operate with the Atrix specific accessories (car dock, laptop dock, television dock) and there was no software resolution, so the phone had to be returned.  The 2nd would randomly reset itself to factory default, causing me to lose all my information.  The 3rd would only play any sounds (calls, music, etc) if I squeezed it very tightly (loose connection?).As a side note to the warranty returns and software issues, Motorola support is terrible terrible terrible!  I cannot stress this enough.  The FIRST thing they have me try when calling is a factory reset (loss of all data).  I have to work my way up to a 2nd or 3rd manager before they attempt any software solutions other than just reset the phone.  Secondly, despite the device being under warranty Motorola would not accept my returns for the hardware issues unless I paid them for the repair/replacement of the device.  I contacted AT&T; about the problems and they took care of it immediately even though Motorola is supposed to resolve warranty issues.As a second side note, addressing the Atrix specific docks that were supposed to be a huge selling point of this phone.  The docks, when they work, perform admirably.  I've owned all 3 at this point.  They integrate well, work the way they're supposed to, and are a great addition to the phone.  Unfortunately they will work only with this phone, ever, and if you ever upgrade your device they can go in the garbage can.  Motorola has changed the layout of their docking connections for more recent phones, and because of that I would consider these accessories a waste of money.  Go with more generic docks that will work for any android device.Finally, this device was/is advertised as being compatible with Android OS 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).  However, despite using that as a selling point for the Atrix and several other devices, Motorola recently announced that they are cancelling their support and this phone will no longer be receiving ICS.The Atrix had the potential to be a great device, all the features are there, but the software, warranty, and (especially) support issues make this a phone to avoid.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery is always low!", "Author": "andrea", "ReviewID": "R2NY02R6TCV4OO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product was late, but dealer managed to send it to a new address.

Mine never locks up or fails and gets good reception.  It rarely drops calls.So you might be wondering why I only gave it 4 stars instead of five.  The reason:  the phone call quality is mediocre.  Callers say that I sound like I'm in a bucket, unless I'm on my bluetooth headset.  And it's pretty hard to hear my callers; I don't have bad hearing, but I do have to keep the volume up at 90% to 100% at all times.  Any lower is too soft, but that high it distorts.So overall it's a super-cool phone, but it doesn't have the most important aspect that I require in all phones:  good sound.

The phone works perfectly. Faster than the desire, wildfire and motorola droid 2. The dual core from Nvidia is excellent at running everything. And the phone works great in Latin America (Venezuela) and Caribbean islands as well. There is a lot of bloatware installed by Motorola, that lives on top of the native Android OS, but this has very little lag or delay (despite other user reviews on Youtube). The cpu, ram, memory and visuals, and the screen colors are excellent. I would recommend this phone to anyone, and if the price drops further I will be purchasing another one in this line before Xmas.

You should expect download speeds to be optimally 3-6 Mbps with perfect signal strength, off peak.  Often , the performance is closer to 1.5 mbps.  Check with your carrier to be sure you will get the performance you expect on their network (and that HSPA+ is available in your overage area).On WiFi, I have verified that the phone can handle data rates as fast as 40 mbps.Related:  The multimedia dock is well worth owning, especially if you would like to use a keyboard and mouse to operate the phone (you can also attach a display or TV via HDMI for an even better experience).CONS: Wish it was an LTE phone.

I ordered it on a Saturday and it arrived 1 day earlier than expected. First two days, I tested the phone and saw what it was capable of. Processing power and the nVidia Tegra 2 makes this great for those graphic intensive games for the Android market (Modern Combat 3, Shadowgun, etc).So like I mentioned before, this phone worked GREAT for the first 2 days. 3rd day I was using it, the phone suddenly shut off by itself while I was in the bus listening to music. So I didn't think much of it, until it happened another time while I was playing Modern Combat 3. Then 2 more times when I wasn't even using the phone at all.I thought a factory reset would fix the problem, but it didn't. During the reset, the phone restarted again. So I checked online for a solution which some told me could be a problem with the SIM card and or other countless problems the Atrix 4G has. So I did another factory reset from the way Motorola support said, which is a hard reset by pressing the volume down button and the power button at the same time.Did that twice and still had this problems. Not even a week of using the phone and already these problems occurred. I suggest to all you thinking of getting this phone, its a great device ONLY if you are going to need it just as a cell phone. Making phone calls and minimum internet usage. Other than that, using this device for playing games or even listening to music will get the phone to restart itself 5-6 times a day.PS: Not sure about how other people received their Motorola Atrix through amazon, but when mine arrived there was a scuff mark on the top right corner of the battery cover and on the bottom left corner of the phone. So I ignored that fact when the phone first arrived, now I'm just disappointed.This would be a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the problems.

There is very little I can say which reflects positively on the unit after 7 months of use, I have found almost every aspect of this phone to be unacceptable by any quality standards.Build quality:The assembly on my phone is poor. The metal brackets that hold the rear case on are crooked, resulting in a phone that does not have uniform thickness and does not seat properly in cases.Screen:The screen is easily the best part of this phone. It's high resolution, sharp, and delivers reasonable color quality and performance. Please note that it is unreadable while wearing sunglasses and difficult to see in bright sunlight.Bluetooth:It's terrible. My unit receives large amounts of interference when connected to Bluetooth devices that was not apparent on other phones I have owned (with the same accessories).Reception:Mixed. Service bars do not reflect your ability to hold calls on the phone. Calls may be dropped with 2 service bars due to lost signal, while the phone can continue to talk in an elevator with only one bar (usually a surefire time for calls to drop with other phones). The phone does not do a good job pulling in a strong WiFi signal (it does not receive full service unless you are within 2m of a router) and delivers only so-so speeds over WiFi in general.System Software:Don't expect the fingerprint scanner to work. It's only recognized sometimes and it's completely tied to software. The exclusion of the scanner in the Atrix 2 shows that Motorola was unhappy with their ability to support it.Overall, the phone is extraordinarily slow. Sensitivity in the gyroscope is awful and it can take several seconds to switch rotations. Apps take a while to load and the phone will get bogged down quickly (despite having minimal software installed).Stability is poor, the phone will restart itself randomly during regular use. Startup is nice and slow so don't worry about continuing calls quickly.Input support is sketchy and not well thought out. You will frequently encounter dialogues or keyboards that do not have important buttons to complete basic functions like 'send your message' or 'go to next field'. Don't worry, you can retrieve your navigation ability by flipping your phone and waiting 3 seconds for the screen orientation to switch itself. And enjoy those special moments when your keyboard panel comes up and reads 'Input Device' instead of actually showing a keyboard.Corporate Sync functions:So poor it deserves its own section. Create a contact on your phone in your corporate sync account. Go to your account on another machine and see if it appeared. It's anyone's guess if it'll transfer, more often than not it won't though. This is very useful when your phone crashes or needs to be reset, as you'll lose contacts randomly. Transferring contacts via your SIM or Micro SD card is no more reliable. Have fun with setup as well, the inconsistent support extends to your calendar and all other accounts. Some apps might sync while others don't, and the device setup is inconsistent across units. That's right, what works for your corporate network on one phone may not work when set up EXACTLY THE SAME WAY with a second phone.Stock software:The music player is unusable. It will start playing randomly when the phone's asleep or when you hang up a call, and frequently crashes after playing 1-2 songs. It cannot play more than one album at a time and seems to interfere with other music apps that are downloaded. It's best to never open it and uninstall it once you get the phone.The stock browser does not compare favorably to a desktop browser in terms of speed, load times are better than on Windows Phone 6.5 but pale in comparison to a 768k DSL connection. Flash loads slowly and is difficult to navigate with touch, its support seems irrelevant to the device now that it's discontinued.Battery performance:Turn off background syncing and it's great with 2-3 days of light use. Allow just the stock apps to sync in the background and you're talking 5 hours of idle time, 2-3 hours if you're using the device. So turn off all background syncing but your corporate email for regular use.Overall, I could never recommend this phone to anyone. I don't know if I would ever buy a similar unit after the terrible experience I've had with this phone, a flip phone would be more reliable.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dont purchase from WorldWide Distributors", "Author": "Loquillo", "ReviewID": "R1Z8B1GZD1OHS7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It doesnt seem like this phone is origional.

Voice quality is sharp and crisp. Video and picture quality is great as promised. I like this phone set.The Biggest ConsThe biggest problem that I found about Motorola Atrix 4G is that it is a battery hogger. The battery life for this phone is terrible. It doesn't even last me one whole day completely even if I have almost all my background applications, my WiFi, and data turned off.Another major problem that I have to point out about this phone is that it heats up really fast and really hot. I found I Phone 4 providing a better battery performance than Atrix. I fear if this goes on, then I might have to return the phone set.Overall, it is a good phone. Efficient and effective.

The screen is very clear and the form factor is pleasing. Most of the time it works very nicely. I really liked it at first...But the software apps and the Android OS they run on has been plagued with problems from the beginning. My biggest irritation is when it locks up or reboots itself while playing music. A recent OS upgrade fixed much of this problem, but it still happens on occasion. It has all kinds of little glitches I don't have to deal with in my iPad.One big irritation is responsiveness to the touch screen. There are times you touch a button on the screen several times and it does nothing. Very annoying. This virtually *NEVER* happens on my iPad. And believe me, I'm not a religious nut about Apple products.iPad apps are more professional looking and more importantly seem to work much more reliably. I've had several Android apps get 'confused' and have to exit them and start over.I've updated the OS whenever possible. I've upgraded the flash memory. I've taken to rebooting the phone almost daily. I've used multiple bluetooth accessories for music playback. Still the buggy problems persist.As I said, I really wanted to like this phone. I didn't get the newest iPhone because the 4s didn't offer 4G speed and I think it is overpriced. And I wanted to give Android a chance. When my Atrix works, I do like it. But I don't have to put up with these problems with my iPad, and I'm guessing the iPhone will be the same.When the next iPhone comes out, this Atrix is headed for the garbage can.Right after I smash it with a hammer.This was my first and will be my last Motorola phone.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Working", "Author": "Angry Atrix", "ReviewID": "RA59KRQRD9Y7D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is sold as unlocked, I live in Zimbabwe and like to keep as up to date on tech as possible.

Also the Android app killer wont kill your browser you have to go into manage apps and force close to stop the browser from killing your battery.WASTE OF $600. Buy one of the more popular DROID phones. You don't want this.In hindsight, I had a AT&T; Sharp FX (Flo TV) phone before this. I paid over $150 for that phone brand new. SIX MONTHS LATER AT&T; MADE THEM A NEW CONTRACT FREE PHONE. My Sharp FX is only worth $12 now. So lets make this an intelligent thought. $12 x 100% = 1200/$150 = 8%... My Sharp FX is worth 8 percent of its original value. So in one year my Motorola Atrix MIGHT be worth only 8 percent of its original value... so $48. NOT WORTH BUYING.UPDATE 14 September 2012.Had this phone for about a year. It was in the otter box the other week when I dropped it. The screen shattered. I took it to AT&T; and the phone replacement is $125 so im just going to wait for my upgrade because that will be cheaper than replacing this piece of crap. Now the charger port has gotten loose and the phone will not charge overnight. Now that it isnt holding a charge it also died, and wont charge up again. it just sits there blinking the green light at me.
