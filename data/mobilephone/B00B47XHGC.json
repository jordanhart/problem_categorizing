I did some research online, watched some reviews on this phone and I got everything I expected except the phone charger cable.  I was really disappointing and so I had to order a cable separately. Other then that, everything's fine, the phone looks nice, and even had some extra juice for me to turn it on without charging. The UI looks a bit complicated for flip phones, but hey :) It's Japan. Would rate 5/5, fast delivery, safe packaging and all.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "arrived perfect", "Author": "antonio", "ReviewID": "R1DGAMFMCYDHCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i loveeee this phone. works perfect, only bad thing is that it does not include charger or microo sd card", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Available from US sellers\nMulti Color Notification Lights / Eco-Modes to conserve battery life and also a new one touch Bright mode, when in dark areas\n5 Megapixel HD Camera (1932 \u00d7 2576 pixels max picture taking resolution)\nHD Video Recording (1280 \u00d7 720 video capture in 720P resolution)\nGSM GPRS EDGE  850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz.
