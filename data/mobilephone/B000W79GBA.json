I haven't really gotten any real use out of the phone.  But what I have to say about it is, is it is a super design!  It is sleek.  The bluetooth works like a charm--easy to use.  The phone came with a 2 year old battery--bummer, but I bought a new one and now it is humming right along!", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Motorola RAZR V3 GSM Mobile Camera Phone (Silver)", "Author": "Robin Grepo", "ReviewID": "R3CZNFN4SKPD0M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this used through Amazon but the phone has many problems! Half the time you can't hear the person calling you and you're forced to call them back. Also, it is a model that doesn't have the \"Favorite Five\" display, so you are forced to call customer service to set up and/or change your favorite five. Also, when using blue tooth earpiece and then you remove the earpiece from the phone, the phone then stops working (you can't hear anything or call anyone) unless the blue tooth is constantly plugged in. Not the greatest choice of phone!", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "RAZR V3", "Author": "Mark F.

It's very user friendly, and all of the function keys are conveniently placed on the handset.I have nothing but positive praise for this phone.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Motorola RAZR V3 GSM Mobile Camera Phone (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31MAEmvXMeL.jpg", "ProductID": "B000W79GBA"}}
