{"Reviews": [{"Title": "3 Reasons why the Xperia is better than the Iphone", "Author": "N. Sanchez \"ALeX\"", "ReviewID": "R2IPTQFQJ63O8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After trying out various phones such as the iphone 3g, and blackberry tour I fell in love with this phone.Let me start out by saying that I liked the phone using the touchscreen so much that I felt like I didn't really need the keypad anymore which is a bummer. So yes the touch screen is very easy to use that not even the keyboard, which is the reason I bought it, is that useful. At times when you are writing a long text to write direction sure that can be very useful, but other than that the touch screen keyboard does a great job of saying your playful texts, invitations to your house party, or hellos. So it depends how much you are going to type. For right now I'm not sure whether it would've been worth getting the mini not this pro because its a little smaller and the touch screen works nice.Reason I got this phone over the Iphone 3GNow the reason I didn't like the iphone 3g is the qwerty touchscreen. After using a blackberry there was no way the iphone was easier to touch than the blackberry, because you don't get feedback. Some people like using the iphone keypad but who knows if they have used other phones. This is why I got this phone. This phone has a nice keyboard, and touchscreen. You get two worlds here. But like I said the touchscreen worked so nice even though this just has T9 keypad on the screen it works flawlesslyAlso after having the iphone what I liked about this phone much better is the ease of use. The iphone 3g is many times slower than this phone. However I'm not sure about the 3Gs it isn't the reason why I didn't like the iphone its just because of the keypad.Sound QualityThere isn't much to be said here. The quality sound much more fuller than the Iphone by far. So if you want to jam some music loud this is for you.Stand outMany people already have the iphone, those mytouches, the first thing I thought when I got the phone is this is going to stand out since it is many times smaller than your average phone, yet it does everything, well almost since there are some applications that don't work with this phone but I haven't encountered any that don't. You still have your common apps that work such as facebook. In the end this phone does not have that generic look many phones have, and is very stylish.CameraHands down to this phone compared to the iphone 3g. This is just as good as the camera on the Iphone 4 why pay more?QualityAnd to be really honest with you as far as the quality goes this really owns apple products. To me I think apple just raises prices to create a demand for the Iphone. For example the Iphone 4 has the same mega pixel camera as this phone does. And there are other phones that surpass the quality of the iphone 4 camera such as some other Sony Ericsson phones and droid phones. Just the look, feel and smell ;) is a winner for me. Guys this is Sony.True Unlocked phoneThere really isn't anything left to be said here.Data PlanThe Iphone requires a 30$ data plan from t-mobile to use the internet. This I can just use the basic 5 dollar a month internet and get 3g speeds.*Update actually I'm sorry guys but unfortunately I was misinformed. You would have to get the expensive data plan not just the simple internet fee.ComparableAnd some might say oh my gosh how dare you compare this to an iphone. The iphone has well there really isn't anything better unless you want to use imovie, or I don't know like that bigger screen then I don't know why you would prefer the iphone. And still this isn't a who has the bigger screen contest, there is the Samsung galaxy if you want a huge screen. The reason I didn't like it is because the touchscreen wasn't that responsive, and texting was actually hard to use.Wow factorI'm really surprised that this phone is not more popular. This fun is a very fun phone to use and to have around. I highly recommend this phone.And I'm not going to lie its hard to type on any iPhone whether its 4g, or 3g. There is just no feedback on the iPhones. Maybe if the iPhones make it easier to type like the android phones then just maybe I would switch but then again the iPhones are delicate phones, and they are expensive. So really I have been very satisfied with this phone, and I've had this for already about 6 months.Thank You Sony for giving me a phone that texts, and is easy to use.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't actually keep it", "Author": "O.

I do NOT have a data plan since I bought it to replace the POJ phone that my employer gave me.  This is a VERY small Android phone.  I have found that the small screen combined with the keyboard is a winning format.  Trying to type with the on screen keyboard is impossible.Pro: Small size, nice little keyboard, good (but not awesome) performance.  Supports 16gb SD card, good quality screen, good voice quality, speaker phone is nice and loud, good WiFi performance, nicely responsive touchscreen, generally quality feel.Con: stuck with Android 2.1 (not addressing custom roms), no flash support, screen is quite small, battery longevity (keep wireless off and it's much better), sometimes keyboard is squeaky for some reason, screen does wash out in bright light.Overview: I'm quite happy with this phone.  I use it in conjunction with my HP Touchpad so I don't need to carry a massive phone.  I'm a total fan of this little phone.  Just to reiterate.

I am very pleased with this phone. For the performance and features it must be one of the best. Everything works quite well and I defer to the other positive reviews. It is not perfect but I can live with the minor flaws I've encountered. These are: force close issues when opening a draft message, accidentally tapping the language button during texting, overly sensitive screen when web browsing, no camera zoom, camera shot sound has disappeared (even after a reset), sometimes all audible tones disappear but can be restored using the reset feature (without losing your data).I have dropped this phone, it has slipped out of my shirt pocket into a pond, and it has been splashed with salt water. It has recovered fully in all cases. I did have to use a needle and dielectric grease to restore the data connection terminal after the salt water incident.The keypad is somewhat cramped but if your fingers aren't overly large you'll be fine. Love the wifi and option to have data service plan when I need it (ATT).All considering a great phone! So good I just bought my daughter the sk17a model and she loves it.

Waters", "ReviewID": "R1QIRCBJ5QNGMN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the pleasure of owning this phone for over a year.  I am currently ordering a replacement digitizer so that I can continue to get life out of this phone.  When I had searched for a Phone, I was looking for small size, physical qwerty, 5+ camera and touch screen.  This phone fit all of this perfectly.  I have been able to get a lot of use out of this phone both in the states and outside.  I have never had any major issues with the phone, it still slides perfectly as the day I bought it.  I've put this through a lot of abuse over the year and it keeps on trucking.So if you are looking for a few simple things in a phone and don't want a 4\" brick in your pocket, this or it's follow up the SK17a would be a great choice.I will mention that I do not have a data plan, most places now have wifi and I have separate navigation because I don't want to carry around a 4\" phone just to use my navigation once a year.  I just really don't need to stay connected to people that often when I'm not around some wifi anyway.  Texting works just great for those places where there is no wifi.What do I like:-size, the 2.5 screen is designed well and fits perfect into your hand-takes great pictures if you aren't looking for 1500$ camera pictures-the well thought out physical qwerty, I rarely need keys that aren't already there-the microSD slot, don't have to upgrade my phone because I want more space-**plug and play ability for music, I'm constantly adding/taking away music with just sliding folders over, no extra software-built in stand for standing the phone on its side, you'd be surprised how often you use it when its there.-gmail sync-google voiceWhat I don't like:-This phone can be very sluggish at times especially when texting quite a bit-**referring to the ease of adding music which I like, the music player is terrible for setting up playlists and the software makes it so you have to sync up your library again and its just a hassle, if you use iTunes, get doubleTwist and save yourself some headaches-you only get 4 options on the main screen, choose wisely-my contacts and calls are in two separate programs, taking up two of my four spots when they could easily take up one. I could have just the one for calls but I do use the contacts enough that I don't like having to go down a page and then click, its not essential but it is annoying for how I use this phone.-battery battery battery... it's life is terrible, keep the chargers (yea you are going to need at least 2) very close if you talk on the phone a lot-moving icons around is a nightmare at times, I imagine this can happen on any phone but the compact screen makes for an extra fun nightmare-DO NOT even turn this phone on without a screen protector, don't get me wrong the phone can take a beating but the screen scratches very easily, seriously admire it from inside the wrapping until you have a clean room and a screen protector to put on it.-The texting screen is a bit cramped with a huge box for language at the bottom that is just unnecessary and the whole contact coming down randomly from the top, you are lucky to get two lines of text in between them.In conclusion I will say that I enjoy this phone very much even with all of its quirks and I will likely look into getting the SK17a or something similar after this phone has run its course.  I think that the phones of today have gotten too big for their use and I really like using my phone for just that, a phone.  It's not a TV or a video console so lets not try to turn something into something it is not.  It boils down to use and while I do wish this phone had better battery life, be less sluggish (faster processor) and a bit better design of the OS, I believe the SK17a has resolved all of these issues.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "The worst phone I've ever had", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R3CKZSWAXJMRO2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Only 1 month of life, thats was the period of time I can used it without any problem, one day suddenly, the phone turned it off by itself and no matter what I tried, It never reignited again.
