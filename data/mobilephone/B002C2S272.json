{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Win Mobile done right!", "Author": "M. Chester", "ReviewID": "R2LSQKRW5UBND6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using this device via an Executive trial courtesy of Verizon Wireless. First things first, it is 3G using a VzW SIM card. Not sure how available the SIM cards are, I am just reporting what I see when I looked under the \"hood\". It came with a local (for me) phone number which makes the SIM card all the more impressive. This is a US based demo unit hopefully, signs of things to come for VzW. On to the hardware.Windows Mobile is often found to be lacking when compared to the iPhone. Is this an iPhone killer? Yes, if you are a Win Mobile devotee. Things that have been a struggle in the past, the virtual keyboard are finally done right. Letter selection is confirmed with a gentle vibration while the selected letter zooms out. When using the browser or addressing email the virtual keyboard adds a .com button to save a you few keystrokes. Not convinced that a virtual keyboard is the best way to type, use the QWERTY keyboard that slides, and yes tilts on the device. Want to watch your favorite You-Tube video, the 3G speed coupled with the super high resolution screen offer a winning combination for doing just that.  Email, texting  no worries, the HTC Touch Flo interface offers elegant ways for you to read and send messages on the device. Want to take pictures? No worries as this device comes with an adequate 3.2 Megapixel camera. Do you want your contact book to be linked to Facebook? The software on the device provides this integration.Other nice touches abound on the device. Web browsing for example is provided by either Opera or Pocket IE. The Opera browser stands head and shoulders above Pocket Explorer. The browser is easy to use and while you can't zoom by \"pinching\" the screen, you can zoom by rolling your finger across the bottom of the screen. The phone itself presents a minimum number of buttons on the device, making it easy for one handed operation. The device is most intuitive to use proven by the fact that my demo came without a user guide or prerequisite install CD. Despite this missing documentation I was able to get up and running in no time.A perfect Smartphone, no but then neither are any of the other 20 or so that I have used in the past 2 years. For example, it is certainly a bit beefy. In fact when compared to the Omnia Touch that I currently use, this phone is easily twice the weight and thickness. Would I buy it to use as my everyday phone...a resounding yes. Win Mobile is the OS I need to use based upon software requirements at my job. Of the Win Mobile devices I have used in the past this one is hands down the best.Now if I could only figure out how to keep this device after the demo period...", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "The closest VZW customers will get to the iPhone", "Author": "Dave W.", "ReviewID": "R84LDFVPLCGX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I apologize for the wall of text, but it'd be great if VZW's review form took carriage returns.If you had been holding out for an iPhone on VZW, then it's time to give up the ghost and get this phone or it's keyboard-less twin the Imagio (out on Oct. 6th). HTC really made a great phone here in the TP2. It's easy to use, functional and gives all the bells and whistles you'd imagine out of a smart phone. Here's the important points. It should be noted I am a power user who does not use this phone for business needs.Design - The phone is pretty big, but it needs to be to accommodate the large screen and keyboard. Likely one of the heavier phones out there, so if you're looking for a small phone, this isn't it. However, it's not so big that it won't fit comfortably in your pocket. The only negative here is the button placement, specifically having Delete where Enter should be and the Sleep button in an all-too-easily pressed location when the keyboard is open.Screen: Big wow factor here. The screen is bigger than the iPhone (!). Extremely high mobile resolution (800x480) too. The touch part of it is good, but a capacitive screen would have better. However, it's not something that will ever interfere with your daily use. I have never used and never had a need for the stylus after one week of use. The zoom slider under the screen is also a pretty neat addition.Call Quality: No complaints. Calls sound clear and no dropped calls (which is why you stay on VZW and don't leave - ever). The phone has some nice features - put the phone face down on a call and the speakerphone turns on; pull it away from your ear and the screen turns back on. Clever. I can't tell you how many times I'd adjust the volume on my Voyager just to get the screen back on.Connectivity: EV-DO is zippy and the Wi-Fi links up to your wireless without a hitch. Bluetooth is solid, tested with stereo headphones, it has gone off without a hitch. It's also nice that this is a GSM worldphone too. Just be sure to set it to CDMA only as soon as you get it, to save battery life.Battery Life: It's typical smartphone - charge a day. Highly recommended to turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not using it. I get a 24 hours a charge and make it a nightly ritual to plug it in. If you can't get used to this, then this phone isn't for you.Interface: I hear a lot of gripes about WinMo 6.1. The good thing is, I can't say that I've experienced them due to the included Touch Flo 3D shell. It's great. Really increases ease of use exponentially.  It's a good way to have WinMo's awesome customizability while still having a slick interface. Also, Office Mobile is standard and really nice to have.Web Browsing: Opera is sick. I love it. Never open IE Mobile. NEVER! Stick to Opera and you will basically have your PC on your phone. I may download Skyfire, as it has flash/ajax support when Opera doesn't, but for now, I'm content with Opera. The phone never chugs with browsing, even on image heavy sites. Definitely a big plus.Audio/Video: The music player is so trying to be the iPhone and it does a good job of replicating it. No complaints here (also nice to be able to listen to music and do anything else with next to no lag!). The video player is WMP by default, but it's too short sighted to be useful. DivX Mobile works great in its place.Price: Right now, the deal VZW is offering, plus the rebate, make this phone a steal. With NE2, the promo discount and the rebate, you'll pay <$[...] for this phone. Insane.Other: GPS IS UNLOCKED! Shockingly, VZW let this happen and now you can ditch Navigator and get Google Maps. The GPS does need some tweaking to get working right, but when it does, it's pretty spot on.In the end, this phone has everything I wanted and it does it well. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to jump into smartphones as a non-business casual or power user.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "We're gonna need a bigger belt", "Author": "MrMike", "ReviewID": "R3BRDZW24JBEWQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read all the reviews here so i got this phone (HTC Touch Pro 2 Verizon).  I'm really disappointed and writing this to help others not make the same mistake as me.  I've only had this phone 3 weeks and i'm returning it within my 30 day warranty period, i cann't go on with this phone; i just can't take it anymore and ordered an HTC Ozone to replace this 'brick'.A little about me: I started a long time ago with Handspring Visor, then Edge, Palm Treo, Blackberry (BB) Curve, Blackberry Bold now the HTC TP2.Here's the executive summary: If you are coming from a BB, do not get this phone you will be very disappointed. If you're thinking about trying out a 'touch' device and this is your first step towards that, don't... i know it has a slide out keyboard and it's great but the software hangs going in & out of landscape and portrait display and the touch flo is quirky & slow when the memory ususage creeps up (see Con below).Yesterday i was holding the TP2 thinking all this technology and this thing weighs a ton and the battery life still stinks.  I know nothing compares to a Blackberry for battery life (4-5 days when in use) but one day is really unacceptable.  Oh, and don't think you will use this thing with one-hand; after a few emails you'll feel the pain.Pros:  Full of features and coming from ATT the Verizon network is so much faster (i'm in SF Bay Area, CA).  Slide out keyboard is nice & layout is efficient.  I like how it verbally announces appointments and high priority emails but be careful what you put in your calendar... you might now want it announcing you're personal business.Cons:  Weight, this is something you will not get over.  I put this in my pocket and it's a serious 'tug'... i feel it!  walking around it looks like i'm happy to see you... this thing is big, don't be fooled.- When on a call, it is too easy to end the call and accidentally start to conference in another contact and you can't back out.- Memory leak - i find that memory usuage creeps up quickly and the device slows down (i recommend soft resets 2x per week.  To me this is unacceptable).- The 'mute' button does not always work... it will say you are muted when you are not; very embarassing on conference calls.  I called my rep at work and she said i'm not the first person to complain of this.- Can't modify set up of home screen; you will always see \"time\", \"call history\" and \"calendar\".- GPS is horrible.  I downloaded Google Maps and 'my location' is 3.5miles from me (useless)... don't even think about using it for Golf GPS. As a compare i put my iPod Touch next to it with Google Maps and 'my location' is about 10' from me.I really don't know what peopl love about this phone except maybe the feature set but c'mon people... it's 2010 this phone should not weigh more than a phone from 5 years ago.  I feel like it should have a cord to a battery pack with a handle (remember those????)Sorry if this sounds like a rant, it's not.. just don't get sucked into getting this phone, there are so many better choices out there.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible experience, probably due to Win Mobile", "Author": "Dr. Leibnitz", "ReviewID": "RL187SPLPTGI0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone itself is not bad.

I'm on Verizon.  I have had this phone for 10 months so I can give a very honest review of it.  My experience with this phone has been deeply underwhelming and disappointing.The design of this phone is spectacular.  I don't mind the heft of it at all.  It's well laid out and well appointed.  Bar none, the best speaker phone of any phone I have ever had.  The screen layout of this HTC phone is sensible and I was overall pleased with it.But the overall performance of this phone is slow, slow, slow and then finally, slow.  The internet browsing on this phone is deeply unsatisfying and slow.  This phone's heartbreaking downfall, and it's a mighty one, is WinMo.  In one word WinMo is truly awful.  It's clunky, and again, SLOW and provides a very convoluted and deeply underwhelming user experience.  I simply don't understand how consumers can say they love WinMo.My colleagues have switched over to Android to get away from WinMo.  So a couple of weeks ago, I took a trip to Verizon to look at other smartphones.  I simply can't take the HTC Pro2 or more specifically, WinMo any longer.  I really do need a smartphone that is highly functional and performs at a decent speed.  I took a look at the HTC Incredible and I was floored; actually I was stupefied.  It's highly functional and fast as hell.  I spent about a half hour going over everything on the HTC Incredible and decided right then and there to pay full retail for the phone.  It arrives in August.The HTC Pro2 is a handsome phone and well designed (and the only reason I give it 1 star) however with WinMo, this phone is an absolute mess.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great phone although at a steep price", "Author": "Boris M.

Really annoying. Hopefully sprint will let you download a tweak for that)-The power button is at a very bad spot. (almost impossible to not press it a million times in your pocket while walking or any motion, unless you buy an upright pouch)-Sprint back design is not only bad but is destructive how after two months those pores in the back fill up with dirt. (I can't imagine they actually pay someone to design this crap)-HTC should have given it a scroll wheel. AND the scroll wheel should have doubled as shutter button in camera mode.

My Q, at just over 4 ounces, seemed quite svelte compared to this thick, heavy phone.  When I unboxed it (it was online only, so I didn't get a chance to hold it in the store), I thought that might take some getting used to, but if it was a great phone it would be well worth it.I used it for over four weeks and still had issues.  I hadn't dropped it yet, but I dreaded that day (it will come) since it was so heavy that I knew bad things would happen if dropped on a hard surface.The good - nice screen, great syncing with my PC and a easy bluetooth pairing (at least compared to my now-dated Moto Q).  I also like the \"favorites\" section of the contacts, where you keep your top 10 friends.  The RSS Hub was also pretty slick.  As was adding photos to contacts.  The slide out keyboard is large, but I made a lot of mistakes using it (much more than on my Q).  Call quality was good, but I was never able to voice-dial through my bluetooth headset.  It may have been the headset (which still works well with my Q).The bad - large (thick), heavy, WinMo 6.1, not very intuitive.  I never got Media Player to play correctly.  I also downloaded the software to enable the FM radio included, but I never got the radio to work.  That would have come in handy at the health club, where the TV audio is broadcast on FM.  And there isn't a quick way to turn the phone to silent mode (at least compared to my Q).I ended up returning the phone after 31 days of use.  After 4+ weeks, I was still struggling to complete tasks that should have been second nature by that time.  I didn't see enough benefit to justify the heaviness of the phone.

When answering the phone, I often end up accidentally putting the phone into some undesired state and finding it impossible to navigate to where I need to be because the screen can receive unintended commands so easily.  And I use the screen lock!  Battery life is poor so I got an double size battery.  I use it with WM WifiRouter which works well and I carry an IPOD Touch - which uses the WiFi link - to make up for the unbearable browser in the HTC.  Email is ok.  But inefficient for sending internal emails.  Not nearly as quick and efficient as BB. Voice recognition is pretty decent.  VZNavigator is slow to load, but runs well once it is working.  It is possible, with effort, to get google maps to work on the VZ version and it works nicely once you get it running.

I have been cheated by sending a HTC tilt instead of HTC TOUCH PRO 2, and  its not even a small purchase that i can forget about. Its 500$, hard earned money. Such a cheat. and now i cant even return it back to them as i am out of country. It would cost me 200$ more to do so. And i already informed amazon that i was leaving the country, inspite of that or may be BECAUSE of that, they have cheated me. CHEATERS.

The screen is incredibly nice. Internet surfing with 3G is great. Youtube application built in is fabulous. Drawback is the camera. It takes really pretty poor pictures. If it took pictures like other camera phones I would give this phone 5 stars. I had replaced my HTC T-mobile Wing with this phone. Even though the wing was only a 2 megapixel, and this phone is a 3 megapixel the performance is really poor. The ISO and brightness adjustments simply do not function at all. I have had a bunch of emails to HTC and they say the changes are subtle. They are not subtle, they do nothing. I had taken some sunset photos with my Wing and the colors were vibrant. With the Touch Pro 2 they are all washed out, no matter how I adjust the settings. I love taking photos and know a bit about photography. The camera performance is just heart-breaking on this phone. As far as I can figure, the camera makes no adjustments for exposure at all. I think it could be fixed in software, but HTC customer service just says the phone operates as designed and they won't even report the problem.If a camera in a phone is important to you buy something else. Probably anything else would be better", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "WORST PHONE EVER", "Author": "louis \"unapologetic fan of good tv\"", "ReviewID": "R3KGE8W8S8L8L3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "you pick it up and its like a stone, which would be ok if all of that extra bulk included battery life or storage, but no- this phone is ALWAYS about to run out of power and ALWAYS about to run out of space.the touch response is like an itouch on drugs and not the good ones. no matter where you put your finger, be sure it will click the most annoying button possible.proprietary crap makes it a step even worse as you type in a url only to go through sprint's portal and not the site you thought you were going to.you will always be turning the volume down or off and missing that important call (if the phone hasnt died)you will always be missing that crucial text (because the phone is, no matter what you do, always out of space)photo quality is awful. absolutely dreadful, but dont worry becasue it doesnt hold so many photos anyway. extra card you say? got one. still out of space.and then there's the \"adjust stylus\" loop where if you press a wrong button (which you will do more than press the right one) you have to tap the screen on various exes. there is no way out of this nightmare and no way to enjoy this phone.try to plug the phnone into your computer using the usb provided? good luck with that. it doesnt work properly.i cant imagine loading music on this thing anyway, frankly, it DOESNT STAY ALIVE long enough to be of use. this experience means i will never go near sprint or htc again no matter what.worse phone ever produced. these people should be carted off to prison.dont care about my contract. i am going to take a hammer to it and get an iphone. att cannot possibly be as bad.oh yeah and dropped calls. dropped calls all around. no matter where. no matter what. no matter how when or why.screw this phone", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't buy the Euro/Singapore  T7373 version!!!", "Author": "Len \"grad student\"", "ReviewID": "R14P5IDPX70BP1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok, so I couldn't wait to have the phone, so I jumped the gun and got the Euro/Singapore version.
