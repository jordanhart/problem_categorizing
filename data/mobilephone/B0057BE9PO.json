{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First impressions", "Author": "mbinebri", "ReviewID": "RDOMWKPDOBYHZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If I could, I would have rated it 3.5.  The Theory is an impressive looking phone with a nice screen and an easy-to-use QWERTY keyboard, although the Call and End keys are awkwardly placed and sized.  Calls are nice and clear, and my reception and data speeds (2.5G) are pretty good considering I'm on the very edge of Boost's coverage.  Battery life is better than I expected too.  However, there are several drawbacks.  The web browser is bad.  It's ugly, every page you view has a heavily pixelated advertisement at the top, and you get a bare-bones rendering of any website you go to.  I would highly recommend downloading Opera Mini and using that as your browser instead.  The camera also leaves much to be desired.  Even at the Theory's highest resolution, photos are small and of poor quality when you get them onto a computer (USB cable is not supplied); I frequently have to override the white balance \"auto\" setting to get proper color correction; photos are often overexposed--even indoors with the exposure at -2--and there's no flash.  Without a video camera and music player, this is a poor multimedia phone.  If you just want to text/talk/surf (through Mini) on a phone that has that Blackberry style, it's a worthwhile buy, but only through Boost: the Theory is definitely not a phone you would want to get locked into a contract for, unless you were getting it for free.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Phone", "Author": "KSHORT", "ReviewID": "R6LATC3HVR3XJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my phone at Target but I still wanted to leave a review. I am sure there are others who use amazon reviews for new products whether they purchase through amazon or not.I have had this phone for about 2 weeks now and I am pretty happy with it so far. I downgraded a little. I was first using a Samsung Gravity Touch and then a HTC HD2 (which is what I was using when I ditched the contract and got the Theory). I thought I would miss the features of my touch screen phone but I actually don't. I am personally happy to leave the pressure of using an advanced, trendy phone behind and to go back to something basic.This phone has no music player feature which is ok with me. I carry a mp3 player with me all the time anyway. But the camera is POOR. I like to take a lot of pictures and upload them to Facebook so this is a bit of a set back. I know have to carry my camera with me if I want decent pictures.Also...although I can text easily (even with having large hands and fingers), I can't text much in one text. Maybe there is a way to get around this but each text only allows 160 characters which limits you if you tend to send long thoughts in a text as I do.Other than that, I am pleased with the phone. The browser was not that great either but I download Opera Mini and it has improved.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yay!", "Author": "Rice", "ReviewID": "R3SBFSFJKCI7PU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my phone today and I'm liking it alot more that any other boost phone I've had.

The calls are nice and clear. Its very user friendly. Not much in the way of selection for ring tones and no micro sd slot. The camera is great if you are outside and have lots of light. If you don't it is horrible and dark. I also don't like that it doesn't automatically start another page of text when you reach the maximum 160 characters. Also you can't respond to emails through the preset location for email and im. You have to set up your email through the internet and save the page as a favorites in order to respond. Because of this you are not alerted when you receive an email.All that being said it was still a functioning phone. Nothing fancy. After four months of use during a phone call my ear piece speaker went out. Zip, nada, zero, no sound at all. DURING A CONVERSATION! If I am going to talk to someone on the phone I have to remember to either answer the call through the speaker phone or turn the speaker phone on before dialing or I am listening to air.Oh and another complaint. The battery life stinks. I sometimes am down to yellow one bar battery by one in the afternoon. I don't even turn my phone on most days until 10 to 10:30. I am not in any way abusive to my phone. I set it down, not thrown or dropped onto the counter or coffee table. I only plug it in when the battery is low. I realize I am odd in that I turn it off every night too! So I was very upset that my speaker went out and the battery is sucking the life out of itself so quickly.My husband has the same phone and had it for one day longer then me. He works in a place that is very dusty and dirty with dry chemical ingredients flying about and his phone works okay. Though his battery life is beginning to decrease rapidly in just the last week or two.So I guess if you need a phone for just a few months until you can get the Samsung Prevail or the BlackBerry, then this one seems to be fine. But four months seems to be its limits.Boost service is fantastic though! We left T-mobile to save money and didn't loose any of the service that we had with them when we switched over. So very pleased with Boost service.

The screen went white after it fell from the sofa to the carpeted floor. A common occurrence for most of us. I had hoped to use this one as a backup phone.The keys are really small, the sound was tinny, the backplate fell off all the time. The battery ran low frequently. It was built like a cheap Dollar Tree toy.  I am glad this phone went dead as I made a mistake when I bought it. Here I am, back online looking for another phone, nothing fancy.

I stuck with the phones that were currently available for my Boost plan as a choice.It's nice for a prepaid phone. It's a slightly heavy. It has a datebook, alarm clock, calculator, notepad. Since I haven't been able to easily remove the plastic off the lens, I haven't tested the picture quality of the phone. The keys on the phone feel like small bubbles which can be irritating. There isn't a num/cap lock on this keyboard.  But there is a ALT and arrow up with a dash over it as it's equivalent. There isn't a SIMS card.The transition from the Rambler to the Theory was seamless with Boost automated system.

Turns out that's all it's good for, theory, as far as Motorola tech people are concerned. They suck at providing sound tech advice on their own product.  You'd think they should know that there is no way to connect the Theory to a PC either with bluetooth or data cable.  It cost me over $50 to get their Motorola Tool kit, which they recommended as a solution for getting access to my contact and text messages, not to mention photos (as poor as they are!), on a PC.  Only after installing and reporting back to them that the tool does not seem to recognize Theory did they figure out that there's no way to connect Theory to a PC.  Worse still, they would not refund me even though they told me to buy it!.  Each time I called I get a different recommendation from Motorola technicians.  Needless to say, this is my last Motorola phone!
