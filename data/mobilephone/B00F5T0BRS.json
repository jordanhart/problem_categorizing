I looked everywhere for a simple device (easy for someone to function) that vibrated on calls. Yet the market on wearable tech was not great and most were bulky thick watches at best. So the function here works properly.Pros:Vibrates on callVibrates on a set distance away from phoneHas Time and battery displayDisplay's call number, heard that some phone's may display caller name.Cons:Can vibrate at odd timesloss of time. not very good clock programming.loss of signal that will cut Bluetooth linking (too be expected)May be difficult to pair devices (would of liked a separate button just for pairing.)Not water proof.anyways, not great and I never expected a miracle to happen but bottom line, it was very much needed.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F5T0BRS"}}
