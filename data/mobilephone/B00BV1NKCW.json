{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone, Incredible Performance, Not Perfect", "Author": "R. Garrelts", "ReviewID": "RZ6G946NNM0TI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently decided to ditch Verizon and my contract with them and go with a no-contract carrier. At the same time I decided to upgrade my phone (Motorola Droid X2) and after comparing many different options settled on the Samsung Galaxy S4. Before switching to Android in 2010 I was an iPhone owner so I will also try to give my perspective on that end here.--------------------Initial Impressions:The S4 is a really nice piece of hardware. Aesthetically it is light-years ahead of my old Droid. My wife settled on a white S4 which is very clearly inspired by Apple's consumer electronics design philosophy. I settled on the 'black mist' phone and it's equally impressive though a bit more rugged looking. The screen is huge and incredibly clear. In comparing the S4 to the S2-Note the phones aren't that different in terms of dimensions. Though the phone is large it is very slim and fits easily and comfortably in my pants pocket.--------------------Specifications:As I mentioned the S4 is a large phone due in no small part to the 5\" screen. The exact measurements are: 136.6(l) x 69.8(w) x 7.9(h) mm. For being packed with technology the phone is a svelte 4.6 ounces or 130 grams.The screen features 441ppi, 1080p resolution (1920x1080) and is a wonder to behold. App tiles, widgets, images and video are crisp, clear and instantly made my previous phone seem incredibly antiquated.The processor comes in two different flavors. My phone comes with the 1.6GHz, Octa-core processor though a 1.9GHz Quad-core processor is also available. The S4 features 2Gb of RAM. Memory comes in at either 16/32/64Gb built-in and expandable via MicroSD. The S4 accepts up to a 64Gb MicroSD card.--------------------Operating System & Hardware:If you're an Android fan (and I am) then Jelly Bean (v.4.2.2) is really a nice evolution from Ice Cream Sandwich and previous Android versions. I won't launch into a full-fledged iOS vs. Android comparison here but I will hit on my favorite parts of Jelly Bean.Google:The search bar in Google has been refined and positioned to offer more than just a simple click-search function and is called \"Google Now\". Now your \"wall\" (whenever you tap on the Google search bar) is a full-fledged hub of activity. Google aggregates important data from your email, social media accounts, weather, GPS and more to populate your wall with instantly relevant and recognizable information. At the end of my workday for example my wall is already populated with my GPS-estimated time to get home, traffic data, and route-avoidance data. If I make a purchase online the tracking data is displayed on my Google wall. If it's a friends birthday it'll be displayed or important appointments and tasks. It's an incredible feature that is quickly becoming my favorite feature of my phone.Camera:The S4 features two cameras, a rear-facing 13 mega-pixel and a forward-facing 2 mega-pixel camera. The camera takes fast and beautiful photos for being so limited by the dimensions of the phone and inherent limitations. This isn't a replacement to your Nikon SLR but it's great for snapping quick pictures while on the go and in situations where extra gear just isn't practical. Some of my favorite aspects of the camera include PhotoSphere that lets you take 360\u00ba and wide-angle shots and a burst-mode for firing off a rapid series of photos. Swiping while in the camera-mode will instantly bring up your photo album and swiping back will bring the camera back for snapping more photos.Keyboard:Swipe or a Swipe-like app comes standard on 4.2.2 and is even better than previous versions. The text-prediction function is very accurate and makes typing emails and texts a breeze. The keyboard is customizable to a incredible degree from key-mapping, hot-key, language settings and more. I text in Spanish to my mom and English to pretty much everyone else and the built-in dictionary adapts perfectly to my texting.Hover:This is an interesting feature that allows you to hover your finger over an item of interest and have the sized up and brought forward onscreen. It's like previewing something (i.e. an article) without committing to opening/launching it.--------------------iPhone vs. Galaxy S4:I have not owned an iPhone since the 3GS, however, have many friends who use the device and thus exposure to Apple's products and iOS. I won't argue the merits of either except to say that Android is a better fit for me and at this point I can't see myself ever going back to Apple's products. However, I recognize that to some folks Apple is the better solution. For certain I find that Apple's iOS is simpler, probably instantly more easy to use and familiar. Android comes in so many flavors because it is customized by so many different carriers and phone manufacturers. So one's experience with Android is heavily dependent on the phone and the manufacturer of the device unlike Apple who has control over the entire experience.--------------------What I like about the S4:(+) Excellent battery life. I'm not on my phone all day. Particularly at work I do not frequently use my phone. I do however, increase my usage considerably in the afternoons, evening and weekends. I've been pleased that a single charge overnight will get me through my entire day.(+) Google Now. As mentioned above this is really becoming the focal point of my experience on my phone.(+) Camera. My wife and I stopped carrying our Nikon point-and-shoot camera and have been very happy with the pictures we've been snapping with out phones. Coupled with Dropbox (or another Cloud storage provider) we've got instant back-ups of our pictures and they're already on our laptop, desktop and tablet when we get home.(+) Call quality. My carrier provides the option to make and receive calls over 4G or WiFi(VoIP) and the call quality has been really very good.(+) Ease of use. Connecting to Bluetooth devices, WiFi, wireless printers is a snap and very, very quick with the S4/Jelly Bean.--------------------What I dislike about the S4:(-) Our 16Gb phones come loaded with Samsung apps that I really don't intend on using. Out of our 16Gb, only 9Gb are open for use. Obviously the MicroSD card makes up for storage so this is relatively minor.(-) After about a week of use my wife's S4 could no longer take pictures. We tried several troubleshooting steps but ultimately her phone was replaced by our carrier. We probably simply received a lemon but we're monitoring our expensive phones for any additional faults.--------------------Closing:Samsung has really delivered a stellar product. Coupled with Google's excellent Jelly Bean Android OS the S4 is a great marriage of power, function and accessibility. This is a fantastic phone that we hope lasts us a few years.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "USA CUSTOMERS BEWARE !!!", "Author": "Grace D.", "ReviewID": "R3D3QADTZSNHB6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently bought the Galaxy S4 from FGS Trading thru Amazon. Unfortunately the phone broke down only after a few weeks of using it. I called Samsung USA to schedule a repair and was SHOCKED to hear that it can\u2019t be repaired here in the USA because the phone that was sold to me is an AFRICA phone !!! Any repairs will have to be made in AFRICA!! UNBELIEVABLE!! I live in the USA and bought this phone from a third party merchant thru Amazon which both are also from the USA. I do not think that it is unreasonable for me to expect that the phone can at least be repaired here in the USA. I am even willing to pay out of pocket to get it fixed here in USA. It is unthinkable that I have to ship this phone halfway around the world to Africa just to get it fixed!!!I bought the phone for $616 and AT&T; sells it retail for $640 (without any contract). So its not like a \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d kind of deal. The price that I paid is very close to the AT&T; retail price, its not like half price or anything like that. If it has been properly disclosed in the listing or product description that the phone can only be repaired in AFRICA, I would have NOT bought it at all. Not at $616!! Would you???International version phone simply means that it is a GSM (multiple frequency bands) phone which can be used while travelling abroad. Thus avoiding those pesky and pricey roaming charges that the phone companies charge. International version does not in any way means no US warranty. If it is, why not just simply state \"No USA Warranty\"?  Warranty is probably one of the last things that will be on a user\u2019s mind. But don\u2019t take it for granted.Always assume that the phone is from AFRICA and there is NO WARRANTY in USA. Do not get SCAMMED like me!!! For USA customers, buy it from AT&T; or T-Mobile and ask them to give you the unlock codes. Since you are paying full retail price without any contract, you do not need to wait a few months to get in unlocked. Instead, you can ask for the unlock codes right away. I am now out $616:(", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome phone, incremental upgrade from SIII", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3Q4AL2311GSUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

I had purchased online, so it was international i9500. Battery bulged and had standard issue that is widely reported in the press. I called Samsung USA. They refuse to change the battery and say that it is international. The phone is British EU based. I checked with IMEI number also. Samsung US claims the phone is from Syria! and refuse to replace the battery. Well that's it for customer Service. So warning that the international phones have no warranty! I am amazed at their utter lack of customer Service.UPDATE: 10/8/2013:An updated NFC Tag from Whiztags is just awesome, has 450 bytes of memory and I use several of those in office and home with my Samsung Galaxy S4 NFC tags - Topaz 512 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writeable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 3 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee!I have been using TechMatteTM Qi-compatible Wireless Charger for the Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 (With AC Adapter and Micro USB Cable). and TechMatteTM Qi-standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV for wireless charging and they are very convenient for charging by placing on the mat.UPDATE 9/15/2013:I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL Review:Galaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger.

Shortly after the S4 was released I decided to give android a shot. I had been a loyal IPhone customer, but the big beautiful screen was enough for me to take a gamble, and now I am paying for it.After about 1 month of use, somehow the phone developed an internal crack on the LCD. The phone had never been dropped, never had my 7 year old and my 3 year old play with it (side note: all of my IPhone have been thoroughly slobber/drop/sat on/thrown down stairs tested). There is no reasonable explanation for the internal, not external, screen to crack. But there it was, a tiny crack in the top right of the screen.Distressed I immediately ran to the store I bought the phone from. The girl at the store proceeds to tell me they see this ALL THE TIME. That she has seen someone that, while removing the 4S from the case, somehow managed to crack the internal LCD, just by removing it from the case. Basically that you just always have to be really careful and never put any kind of pressure anywhere on the phone. Wow, something that most people keep in their pocket and the store is telling me you can't ever put any pressure on the phone. She then tells me that she can't help me because even though it's an internal crack, they will still claim that it is damage and it won't be covered under warranty.I moved on to Samsung. After having the store switch my phone account back to my IPhone 4s, slobber, and everything, I called Samsung. I explained my problem to the girl and she said she can't help me, but that she would have someone call me back within 24 hours........25 hours later I called Samsung back. Needless to say I was annoyed. That fact that Samsung didn't even bother calling me back made me think they must be having major issues with their phones.  I asked the girl about this and she simply apologized, but couldn't explain why I hadn't been called back.  I again explained my situation to the girl on the phone. Her name was Octavia. Octavia explained to me that if the problem was in fact internal then Samsung would fix it for free. I was ecstatic. She emailed me a shipping label to send my phone in. (The email had the wrong address...sigh...I called back and talked to someone else, and he sent me the correct address.)I immediately sent the phone off to be fixed by Samsung.  After over a week Samsung calls me back to tell me that they can fix it, but it will cost me $200.00. I asked what they found and they said the LCD was broken. I asked so the \"internal\" LCD. They said yes. I asked about what Octavia had said about fixing any internal problems for free, they said that doesn't include the LCD............so basically. I told that guy he needed to find someone to explain how I go from anything internal will be fixed for free to now that we have your phone and have wasted over a week; we want to charge you another 200.00 for your plastic phone.I am currently waiting for someone else from Samsung to call me back. I am going to go out on a limb and say I am going to have to call them back. The bottom line is that the S4 is a terribly plastic design. Maybe the active is better, but I am thinking they probably made the active once they realized how incredibly fragile their standard design was.Avoid the S4 at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S4 vs iPhone 5: From someone who has owned both.", "Author": "Anthony R.

I would stick with the iPhone and will probably sell my GS4 when the next iPhone comes out.### Details:For each topic above, I have included details for each:# GS4 Pros:Better Screen* The larger screen really is wonderful to watch and use* GS4 makes TVs and you can tell. The blacks are blacker, the colors more vibrant than I had on the iPhone 5.* People keep saying wow to the screen when they see it. Or they ask me to dim it.* Games are amazing on it due to the size and colors.Better Text Messaging* If you don't hit send on a message, that contact shows *draft*. I have MANY times had unsent messages in my iPhone I was unaware of.* Swype is a game changer. I used to want to throw my iPhone into a wall when typing, which I do a LOT. Swype allows me to type data in MUCH faster. Guinness World Record faster. And Swype FIXES capitalization for you!! I use this constantly! And it does select all, copy, cut, paste as well with a single keystroke. Fantastic.* You can select \"ignore with text\" on an incoming call. I use this feature a lot when in meetings or in a loud bar. Not on iPhone.* On the iPhone if you have a single unread text, it automatically opens it. Sometimes, you go to text someone you were just texting, but the phone switches you to the unread text and you don't notice and BAM you text the wrong person. I've done that LOTS. Not so with the GS4.* If you have more than one number or an email and a number, the iPhone just says the contact's name at the top. You have to click it to see what is in blue to know where the message is going to go. The GS4 shows the number or email at the top with the name.* It is easier to place a call from a text. Icon always visible at the top.* If you are doing an iMessage you do not get a character count even if you have the count setting on. Also it doesn't show till you hit 160 characters. The GS4 count is always present.* You can change the font size of a text by hitting volume up/down.Higher Wow Factor* Nobody ever says \"wow, you have an iPhone!\" to me. But in three weeks at least a dozen people have said wow to this phone for various different reasons. And that feels nice.Great Back Button* Still missing from the iPhone architecture are a menu button and a back button. Always in the same place. Makes for much easier navigation than on the iPhone.Easy to add free custom ringtones* No need to buy ringtones. Add your own tracks and edit them smaller.Videos in Play Store* The play store allows app sellers to include a video of the app. This is AWESOME as you can really get a feel for the app without installing it first. On the iPhone installing is always a gamble.* Set a custom font for everythingI set the font to a comical one and it is EVERYWHERE. I love it.# GS4 Cons:Horrible NotificationsNotifications are how I keep up to date with EVERYTHING. The iPhone sorts them by app instead of by time and maxes out at five in the notification center. But this is STILL better than the GS4's approach. Example: If I am showering and hear my iPhone, I peek out of the curtain and there on the lock screen is the latest notification. If I click the button I can see all of them on the lock screen and get the gist as to if I need to dry off and respond or wait till later. With the GS4, they appear at the tippy top (like they do on the iPhone when turned on, not in lock mode). They go by very quickly so by the time you peek out, they are long gone. And YOU CAN'T CLICK ON THEM to read the details!!! I thought for sure Air Gestures would let me preview them without touching the phone. Nope. Further, with the iPhone I can get a ton of details without opening the apps. With the GS4, I constantly have to dig into an app to get the level of information I really need. That's a whole LOT of touching, and takes a lot longer to do. iPhone notifications are far far easier. And faster and more accurate. I used to hear my laptop and my iPhone chime together whenever I got a fb alert. The GS4 chimes when I don't need it to, doesn't when I do need it to, and that little blue light is always flashing when nothing important has changed...Won't Sync Outlook MemosSamsung tech support is AWFUL. On hold three hours. Clueless reps who are trained to say \"I'm sorry to hear that\" 20 times in a call, then not actually fix anything.  Their free outlook sync app, Kies says it does memos in the help, but the tool is missing that feature. They say it is Verizon's fault, but it is their own software that is missing the feature. And the old software didn't have it, so this is most likely a regression error (it went away again by accident). Most of you probably don't care about this one, buy I have over 500 memos I use all the time and need them on my phone. They are my memory.Visual Voicemail NOT FREEOn the iPhone you have all your voicemails as little files. You can pause, rewind, delete, recover etc. The GS4 requires me to CALL MY VOICEMAIL!? This is dinosaur archaic. Hit 3 to delete this message??? No slider bar... c'mon. On the GS4 voicemail window, I can opt to pay $3 PER MONTH to get visual voicemail from Verizon. Disgusting. Give me back my iPhone.No Successful Air GesturesThe commercials are all about the air gestures. Showing people with dirty hands who take care of business anyway. This hasn't worked ONCE yet for me. Many of the air gestures and air views are turned off by default. When you finally get them all on, they still fail to work. And even if they work as designed, which so far they haven't, I *expected* that if I got a text, I could read it without touching the phone. Negative. Even when working. You can preview one once you are in the Text App, but getting to it requires much screen touching!!! Defeats the whole purpose. I call this absolute false advertising compared to how the commercials make it seem.Multiple Restarts RequiredEvery day, my sound goes out. You can set silent, vibrate or sound on from the power button. My sound goes out and the button does not change it. I use the power button to select \"restart\" and the sound works again. Ok, maybe not every day, but at least twice a week.Clumsier App SwitchingI can switch back and forth between two apps on the iPhone by double clicking the home button and the last app is always the first spot. The GS4 requires a long press and it is the last app is actual the second one up from the bottom. This takes a bit longer for each step than on the iPhone. Just a minor annoyance.No Silent Text Tone Per ContactWhen Amazon or my bank send a text alert, I set those contacts to silent so they didn't disturb me. They still alert me, but quietly. Real people honk with happiness. Oddly, you can't do this on the GS4! Nor can I create a silent tone to add myself! So I had to find the quietest tone I could for these. Lame. Why can you so easily customize ringtones, including silent, but not text tones?Awkward Power Button PositionThe power button is directly opposite the volume buttons. And volume overrules power if you hit them both. I rarely change volume on my phone, but always hit power. And nothing happens because it is quite awkward to hit it without hitting the opposite side volume buttons. Especially one handed.More Accidental Screen TouchesThe screen size is wonderful, but I find myself activating it by accident ALL the time when trying to use it one handed. Over and over. iPhone is definitely one hand friendlier.Too Many App StoresI have like seven app stores on my phone instead of a single one on the iPhone. Which should I use? Why have so many?? Playstore, Amazon Store (and they have like four different kinds), Samsung (and they have multiple too)... Just too much. I created an appstore folder and there are 10 icons in it.# Other:Camera is great on bothThe GS4 seems to be better, but actually I think they are very similar but the GS4 screen is so great they look better until you put them on the same device. The v has amazing editing onboard, but I don't use that and the iPhone will have similar ones onboad in a couple of weeks. Oddly, the GS4 will shoot one randomly blurry shot about once in five to ten shots! I am not touching any settings, it just comes out very blurry. It happens enough that I noticed the pattern and I've never seen that on my iPhone.Neither allows a ringtone per groupI like creating groups with one tone. Besties. Lovers. People to avoid. Etc. I hear the tone and I know if I should run to or away from my phone without even looking at it. My Palm phone did this. Too bad none of these phones do.Neither phone flips screen upside downOddly the iPad does! Why did they not allow that on the iPhone. Why does it matter? GPS or Pandora in your car cup holder while plugged in. I had one iPhone GPS app that DID flip 180. I loved it. Plug in phone, put upside down in cup holder, map flips over and you are good to go.SummaryThe GS4 has lots of great pros, but if I can't fix say the first three to five of the cons above, I'll be heading back to my iPhone when the next model comes out.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R3J9NCQ86WIH2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had it for 3 days spent 650.00$ and screen cracked in my pocket.

I just program a tag to turn on wifi, or turn on/off bluetooth, or start an app, or whatever I need my phone to do.  Then I stick the tag near where I usually end up changing settings and tap my phone to it, EASY!!So far the best quality, and best looking NFC Tags I have found that work with the Galaxy S4 (and all devices with NFC) are these: 5 Pack of 4K NFC Tags with a Sticker Sheet by TagsForCells. Samsung has NFC Stickers, but they are flimsy and if you get the wrong ones from samsung they will not work with the S4, only the older models.

Well, I now know the problem(s). I turned everything on. If you turn on every bit of technology this phone has to offer, you'll go through the battery faster than a Ferrari goes through gas. I would run out of charge in 14 hours....with very little use. I am now trying to figure out what I can't live without. I still think I have a lot to learn on this phone, especially having discovered \"developer mode.\" You will not find it in your settings. It is hidden. To \"unlock\" it, here's what you have to do: Go to Settings, then go to About Device then scroll down to Build Number and tap it 7 times (I later heard you can tap 5 times, but I did 7). You'll get a little pop up saying that you have enabled developer mode. You can now debug USB, etc.....just when I thought I was getting to the meat of the phone, I discover all these other things. I'm going to keep searching, I might even find a personal cloaking device in here! ;)One more thing, be careful with contact info. I accidently merged two accounts, and so one was deleted. I had to manually re-enter it.Original:It's nice to have a phone with such a large, brite screen....especially when your eyes aren't as good as they used to be. We had iPhone 5's and they were fine, but there was a lot missing. Let me first tell you that the phone is pretty amazing, but also has some quirks. I am not an Apple hater (we have several ipads, including 2 mini's), and I was tempted to stay with the iphones, however, since we were able to upgrade, we thought we'd give it a chance. Keep in mind that I used to have a Samsung Brightside (dumb phone) and I HATED it, so it was tough to get these.Obviously, the ability to throw in a 64 gig card, pull it out, and put everything onto my computer/external drive, etc., and I have to say, it is very convenient. Another wonderful thing is the battery. It lasts a long, I mean LONG, time. One thing to note, if you let it drop to below 15% charge, it says that it could effect how well the battery charges....so, when you see you are at 15%, start charging.So, yes, there is a lot you can do, and the difference between doing it and doing it well are two different things! You will probbaly learn as you go, and you will find great videos, but if you are hoping for a book , don't hold your breath. The literature is sparse (and that's being kind).I got ours through Verizon and it came preloaded with so many useless apps, that I can't stand it, especially since it tells you that deleting preinstalled apps may cause other apps to not function...and maybe the phone, too???? Down one star. If I want google to know all of my contacts,etc., I'll do it myself. It's very intrusive! I also don't need ATLEAST half of the apps that it came with.Ok, with that said, I think I'm going to have to take some kind of class. This phone is not intuitive. I found the iPhone much more user friendly....but good things come to those who wait, right? The camera is AMAZING, clear, crisp, and super fast. Just keep taking pictures,it works well.The flash will wash out the image a bit, but I really didn't expect Canon quality (though quality is excellent).Scrolling by nodding/tilting your head is great....when it works. It's quite quirky, and at least 50% of the time I end up using my finger to scroll down. Too, finicky. But it's cool to show your friends, and does have its uses.I have enough remotes, so have not used it.However, I have no doubt it works. This is simple technology compared to everything else it does.With an Otterbox case, it is as thick as the iPhone, just about....but the Otterbox makes it feel really nice and less fragile. You can customize so much that it will take a while to get it the way you want it, but once you do,watch out! You'll love it.....at least, I did! :) Even with all this coverage and protection, typing is EASY and accurate! MUCH better than with the iPhone.....I always was making mistakes, but notany more. The large keyboard is perfect for me and my fingers. Music plays well and is easy to use.Reception is great! Before,in places where my iPhone would almost drop me, I have no problems! I hadn't expected this, but it is a nice surprise! Internet is fast and it picks up my Wi-Fi easily, all over the house, but not as good as the iPhone, which stayed connected almost to our corner!Speaker clarity is very good while vibration strength is mediocore. Fonts are okay, and you can download plenty more, some are and some will cost you.  Pairing with my car was easy. I wish I could figure out how to print to my wi-fi printer, but like I said, there is so much to learn.If you don't have the patience, get the iPhone, but if you don't mind taking some time (a semester or two?), then consider this phone.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone and features but too fragile to believe.", "Author": "Scott Vann", "ReviewID": "R38JTRSIV9VTJ6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Had my phone only about 33 days before the screen and digitizer broke ($200 in repair).

The biggest and most usable upgrade over the s3 and any other phone on the market is the phone's \"Air View\" feature basically hovering your finger over the phone lets you preview text messages and e-mails, lets you zoom in on web pages.  You can also go back and forward on web pages by waving your hand in front of your phone's sensors and switch between the home screens on your phone.  You can also wake up and answer your phone without touching it what so ever.  The feature you'll most likely be showing off to your friends is the \"eye scrolling\" feature.  Basically by tilting your head up or down you can scroll up or down on webpages, books, and other reading material.  I think the phone will mostly influence market trend towards touching your phone less and using gestures to control our phones. Another feature I will not be using but I can see being useful is the phone's simple homescreen.  The phone can switch from the traditional Android screen to a phone with large buttons and a simplified interface for using the phone's most basic features.  Also cool is the phone's \"multi-window\" feature which lets you run 2 apps on the same screen similar to Windows 8.Speaking of screens.  This one is huge! definitely counts as a Phablet, it's funny after using this phone for a week all other devices (ipod, iphone, other android phones, BBRY devices, Win 8 phones) screens look tiny and compact.  The screen is slightly bigger than the S3 but they still managed to make the phone thinner and lighter than the S3.  How with he bigger screen you think it would be less sharp or less clear...NOPE! this screen packs in more pixels than the iphone's retina display and gives a better representation of colors.  There are many videos on youtube proving this feel free to check it out.  the S4 gives the best quality screen on the market of any device to date maybe excluding the 4K televisions.Camera: pretty dang good.  I rarely use my phone's camera because I have a Nikon J1 for photography but once again, the features in the camera are just too cool, different shooting modes (night, skyline, facial ect) and a cool perk of being able to take a pic on the front and back camera at the same time.  Takes some quality photos too.Speed: which is especially important to Android users because a lot of android phones have a tendency to be slow or buggy.  No sign of that with this phone.  Now once again I urge people to check youtube to back up my claim but this phone is faster than the iphone.  Several speed tests and everyday use tests have proved this.  This thing is snappy and handles everyday tasks and games with ease.  Haven't run into an app it can't handle yet.The one thing I wish this phone had was Blinkfeed.  I have to admit this app makes me jealous,  I'll have to wait and see what facebook delivers as far as news-readers and content delivery.  Because taptu and flipbook aren't very visually appealing compared to Blinkfeed.  Surprised google hasn't taken this task on yet themselves.Anyway this was quite an upgrade for me, no regrets.

However, these features function intermittintly at best, and even if they were rock solid, are of limited utility. I dont advise anyone to buy this phone based on these features.One \"feature\" that the phone boasts is how slim it is. This comes at the cost of an inadequate battery. I, personally would rather deal with a thicker phone and a solid 24 hour battery life than this tiny tank of a battery and power hyngry phone.Many would say that there are features that I should turn off to preserve battery life, and they are correct, however I don't belive that a person should have to allocete time to configure his or her phone characteristics to match the situation that they are in at that point in time; a situation that may change in hours or even minutes.Mulltimeda integration is a hodgpodge of high performance and low integration.

It has some pretty innovative features like the new air gestures and smart controls. Some people call them gimmicky but i find myself using them on a daily basis.The design is terrific. i don't want to use a case but i know ill drop it. The screen is amazing too. Its one of the few phones that has a 1080p display so you will get a sharp display.You wont have to worry about lag since it does have a super fast 1.9 GHZ processor.Battery Is ok i get about 15 hours on moderate use. i don't use it much at work so i usually plug in my phone late night. On screen time you could probably go like 4-5 hours.Camera is the best on the market with a bunch of cool features. It is 13 Mega Pixels which is awesome.I recommend get a SD card because like i said earlier, the preinstalled apps take up 6 Gigs!So overall im going to have a good time with this phone.

Almost everyone is going to compare this to the iPhone. I suppose that is natural, given that the iPhone and this phone are at the top of the smartphone pile, but I think comparing two phones based solely on a feature spec sheet is silly. There are going to be iPhone fans who are blinded by their loyalty that nothing Samsung does will ever be good enough, and there will be Samsung fans who will thumb their nose at anything Apple does. Both positions are silly. If you are in either of those two camps, this review is not for you.I'll start with first impressions. The packaging is extremely neat. Easy to open, everything was logical. I didn't need a manual to tell me where or how to insert the SIM card or the battery. After inserting both and clipping on the back plate, I powered the phone on for the first time (hold the button on the right edge of the screen for a few seconds). The *immediate* impression is along the lines of \"holy crap, look at that screen!\". When the animated Samsung logo fires up it is immediately obvious, before even the home screen kicks in, that the screen is bright and so sharp you could shave an egg with it.Once the OS is loaded and the screen has more pixels, it is even more obvious, if that is possible, just what an amazing screen this thing has. The text is as crisp as a winter morning, and the screen responds to the lightest of touches. Flipping through the default screens there are a lot of apps that I suspect many people will remove and trim down the widgets and apps. They're cool (I wont review the apps, that would take too much space) but I use my phone mostly for making and receiving calls, taking notes, and a few photos and videos when the occasion demands it and I don't have my DSLR with me.I was dreading importing all of my contacts from my iPhone. Samsung made those fears baseless with their \"Smart-Switch\" application. I had backed up my iPhone prior to removing the SIM to put in the S4, and Smart-Switch found the backup and seemlessly imported all of my contacts, old SMS conversations, notes and calendar entries. It really couldn't have been easier. After importing everything I came across the first weirdness with the S4 though.Samsung provides a truly awful notes application called \"S-Note\". It's for children. While it does allow you to create text-only notes it also allows you to scribble notes. I am guessing some sort of pen device would make this more attractive. However, it stores the notes very differently. The import  took the first few words of each name and manufactured some sort of file name. Yes, on S-Note, each note is its own \"file\". The upshot is, that although the notes imported perfectly using SmartSwitch, they do not get synced with Outlook when using Samsung's \"Kies\" sync program. It is a terrible oversight on Samsung's behalf that notes are not stored in a way that can be synced with Outlook, when all other data can be.The next day I was at a Metallica concert and got to use the camera and video for the first time. The photos are absolutely beautiful, even though they were taken at night in a dark stadium. The video has to be seen to be believed. When playing the video back on my PC, you would have sworn it was taken by a professional video camera (mild shake aside). Even the sound was good, and that was picking up the massively loud PA system from half a stadium away. It is very easy to switch the camera into different \"modes\" and \"night mode\" was smart enough to turn the flash off. As if the flash on a phone could light up a stadium enough to make any difference to the image! I chuckled at the idiots around me who had their flashes fire. The interface for zooming photos and video is intuitive (you tap the screen, a little box with \"1.0\" appears, and you pinch-stretch it to zoom in), but still a little cumbersome. You have to hold the phone steady with one hand and then pinch this small rectangle to zoom. It would have been much more intuitive to have a slider bar under one of the thumbs. However, that is a minor thing and the crystal clear image is worth a few irritations.I have spent a week with the phone now. I find that my fingers, which have been used to an iPhone since the day it was launched, now quickly find their way around. I love that you can drag phone contacts, or WhatsApp contacts right onto the home page, so the people you call or message the most often are just a single tap away. The voice recognition is extremely good, Skype, WhatsApp and Facebook all work flawlessly, and Chrome is as zippy as can be.Overall, I am extremely impressed with this phone and do not regret buying it. I love Apple phones, I think they are marvelous devices, but I personally wanted to try something new for a change. I didn't leave Apple behind for any lack of features (although I do not think they have innovated very much since they released the App store - they've just revved the hardware), I just wanted something different and this seemed like a good point in the smartphone game to try an Android device. However, there are a few things I did find frustrating. It may just be a familiarity thing:It would be nice if I could specify that only phone contacts show up when the phone syncs with Bluetooth to my car. Having a lot of blank contacts at the top of the list (all Facebook contacts for which I don't have phone information) is irritating. Fortunately I can tell the Facebook app to remove all Facebook contacts from the phone, so that fixed that problem. Some of the settings are very difficult to find. I still haven't found a way to disable LTE or HSPA or whatever its called. I just want normal good old fashioned 3G data thank you very much - it's all our networks support reliably. At the Metallica concert I couldn't upload to Facebook because the phone detected and used HSPA, whereas my friend next to me with an old Blackberry was connected via 3G just fine. Some of the new gestures are a bit flaky. I think I disabled them somehow, because when my friend upgraded from his Blackberry to an S4 (where toe Smart-Switch was not quite as smart as it was for me - he lost about 22 of his 500 contacts), they work just fine on his phone. Once or twice the wifi has just flat-out refused to connect and even switching the phone off and on again didn't help. Then 3 minutes later it just magically connects again.In summary, this is a fantastic phone, whether you are switching from a Blackberry or iPhone or getting your first real smartphone. It has some warts, of that there is no doubt, but all phones do (admittedly the iPhone has fewer, though). If you use your phone for photos and videos a lot, this phone can't be beat.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Customer Service, will NOT replace defective device under warranty!", "Author": "Bobby R.

Remington", "ReviewID": "R32JKFMQYS2T0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung S4 cell phone is the hottest and newest phone on the smart phone market.  This Android device has gotten much press and rightly so.  In terms of specifications, the S4 has a lot going for it that has it as the leader of the pack over many smart phones.  But at first glance, this new phone looks and feels much like its predecessor, the Galaxy S3.  So what makes this phone different and why should you be interested in purchasing it?  This review will explore those issues and help answer that question.When you have a good thing going, why not start with that as your baseline.  Samsung has done just that with the S4.  The S3 and the S4 are very similar on many levels and very different in key areas.  Their size is essentially the same at 5.38\" x 2.75\" x .31\".  This actually makes the S4 .7mm thinner than the S3.  Its weight is 4.6 ounces, .7 ounces lighter than the S3.  Comparing the two, Samsung has increased the size of the screen to a 5\" display that offers full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels.  While other phones offer similar resolutions, none have the same quality image that comes from the Super AMOLED screen offered on the S4.  Side-by-side comparisons with phones such as the HTC One find the S4 shines with more prominent resolution and richer color tones.The screen also has improved capacitance over the S3 and previous Samsung offerings.  This improved capacitance supports phone use while gloves are worn.  Those who live in cold climates or those who are fashion conscious and wear gloves will find this enhanced capability helpful.  While this capability is a nice addition, it takes some getting used to.  Because it is more sensitive, it's easy to falsely register a finger press if you hover your hand over the screen in the just the right way.  Hopefully Samsung can correct this performance flaw with future software upgrades.Regardless, the S4 screen is a remarkable technological creation.  Its visual performance makes it like a smaller cousin of much larger HD televisions.  It is a beautiful piece of work and the highest quality screen of its size presently on the market.At first glance, the camera appears to also be the same as the S3.  This is, in fact, not the case.  The S4 houses a whopping 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel, front facing camera.  The rear-facing, 13-megapixel camera image is excellent.  The imaging capabilities of both cameras extend past the raw hardware with added features built into their associated software.  There is software to do most anything you can think of with the images taken.  Software even uses both the front and back camera to offer all kinds of imaging effects from panoramic images to slow motion videos.Much of the new hardware, software, and extended features built into the S4 place heavy processing demands on the phone's engine.  Because of this, Samsung has integrated a 1.9GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor to help keep things purring along smoothly.  At the time of this review, this makes the S4 one of the fastest smartphones on the market.Coupled with this increased processing power is an expanded memory card slot for additional storage.  Samsung is selling the S4 in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB configurations.  For those considering the S4 with 16GB of storage, this may be a bit limiting.  Approximately 6GB is eaten up by the OS and installed apps, which leaves a scant 8-9GB of storage.  This is 2GB less storage than the S3.  The S4 supports the installation of up to an additional 64GB using a Micro SD card.  If you're considering purchasing this phone, you might want to add a Micro SD card to your purchase and expand the base memory, or purchase an S4 with a higher amount of integrated storage.Keep in mind that the more data you add to your Micro SD card, the more information the S4 has to parse.  If you have a 64GB SD card packed with pictures and videos, when you open the Gallery to view them, even the quad-core processor will crank itself silly to host them for you; it will take time for them to display.  There's no working around this.  It's the nature of the beast.  Just accept this as a current limitation based on processor speed and storage mass.The front of the phone contains a number of additional sensors that monitor eye movement and proximity so the phone knows how far it is from your ear.  An infra red blaster is integrated into the top of the phone to enable it to act as a remote, with the appropriate app installed to function as a remote.  These sensors and the infra red blaster offer many new features not available with the S3.  The phone can act as a remote control for your television, CD/DVD player, A/V receiver, and even home appliances that support remote control.  The eye sensor offers additional features that control screen dimming and auto pausing when you look away from the screen.  Likewise, when you look at the screen, dimming and auto pausing resume their normal operation.Applications available to support the additional sensors include Air View, Air Gesture, and Smart Scroll.  While these features are futuristic and helpful in theory, they aren't flawless in practice.  They are also rather complex to learn and use, which detracts from the concept of simplicity when it comes to operating the device.  Take this into consideration when adopting the phone for your use.  Not all the features have to be used at once.  You may find some features helpful while others are an annoyance.  They are all highly configurable and it will take some time and practice to set them up to your liking.Like the S3, the S4 supports Samsung's S Beam and near field communication (NFC).  S Beam allows two Samsung phones to be placed back-to-back so they can share multimedia content such as videos, music, pictures, etc.  The devices only need to be placed a few centimeters from each other to link, and, unlike Bluetooth, no pairing is needed.  Communication is provided by WiFi Direct, which makes transfer speeds quite good.Samsung has received many user complaints over the quantity of polyurethane used with their phones.  They are plastic centric in construction and many consumers feel this detracts from a robust, solid feel.  The S4 seems to have taken this into consideration with the addition of a flat metal bezel around the side edge of the phone.  Much like the iPhone, the S4 has a metallic edge that augments its former plasticized edge construction.The case itself is similar to the S3.  The rear cover is easily removed to reveal the battery, SIMM card, and Micro SD card.As for battery life, the S4 stock battery is 2,600mAh compared to the 2,100mAh S3 battery.  This is a 20% increase in battery size with no added thickness to the phone's form factor.  In fact--as stated earlier--the S4 is .7mm thinner than the S3.  This added battery storage is required due to the increased screen size and additional features and applications.  Each person's use is highly personalized, so it's difficult to gauge how this battery will perform with your personal use, but, in general, it seems to be an adequate amount of power storage for moderate use.  Still, it will more than likely require daily charging.  If this is a concern to you, you might consider an extended-life battery.  These batteries are freely sold on Amazon and other locations, but most of them require an aftermarket back to the case that will replace your stock rear cover.  Extended batteries mean heftier weight and added thickness to the phone.  Another option is to purchase an additional battery as a backup for when your primary battery discharges.Out of the box, the S4 comes equipped with Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 and a huge amount of software.  If there's one complaint about this phone it is in relation to the amount of features and software bundled with it.  The S4 has a mountain of software that, at first glance, can be absolutely overwhelming.  It will take time to sort out and learn everything this phone can do, so pencil in an evening or two to explore, configure, and learn what's new and how to use it.  The list is far too extensive to cover in this review, but it should be stated that every feature the phone has is supported by associated software.  In addition to this software, Samsung has packed new applications to satisfy every possible type of user.  You may find it all useful, but this is doubtful.  Most likely, you'll use a subsection of all the software installed and make it your own.  One could say Samsung has given the consumer the benefit of choice by adding so many features and so much software.  Sometimes it's better to have too much than not enough, and this is true here.  Rather than be overwhelmed by it, see it as a library of possibilities that supports a healthy amount of functions.  Decide which functions are useful to you and learn them.  For those functions and applications that hold little interest, leave them alone for now.The S4 is an enhanced deconstruction and reconstruction of the S3.  If you currently own the S3 and are considering an upgrade, take stock in the added features and capabilities of the S4.  The S4 will give you the latest Android has to offer; a larger amount of storage space; a fabulous HD screen; a high-quality, 13-megapixel camera; huge amounts of added features and software; and a fantastic processor under the hood.  If these things are important to you, then the S4 may be an exciting upgrade.  If you're happy with the features and performance of your current S3, then you may want to save your money and stay with what you have.Overall, the S4 is a brilliant device.  It's not without its flaws and there is always room for improvement.  While Apple performed wonders defining the modern smartphone, Samsung has helped take the concept one step further.  If you're looking to upgrade your older smartphone and break into the Samsung Galaxy world for the first time, the S4 is a fantastic selection.  It is, arguably, the best Android phone on the market, at present.  Some may say it's the best smartphone, period.  Each person's decision and opinion is highly individualistic.  One thing is for sure, Samsung has pulled out all the stops to ensure consumers get the most for their money, and they have set the bar even higher for newcomers to take the mantle of achievement to a new level.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT AS ANNOUNCED", "Author": "Renato Caldas", "ReviewID": "RG8M64BGS0522", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The seller says that is a \"FACTORY UNLOCKED PHONE - INTERNATIONAL\", however it is a T-Mobile phone with all the software from this operator inside, and you cannot remove it.

Just go to there Worldwide website and see for your self. Its \"NORMAL\" for phones to cost that much overseas.

I kept hearing about these two phones the I phone and the Samsung gs4 and i was never really into apple and people kept saying that the gs4 had some really cool features like duel shot, group play, s translator, chat on, air gesture, smart pause, watch on, and a really good one was power saving that would make your battery last twice as long or even triple.So i was convinced ill go check it out i went to the T-mobile store i was looking around to see the other phones but nothing really compared to the gs4 so i looked it over it was nice smooth not to big not to small good size unlike the iPhone 5 which i think is to small. i was comparing the gs4 with the iPhone 5 and it looked like it would beat it in almost everything. So i bought it and was toying around with it and found plenty off more useful features. my friend was watching a movie on his iPhone 5 and i thought the screen was too small to see a movie. the gs4 may be an inch bigger but it makes a big difference in my opinion. its easy to use since its my very first smart phone the battery life lasts a really long time. this one time i left my charger at a friends house and my battery life was around 90% by the time i left. i dint go back until two days after and the battery life was at 28% by the time i charged it and i was constantly using my phone for every little thing. it also charges pretty quick i only charge it for half an hour and it was already close to 100%. another thing i like is the screen sensitivity you can put on a pretty thick screen protector and have gloves on and it would still work which is very helpful especially at work because if i would want to check something on my phone i don't need to constantly take off my gloves. i know its not a big thing thing but it gets annoying to take your gloves on and off just to check something on your phone. The only thing i dint like about this phone were the headphones there not bad but they could have done better ill give props to Apple those new head phone they made are great. that's all i can really think off for the flaws for this phone. another thing i like is the battery is replaceable so if your having battery problems just buy a new one also the back piece doesn't come off easily unlike the iPhone 5 my friend dropped his phone once and now the back piece comes off easily i have yet to drop this phone and hopefully i don't. i really recommend this phone too anyone really its a great phone around the same price as the iPhone 5.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "The phone was on a black list!", "Author": "Dairam Martinez", "ReviewID": "R3IO73TUADSUGY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, I bought the product from the seller \"Good deals only Good\".The phone I bought would not accept any SIM card.

I must repeat, for this price this phone is supposed to be silky smooth and buttery fast and flawless. Four days ago while at a house warming party i got to interact with my friends iphone 5, and OH MY GOODNESS, the phone is fast and smooth. There is absolutely no hesitation AT ALL. She was showing some photos of her dog and when she moved around the phone the various menu and photo galley the phone just move effortlessly. I was completely embarrassed as i tried to show her photos of my cat. As usual my S4 hesitated for about 3 seconds to bring up the galley not to mention to bring up the photo album. Literally that took about 5 seconds to load. Listen i don't mind waiting 5 seconds but i am not paying $600 for a phone to do that. It is a crying shame. I am actually thinking about factory resetting the phone to see if it will work better.Also my battery has started to swell malfunction when playing hi end games under 50% so i have have to purchase a new battery.For the money i am really disappointed.First Review - November 13, 2013 - I have been dreaming about this phone for months. I previously had an LG Optimus 4X and have been trying to sell it desperately to get this. Anyway i finally got it and trust me maybe because of all the hype i expected more. I thought that this phone would be as close to perfection as possible but it is far from it. The camera takes a long time to load up, the stock keyboard doesn't have auto prediction, flash light apps dont work properly cant create folders on the home screen by dragging one icon over the other and the overall phone is not as fast as i thought it would be. I dont know if its because it is the Exynos chipset or what but i'm not really impressed. And dont even get me started on the small on board storage for a 16GB version. Its just ridiculous. The Screen is mind blowingly awesome so videos and games POP. It runs the top games flawlessly but the above stuff has really gotten to me. I am told that the new firmware upgrade fixes a lot of those issues so i am waiting to see how that goes.

[tho we didn't buy them via amazon...i thought some may appreciate reading my take on it]While there are some pretty nifty features about the S4, I must fore warn those out of there that while it advertises 13mp camera; don't get the S4 if photo quality is of importance to you on a phone.  If its not one of the items on your 'checklist' and you don't mind some poor clarity of phone photos - which is me, I was not interested in the phone to get amazing photos out of it.  It has enough other features to make up for the poor clarity... in my opinion.Parts of me want to send it back and exchange it for some other phone.  But I think that is the 'perfectionist' in me wanting better picture clarity of this phone.  The S4 is replacing my HTC Thunderbolt [which by the way has an 8MP camera, & its' photo clarity / quality is much better than the S4!]There is some really cool things this phone has the capabilities of doing.  This review @  [...]  was one of many I considered when debating what phone we should replace my htc thunderbolt with.I am bummed about 2 apps [KeePass Droid & EasyMoney] I use a lot not being able to import data at all from my microSD card (from the htc) on to the S4.  I see the files to be selected in the folder - its' there on the sd card, but the apps on the S4 when selecting 'import' do not recognize the proper file(s).  There are Several folders & files actually that I can see that are on the SD card that thru those apps it doesn't even recognize their existence.On a POSITIVE note about this phone:  some Feature(s) I DO LOVE  --- SBeam  [like i said earlier we purchased (2) S4 phones; 1 for me and 1 for my husband]  the \"SBeam\" allows us to share photos, videos, apps etc with eachother easily thru a 'kiss' of the phones.  [putting the phones together, back to back].- Tv/DVR remote control (via the WatchOn app)- Easy access to multiple 'features' of the phone via a quick slide of the finger to the notification panel...turn on / off  wi-fi, bluetooth, sbeam, too many other features to name here.- Neat to be able to take Still Picture snapshots while recording video (again not very good quality of photos, but perhaps that is in the hand of operator --maybe i'm not holding it still enough or something.  and maybe I still need to work on that.]I will leave my review at this for now and will try & remember to come back w/ an update as we have more time to learn more about the S4 features.Hope this has been of help to you!", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice phone but kills MicroSD cards", "Author": "Serge Kavetsky \"Mr. Fix-it\"", "ReviewID": "R3A0YH6U39S8A3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone destroys all of the MicroSD cards that I installed into it.

The apps, features, technology, and design are simply the highest quality of any smart phones in the US to date.13 Mega Pixel Camera- the Galaxy S4 comes stocked with a 13 mega pixel rear camera, nearly twice that of the Apple Iphone 5's 8 MP rear camera. And triple that of the HTC One's 4 MP rear camera. The 13 mp camera allows for instantaneous crystal clear images with just the touch of your screen. The camera also comes fully loaded with multiple shooting modes designed to allow you to take the best picture for your situation.2GB of Ram- the S4 runs with 2 GBs of RAM, double the iPhone 5's 1 GB of RAM. Making the S4 twice as powerful as the iphone allowing it to run multiple apps at once. A feature not even available with the iphone 5. It also allows for the S4 to run crystal clear movies and games with no lag!5 inch screen- the S4 has a 5 inch full HD Gorilla glass screen! Compared to the IPhone's 4 inch screen. Or the HTC One's 4.7 inch screen. The 5 inch screen is truly the perfect size screen for a phone. Not to bulky to feel uncomfortable in your pocket, yet large enough to comfortably watch movies and play games on the go.Larger battery- the S4 has a 2600mAh battery, compared to the iphone 5's 1440mAh battery, or the HTC One's 230mAh battery. Making the S4 run the longest on a single charge out of the 3 phones.Amazing gestures- only the S4 has the technology to read your motions and activate your phone with these gestures! The S4 also reads your eye movements and acts accordingly, such as pausing your movie when you glance away from your screen, or scrolling down the page when your reading a book or website.The S4 is the fastest, most productive phone on the market I 100% recommend it! It never once has let me down, whether it's finishing a project on my phone through Polaris, or watching Netflix on my S4 while I'm out my S4 always runs smooth and effectively. The battery lasts all day through heavy usage in a single charge.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Galaxy S4", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R2Y1BDHQK2L7NJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cell phone achieve over my expectations.

Bakker", "ReviewID": "R3LRCLRZ66JLBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Full review at MetalArcade.NetThe Samsung Galaxy S III was  one of the fastest-selling smartphones ever created. The Galaxy S series has quickly become the iPhone's greatest competitor, and once I got my hands on the Galaxy S4, it was easy to see why. While some may knock the aesthetics of the device (it may be a smudge magnet, but I find it to be quite sleek-looking), the S4 has one of the most beautiful screens I've seen on a smartphone; its 1080p 5 inch Super AMOLED screen combined with a powerful graphics chip and quad core processor creates truly beautiful imagery.  The Galaxy S4 is extremely feature-rich, to the point that it may seem gimmicky, and it does come with a fair amount of bloatware. However, the few negatives I found during my time with the S4 are far outweighed by the positives.Though the Galaxy S4 looks largely the same as last year's model, it somehow manages to come in at a lighter weight and smaller size while packing a larger battery and bigger screen. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor certainly packs a punch; during my time with the Galaxy S4 I never encountered any lag, frame-rate drops or overheating. I tested it with some pretty graphically-intensive titles, too: Asphalt 7: Heat, Need For Speed Most Wanted, Iron Man 3: The Official Game and Dungeon Hunter 4 all performed admirably, with silky-smooth frame rates and stunning, vibrant detail. I should mention that I tested these titles while the device was paired with PowerA's MOGA Pro Controller, and still encountered no noticeable lag.The Galaxy S4`s IR blaster is definitely a welcome addition. With the included WatchOn app, you can control your TV, cable box, and even Netflix. It's much more intuitive and useful than it sounds; I thought it would be cumbersome to use and difficult to set up, but it's quite the opposite. There's a ton of other features, which range from cool to unnecessary. One of the more noteworthy ones is S Health, which can be useful. The app can use the phone's many sensors to track your daily steps; once it knows your weight, height, and fitness goals, it can tell you how many daily calories you need. Really, all of this can be done on something like the MyFitnessPal third party app, but the step counter will be useful to some. Some of the features that came off as a bit gimmicky or unnecessary include things like Air Gesture and Air View, as well as the feature that auto-pauses video when you turn your head. All of these worked fine, and were cool to show off, but I felt these tasks could be easier accomplished just by using the touch screen. Of course, you also need to think about the toll all these things can take on your battery life. Though in my tests, even with every available feature turned on, the battery life on the Galaxy S4 was excellent. There's plenty of other neat stuff included, like the ability to share media with other devices, translate language while traveling, and scribble notes down.Overall, the Galaxy S4 is a great choice for those who are in the market for a new high-end smartphone. The insane variety of features can be a bit overwhelming at first, but a fair amount of them are quite useful, and the camera, processor and graphics chip in the Galaxy S4 are hard to beat. The S4 packs just about every feature you could ever want in a smartphone, and even some you didn't even know you wanted.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellente condition!!!", "Author": "lorena hernandez", "ReviewID": "R23T4IV07M62X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The package arrived brand new as the promised.

It is my first smart phone so it is mostly referenced to my wife's iPhone 5 (and my ipod touches).Positives include the key pad (primary sales point) good camera, ability to add memory, good (large) display and the availability of apps (and support). It also had lots of gimmicks like the feature that tracks your eyes so you can scan down documents by literally scanning with your eyes.  When I say gimmick I mean it sounds great but when I tried using it out drove me nuts.  You need the discipline of a karate master to train your eyes.  I don't have that discipline so I turned it off. Most of the camera features fall in the gimmick category (but not the panorama -- that one is really nice). The voice recognition software is borderline gimmick: it is almost great, but not reliable enough to use for much.  Android was another selling point and it has some advantages (multi tasking is at the top of that list).  However the whole product integration pales by comparison to the iPhone. Why didn't I get an iPhone?  Mostly the keyboard (too small) and Apple has gotten too reminiscent of big brother.There are always negatives from design trade offs but some of these are severe. First, it is a lousy phone. Sound fidelity is substandard.  Reception is poor. Changing modes internationally is inconvenient (my wife's Iphone works seamlessly when she crosses the border to Canada-- my S4 is challenged--often will not connect or warns about international roaming charges).  The phone software is a pain when you have to wake it up to give you buttons to \"press one for English...\" or to hang up.  How about a button to answer the phone vs. swiping the screen?  How about a button to HANG UP the phone?  If you try using it on the fly and hit the wrong button you have to speed through any number of menus to get back to the hang up icon. DO NOT try this phone in the car.Software turns out to be another source of concern. Android 4.2.2 rolled out last week and the phone started crashing.  I understand it crashing if I try scanning a barcode with the Amazon app (one example) but the other night it crashed badly overnight when I was sleeping.  Not only did the alarm clock not wake me, the phone acted dead in the morning and would not reboot.  I ended having to remove the battery to reboot it.  4.3 came out last night, hopefully this will improve reliability. There are also a number of software glitches.  Like if you hold the delete button down it deletes lines of text faster than the display updates, The alarm clock is inconvenient etc.  With this phone you get one or two apps a day that update themselves automatically so I find the software unstable in the sense that you never know when things will change on you as well as unstable in the sense of crashing).Like the title says: some real positives but some real problems.

To do so, I went to Settings, selected the More... tab, then selected Application manager. Then I clicked on the RUNNING tab. After that I disabled apps that I did not want by selecting them one by one. My battery life is now significantly better, though I still charge my phone nightly.At $199 with AT&T; contract and about $50 for a SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 memory card, I wound up with the equivalent capacity of $399 IPhone 5. Plus I can change the battery myself when needed and the camera is better. Also, I can simply drag and drop files to my S4 from my PC using a USB cable.The learning curve may be a little longer with the S4, but in my opinion it is definitely worth it.Original Review:I would rate the phone very highly except for the following:1) Unwanted factory installed apps cannot be deleted. Buy it and you are stuck with Samsung bloatware. For instance, you get Maps, Navigation, and AT&T; Navigator apps. If you decide you like one, you cannot delete the other two. If you prefer a 3rd part app, you cannot delete the pre-installed ones.2) Some apps, such as Maps, keep running even after exiting them. In the case of Maps, multiple instances are sometime found running concurrently3) Some apps run all the time unnecessarily and restart themselves if they are stopped using the Application Manager. Samsung Link and WatchOn are examples of this.4) The unnecessary running of unneeded/unwanted apps results in intolerably short battery life.

The phone does not break a sweat running apps, and there is a lot of memory so there no noticeable lag in performance. Mind you I have the quad core version from Tmobile. The screen itself is large, and very bright. There is a tinge of blueish-green when it is not lit up, but other than that, it is clear and I can't ask for more. It is though, a little large in the hand, with my thumb not being able to get across the whole screen, so if you think that you have small hands, you may want to hold it with both hands. Some people may complain of the polycarbonate body, but it is pretty sturdy and feels good in the hands. It also lends to the fact that the phone is light, very light for its size, and if the case is broken or dented, it should be relatively cheap to repair. Consider replacing a phone that is sealed, and how difficult that may be.The phone requires a micro sim, and it does come with a port for an SD card which if you own the 16gb version, you will be using. Samsung has loaded this phone up with some cool features, but nothing you can't already get. If you do not want the extra features, I would wait for google to release their version of the SGS4, which is going to be running a stock version of android.On to battery life. It is awesome. I am an average user. This is my primary phone and I talk about 2-3 hours on it daily. I surf the net, watch Netflix for roughly an hour, and text a lot. I keep the bluetooth and wifi running 24/7, and have disabled all of the sensors that I believe are a waste. That being said, the battery gives me roughly 12-14 hours a day, with me unplugging the phone at 7:30am and plugging it back in around 11pm, and still having 20% of juice left.I've mentioned the sensors.... I think that air view and air gesture were a little rushed. They really IMO do not work as advertised. Good effort, but needs a lot more work, and if you have them enabled, battery life is taking a hit. The internal speaker is what can be expected of any phone speaker, loud and a little annoying, but as I said, what can you expect out of it. That said, I think that the iphone speaker is a little better.Connectivity wise, I have very good reception with this phone, 4g anywhere I go, bluetooth works flawlessly, and gps is perfect reception. Wifi also is really good, with fast speeds.Call clarity is very good, especially if you are tmobile to tmobile, and if your phone supports HD calling. I definitely think that call clarity is a lot better than that of the iphone, which,whenever I speak to anyone who owns an iphone, it always sounds somewhat muffled.As for Samsung's TouchWiz, I've heard a lot of people bash it, but it really works pretty well. Layout is pretty well thought out, and to me, it makes sense.

The HTC One X I returned due to the multitasking functionality being stripped.  The S3 I just felt didnt match up to the smoothness of iOS even with Jelly Bean.  Finally the HTC One was nice but it was a tad heavy and didnt feel as good in the hand for one hand use due to the power button being on top left and the 2 capacitative keys not feeling right.  Ultimately I went to the S4 and haven't looked back since.  It is definitely more than an incremental upgrade in just the screen quality and resolution alone.  It feels better in the hand and looks better in general.Pros:- Light as a feather- Gorilla Glass 3- The \"gimmicks\" are actually quite nice sometimes- Battery life is nice with the 2600mah removable battery- Wireless charging support (Wont know how nice it is until you get it)Cons:- Plastic- On black, the back gets fingerprints easilyOverall:Definitely support the S4 over the iPhone 5.  The iPhone 5 is a great phone but I got tired of the 4\" screen and it just wasnt large enough.  Also with iOS functionality lacking file downloads and setting other default applications, there were just little things here and there that make the S4 a better phone.  The lag that people mention on this phone is still there but turning animation settings down to 0 in developer options gets rid of most of it and I'm sure future patches should improve the situation.Highly recommend this phone and make sure to take the plastic seal off the camera lens, your pictures will be clearer for it.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone but only small upgrade from the S3", "Author": "JWink", "ReviewID": "R2KCGXWM9NIZB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just recently upgraded my phone from the Motorola Droid X, mainly because the Droid after 3 years was beginning to give up the ghost, sections of the screen were going out, battery was giving up and just starting to have problems.  I loved my Droid X but it was also beginning to show its age with the older Android operating system as well.So, after hearing good things about the Galaxy 3 and Galaxy 4, I decided to check them both out and reluctantly make the upgrade.  After checking both, I decided to go with the latest technology in the S4.What I did like about the S4 is that it has  the latest Android 4.2.2 and will be one of the first upgraded when the newest system comes out.  The S4 has a fantastic camera, a powerful quad-core processor, and software solutions for just about every scenario -- including working as a TV/DVR remote. It's also comfortable to hold, although a bit slick sometimes.  It has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot.Although some people will complain about its plastic design giving it a cheaper look than its rivals and even though I came from a medal Droid X, this didn't bother me so much, I found the look to be modern and nice to look at.  The new features that Samsung brings are mostly flash though and I don't think I would use several of them on a regular basis but it does have a solid set of toys to play with and the new features are cool just not something that is revolutionary.The S4 has a list of features that will keep you occupied and the Galaxy S4 is a solid phone with a big-screen and a do-everything smartphone although those of you who have an S3 will only find a small upgrade from your phone as from my perspective I couldn't tell any major differences that would have caused me to go from the S3 to the S4.This phone is a bit pricey here as compared to those with contracts but if you need an unlocked phone for international use then expect to pay at least 600 for an unlocked version.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Juan", "ReviewID": "R2CJ4OR73CNCCU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very cool phone, but need a software update cause it restarts very often with the camera and other apps.

This is my fourth smartphone after two Iphones and a Nokia Windows phone.  It leaves them all in the dust.  I needed an Android phone because I use Google Apps for Business - and the Samsung interfaces perfectly with it. Iphone and Windows support for Google is, as you'd expect, almost non-existent.  If you use Gmail you're better off with an Android phone.Plenty of apps available from the Samsung store and Google Play, and quite cheap too, compared with Apple and Windows.I paid $20 to upgrade to the full Garmin sat-nav app.  That was worthwhile. Another useful function is the ability to tune earphones and headphones to your ears.  Works rather like the hearing test an audiologist uses.The main downside was PC-to-phone music syncing.  All my music in is Itunes, a hang-over from my iPhone days - and I like Itunes.  There are a couple of utilities that sync Itunes to Android.  The best I found is a paid app called Isyncr.Battery life is decent.  Usually a day of average use take me down to around 70%.  When using sat-nav I plug it into the car socket otherwise it will drain quickly.  Rarely, and for some unknown reason, it suddenly decides to drain completely by mid-afternoon.  Re-booting restores normal use.  I use a paid-for power control app to assist.  Useful as it automatically switches wi-fi, Bluetooth, and 4G data on and off as needed.  This conserves power.My phone was a grey-market import from Hong Kong using a local well-known mail order importer.  I suppose I don't get a Samsung warranty with that but I was prepared to risk it.  Oddly the operating system was branded Optus (Singtel-Optus) with a lot of Optus crudware.  Deleted all that.The camera takes decent pictures but it's no substitute for a 'proper' camera.I'm upgrading to the newer model because after 6 months I killed mine by putting it in the wash.  Sad and annoying.  If I hadn't done that I'd stay with it for a while longer.

At home with my home internet wifi, it definitely runs faster and better than my gs3, but outside where I have to rely on my data, it runs significantly slower, especially when it comes to streaming videos.

Lightweight and thin while feeling like a Premium handheld device. It really makes me smile inside every time I find a reason to grab it from the pocket.The features in the new Galaxy take the experience to an entire new level. Multitasking is a breeze! And the Quad-Core Processor is nothing to complain about as it will run multiple applications simultaneously without breaking a sweat.Now the camera, which is one of my main interests in any phone, is pretty darn good when used properly. Quality photos are easy to come by considering that there is good lighting within the shot.

Don't get me wrong, I love my S4, but it feels like something is missing. It's a phone you might not want to stick with during a full 2 year contract.  The most used app you'll experience is the texting app. The text interface is like a luxury car without the luxury.  It just gets you to point A and B. Things like the keyboard and sent text messages just pop out of thin air, no animation what so ever. I'm not an Apple fan but their text inteface  for IOS 7 is stunning. It needs more of an Android feel to it all. Samsung's Touchwiz interface just sucks. Let me remind you that it's the same interface found on older Samsung devices. So it's not all an entirely new phone.  I would like to see some changes with Touchwiz in the near future.  It's too bland.  Other than these few things, it's a great phone.

I got the phone through T-Mobile after switching from AT&T;, who's been named the fastest 4G network or whatever, but this phone is built to be so fast that it's definitely much faster than the phone I had been using with AT&T.;The only time I've really been frustrated with the phone is when I'm making a phone call and have to open the keypad, I can't seem to get the phone to go back to the call screen so I can adjust call volume, speakerphone, etc. This hasn't been a huge detriment, since of my unlimited monthly minutes I usually use about 10 minutes of talk, but it can get frustrating when it does happen. Also I really like being able to make calls over Wi-Fi, but one annoying thing about that is sometimes I'll be on the phone while walking out of my apartment and once I get out of range of my Wi-Fi connection even if I have a 4G signal the call will get dropped. I wish it could transition more easily.Also I never used the Google Task function until I got this phone, because it makes it so easy to make a little to-do list for myself on the go. However this function won't sync with my Google calendar on my computer which can be annoying. But I think that's more of a Google issue than Samsung.But I mostly love this phone and all the apps I've been able to use that I couldn't before. Using Dropbox to sync my camera pictures with my laptop has been great as I'm a blogger by hobby and using my digital camera was quite a hassle. I'm also better able to use apps like Pinterest and Facebook that would bog down my old phone. The camera takes great pictures and I feel like it's much easier to share them than it was on my old phone. The display is great as well, very sharp and high resolution. Also the screen is huge, but the phone is very lightweight and thin. Much more so than the smaller screen LG phone I had been using.Today marks one month that I have had this phone, and I'm optimistic that I'll be happy with it for several more months.

No led or anything. just blank.Now the phone doesn't turn on. I went to ATT DSC (Device service center), and they said it was a battery issue. I tried somebody else's s4 battery that had a 75% charge. I got a grey battery icon with a stuck circle on it. Then it black screens. Phone refuses to turn on. So it's not a battery issue and technician is a moron.When I put in a battery, sometimes the LED flash on the camera will stay lit for a few seconds, but no matter what i do or what combination of buttons (power + volume up, etc etc) the phone will not turn on. Sometimes when I plug in the phone for a few hours, the phone gets incredibly hot but still won't turn on.Tried the samsung charger and cable with half a dozen outlets and computer usbs..And the phone is completely stock. No ROMS, no nothing. Never dropped it, never submersed in water either. I've always taken great care of my phones.I went from an iphone 5 to this. I was so ecstatic - like an upgrade in most ways!

Horrell", "ReviewID": "R1CPJXBWM6DSHG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 as my primary phone as I became required to use phones that are Samsung SAFE phones. SAFE is Samsung's acronym that denotes phones that are capable of secure connections through microsoft exchange, secure VPN, on-phone encryption and remote management. What they don't mention is the remote management and encryption is done through the BUILT INTO ANDROID TOOL called Google Device Policy.I digress though, this is about the GS4. I had purchased an LG G2, but had to return it in favor of a Samsung SAFE phone, but I have used both long enough to write an accurate review. Overall the GS4 is terrible.It suffers from feature bloat, something that is well documented. Its notification window is now dominated by various samsung notifications that cannot be removed nor turned off leaving me literally 1/4th of the screen for my actual notifications. The space is taken up by a brightness slider which could easily be replaced by the android standard control panel widget for brightness. The widget I speak of allows you to quickly go from low to medium to high brightness with a single touch. LG does this AND it allows a 4th setting for a custom brightness level. +1 to LGJust below the brightness slider is the 'Ongoing Apps' notification. Go ahead and google this. The ongoing apps cannot be removed and its notifications consist of things like, \"You are now connected to wi-fi\", or \"your wi-fi is off\". Both of these I know, and can easily tell by looking at the top bar or by looking at the wi-fi widget along the top (also not removeable). So on the same screen I have two notifications that take up about 1/8th of the screen each telling me something I should be aware of anyway through normal usage.Moving on to the audio department. The audio hardware generates a high pitched noise which is a grounding issue within the phone itself. All phones have this issue and I have yet to find a good solution for eliminating it. This means that high quality earphones or car audio systems become unusable with this phone. I personally like to use my phone for music a lot and now that is impossible. This renders my phone really only good for silent gaming and for taking phone calls. If I wanted a device just for phone calls, I would have purchased a flip phone.Those cool features that pause the video when you are watching it if you look away? They don't work at all. There is Smart Scroll which is supposed to scroll up when you look at the bottom of a paragraph which I have never gotten to work at all, even in smart tilt mode. There is smart screen which is supposed to keep the screen on while you are looking at it which does not work at all either (especially while using you tube for some reason). And finally, there is the smart video which will not work when I have my glasses on, and when i take them off, pauses the video every time I blink or never pauses it at all.The other most advertised features is a mode which presents the user with only the shortcuts a novice would need and only the apps they use. This is a way to get people who never use a smart phone to start using a smart phone, but is flawed because it really prevents them from using the phone in a smart way. It is a function that turns your $250 (new contract priced) phone into a phone that has functions available on ALL free phones from all major carriers. This essentially is for those who want the latest and greatest just to say they have it and not actually for using it.To top it off, its camera is good in really bright situations, but in medium to low light, it looks like a knock off $20 camera available at a gas station.Overall I would NEVER purchase this phone again. It is worthless, and a complete waste of money. To top it off its cost is $50 more than the far superior LG G2.

It's in english but some of the apps are still in spanish like the samsung stock app to take a picture of text in different languages and recognize and translate. The phone is amazing and worth the buy. The only phone on this planet that compares to it is the note 3. I bought this a couple days before the note 3 unveiling. You can't go wrong with either product. The phone sits at 5 inches and I can reach all 4 corners of the screen with one hand effortlessly. I recomend a screen protector and I found the best one. I will add the name at the end of the review. The phone does come with a lot of bloatware samsung tied to the os. I recomend rooting and installing the stock rom from google to speed up the phone even though performance is not an issue. I just feel that even though things are good and fast, that it could be better. The camera is above par. Don't let Nokia's gimmick 40mp sensor lumias fool you. This camera is amazing. 20 shutter shots at 10 frames all at good quality close to 4k. The speakers are amazing. Surprised me on the depths of the sound and how they reached all 4 corners of the room from the palm of my hands. The softwared samsung put in this makes the device more valuable than the hardware itself. The \"Octacore\" cpu makes task and installing apps fast. The battery life is amazing. I sat for hours just getting all the apps and info linked to my account and sat above 80%. No problems with the phone heating up either in the time of usuage. The screen is nothing short of what you would expect from samsung. 1080p display is something everyone should have. The phone feels good in the hand. Light. I was a proud owner of the first galaxy and I think samsung made a great product in this. Since that first galaxy I purchased two phones. Artix 2 & Iphone 4. The only reason I purchased the Iphone was for Itunes and the Ipod app. As a long time android user adjusting to apple and their rules took some time. If you want a simple user experience this isn't the device for you. Get an iPhone. With the 5s being x64 bit it's pretty much laying down the foundation of forcing previous model users to upgrade because the knew phone does not support backwards compalibility with the apps. If you want a defined experience and something you can customize to cater to you and your needs this phone is for you. The versitility of this phone and all the software that comes with it make the device more useful.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Etienne", "ReviewID": "R3J5XWHJ02KI6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As many reviews mentioned it is a great phone. very fast and can get any app from the Play Store.

I'll never slow this thing down...16GB of internal storage is sufficient (my previous device had 8GB.)2GB of system RAM is phenomenal, especially for opening many web browser windows without crashing the whole phone.MicroSD cards give ME the freedom over inexpensive storage expandability.The physical, spring-loaded 'home' button is a change from the touch-sensitive backlit \"button\" my older phone had, especially as the S4 has touch-sensitive backlit \"buttons\" and it's awkward to  get used to.The chassis feels solid, but is cheap plastic and not metal.Photography is great, given the limitations of cell phone cameras.  The HDR mode is a partial joke, though, as it merely artificially ramps up darker sections - truly dark areas are not given bracketed exposures needed for real HDR photography.  If there's enough lighting, the faux HDR does a passable job, but it can't replace skill with a real SLR camera just yet.I love the ability to use my own fonts for the user interface.The phone runs VERY stable as well.But, along with a bigger battery, the USB port no longer allows a mass storage device option when connecting to a PC.  This makes data transfer difficult, but wi-fi options exist.  There's one at the Play store I will be buying, to get rid of the 5MB/file limitation (find and try it out and see if it works for you...  it's a popular app.)  But wired connections are always faster, and more reliable, than wi-fi.Overall, a top-notch phone, but the two nitpicks are just enough to cost it a point.I am not affiliated with Samsung, for the record.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect phone", "Author": "filippo levati", "ReviewID": "R3I5SYPPZGJ4AP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "but still improve is needed for:display use under sun (not enough brilliant)slow camera response at start up.fl", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome cellphone", "Author": "Wolf R.

(OUCH!) There is a GIANT learning curve to this phone, if you've never used a Galaxy 3 or even a 2. I used a Galaxy S3 for one week before I decided to go with the S4. The S3 performed even worst then this S4 \uf04c, when using similar apps/functions/settings.Visit the Galaxy S4 simulator on the Samsung website, it's really awesome but it only shows you a picture perfect version of how the phone is intended to be used, not real life application.Jelly Bean 4.2.2./ Operating systemIn general, I'm SO disappointed at how the phone stutters or lags. Considering it's the fast phone on the market with an overclocked 1.9GHz quad-core processor, I would expect it not to lag at all or as much as my previous phone the EVO 3D with a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor.You can view all the applications that are currently running by holding down the home button, you're supposed to be able to close all running apps when you press the \"close-all apps\" button. I find that several apps do not close down, even though they no longer show up on the list of running apps. I'm not sure if this is due to application errors/code or Samsung just added this feature to make people feel better?Take a screenshot by sliding your entire hand across the screen (this is not \"easier\"), several instances where this doesn't work or takes the screen shot at the wrong time because your hand causes the screen to slide what's on the app left or right. GIVE ME BACK my power button + home button to take a Screen shot please!Creating folders on the home screen is now slower / annoying (what?yes!) What ever happened to just dragging an app on top of another to create a folder?You can easily hide or uninstall apps from the app drawer, \"Go launcher\" has been doing this for almost 3 years now.Major Dislike: There is no toggle//widget for Data, 3G, 4G, or LTE on these Galaxy S4s. You must dive deep into menus to do this. There isn't an app I am aware of that can produce this functionality either. I'm sorry I thought I bought an android phone, not an iPhone.Screen lock has several issues unlocking or creating short cuts. I gave up trying to customize this using the built in features.Samsung Apps:Samsung wants to replace just about all Google Apps, which is really dumb; I don't need several apps backing up every piece of my personal info. One is good enough? Besides, just about all the Samsung Apps are severely under developed. Samung Link and Samsung Kies are also VERY slow, I would never use them. Snappea app is better for managing for phone/apps/music/etc from your desktop.Samsung's Clock/Weather widget lags like crazy on this Galaxy S4. You also can not launch our clock from it, which was something I was used to do ICS, it was natural. \"Clock the clock to set the clock or alarms.\" Now, Samsung wants me to become obsessed with checking the weather, because that's all it launches. There are times when the App is completely invisible, not displaying/functioning at all. COME ON!S Health: This works ok, there are better apps at the play store. Tell me why they removed this from the LTE version of SG3s?S Translator: This works well, give it a try.Samsung Hub/apps = Galaxy only PlaystoreS memo : it's okay, I've used better apps for typing/creating documents.S Voice is horrible in my opinion, but the Driving mode is completely Hands free, unlike Siri. I don't care what you siri-fanboys/gals say, this is a much safer way to use the phone while driving.Google Now is awesome, it's not Siri, nor will it replace Siri, and it can't do certain things S Voice can. At the same time Siri could learn a lot from Google Now. It's great for asking questions that you normally would do a Google search for. Siri is a beast when it comes to performing local app-based functions like calendar events and emails. You can have the best of both worlds on an Iphone 5, unfortunately, there is no Siri for android phones. With Google now you can ask it \"Who is the president of the united states\" = Barack Obama. Then ask a follow up question like \"When was he born\" = Aug 4, 1961. That is amazing! Endless possibilities with that active conversation-like function.Optical Reader barely works the way it's advertised.Multi-Window: Something most people would rarely use. It only works with a handful of apps.\"Contacts\" is one of the most annoying features about Jelly Bean 4.2.2. When you type numbers or letters looking for someone to call, it only previews a single contact, not several like previous versions of android. It's also really bad at suggesting the names you are looking for, often showing names with letters you never even searched for in the first place.Keyboard:Normal keyboard and Swype work at the same time, which is amazing. I used to have to decide how I wanted to type from the keyboard options. Weird feature on this Galaxy S4 or Jellybean 4.2.2., there is this annoying \"Select input method\" notification in the drop down panel when typing text, no way to stop it from popping up is what I found searching around the net.There is no point to ever type in landscape mode, you get maybe 1/5 of the screen to see what you're typing!? The rest of it is for the keyboard. I can no longer long press on a letter that has a symbol I wish to input such as a hyphen, because it also brings up the hyphen and 3 over versions of a Z I'll mostly never use in my life. This makes it's much slower to type, since it takes about 3 seconds to get to that hyphen. example \"Long press the letter Z, wait for menu to load, press hyphen.\" It's a serious step backwards, considering a lot of these symbols and characters could of be placed in the keyboard as separate individual buttons. It's a freaking 5\" screen for crying out loud, use it!G4 Features:Air Gestures: This works with a very small amount of apps.Air View: This works with a very small amount of apps.Smart Rotation: Never use it/notice its working.Smart Pause: This works well.Smart Scroll: This has yet to work properly once for meSmart Stay: This works well.-Tilt head: very under developed.-Tilt phone: very under developed.Camera:Capture Photos while recording, finally!Slow/Fast Motion I didn't even know how to use this until I started to write this review!Dual Shot is very fun, you don't know how nice it is until you use it.Story Album is absolutely garbage compared to the HTC One's Zoe. I simply hid this app, since you can't remove it.Live filters are awesome, shows you exactly what the photo will look like in real time.Animated Photo creates a gif, takes some time to learn how to properly use it.Voice Commands will work flawlessly once you learn how the camera app wants you to pronounce the commands, for some reason, it didn't like the way I say \"Cheese\" at first.There are several more less notable features, check out the Samsung Galaxy S4 simulator to see the rest.Group Play:I was looking forward to using this with my Wife's Galaxy S3, but Samsung put out an update to my S4 Group Play app, which made it incompatible with S3s. Seriously Samsung?Battery:I am not impressed with the battery life. After checking with the built in battery app, it shows the battery is down to 71% with 2hrs of use (since the last charge). 61% of the power drain was from the massive 5 inch 1080p screen. What's shocking to me is that this poor performance was all under the \"power saving\" mode with all options enabled.After using this phone I've determined I wasted my money on it. This is not worth my upgrade. The phone features the best stuff available (spec-wise), delivering a very sloppy experience. Maybe Samsung should stop pumping out phones every month trying to be more innovative then Apple, and actually make something that works VERY WELL the first time you make it available to the public.There is a chance Samsung could update or polish up a lot of these features in the near future so that they work more accurately, not as some gimmicky magic tricks you use once in a blue moon. Most people will not touch 50% of the available features. There is a lot of unnecessary crap on this phone. Dear Samsung: spend more time on what counts.I will be replacing this phone as soon as I possibly can.P.S. I don't write professionally so may it sounds like I went on a rant?

As of recently the Galaxy S4 is the primary topic of discussion.  This past year Samsung released its new phone to replace the popular Galaxy S3.  According to Samsung the Galaxy S3 sold more units in Q3 of 2012 than Apple's iPhone 4S and iPhone 5.  With these kinds of stats it was only a matter of time before Samsung would release the next \"S\" smartphone.  With all the hype surrounding the release of this new phone it may seem like a no brainer to get one.  However with many other impressive smartphones on the market, is the Galaxy S4 worth buying?The Samsung Galaxy S4 is extremely thin even though it is arguably one of the most powerful phones out there.  It is less than a half inch thick and only weighs about 4.59 ounces.  Samsung has done a great job in distributing this weight throughout the phone to give it an even lighter feel.  When holding the phone it feels like it molds to your hand.  The shape of the phone is perfect and feels very comfortable.  The sides and back of the phone are slightly rounded to be in-sync with the curvature of your hand.  The back of the phone is made of a polycarbonate cover that encloses the battery and MicroSD card.  This cover has been a problem on the older Galaxy phones in terms of it flimsiness and the problem has not yet been completely solved.  When the cover is removed it feels quite flimsy and flexible.  I would have liked to see a better quality material be used here due to the fact that this phone is on the more expensive.  The iPhone 5 on the other hand has a metal and glass body that has a much more solid feel.  Moving to the front of the phone there is the same layout of buttons as the S3.  There is a large centralized \"Home button\" with a touch screen menu button to the left and a \"Go back\" button to the right.  This type of button layout is very convenient when using the myriad of applications that this device offers.  Right above these buttons is the massive 4.99 inch screen display.  While holding the phone in one hand it is surprisingly easy to reach every corner of the phone with the thumb of the same hand.  But the most noticeable part of this screen is its color and clarity.  It is capable of 1080P resolution and 441ppi which produces, in my opinion, the best displays on a smartphone.  The colors seem to pop out of the screen and the sharpness is comparable to the best HD televisions.  The screen is leaps and bounds ahead of the iPhone 5 because of its unbelievable contrasting colors and let's face it, the 4\" display on the iPhone is no comparison to the Galaxy's 5\".Once you get over how amazing the display is you are further impressed by the strength and capabilities of this device.  It contains the Quadcore 600GHZ processor and a whopping 2GB of ram, which in English, means that this phone outperforms many laptops and desktop computers!  I was able to multi-task on this device without any hesitation and the loading speed was impressive.  When given a strong Wifi signal the device was able to load pages at a speed faster than any other smartphone that I've owned.  The S4 also sports many highly customizable pages where you can put virtually any app in any arrangement possible.  It also contains a useful app short cut tool bar on the bottom of the display to access all your favorite apps.  However all of these features come standard with many of the other smartphones.  So what sets the Galaxy S4 apart?  It has many futuristic features such as Smart Scroll.  This feature allows the user to scroll through pages on the phone by only using the eyes.  There is a small motion sensor on the front of the phone that captures movements.  You can also use your hand to wave over the screen and move through pages.  This feature is not only ridiculously cool but useful in times when your hands may be dirty or occupied.  Another new feature is the air view.  This allows the user to hover their finger over a text message or email to get a preview.  I found this feature to be quite unnecessary when you can easily just click on what you want to read but it is another option nonetheless. One of the most remarkable features of the Galaxy S4 is its front and rear-facing cameras.  The rear-facing camera contains 13mp and the front facing contains 2mp.  These cameras can take unbelievable photos that enhance colors and clarity.  There are also some awesome new camera features that include eraser mode which allows you to erase anybody or anything in the background that is unwanted.  This was very useful when editing out a \"photo-bomber\" from a quality photo.  There is also a \"dual camera\" mode which allows you to use both the front and rear-facing cameras simultaneously.  Video that was taken on this phone is just as vivid as the pictures.  Compared with the iPhone 5 the Galaxy seems to take the win in terms of clarity.  This is due to the extra 5 megapixels that the Galaxy has on its rear-facing camera and 1 extra megapixel on its front-facing one.  When taking a far-away picture the picture on the iPhone 5 becomes quite blurry while the Galaxy captures minute details.  The sound quality on this phone is certainly not the best however; it produces a respectable amount of depth and clarity.This phone is clearly one of the best of its kind on the market today.  It is a tremendous step up from its predecessor, the Galaxy S3, in every department.  I also believe that it trumps Apple's iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 because of its endless options and superb design.  This phone brings a new meaning to the phrase \"an engineering masterpiece\".  Samsung has managed to create a phone that truly allows its user to have the world at their fingertips.

The placement of the POWER button is just stupid its right where your thumb goes (for rightys anyway). Getting Apps to stay off for apps you dont use is a nightmare even with the use of a 3rd party app killer so that can be a huge power suck. Samsung, AT&T; offer little to NO support so your best bet is to go to Youtube and that's a crapshoot. I was using an iphone 4 and what made me move was the better Exchange support since our office is Windows based it makes it easier to search old emails etc. And also I detest itunes with a passion and since i have a lot of music that's just amplified.So there is good - the video playback is pretty outstanding, sound quality is pretty good too. As a PHONE its actually really good compared to the iphone which is more iapp that can occasionally make and take calls and I do get thats partially to do with AT&T; service.Anyway my recommendation is if you are not a geek this is not your phone please move along. iPhone, Nokia Lumia or even the blackberry might be more your speed and mine apparently.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful phone", "Author": "Jac", "ReviewID": "R1N11W8895G48S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I enjoy using Samsung galaxy S4 with a wide screen yet light in weight!

I have to say I am impressed. I have been using the phone for several months now and I am more than pleased.Battery Life: I am able to get approximately 15+ hours per charge on this with regular use (Not gaming on the phone). I will describe regular use as calls, texting, some internet use. The phone while playing games causes the battery to drain quite quick, so if this is something you want to do with this phone I would recommend getting an extra battery OR bringing your charger with you. Coming over to this phone from IPhone I was thrilled to see that you can actually remove the battery. The other really nice thing is that the phone can be charged with a simple Micro USB cable, you are not stuck with some phone specific cable that only works with this phone!Speed: The speed of this phone is simply amazing! I am able to switch between apps very quickly, the apps also run smoothly. The processing power on this phone is very powerful and I really am pleased with it.Storage: I have read many complaints about the space available (roughly 9 gb. of free usable space on the 16gb version of the phone). Now the good news if 9gb is not enough for you is that you can simply pick up a Micro SD card for $20 and then you will instantly nearly double your memory capacity! I picked up a 32gb card and installed it with no issues at all! Rumors are that a future software update will even allow you to run apps directly from the Micro SD card, so be sure if you get one that you get a card that is quick enough.Design: I love the design of this phone, it is sleek and stylish. The phone is very nice and has a really nice look. I purchased the black version which is more of a graphite.Screen: The screen is also really nice, it is the best screen on any smart phone that I have EVER seen. I have compared this to friend's Iphone 5s and the HTC One. The closest competition is the HTC One, but I have to say that the Galaxy s4 looked sharper and the colors were brighter and more lifelike.Special Gimmick Features: This phone has so many additional features that are featured in the commercials, such as Air View, Screen Scrolling, Waving to Answer, etc... Sure these features work fine, but in my opinion they are not really needed. I find myself not really using these at all... I have shut down several of these simply because I never use them! The additional features are cool things to show off to your friends, but they are a really small reason of why you should buy this phone!Overall this is an amazing phone, I would definitely recommend picking this up!", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "help", "Author": "NormalConsumer", "ReviewID": "R1SQCNHAK4OT7T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Does anyone know if it has the language choice of turkish.

The fastest one on the Galaxy family is the S4 and this is why I got it, but honestly the speed I was expecting to get is not too much noticeable.I'd hate to conclude that smartphones are lazy devices, so I won't do so. I'm not there yet. I guess that dealing with these beauties is a matter of patience, most of the times.Nope, I don't have installed tons of apps and games in my S4; I'm not one of those users. For me, a cellular phone is... a phone, basically. So I installed just 5 or 7 smart tools for my daily tasks, but that's it. And those tools are not heavy ones like those applications out there that require enormous resources from the OS or the processor for their operations. So this is not the reason that makes my S4 a bit lazy. But anyway...One of the aspects that professedly are one of the \"great\" features of this phone is its huge screen size. For some people this can be awesome. Well, sorry; not for me. Why? Just because you would need giant hands and an extremely elongate thumb to reach the entire area of the screen. So even if you have big hands like me this is not a comfortable phone to operate with one single hand (as I used to do with my Galaxy Ace).Now don't say \"get a smaller phone then!\". Please go back and read my first paragraph...Regardless of what I have mentioned above this is a great phone and I am happy with it.

I try to touch something and it wont react or it will hit something else. iPhone doesnt have this problem. Even with a smaller screen i can easily type messages on the iPhone with minimal error when compared to Galaxy's huge screen.The other thing is the responsiveness of the OS.

I had the iPhone 4S and was looking to upgrade, but wanted to try something different. I have used android in the past, and didn't care for it, but with the direction Apple is going, thought it would be worth it. I was wrong.First of all, I must say Samsung had some things right. The screen is gorgeous, good color and resolution, but I feel just a little too big. Swiping down for notification center is a big awkward with one hand, stuff like that. Another thing so right is the performance. That 1.6Ghz snapdragon shows its stuff in games and common tasks. Jelly bean feels super snappy, as did CyanogenMod 10.1, while rooted. I was able to achieve a 1.8Ghz overclock, stable. The 2Gb of ram is great for multitasking, just a great performer overall. Also, descent battery life, and the 4G is super fast. However, it stops there.After initial setup, the phone restarted. No reason, just did. I brushed this aside, since it was a new phone. This problem persisted. I've had the thing restart midway through a phone call. Apps crash often, generally unstable. After rooting the phone and installing CyanogenMod, the restart problem still persisted, even with no overclock or tweaks. I wasn't happy, so I went through the whole RMA process with Amazon, essentially without a phone for a week. Not happy.The new one worked well, I only had it restart when I pushed the overclock a little too far, to be expected. This one wasn't nearly as bad, but it was still just not right. While holding it, it doesn't feel the same quality as an iPhone, it almost feels cheap. The back is all plastic, digitizer is fragile, and once while taking the back off this new one, I turned it around to see a nice small crack in the LCD. Small, but there, and a very big issue.The thing is, this phone is garbage and Samsung knows it. Their previous Galaxy devices were great, but greed it turning them into a money-hungry company that produces beer cans for products. There is no excuse to be having these problems on a $600+ device. When my next replacement comes in another week, I will be selling it and getting an HTC one X, as I suggest anyone still looking at this device should do, while you still have the chance.

I considered, but did not buy this phone. My review is based on the phone's specification and my research.I had multiple motivating factors for spending big buck and get this cutting edge phone:1) I wanted to buy my own phone and keep it as long as I like.  I am tired of being locked in two year contract.2) I would like my mobile phone to be compatible with multiple carriers.  I would like to shop for mobile service independent of my phone being from a specific carrier.3)  I wanted my phone to be unlocked. Sometime the carrier unlocks it for you to use the phones overseas, but not with the competitor here in the US. The price of the phone is built in the monthly bill.  It is not free. Why is that  I am not allowed  to do whatever I like with my phone, at least after the contract has expired?4) I want my phone to accept a SIM card. Some phones form some carriers in US, such a Verizon, do not have SIM cards and effectively you cannot use them with any carrier other than Verizon, inside or outside the US. Off course, Verizon now have some phone models that accept SIM cards that can be used overseas, as long as Verizon unlocks it for you. Why not all phones come with SIM cards, like many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America?5) The 4G technology called LTE is growing in coverage and that will be the cutting edge mobile communication for next few years. I wanted my new phone to support LTE.6) In many countries outside US, the phone networks use widely accepted international standards; therefore, the mobiles phones can be used with any of the carriers in those countries.  That is what I would like to see here in US.Let me come back to the review of the Samsung Galaxy S4 International version offered here at Amazon.It meets some of my requirements with the following major shortcomings:1. The phone does not support LTE networks (4G). yes, the phone will work, but it will be using 3G or older networks. This is a mjor shortcoming for a phone that is the latest release from Samsung. What is the point of forking large amount of money and buying the cutting edge mobile phone when it does not support the latest generation networks from your carrier. It is better to spend a little bit more and buy the version of Samsung Galaxy S4 that supports LTE.2. For 3G side, some users have mentioned that the phone is not compatible with T-Mobile`s 3G in the USA. T mobile uses 1700 and 1900 MHz frequency for 3G. If T-mobile uses 1700MHZ in your area, the phone will not be compatible to use T-Mobile's 3G network.I do not recommend this International phone for USA users. The best alternative is the T-Mobile version of Samsung Galaxy S4 with LTE. That phone will support LTE networks for AT&T;, T-Mobile, and MetroPCS.  Its 3G (WCDMA) part is also compatible with networks in many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. My understanding is T-Mobile unlocks the phones as long as you paid the full price of the phone.In summary, here in USA, we are not there yet where your phone will work with all the carriers; however, the T-Mobile version of Samsung Galaxy S4 comes close. It gives you flexibility, freedom from a contract, and compatibility with some USA and most overseas networks. I think this a starting point to freedom.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "does not support aws1 band", "Author": "V.
