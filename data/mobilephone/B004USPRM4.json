{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent phone", "Author": "Mr. Ben \"ctsamurai\"", "ReviewID": "R6777MJ3YI242", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(I would expect someone investigating purchasing a cell phone would do some price comparison, $700 for this phone is a bit steep.)The Nexus S is an interesting phone. It is the sequel to Google and HTC's Nexus One (incorrectly regarded as a flop) and like the iPhone 4 it sets the bar for the current generation of smart phones.I bought this phone on its release day, so I am very familiar with what it can do. I came from using a Nokia N900 Unlocked Phone/Mobile Computer with 3.5-Inch Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, Maemo Browser, 32 GB--U.S. Version with Full Warranty which was another great unlocked phone. But this year alone has seen a lot of improvements in what phones can do.The Nexus S, made by Samsung, is a gorgeous gadget.  It is a little underwhelming in person, glossy all-black, but its a sleak package and it has some definite power under the hood.  The 1GHz Hummingbird processor absolutely blows through apps, I have not experienced anything I would consider lag.  I've encountered latency and bad apps, but those are not the phone's fault. The Gingerbread version of Android is a real stunner.  I still read about issues with 2.2 (Froyo) and just have to shrug because this phone does very well with every app i've installed.The camera(s) and other features function very well.  The optics of this camera are not all that impressive, but the software behind the camera works very well and even resource hungry apps like Photoshop Express function very nicely on the Nexus S. As for displaying those pictures, this is one of the most beautiful displays on any phone. The \"contour\" glass is curved just enough to be comfortable when held up to your ear, and it separates it from all the \"slabs\". The glass coating is wonderful to touch and fingerprints wipe off without a lot of smearing.One of the big gripes I've heard since this phone was announced was that it lacked an SD card.  I was nervous stepping down to a 16GB phone after having 32GB plus an SD card slot on the n900, but now I do not miss it. The streaming apps (youtube, last.fm) do a great job of keeping me entertained and I've gotten quite good at plugging in to my computer every so often to move media onto and off of the device.  An interesting thing to note: The 16GB is partitioned similar to a phone with SD card, So you have about 2GB of \"root\" space- where the apps and actual Android OS stay, and then the 14GB \"SD\" partition that will be unmounted when you connect your phone to a computer (if that didn't make sense to you, don't worry). You can move apps onto the \"SD\" partition. In short, I have not missed having a huge hard drive on this thing.The other gripe is \"No 4G\" and this one is more of a \"religious debate\".  We are only seeing the tip of 4G.  Every carrier claims to have 4G service, but that's a debatable statement. Its pretty clear that carriers didn't even roll out 3G as much as they could have, so really we're waiting for proper high speed connection of any sort in most areas of the country.  If you are one of the fortunate few who lives in 4G land, and you KNOW that you need extreme speeds NOW (and you won't travel anywhere, because then you're back to 3G or EDGE pretty quick) then this is not the phone for you. For the majority of people, 3G speeds are quite adequate for the majority of applications (both software and usage) that people will use, the phone is also 802.11 b/g/n compatible, so using wifi will improve your experience over many 4G connections.  Consider also that you get tethering for free with this phone (a very nice feature that makes any Wifi device far more mobile so long as you have your Nexus S with you).Now on to the Nexus S's unlocked status. Is it expensive to buy a phone without a contract? of course, you are only paying for the phone once.  If you do the math  it is cheaper in the long run (and you have more freedom) if you buy your phone and choose your carrier. Also take into consideration that Google will send the Nexus S Android updates before any other phone on any carrier gets them in the US.  This shortcuts all the \"fractured\" issues with different manufacturers and carriers limiting your access to the latest Android software. This phone's usability will be extended because of it. There is no carrier in the way who will want you to upgrade to get the next batch of features for Android, instead you're plugged directly (or more directly) to the source.  That is a big advantage.UPDATE: Having now used this phone daily for a few months, I am still very pleased.  The main comment complement I get when people notice the screen and just how good videos look on it (even rather low quality youtube videos).  Having Gingerbread on here is a real treat (ha ha). Its a shame I can't recommend certain apps (like Google's Navigation or certain widget functionality) since its running a version of Android that isn't available to my other 'Droid brethren and I feel like a snob explaining how this is practically the only phone with the latest OS. About the only thing I miss on this phone is an LED to indicate incoming messages when the screen is off. And I have noticed a weird quirk where the phone will randomly reboot itself. This is a known glitch that should be resolved with the next update to Gingerbread (2.3.3).", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't get fooled by the low price", "Author": "ranjith", "ReviewID": "R2ACTNZQXC9SR4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There are many sites which display the model number as i9020 and ship i9023 instead.i9023 is a cheaper model(almost 100$ less) without the Super AMOLED screen which is the best feature of this phone according to me as the processor speed,RAM capacity are not as good as some of the latest dual core phones and this phone has a below average battery which lasts for only one day.I was expecting Amazon to be truthful to the customers and mention the display type in the product description.As the other clever websites,they also chose to misguide the customers by not including that part of the spec in the item description.Try calling the customer care and confirming about this item,you will receive only vague answers.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "it is not US, it is not Super AMOLED, it is not i9020", "Author": "erkam", "ReviewID": "R35EBU5TRECFS3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought it just 2 weeks ago.I bought it especially for its Super AMOLED screen.But you should know that before buying:There is actually 2 kinds of Nexus S:i9020 (i9020a i9020t) and i9023i9023 is the european version or non-USA/UK version.

The I9023 version (SLCD) which was produced for the French market and only gets EDGE in the US.  Also, it has no warranty despite the product listing saying \"US Warranty.\"  Amazon really screwed this listing up and sellers will get droves of returns (mine's going back today) if it continues to go unchecked.  It's simple, really.  There are three versions of the Nexus S, and it appears Amazon and it's resellers ship whatever version they so wish even though the listing says I9020A.I9020T - intended for T-Mobile.

I already had my own SIM Card, I kept the T-Mobile one, because you just never know.My service is Corr Wireless and this phone allows me to send and receive pictures straight from/to the phone without going to the Corr Wireless website. It's the first phone out of 6 I've owned that does that. Mind = Blown.The packaging was great. The actual box for the phone, with a picture of it and logos, etc. was in mint condition.Been a little behind in phones due to using them to strictly texting. But finally wanted something that made texting epic win from my RAZR, a full keyboard, etc. I loved the idea of Google sending the updates straight to the device rather than going through the carrier. ^5First Android device I've used. I've setup and worked with iPod Touches before, but I caught on fast. Very easy to use, I instinctively zoomed in on a web page then wondered how I knew that.Another thing that caught me by surprise was how it recognized my lesser known carrier so fast and was working with it from the start. I didn't initially realize that and after exporting my contacts from my SIM fumbled around trying to call my voice mail (I'm deaf) when a friend told me he received a text 30 minutes ago from me. He was busy and so his reply came late. It dawned on me then that it already detected and was working with my carrier from the very beginning.I sent the message right after I exported my contacts. Before I spent 20 minutes trying to guess what button did which for voice mail. I then called his phone and boom. Yep. I was a little embarrassed it was working perfectly and I expected some hiccups.Now it's hard to imagine my life without a smartphone, especially this one. GPS <3 makes life a lot easier because it connects to a GPS satellite rather than through your carrier to the web. And displays a icon that moves with you as you drive along on streets, etc. I love it. I'm still discovering more and more about the phone as I go along, tweaking it more and more specifically for me.The AMOLED screen is beautiful. And the flash on the back of the camera is wow. Bright. In a good way because it really makes the picture your taking seem clearer and less darker when taking something in a low lit area. In a way it reminds me of the flash in a professional photo studio.The Android 2.3 OS seem pretty fast, sleak, and nice. It's my first smart phone though, but one reason I delayed getting one was because I knew they were not as powerful as say a netbook. I'm a electronics tech, so I'd rather do things quicker on a laptop/netbook than I could on a phone. But this phone actually surprised me in terms of speed and functionality.Only Con so far has been... the amount of memory made available for Apps. You get roughly 16gb as general storage (like a internal SD card) for music, photos, etc. But Apps get about 1GB. Not counting the content you get (say Kindle Books) in the App (I believe that's stored in the 16gb area). You might be able to add some of this storage GB to the App 1GB storage, I haven't looked into it. I haven't used up either memory yet either in any case.tl;dr version. GPS = win and oh, yeah.

What about a phone?", "Author": "Tom G.", "ReviewID": "R11P5D44830FL5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First a heads-up, be careful if you want to get this from outside the US! Amazon/FGS messed up in my case and the device got stuck at customs with extra brokering fee charges, not very professional from a company used to shipping goods (I suppose it's the bulk of customers for this article since it's cheaper from other well-known dealers inside the US).This is a rather good smartphone, on the plus side:- the availability of Android 2.3 though this is a temporary advantage, you can manually upgrade to 2.3.3 (as of time of writing), for some reason Amazon's partner is still sending an old 2.3.1 version and there is no upgrade available from the usual settings menu;- the battery, which can easily last one or two days depending on the use of course;- very good display;- the basic initial set-up, not cluttered with applications, you get to choose what you really need;- unlocked (Android), comes with a T-Mobile SIM that you are free to ignore.On the minus side,- why on earth isn't there a notification LED? It's dearly missed, one has to switch the device on every time to see if there are missing calls or new notifications, very impractical;- another big mistake is the lack of SD card slot;- no manual, you have to find it and download it, some links on the Samsung site, provided at synchronization, are not working;- sound quality is good but not more, I used to get much better on feature phones;- GPS only working outside, is that standard for smartphones? I hardly see how this could be used in a car, for example, do you have to stretch your arm out of the window if you need directions?- plastic design, easily smeared with fingerprints on both sides, the supposedly anti-fingerprint display coating is really just a farce.The Android is a great platform, *almost* mature now, of course there are still some remaining quirks or silly decisions, like for example the lack of groups in the contacts: it's easier to select a song than a contact, still it's supposed to be a communication device.So it's quite good, but the quality doesn't justify the high-end price, at that level one wouldn't expect mistakes like missing LED or an SD card slot, and a printed manual or a protection case wouldn't hurt either. It's more at the level of a bulk version that should be sold at a lower price or with a contract. A couple of stars removed because of this.EDIT: Little update after a few week's use.Still wonderful platform, but everything related to the primary functionality - this is a phone - is average or below average. This may be partly the hardware, and partly the Android OS (2.3.3, very few apps installed).First of all, this is unstable. I had several calls I couldn't answer, swiping would just fail to take the call and the phone app would just hang until the call is missed. Several times did I also have troubles calling someone, the phone would just wait, but no tone, no real call was issued to the network apparently, app freezing again.Now and then the phone fails to register on the network when it's switched on, changing the 2G / data option sometimes seems to be a work-around but this is suspicious. When it does register, sometimes it can't transfer data (again, switching on/off some options may solve the problem). There are several networks here, each with a very good 2G/3G signal, I've never had this problem with another phone before.It is also more difficult to get a signal with this phone than others I used to have, even at places where the signal is fine.The speaker volume is too low (even at its maximum), don't even try to give a call in a noisy environment. On the other hand, the earpiece is fine or even dangerously loud if you don't lower the volume enough (you have to do this for the ring, the media, ...).So in conclusion, it's a very nice gadget, but don't buy it if you need to rely on the phone functionality.

Always have latest Android version.", "Author": "David Seese", "ReviewID": "R3K0NSX73IMFMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great phone. The best feature is that it should always get the latest version of Android quickly. For most phones, it takes forever to get Android updates from the manufacturer if you get an update at all, but the Nexus series of phones gets updated directly from Google relatively quickly. Look on the forums and you can see how frustrated people can get waiting for an Android update. I really like the vanilla (stock) Android better than the overlays the manufacturers usually add to Android. I had an HTC Desire with the HTC Sense Android overlay before this phone. HTC Sense is probably the best overlay, but vanilla Android is still much better. The other issue with non-vanilla Android is that some apps don't seem to work properly all the time. With vanilla android, if the app doesn't work, you know the problem is with the app, not the phone.Other top-end phones have faster dual-core processors, bigger screens, and cameras with more megapixels. I expect faster processors decrease battery life, which is a big issue, and this phone seems very fast as it is. The Nexus S screen seems plenty big, and the phones with larger screens don't have any higher screen resolution. The screen on the Nexus S is absolutely beautiful. It's so bright you can see it outdoors in direct sunlight. The AMOLED screen saves battery life when it's not so bright, especially if you have dark colored wallpaper. The camera is very good quality, especially in low light situations. I never have to use the flash. I suppose more megapixels wouldn't hurt, but without better lenses and bigger sensors, none of the smartphone cameras are going to be great. In short, no other smartphone offers features that are really better in the real world.The battery life is much better than my previous phone. All Android phones have relatively poor battery life because they are basically very small computers with many radios (3G, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth). My battery has always lasted at least a full day even with heavy use. Of course, if you use the navigation feature without plugging it in, the battery will run down in a couple of hours.One complaint some people have about the Nexus S is the lack of an SD card slot, meaning the storage is not expandable beyond the built-in 16GB. If you use Picasa to store your photos and Google Music to store your music, this is not a problem. With these services, your photos and music are stored primarily in the cloud instead of on the phone. With Google Music, you can choose which songs to cache (that is, keep on the phone). 16 GB is plenty to keep enough songs cached to listen to when you don't have a WiFi connection. I can't imagine what you would want to store on the phone other than photos and music that would not fit in 16GB.For me, the Nexus S is the perfect balance of features, making it the best smartphone available today. I won't be tempted to get any other phone unless they come out with a vanilla Android phone with a higher resolution screen (more pixels on the screen), a better quality camera lens, and a bigger camera sensor. No phone offers these features today.

I ordered this from Amazon LLC (not one of the many resellers) and received the exact model of the phone that I expected, with the super nice true-black screen, and it works on T-Mobile (voice, text, and data).  Most of the negative reviews on here are reviews of the seller and item description, not the phone itself (which has brought the star score down, Amazon needs to look into this, figure out if some of the sellers (or even themselves) are selling the wrong version at times, and remove non-product reviews).  If you notice, most of the reviews that actually review the phone are glowing reviews.Anyway, on to the review:PROS:I switched to this phone from an old HTC Hero that I have.  I immediately noticed how lightweight the new phone felt when I picked it up.  It's a tiny bit wider and a little taller, but it is also thinner when compared to my HTC Hero.  It is still a nice slim size though, and slides perfectly into the small pocket on my jeans where I always kept my old phone.The screen is nothing short of amazing.  I put a plain black background for my home screens, and it looks really slick.  You can't really tell were the screen ends and the edge of the phone begins unless you look close, it's beautiful.So far everything has been snappy and fast.  No major problems getting all of my apps installed from the market. The camera has taken beautiful pictures so far (even in just ok lighting conditions), though I haven't tested it much (plus, it's such a step up from my old phone, it's hard for me to know how good it compares to more recent phones).I love, love, love the pure android interface.  It only came installed with Google stock type apps and the expected stuff, no carrier garbage or crappy ad-filled garbage like you sometimes get from some of the android interface creators / carriers.Also, I just downloaded Netflix, and it worked beautifully and looked very nice on the screen.  I tried it through WIFI, though I mostly use my phones through WIFI.CONS:This is only a 3g phone.  I personally don't mind, but it would be easy to assume with just a nice, new beautiful phone that it would be 4g.  If you watch a lot of movies or something over the phone data connection, that may matter to you.  But 3g honestly should be just fine for all of my mobile needs, and I just use WIFI at home and work.CONCLUSION:Unless you have to have 4g, this is one of the best Android phones out right now.  My roommate has a Galaxy S phone (which is also a very nice recent android phone) and he's envious of my beautiful screen and nice clean interface.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone with fabulous display!!", "Author": "George E. Jelly \"GeorgeJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3KKEDCCCBPF12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There isn't much else I can add to the many 5-star reviews here - but I do want to mention a couple of things.  First of all, mine is clearlly a 9020T, marked that way both on the package and under the battery cover.  As several other reviewers have mentioned, make sure that you order yours from Amazon LLC and not one of their other suppliers if you want to ensure you get a 9020T.  The display is absolutely beautiful and the phone feels more solid than I thought it would.  That said, I'm not thrilled with the pop-off battery cover - it seems fairly strong and I have to assume both Samsung and Google tested it.  Replacement covers are plentiful and reasonable on *-bay so I'm going to order a replacement just in case.  I'm also surprised and happy with how Samsung implemented the SIM card slot - I recently damaged another phone by using a micro-sim card adaptor.  The Nexus S is well designed in this regard and you don't have to worry about swapping out SIM cards.  Overall, I am 100% pleased with this phone so far and highly recommend it.********************* Edited on 4 AUG 2011 to add update ***************************No doubt about it - this is a wonderful phone - but I do want to add a couple of caveats.  First, at least with mine, it appears that I cannot charge the battery to 100% - it stops at 97%.  And, the battery life is pretty good but I do not think it will hold up for almost three days like the Nexus One.  Second, and I admit this is kinda minor - there aren't many highly-rated cases for it - and Otterbox does not yet make a case.  Still - with the incredible display and how fast it runs - it is the best phone I own and I'm thinking about getting a second one to use with my 3GS contract chip.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "To the point:", "Author": "AndrewThiele", "ReviewID": "R23IA0QRGNERJ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PhonePros: -easy to root. -screen looks nice and contours to your face. -Android OS and Apps run fast and browsing sees little slow down. -3G seems adequate for data and phone reception is nice and clear. -NFC capable and WIFI works nicely. -receives Android OS updates quicker than other phones (in most cases). -easy to develop Apps for Android using this phone.Cons: -no indicator LED so you'll have to unlock the phone to know if you received any messages or missed any calls. -camera's have no zoom ability for pictures or video capture (at least from the default camera option). -no 4G ability although this seems negligible considering 3G speeds seem just as good.Android OSPros: -open source and market is completely open for any and all Apps. -fast, reliable and highly customizable.Cons:-after installing or uninstalling several apps, the desktop has difficulties switching from left to right.

It's replaced a wonderful barely-two-years-old Google Nexus One that went bad (random infinite reboot loop and heating up) that HTC couldn't remedy without an expensive out-of-warranty repair.There's a lot to like about this Samsung Nexus S:Wonderfully bright and sensitive display.No artificial GUI mandated by the carrier (AT&T; Wireless).Seems much faster than the Nexus One it's replaced.Works well as a voice phone.Fast on a wifi connection.Works well as a web browser.Zero app hiccups so far.The optional Samsung charging stand seems like it's going to be a winner.What's less-than-anticipated:It's very very (have I said \"very\" enough?) slippery in my hand right out of the box compared to the Nexus One.The four (dimly lit) soft function buttons (go-back, menu, search, and home) on the bottom edge of the display become invisible in bright light, even with brightness turned up to max.It's running a few sub-versions behind the Nexus One's Android (it's running Gingerbread 2.3.4 vs the Nexus One 2.3.6), which is disappointing. Looks like ICS isn't going to happen for this phone even though it's already been rolled out to other flavors of this model.Overall, I'm very pleased so far. I haven't had a chance to experience how long the battery lasts. I'll update this review after a few days.Update 04/23/2012:Still loving this phone. Battery life seems okay, but to be fair I need to disclose I put it in the charging stand when I'm not carrying it around. (Charging stand has a minor annoyance because it requires two hands to insert and remove the phone from the stand). Zero unplanned reboots. Most excellent.Update 05/09/2012:Took this phone on a trip, and discovered battery life away from the charging stand is pretty miserable. Admittedly, I probably have too many apps that \"prevent phone from sleeping\", but five or six hours away from a wall or auto/USB charger before \"connect to a charger\" appears seems unacceptable. I've changed to my new/fresh backup battery to see if perhaps the original battery is defective. Will update again later.Update 02/07/2013:Still using this phone daily, and like it a lot for what it is. Battery holds for most of an 8-hour day, which doesn't seem unusual with most of today's smartphones. A major disappointment, though, is it remains stuck on its original Android 2.3.4 OS, and Google/Samsung have shown little interest in updating to Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) or Jelly Bean with a standard over the air (OTA) update. (There are technical users who have manually updated the OS to Jelly Bean, but there are pitfalls doing that.) It's all very disappointing for a Google branded unlocked flagship phone. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, since Google promptly walked away from its first Nexus One phone by HTC, and now this Nexus S by Samsung. Gives me a reason to stay away from the brand-new Nexus 4 by LG. These phones are flagship Google phones the day of purchase, but it seems you shouldn't believe the myth: These are Google flagship phones, and they'll always get the best/latest Android OS updates first before any of the carriers' versions get updated. History doesn't seem to prove that myth.Confirmed today with both Samsung tech support and AT&T; Wireless tech support that there will be zero updates to the originally installed Gingerbread 2.3.4 Android OS that comes with this phone if you're subscribed to AT&T; Wireless. It might be different if you're subscribed to T-Mobile, but I have no way to know that.Also remember if you need in-warranty service on the hardware, Samsung won't honor the warranty even though this phone comes with a U.S. Warranty and was permitted to be registered on Samsung's customer web site. Buyer beware.If you're happy with the phone's capabilities with Gingerbread, and don't care about updating to a more-current version of Gingerbread, or to ICS or Jelly Bean, then this should be a terrific phone for you.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you're interested in Android, avoid the hype, get a Nexus device", "Author": "Mohammed K. Hassan", "ReviewID": "R1Q6PH4PUH0RYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus S is a great phone. What makes it unique than the rest of the android phones is that you will always get your updates directly from Google instead of relying on the mercy of the manufacturer. In terms of hardware, most phones have similar specs. so what distinguishes is the software on them. For example the Nexus One is now nearly 2 years old YET it is officially running the latest Gingerbread update which is absent in many hyped and high end Android devices released in the last few months. Sadly many of these devices will probably never get a gingerbread update. A certain group would call this \"fragmentation\". It's not. You buy a device AS IS. The manufacturer is not required to provide the latest update. Yes it would be nice of them if they did. I 'm just saying they do not have a legal obligation. So you may be behind in terms of software update but your phone will continue to function the same way when you bought it. \"fragmentation\" is just a buzz word that a certain camp created.why android?- you are not tied to one computer AND one specific software to manage your phone and the content. you can use any computer, anywhere, with or WITHOUT a cable to manage your files and contents (use \"File expert\" from market). if you like having freedom/option/flexibility, then Android is for you.- lots of free utilities and application- free navigation by google (assuming you have data service)- full web browsing with Flash. I'd like to point out regarding Flash, that certain group claims that Flash is a battery drainer. Well, what doesn't drain batter on a phone? When you use facebook on your phone, it drains battery. when you skype call on phone, it drains battery. when you watch youtube, it drains battery. So what's the problem? Why single out Flash? Allowing Flash on a certain platform will make a big dent in that platforms profit. Therefore they have made up silly reasons as a justification. Interestingly the same camp can't enjoy Blu-Ray movies. Web experience without Flash player is incomplete. I will not be told what is good for me. I would like to decide on my own. Thank you.Some cool apps to have:- File Expert (wireless file manager)- Remote Desktop (send, receive sms, manage your phone over wifi)- Auto Answer (auto call answer in speaker mode. highly useful when driving, never have to touch or look at your phone!)- Gesture Search (by google. quickly search entire phone for contact, music, files etc, very accurate)- ZDbox (multi purpose utility, app locker, info etc)- and much more!just few things:- unlocked. you can use it worldwide, with any gsm. 3G speeds will vary.- AWS/1700 band for 3g. Because at&t; will acquire tmobile, it remains uncertain as to what at&t; will do with that band. At&t; uses 850 for 3G. This phone will work with at&t;, just not at 3G.The only thing I didn't like was the lack of sd card slot. You're stuck with 16GB built-in storage.

As a computer tech, I'm used to removing whatever OS comes with a new computer and laying down a pure, unadulterated version, so I was attracted to Nexus for its clean Android install.  Before I bought the Nexus I tried out the HTC Sensation, but found I didn't like the tweaks applied to the OS.  The physical build and the OS of the Nexus are perfect.  As soon as I installed my SIM, booted and entered my gmail account info, I found an update to the system awaiting me - to Gingerbread version 2.3.4. Download, install and reboot were lightning fast.Because it's an unlocked phone and because of the clean Android, there aren't resource-hogging apps you can't remove.  The S-AMOLED screen is a noticeable upgrade to my previous AMOLED and I can comfortably reduce brightness without compromising clarity and readability - AKA, good for battery life.Some physical Likes:* The power button is on the upper right side of the phone, which I find to be the better choice ergonomically over power at the top of the case (iPhone and HTC).* The very slight curve to the phone means when you hold it up to your ear, it doesn't touch your face.  I mostly use earbuds (I don't like Samsung's - it's the only thing I've found so far I don't like), phone speaker or in-car Bluetooth, but not having face marks on the screen is a biggie.* 5 MP camera takes excellent photos.  Have sampled low-light using the flash and with flash off.  Great shots either way; as to be expected, focus is sharper when flash is used.* Phone itself feels substantial.  Comments about plastic vs. metal and glass are accurate about materials used, but the overall effect and impression is not \"cheap\".Some Performance Likes:* Fast!  It's not 4G, but on HSDPA I'm consistently getting download speeds of 6 - 7 Mbps and HSUPA uploads of 2 - 2.5 Mbps. Combined with the pleasantly fast processor, I can tether my laptop at speeds better than most Wi-Fi spots.  And the feed is Free!  Love that!* Battery life is pretty good.  Sampling: with phone up for 20 hours giving weather reports, streaming Pandora via Bluetooth to car stereo for an hour along with two 50-minute Bluetooth conversations, battery was still at 17% when I recharged.* Sound quality is very good, both for calls and for music/general audio. Ringer levels max out to LOUD (the trial of the HTC Sensation demonstrated a too-low max sound output).  Voice calls are very clear, both input and output.  Recent trial with a caller using OOMA (with some interference on their end) generated a positive review and cell-to-cell and cell-to-landline both are excellent.Dislikes:* funky earbuds - great sound, but won't stay in my ears* back of case is hard to openOverall, VERY highly recommend.

Google left firmware updates for Android in the hands of carriers and manufacturers, causing all sorts of problems with platform fragmentation. The Nexus S (and before it, the Nexus One) are an answer to that problem. The phone gets updates straight from Google and Samsung, and will get updates before any other phone. This means that you can buy it with confidence, knowing that when Android 2.4 or 4.0 rolls off the assembly line in the future, the Nexus S will have it, and you won't be stuck with some other phone, wondering when (if ever) you will get that update that is necessary for all those fun new features, and to run those exciting new apps (preventing the pain many owners of phones running 1.6 are experiencing).The hardware is alright. I find the curved screen is uncomfortable to hold against my ear, but does alright. My unit has very rare instances of random rebooting, but never while I was using it. It seems a tad low on the RAM side, but powerful enough on the CPU side. Storage is broken up into 1GB of \"Phone\" storage, and 15GB of \"USB\" storage (\"USB Storage\" taking the place of SD Card storage on other phones). I'd prefer to move that around a bit, so I could have at least 2GB of \"local\" (It's all local, but not all apps treat it this way) storage, but it's not that big an issue. I also have occasional reception issues, but that may have more to do with T-Mobile's coverage in my area, than it does to do with my phone.3G is snappy, WiFi is quick, Bluetooth is reliable, I haven't been able to test NFC, though. Call quality is good, photo quality is about what you would expect from a middle level phone. A bit disappointed I don't have 720p video recording, but the 480p quality is good enough (but low light performance is worse than the recording preview lets on). The front-facing camera is OK, at best, with worthless low-light performance. Battery life is as advertised (if it doesn't give you enough time, look at apps like Juice Defender to get about 1.5x more life out of your battery, depending on use). The software is pretty solid, but I'm running into more crashes than I expected (including of stock Android system software!), however none of it is deal breaking (but quite annoying).Simple truth: this is a phone you will have to micromanage. I wouldn't buy it for my mom, but as a bit of a nerd who doesn't mind micromanaging my resources, it's pretty good (and I like not being beholden to T-Mobile for my updates - had that experience with the BlackBerry Curve 8900, and didn't like having to wait until long after Europe and Canada got their updates for me to get mine).", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best CellPhone for developers By Google", "Author": "pedrozopayares", "ReviewID": "R8YRSLB85ETDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sin duda el mejor equipo para desarrolladores.

The speed I get on speedtest.net app is 2692kbps down and 175kbps up which is consistent with AT&T; 3G Network in my area (Los Angeles) The two thing I dislike about this phone is that its plastic-ky and feels cheap compared to the Nexus One which I previously owned and that it has no external SD card slot.Prior to buying this phone, AT&T; send me a SMS that says they will be moving me to a different plan because of the device I'm using, and this happened with Galaxy Tab, HTC Inspire 4G and Motorola Atrix 4G so those of you that are using AT&T; and are considering getting a new device, be warned.  I had no choice but to get this device which is the best Android phone currently that works with AT&T; and its 3G network.I rate this item 4 stars for the lack of external sd and cheap feel.** July 28th 2011I ordered another one since the price dropped but Amazon sent me the i9020T instead of the i9020A.

Few days ago my phone did not turn on, so I did all the usual troubleshooting (take out the battery, sim, soft reset) then call Samsung customer service. The rep asked for the serial and IMEI numbers and told me that I am still within the warranty. But then the good news ended. He asked if I had the original bill of sale (receipt) and it turned out that not having the receipt or purchasing the phone second hand automatically voids my warranty. I asked to speak to a supervisor but the result was the same. The representative even mentioned that if you \"buy phone unlocked on the internet\" this will void the warranty. To add insult to injury, the supervisor explained that Samsung does not have any uniform policy for off-warranty repairs. He offered to give me some numbers stating that \"each shop is different\" and I have to haggle directly with them in terms of estimates, costs, etc. This was in contrast with my experience with HTC that honored the warranty on their Nexus One phone regardless where it was purchased, as long as the phone has not been modified.So buyer beware - Samsung's warranty is non-transferable and depends who you bought the phone for and requires the original bill of sale.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for a year then failed", "Author": "Ctown", "ReviewID": "R3JWC9IMDOT5CX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought two of these phones in May of 2011.

Why you ask?1. The Super AMOLED Display - an awesome feast for the eyes, compared to the SLCD or QVGA. The only drawback, if you could call it that a con, is that the white is not quite white, rather it's \"muffled\". Makes it easier to stare into a white screen, something I could not easily do with my previous LCD phone - Nokia 6120.2. Complete, native and engulfing Android experience! No carrier bloatware, the pure thing! I like freedom, and Android gives me just that - \"Do whatever you want with this OS\" they say. I will.4. The specs - let's face it. If you bought an Android phone with specs as this one's, yo will just want to mess with it! I overclocked my cpu from 1,0 GHz to 1,4 GHz and it was just blazing! That requires a root, though. Just so you know.5.It has all the functions I need, and so much more! That's right, if you feel bored with the Nexus S, you are either a supersmart person, who has tried and done all there is, or you just were overwhelmed by the possibilities and decided to use it as is.That's pretty much it. Make sure you get a case for your phone, I got Amzer. Actually makes the phone laying in my hand more secure.

Got my phone back and within hours it was right back to the same issue. When I called in it turns out they replaced the power plug and re-imaged the phone. Now obviously they didn't properly test the device before sending it back to me. The only compensation was an \"upgrade\" to 2-day shipping. To get \"priority\" repair I would have to call in once they received the device. So I did all that, waited on hold for 30 minutes and got it upgraded. 5 days later my phone still hasn't shipped back.

I used to have an IPhone 3G before that. Compared to that (toy) this is like a tech person's dream come true. Being a Nexus I was able to get all the major updates from Google as soon as they were released. Being a Nexus it also protected me from specialized Android versions installed by the Carrier. For tech folk who haven't used an open phone before, its like the feeling you get when you go outside to get some fresh air after being in a dank basement for days at a time, not because its open (OS updates) alone, just the fluidity of UI feels different (as if unbound from chains)  not having being messed with the carriers.Battery: I have had much better luck with this phone than with my IPhone 3G. Mostly because (I think), I turned off; BlueTooth, NFC & auto Screen brightness. And I make like 1-2 phone calls a day and text messages. Listen to Audio books for about 1-2 hours each day. At the end of the day I still have battery left (25%) easily. But I do have to restart the phone once every other week or so.... (C'mon for a UI enabled device thats not bad at all).Usability: Good fluid User Experience, when too many applications aren't running at once. There isn't a SD port (perfect for me, they are security holes anyway), so you are limited with the onboard drive which is divided into virtual (SD Card) and onboard space. The Screen is big enough for butter/fat fingers such as mine... but some folk bigger than me might have typing issues. The keyboard is awesome (SWIPE), the Mrs, has been jealous from day one (she had an IPhone). Games are quick although I had to give up on Angry birds, not because of the phone, but the Game over the updates has gotten bulky with too many ads.Portability: Its very light, smooth, slick and shiny, which makes it a little tricky to pull out in a pinch, chances of a drop. I usually use a thin profile leather case, one that I can fit with the phone in my pocket (shirt or jacket pocket / jeans pocket). Once, i drop-kicked the phone on asphalt (by mistake of course, while running trying to catch a bus). May be it was the phone or the case, but there were no scratches, or breaks, it didn't miss a beat.Anyhoo... I have been using cell phones since the day Motorola started building them without the box-with-a-handle. Never had a better experience. Could there be a better phone? Sure.

The lack of a custom car mount anywhere on the market a baffling and sloppy oversight and does not bode well for the availability of accessoriesNow however, I'm frankly growing really annoyed with more significant issues.

I'm curious to know what other formats it's supposed to be able to play, as everything that i saw on the topic said the number is limited and i don't want to wrestle with the tech just to play a vid. It also has no search function for the android stock email app unless you're on gmail (yes, really), and the earpiece volume can't be set low enough - minimum setting is what I would call dangerously loud, keep this thing away from your kids if you want them to be able to hear later in life.

The iPhone easily has double the range. I prefer to use my Nexus S, but I have found myself slowly relying on the iPhone more and more due to this issue. When I'm carrying both phones, I'm often able to use Wifi on my iPhone when the Nexus S is not able to connect. It is still very good, but I guess when I found out that it could be even better, it kinda ruined it for me.2) Battery life: I have owned the phone for less than a year, but I'm already noticing a significant degradation in battery life. So while it is cool to have GPS and Wifi, I find that I have to turn them off to be able to get through the work day without charging the battery. The phone was better in the beginning. Not sure if the issue is with the battery, or the fact that I upgraded to Android 4.0, or maybe more battery is being used when Wifi signal is weak? Once again, my iPhone can sometimes go almost 2 days without charging, but the Nexus S has a hard time getting through one day.3) Software Updates: When I first bought the phone, I really wanted to upgrade to Android 4.0. However, I did not find a way to easily do it. I had to wait several weeks before I got the option to upgrade through the OS software update feature. I'm not sure why they don't let you just see all possible upgrades and choose what you want from the beginning?Overall this is a very good phone. But the iPhone 4S has several advantages, even though I prefer Android devices in general.

A rant of longing, disappointment & frustration.Since December of 2010 I have been longing to get my hands on a Samsung Nexus S smartphone. As a Samsung Galaxy S user already (Captivate SGH-I897) I was sure that the Nexus S was the ultimate evolution in the Galaxy S line. Fast forward to December of 2011, Finally... a deal on a Nexus S that seems reasonable. Grab it. Delivered. Unboxed. Battery & SIM in. Power up... Ahhh... Pure Google... wait, the capacitive buttons are all in different places than my Captivate. Keep pushing the wrong one due to muscle memory. Oh well I'll learn. Can't see the capacitive buttons outside or just in a moderate lighting environment either... The LED backlight is very dim... Search Google Mobile Forums... Normal condition, they're just not real bright compared to other Samsung Android devices. Oh well I'll learn where the buttons are. Install apps. Wait some of my apps that run just fine on the Captivate don't want to run correctly, I thought Pure Google was supposed to be better?!?! Oh well... I can live without a couple of apps. Why is the back button flashing all of the time it seems to have a mind of it's own. Even backs me out of apps to the home screen quite often. Search Google forums again... Known issue... Google blames Samsung... Samsung blames Google... Hardware issue, no, software issue. No resolution in sight. Hit up support on Twitter... \"Haven't heard of that in awhile, I'll pass your info along and stay tuned\" Just got blown off. Oh well, I can live with some quirky behavior once in awhile. As long as it doesn't get worse. Disappointment sets in. I know that I have had this phone on to charge all night and it says charged but the battery only says 95%?? Oh well it must be full if the Pure Google Android OS says so, right? Search forums... Known issue... No fix forthcoming... OK shot some video of the kids and it's time to see it on the HDTV... What?!? No DLNA support on the Nexus S?!?! And the video isn't even in HD like the Captivate?!?! Fast forward again to January of 2012... Gingerbread is finally released for the Captivate making it, at least to some degree, a modern smartphone once again. All of the things that the Nexus S can't do the Captivate can. The few things that Nexus S does that the Captivate doesn't I don't need. I didn't run into 1 RFID tag to scan using the NFC on the Nexus S and whenever the NFC is turned on I set off the \"Theft Protection System\" just walking in or out of the store at Target, Walmart & Eddie Bauer just to name a few. Oh well I can live with the NFC turned off... Wait, why should I have to settle?!?! This is supposed to be the \"Flagship\" Galaxy S device. The device that all other Galaxy S devices aspire to be. Instead I find myself increasingly frustrated by this device. Visually it's a knockout but in practice, it seems to lag behind the phones it was supposed to be ahead of. No SD card slot... What?!?! Really?!?! I have 32GB in my Captivate in addition to the 16GB onboard. I have come to the point in my relationship with my Nexus S that we must part ways. The back capacitive button issue seems to be getting worse with no fix in sight from either Samsung or Google. The battery issue... no resolution there either. Now the delay of Ice Cream Sandwich for an unspecified time... Last straw. Remove SIM, Factory reset & re-box... Back it goes. Captivate, for all of your issues you're back for the time being.

Though not as pretty in terms of the UI as the STC Desire S.So why the 1 star rating?  Simple;  Google's customer help/support/service is downright awful.  How bad?  Lets put it this way:The Samsung Nexus S has a factory flaw.  Every once in a while there is a device that becomes stuck (by stuck i mean ZERO control whatsoever), and the only way to reboot the phone is by physically taking out the battery and putting it back in.You initially experience this a few times a day, but soon enough you begin experiencing it over 10...20...30 times a day.  Eventually, the device becomes completely stuck and no longer boots at all.This incident is what's happening to me, but I'm not the only one who's experiencing it.  Many people have submitted this complaint to Google on their support site (listed below) with ZERO feedback from Google regarding the matter.If you want to risk being one of those unlucky few who have to remove their battery more than ten times a day, then maybe this phone is for you.  However, be warned: Google is notorious for not replying to its public regarding its products.  This is happening now with this freezing issue, it is happening now with low availability of other languages on the phone, it is happening now with the inability to connect the phone to an ad-hoc network, and it happened before with the inability to purchase a Nexus One phone back in the day through Google's website.Do note, all of these issues are non-existent on the iPhone.  I personally left the iphone because i thought the Android would be a better choice...i was wrong.Take it from me, stick with the iPhone.  its a lot less headache and you dont have to put up with the huge amounts of problems the Android has without getting a single feedback from the developers.Freezing issue: [...]", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phone is OK, android may be the issue.", "Author": "G.G.", "ReviewID": "RI8GQIS2FW85F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There are VERY BASIC functions I need in a phone, that seem to have been lost midst all the frills and stupidity of availability of functions for what people call phones now days.  First and foremost I need to be able to make calls and receive calls quickly and easily.  This works OK, on the android but certainly more difficult than the old phone I had (nokia 6822). I have to have the ability to record. My day is too busy and I write to slow to be able to keep up with myself with a 'notepad'. I realize this stretches the idea of 'just a phone' a little but not too much I don't think. I've never had a phone that didn't have record capability built in.  For those that would tell you 'there's an app for that'  make them show you one that works before you believe them. I tried over 17 NEVER had one that worked. The other two, what I call basic, functions I need are a stopwatch and countdown timer. These should not really be that hard and again never had a phone without these built in to the clock.  While android does have 'apps' available for these functions now I have to have 3 applications on my phone to do a single function (time keeping) that was always just 'part of the phone' before.  The following issues are probably due to ignorance but I couldn't put up with the two previous issues and had to return the phone and go back to my nokia as it just works better. The first relates to the ability to record.  There were very few 'ringtones' available on this device. Not that this is an issue as I've always recorded my own.  Having the ability to put my own 'sounds' as ringtones enabled me to not only get the sounds I liked but give different clients different tones so I could know by the ring if I had to answer or not ALSO gave me the ability to pick or create sounds I could HEAR. Most of the 'builtin' ring tones on, at least this phone I couldn't hear very well and in a noisy room or car I was missing calls all the time.  This phone is very difficult to hold.  If did end up keeping it a case would have been mandatory as the whole front of the phone is a touch screen and anywhere your fingers may fall on the sides are different buttons too.I didn't give up on this phone right away It had A Lot of VERY cool features. GPS, Voice to text (very accurate), Voice to function (very accurate), usable web surf and most important mobile hot spot. All and all A really GREAT PHONE.  As much as I liked these features and wanted to keep the phone I was losing too much business not having the basic features and ultimately had to return it.  I'm still looking for a 4g phone without a carrier I can use.

The Nexus S is the only workable Android phone on the market. Why I say this is that Android phones are battery eating gimmicks that are pretty much completely useless for anything except impressing geeky first dates for 15 minutes max before the hors-d-oeuvres arrive. Unlike the venerable Blackberry, the Android has no proper message integration. You also have to run from charger to charger and some won't power on if the battery is flat until it has recharged sufficiently.Some will silently use up all their internal phone memory and then drop SMS messages or stop working altogether. No, this is the not the user's fault: they ship in a non-working state. Some ship with so much useless bloatware that you spent your first ten hours un-installing and dis-abling all the garbage apps you are never going to use. Androids also don't generally come with a proper keyboard which is indespensible for typing long emails.So basically you don't want an Android.HOWEVER if you have especially decided that you DO want an Android for some wierd reason, (I wanted an app to tell me the altitude of the Ski lift I was at. Plus I wanted Skype and a proper Web browser.) then, you need to get a Nexus S.There is basically no other Android phone that isn't going to waiste more of your time managing it than you spend actually using it. Why? Because this Android phone is produced by the people that made the Android OS (it would seem). They have fine tuned to to more-or-less actually work.This basically means that it has a reasonable (not fantastic - don't even think about using that word) battery life. It also has an acceptably responsive interface.Now don't go telling me that it is a wonderful phone \"compared to other Androids\". This doesn't mean anything.It is an \"acceptable\" phone in a sea of lies and deceit.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Google's foray into being Evil", "Author": "gl", "ReviewID": "RZXWB9YDD1IEA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I loved this phone for all of two months, then it started freezing.
