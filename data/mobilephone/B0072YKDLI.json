To the phone: I was really excited to charge it and start figuring out the phone. First of all, I bought this phone to text and call, also to use the GPS because I have my iPhone to do anything else. The Samsung Galaxy S heats up real fast, doesn't matter what you are doing. Since I bought it to make calls, I noticed that if I hang up the phone, it calls the person back right after it and the screen is freezing which means I can't hang up again or do anything. The voice qualitiy is alright, I hear ticking every now and then. The texting is also good, anything else is just bad. So if you are looking for a phone to text and call - buy it, if you are looking for a phone also to listen to music, play games, video chat, take pictures and anything else - go buy an iPhone !! Oh and another thing: The battery life of this Samsung sucks !!! It's so bad, I went to bed and the battery was on 80 something %, after I woke up I wanted to check my phone and it tells me to charge it because the battery is about to die. I wasn't doing anything, nobody called or texted me. There was no use of the phone but the battery was about to die. I was thinking about to send it back to get my money because it's not worth 140$ !!! Oh and when I got the phone I unpacked it full of excitement. The plastic package of the battery and the charger was already open, it's supposed to be closed so I was wondering if someone else had this phone before me?
