I am not pleased at all with the hands free. The volume from the ear piece is not the quality I have come to expect from original accessories. The sound of the mic according to my wife is distant. Again not the quality of an original in my opinion. I have browsed the inside of the phone. I am a long time motorolla user so it was very familiar. I have a plantronics bluetooth in the US and when I get home I will try it with the phone.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Baghdad!", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "do not buy this phone", "Author": "brian jeffers", "ReviewID": "RY3MY61V6XW11", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "do not buy this phone, it is defective and does not work. it will not charge the battery at all, i spent extra money thinking it was just a defective battery when in reality it was the phone itself that was defective. dont waste your time or money on this phone save yourself some grief!Motorola RAZR V3i Unlocked Phone with Camera, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Silver/Gray)", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "sorry excuse for a razr", "Author": "radar2", "ReviewID": "R3KLGMZ5TI21B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "worst cell phone i have ever purchased kept losing calls had hard time getting text messages from others.i had 2 razrs before they were great phones but thisone is a piece of crap.hadn t had a month and i ve already ordered a new phone,not a razr", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "lost of money", "Author": "gcruz", "ReviewID": "R3853QTAW6Y9CL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i asked for a new phone and he send me a beat up phone. its not worth buying from him. i work hard for my money and for someone to do that to someone else is wrong. he makes amazon look bad.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "very bad, seems used... very poor condition", "Author": "C.

The battery life on both is about 1 day if you do NOT use it and about 15 minutes if you do.  I've lost a few calls and I have to continuously charge both to be able to get a call in.  I realize I purchased without warranty, realizing this is an older phone, but would not recommend anyone buying them.  I ended up moving my SIM card to another phone altogether.  The other phone is being used, but away from a charger, I worry about losing calls.

The display screen came off at the time and the body of the cell phone was all scratched up. When I contacted DataVision and complained (they make you hold like 20 minutes before you are able to speak to any representative), they apologised and basically told me to buy a new one and the best they could do was to send it for free while sending the previous one back. I had to gift this one to a family member just before christmass and therefore I had no option but to go ahead with their offer. However the return postage on the return item was paid by me and I have not been reimbursed the money yet for the return item even after nearly a month has passed.
