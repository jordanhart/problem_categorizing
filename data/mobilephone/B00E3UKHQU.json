I got this to use on a second line and didn't expect much since it's fairly inexpensive. I am used to high-end phones but keeping price in perspective, this little phone is nice!Pros:- Good price- Very smooth, not much lag- Screen isn't super high res, but it's bright and clear- Responsive touch screen (I never have to tap a selection twice, it always picks up on the first try)- WiFi calling (perfect for low reception areas that have WiFi)- Enough memory for basic apps; don't expect to download an entire library of games and videos, but everything I use fits on it no problem- MicroSD memory card slot to expand memory- Great call quality, speakerphone quality, and both cell + WiFi reception- Runs Android 4.1 Jelly BeanCons:- 3 megapixel fixed focus camera with no flash (don't expect to be a mobile photographer, but it's fine for quick shots)- 3.5\" screen is smallish, but keep in mind that's the same size as the iPhone 4/4S- Single-core processorAll in all, it's a great phone. Just remember you can't pay less than $100 for a phone and expect it to perform as well as a $500 phone. If you're after good call quality, touch screen, and a low price, this is the perfect phone.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "Tim R Barrett", "ReviewID": "R22XJZ15KGG38C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought this phone yesterday and it is my first touch screen phone. Till now I've always had clam shell type flip phones but got to the point where I wanted to be able to do some stuff like check email and messenger and google maps etc. I bought this phone on a whim and now see the big geek sites don't exactly give it rave reviews. I guess they're just used to all the bells and whistles you get with the I phone and the top tier phones like Samsung galaxy etc but those cost a bundle and this phone was under $100 and if you want a great starter smart phone that won't break the bank this is it. I've had no problems, can't say it's real intuitive though partly it is but it's just very different from the type menus and things you do on a non smart phone. But it's not been too hard at all and I'm 65 so I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. I'm not a stranger to technology and get by ok on computers but this is definitely a new experience but I'm loving it. To me the phone is quick and responsive, the graphics are excellent and the 3mp camera does a fine job and there's all kinds of editing software to do different things with your pics once you've taken them. My big concern was being able to type texts on a touch screen as I was used to using predictive text (T-9) on my flip phone. But this phone comes with \"Swype\" a software program that lets you just drag your finger from the first letter of a word to the last and it automatically puts  your word in for you and it learns your words too! What could be better? The phone takes an SD memory card up to 32 GB which is awesome and since I was already on T-Mobile I just switched my sim card from my old phone to this one and was ready to go. I like the size of the phone , didn't want one of the bigh giant ones and this 3.5\" screen is just fine for me . I've had no problems seeing the details or reading, it's much bigger than any thing I ever had on a flip phone. So while this may not be the phone for you if you're used to a Galaxy 3 or Apple I-phone etc I would definitely recommend it as a first touch screen phone or to anyone who wants all the basic functions of web, text and calling but doesn't have or want to spend a bundle or finance a phone. And the calls are crystal clear and loud by the way. My callers tell me I sound much better than I did on my Sony Ericsson flip phone and I hear them better as well.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cheap smart phone for the price and it hides a great little secret", "Author": "W. Rose", "ReviewID": "R3LTG2BVK2E9ZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will first attempt to give some background on the decision that lead me up to the purchase of this phone.  I am an unconventional smartphone user.  I am not the person who uses a smartphone as an umbilical cord and would wither up and die if I couldn't send a text every 10 seconds or miss a single post on facebook.  I actually use my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet for most things.  So at this point one might ask why I would look at a smart phone.  To put it simply, I wanted airtime free wi-fi calling.  We do not have a house phone and we end up using our regular basic cell phone voice service with Verizon, which of course charges you airtime regardless of where you call from.  Since a number of the calls my wife and I make are from home, I figured we could cut down our airtime usage and probably drop to a lower package if we could supplement with wifi calling.  Wifi calling just isn't really practical with a 10 inch tablet (although it is possible with some apps), hence I started looking into a cheap smartphone.The phone itself isn't anything special by the standards of say the Samsung Galaxy S4, Nexus 4, Moto X or the HTC One, but at least it isn't running some super outdated version of Android, like some of the sub-$100 phones out there.  Having at least Android 4.1 (earliest release of Jellybean), it keeps up with the times pretty well for most things.  It's 1GB of internal memory is too small though, so definitely make use of the 32GB micro SD slot (I purchased a class 10 micro sd card from amazon for a whopping $20, so it is a cheap and easy fix).  It has 1GB of RAM so it won't be breaking any records in processing but it is sufficient for the vast majority of apps.  The 3.5 inch screen is usable but coming from a 10 inch tablet is quite an adjustment.  The swype keyboard on this small screen is useless in anything but a horizontal configuration and even then sometimes you won't hit the right letter, character, etc.  I have pretty small fingers, so the small keyboard can get in the way until you get used to it. The keyboard rotation/screen rotation can lag at times, but that is usually when it is updating apps.  Battery life can drain quickly, but as I discovered you can greatly improve that by switching backgrounds and eliminating the shortcuts you don't use (the stock background is an energy pig, so I would switch to another one). It also only has 3G and not 4G, so for those who are glued to their phones and need the very best and latest in i-net performance, it will probably fall a bit short. The last real downside to this phone that I should mention is for the folks who are interested in rooting.  This phone has a locked boot loader, so it is very limited in what can be done in that department.  Thing is though most folks who are interested in rooting probably wouldn't be interested in this phone to begin with.  Just more of an FYI for those wondering.Although, it seems like thus far I have been pointing out it's short comings, overall the phone is very hard to beat for the price. You can get it for $90+tax at your local Wal-Mart and when you compare what you get with other non-smart phones for the money there is no comparison.  The T-Mobile Prism II is in fact a re-badged Huawei 8686. So for those who are looking for the true nitty gritty in technical specs that is the make and model you should look for.  Although not well known in the US market, Huawei is a well known manufacturer in China (where every smart phone, except the Motorola is made anyways).  The phone itself is great for simple browsing and downloading and using apps and the function is pretty smooth barring the occasional screen rotation lag (every device will have screen rotation lag at some point though).  The thing that I was pleasantly surprised with this phone was that even though the screen is small, it's actually not that bad for reading text based applications. The words are clear and legible, which coming from a 10 inch screen, I was really worried about.  For games it all depends on what you like playing and what you are used to.Okay, now as mentioned in the title this phone does hide a great little secret, which is a real boon to folks who want a smart phone but don't want to pay for a data plan.  As the T-Mobile Prism II (aka Huawei 8686) is usually associated with pre-paid users it is one of the select few phones that gives you the option to keep regular voice cell service and circumvent the need for paying for data service and just use it as a wi-fi device. Even though T-Mobile claims that the old phone's sim card will not work or won't work properly, I am here to tell you that is false.  I took my old sim card out of my voice only pre-paid flip phone and popped it in the Prism II and it worked fine (although occasionally you get a thing from T-Mobile stating that you need to activate a data plan).  So I load up the apps and browse when ever I am on wi-fi but still get to use it as a regular voice pre-paid cell phone on the go and can use a number of apps to boot.  While you can use any deactivated smart phone as a wi-fi device, it's really tough to find one that will work as an active voice/text only cell phone without having to be forced to purchase a data plan/or pre-paid data to boot.  The thing that helps make that possible with this model is that like the regular basic phones it uses a full size sim card (whereas most smart phones that are GSM use a micro sim card).  As such this phone is a perfect answer to those of us who are content to use wi-fi and don't want to be saddled with paying for data but want the convenience and features of a smart phone.  I also discovered that the Google Maps/GPS service will work as long as you upload the start and end point while on wi-fi and then leave the app open when you leave.  I tested this out on a 124 mile one way trip to the mountains on a route devoid of any cell/data service and it was spot on with our progress and gave us voice commands right on cue.  I use magic jack for airtime free wi-fi calls to the US and Canada and although it has the occasional glitch (just as any cell service does) it works really well.  For those who aren't aware the company Magic Jack did actually make a free wi-fi caller (although it is a beta version), as such you don't pay a thing for it unlike the regular house phone service that they provide.  The one thing is that Magic Jack is a battery hog and you will need to force stop the application when you are done using it to get it to shut down.  It doesn't cause any errors with the phone or the app though, just a minor inconvenience.  Couple these features with the ability to run games, text reader applications, surf the web on wi-fi, and get rid of shortcuts or completely get rid of annoying apps that you could care less about and the purchase of less than $100 makes it well worth it over having just a basic phone that makes calls.For the record I keep my pre-paid phone, even though I have regular service with Verizon as a backup phone, phone number to give to businesses (so they don't bug me on my regular personal phone) and because it is so cheap.  I spend a whopping $100 a year on my voice service.  Hard to shut it down given all the aforementioned when you get all that for the price of a Netflix instant watch subscription.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent phone for the price, but has issues.", "Author": "O. Gonzalez \"nycwolf\"", "ReviewID": "R12IB1YXWK86Z2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad phone for the price. It comes with Android 4.1.1. here's my 2 cents about this phone.The Good: light weight, decent battery life. bright screen. MicroSD 32GB support, 480p resolution screen is clear.The Bad: Only has about 512MB of system ram so you must make sure you don't have too many things running in the background. You must remove battery before you can remove/insert MicroSD Card. Will not play back 720p Videos.Other: The Prism II seems to have a CPU that's about 15%-20% weaker than my Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant.Issue 1: When I'm listening to Music on the phone using standard headphones, & a call comes in, I have to disconnect the headphones to take the call because the phone \"thinks\" the headphones have a mic. I can hear the caller on the headphones, but the caller can't hear me. They really need to fix that. can't find any option to use the phones Mic while using Headphones during a call like I can with my Galaxy S2.Issue 2: When listening to Music, the phone on occasionally enters \"Voice Dialing\" mode. I installed WinAmp & the problem got better, & now only happens very rarely. Seems like there is an issue with the phone or it's software. I have contacted Huawei & informed them about this issue, hoping they can tell me whats causing it.Conclusion: This is the kinda phone you give to someone who's just getting their first Android Phone, or one you give to the Kids. Not for Power Users due to weak CPU, Lack of TV Output, or Low Resolution Screen. Plays Angry Birds just fine! You will have a great time on the s***ter!2 Stars removed.  1 for the Headphone Issue, 1 for the Voice Dialing issue.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "RSKNO77EWI9HK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone and easy to use.

I set out to find the most affordable Android phone possible.This is surely the most affordable. You won't find it in any store and the staff at T-Mobile can never get it for you. Why should they? The low-end for T-Mobile phones in a store is about $150. They don't want you to resist an impulse-buy. Plus, what's in the store is more expensive for a reason: they aren't Prism II's.According to specs, this phone is technically better than my aforementioned, 2+ year old Optimus S. But that means nothing. With a minimum of Android apps installed (currently 600MB used / 570MB free), this thing crawls.In the mere week that I've been using it, I've routinely waited 6-8 seconds for gestures to be recognized and processed by the OS. Browsing through music via Google Play is an exercise in tech-hate. Gestures will 'wait in line' and then execute long after you've messed with the phone. As a result, you will jump too far forward/backward when cruising through tracks.I've watched all kinds of instructions become executed - very slowly - and fully a MINUTE after I unintentionally queued them up because nothing was happening. Also, various applications will fail with cryptic \"APP has been closed\" messages. All audio will stop for 5 seconds if you view Settings. Even using all the default apps, you'd think the thing would be better optimized.I'm a Google-using fiend and almost all the apps I've used (Plus, Play, Play Store, Hangouts, just to name a few off the top of my head) have closed unexpected at some point or another.This thing begs to be rooted, and I will not disappoint, even though I hate that stuff. I've read other reviews opining that this is a good phone to give to new smartphone users. Unless your intention is to drive your friends away, I would recommend the opposite: Stay far away.The Prism II is the platonic ideal of CHEAP. It feels cheap in the hand. The screen brightness is awful. I knew this wouldn't be a great purchase, given my circumstances, but had no idea just how flawed this device is. This thing is cheap for a reason and I'm pretty sure it has to do with substandard hardware.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "RSMGAURK3VC2D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looking at the price of this compared to the big name smart phones, I was a bit apprehensive about buying it. So far I've been pleased with it. It recognized my old sim card, but it said that I wouldn't be able to use some of the features, like wi-fi calling, so I just used the sim card that came with the phone. Updating the sim card on my T-Mobile account was fast and easy.It does just about everything you need a smart phone to do, but there are a couple of downsides. There's no flash for the camera and the system RAM is on the lower side so you can't keep too many apps open or it will slowdown.Overall, this phone seems to give you the best bang for your buck. It's great for a first time user.

This phone is great.  Just insert your old SIM card and it is pretty self explanatory.  This is my first touch screen so it is amazing and exciting to me.  So many people who give this average or below average reviews seem to be phone elitists and snobs which bothers me. If some minute thing doesn't agree with their tastes they trash the phone-common people it's just a phone.  This day and age everyone is attached to their phone like it's one of their child.  I only use this for calling, texting, and listening to music.  I have internet access on it, of course, but have no need for that since I use my computer at home for that.Anyway I highly recommend this phone it is great.  The best part of this phone is it has voice activated text messaging.  So if you don't want to press the letter buttons while texting you just hit record say what you want to say and the phone translates what you said into a text message and you hit send.  It is great and is quite accurate in translating what you say into text. I highly recommend this phone, and try getting it off of e bay or walmart for the cheapest price.Btw if anyone knows how to transfer music, pictures, and videos from your pc to this phone using the t mobile usb cable let me know I am having trouble doing it for some reason and it is not working.

This isnt a 4G phone like the optimus. once i started downloading my apps i was pleasantly surprised to see this phone actually downloads quicker and plays youtube videos better than my 4G optimus. only 512mb of RAM though so multitasking should be kept to a minimum. Bottom line. for under $100 this phone does what it should...but if possible spend that extra 70 or 80 bucks and roll with the optimus L9. its bigger, thinner and records awesome vids in 1080P and with much better resolution", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible Phone Had To Trade It At Verizon For A iPhone 5C", "Author": "Crystal", "ReviewID": "R2NR83U2GEFWE6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this phone November 1, 2013.

Finally on February 5th I went to Verizon to get a free iPhone 4S. Shockingly I found out I could trade in my horrible Prisim II for a FREE $100 iPhone 5C. I would not suggest this phone to anyone. Thankfully I got a better deal in the end by trading an $80 phone for a brand new $100 iPhone 5C. Don't waste your time or money with the Prisim II. Not everyone can afford a monthly plan due to deposits being so high. So I highly suggest to keep on researching for a better prepaid phone.
