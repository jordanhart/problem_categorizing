I use this card in conjunction with the 365 days card to optimize my usage.  In other words, according to my usage pattern, the 90 days service period is too short for 1350 minutes( I have triple minutes on my Tracfone and so 450 minutes will turn into 1350 minutes after I have installed the 450 minute card ).  Therefore, I would buy another card with 365 days service to extend my service period.  This approach works very well with me so far.  From a cost per minute standpoint, the 450 minutes card provides the lowest cost( around US$0.06/minute ).  Many times, additional bonus minutes are also available if one has the time to look for the bonus minutes code floating around the web.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "The transaction was smooth and easy", "Author": "Mark Bara", "ReviewID": "R1XYPWZPUX7QCF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The lack of the 5 stars has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the seller. It has EVERYTHING to do with Tracfone. Their customer service has gone fro top notch ,to just about the worst imaginable.

I entered the PIN and promo code and received credit for 450 minutes as opposed to the 1600 I was supposed to receive.

The next day, I found that the newly-added time had been removed from my account, leaving me without airtime.  I do not know why or how this happened.  I could not call Tracfone customer service because I had no more airtime.  I then tried to reach Tracfone online and was given a link to a chatroom to chat with a customer service representative who never appeared.  I needed cell phone service for my job so I switched to Verizon.After contacting the seller on Amazon, the airtime PIN was reactivated, which would presumably allow me to redeem the airtime I had purchased.  However, this happened after I had already attempted to work with Tracfone's (nonexistent) customer service, failed, and switched to Verizon.This product was faulty.  Complaining to the seller on Amazon may solve the problem but Tracfone's own customer service department is futile.

Click on \"Edit\"  next to the cc info. You'd think... No, the cc info is de-highlighted. Try to submit a \"trouble ticket\". Impossible. One screen only has two links: \"Yes\" and \"No\". I guess it's like Jeopardy: you have to divine the question. Got 3 codes, 3 different times. One worked (some diagnostic) but nothing happ'd. Two more got me \"Error: (17)\" / IMPOSSIBLE TO ADD MIN. ON THE DAMNED WEBSITE - AGAIN!! Go to a land line. Know what? If you call their website \"stupid\" they'll hang up on you. So will they if you start calling it \"splendid\". For the 2nd time, it took me an excessive amt. of time (REPEATED FAILURES) to get min. added OVER THE PHONE (landline). I hate their damnable piece of crap website. After its frequent failures, it will tell you \"Call 1-800-[etc.]. What DON'T they tell you? They don't tell you: \"Hey, if you drive to a landline, and it's after 10pm, the ph. menu will say (eventually): \"Please hold for the next available operator\", but what the incompetards will NOT tell you is, \"No one is here, bec. we're CLOSED\". I ONLY learned this after calling in again and choosing \"2 for Spanish\", where they DO tell you that they're closed. Utter incompetence, and worse? Customer contempt. Once it took me over an HOUR to add min. over the phone. This time? 25min . Absolute contempt for their customers. I'm sure the people who fielded my complaints will get right on those pesky website glitches. The CS lady was a nice ditz: It was as if if I never made the statements I did-- then she'd ask the most dingbat questions. I hate this damned phone about 1% as I hate their idiotic website. The glitches I dealt w/ that the lady assured me would be handled existed 1 yr ago. Oh, to \"Edit\" your CC info, you do not USE the \"Edit\" link that does not let you edit, you have to go to some obscure link, then chose some additional obscure link. That's what the Philippines told me. UN. REAL. Absolutely unreal. I hate this company like no other.
