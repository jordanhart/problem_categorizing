I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory.  The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear  - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging.  It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones).  I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on.  This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations.

It's not bad, but it's not light-years ahead of other devices either.It's not without bugs or quirks.  Most outstanding:  it has problems with DHCP with my wifi-cable modem where I need to turn wifi on the phone off and then on again in order to get traffic flowing again.  This need has revealed another quirk where, on occassion, Wifi will *not* turn off.  Sometimes the slider (on-off switch) bounces back to the \"on\" position.  Sometimes it looks like it turns off, but when I go back to the main settings screen and then return to the wifi settings screen, the wifi switch is back on again.  In this situation, I go through a cycle of turning wifi off 3 - 8 times before it actually remains off.Text entry is simply uninspired.  For all Apple's much bally-hewed design talents, they certainly didn't waste any cleverness surging beyond a basic keyboard.  The phone's auto-complete feature is nice, but I had better auto-completion on a Palm V over 10 years ago.  I pine for T9 to accelerate text entry.Built-in email is well integrated & supports multiple accounts.  Build-in calendar is less versatile.Speaker phone is adequate, but I've had better from cheaper phones.Oh, and if you only want to use wifi-sourced data on your phone & avoid data plan fees, iPhones work perfectly fine without a data plan.At the risk of stating the obvious:  if you don't have a data plan, you don't get google maps, email, etc. when you're out-of-range of a wifi network.  For me, this is fine.  The carriers categorize text messaging as non-data, so you can pay for that if you like.Sure, without data you take a hit on certain (& very few) phone features; the most significant & least obvious, I'd say, would be the log of outstanding voicemails the iPhone can show you.-- Without data, you just get an indicator that you have voicemail to be listened to.-- With data, you get an inventory of who left you voicemails at what times.***All*** iPhone apps have settings to enable/disable data transfer over the phone network.  The phone also has a \"master\" setting for this, too.DO NOT let Verizon, Sprint, etc. tell you that a data plan is necessary to operate one of these on their networks.  It's simply not so, and -- unless they've changed their tunes in the past 2 years -- they will not tell you this.  Verizon & Sprint (and probably all other carriers) will make you get a data plan to have one of these on their network, and they won't tell you anything different.  When I've asked them, they've been unequivocal on this requirement.  Their justification for this is completely bogus; namely that smart phones need data to operate.I've learned, however, of 2 ways to get around this requirement.1 - get a pay-as-you-go account2 - piggy back your iPhone on an account with someone else's iPhone that has a data plan.(in my case, my wife's work pays for her phone & plan; I piggy-back on the account, but don't use data.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "P.o.s.", "Author": "vickie wallace", "ReviewID": "R28W3F6XGZO2JM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Phone wouldn't work 10 minutes after I got it.

But there's also more security, more safety, more updates that roll out to everyone as soon as they're ready, more people using an iPhone 4 who still get to use pretty much the same features as the iPhone 5 because the software is available for both phones at the same time.The app selection is better, the best apps come out for iPhone first and the screen is great now that they've put the whole 'Retina Display' thing out there, the only real negative is the screen size, which in today's world, should really be bigger than 3.5\".
