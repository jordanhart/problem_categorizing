Much better than the iPhone, HTC and Motorola displays. It truly is amazing and works good in all conditions including outdoors. The Samsung Captivate (android phone) also has the same screen. If fact, Samsung is now switching all their future phones to use AMOLED.SOUND:The Speaker and call quality is very good. I have used a lot of phones and I can tell you this is the best yet. The speaker phone sounds just as good as a full size home phone. Compared to my daughters new iPod, the Focus speaker is way better, and she even admitted it.SPEED:Windows Phone 7 powered by the snapdragon 1GH processor is very fast. No lag, no screen delay, no issue flicking and scrolling. Fast internet browser as well.FEATURES:I am very impressed how polished Windows Phone 7 is, and I think its going to get better.  Microsoft is putting a great deal of money into it and consumers get the reward.  The Windows Phone 7 live tiles are so much better than old school icons on most other phones.SUMMARY:This phone is truly ahead of its time. There are people that will say the iPhone or Android is better, but that is only bias because they probably have never used this phone and compared the features I mentioned above.  I am also looking forward to the WP7 mango update that has 500+ more features.  This phone is amazing.- UPDATE 11/22.  Running latest windows phone 7.5 mango update. Works great. A lot more high quality apps are now available. My wife got the same phone for free at ATT with 2 year contract. For $200 samsung now has a Focus S (based on the Galaxy S 2) which I guess is the next gen for this phone.

The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.)While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint.I am on AT&T;'s Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so.There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner.Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to. There are no reminders for missed calls or text messages. So, I do have to keep looking whenever I am away from my phone.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever used.

The screen is gorgeous, the WP7 OS is responsive and intuitive, and most of all it actually works as a phone! As a previous dedicated Iphone owner, I can say that I have absolutely no regrets in switching, and I can see the jealousy of my family (who are still Apple nuts) whenever I let them mess around with the interface.The only cons I can put against it are that it only comes with 8 gigs initially (which is just ridiculously low these days), but I stuck another 16 in with an sd card I had lying around. Some people seem to be having an issue with not having their cards work, but I've never had a problem. Also-and this is incredibly minor-there's no gapless playback on the Zune software. I know only about 5 people will actually care (or even notice), but it's slightly irritating at times.In it's current state, I would already put the Focus and WP7 at the cream of the mobile crop, but with the Mango update coming in a week or two, I really can't see any other OS coming near to holding a candle to it. A lot of people are still understandably skeptical due to Microsoft's less than stalwart track record with mobile devices, but WP7 fixes every issue of the past and does what Apple has quit doing-innovating.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "I917 : experience & suggestions", "Author": "Bos Vinamou", "ReviewID": "RWUNOWH4II92M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Two I917 purchases -- first one defective, inaudible ear volume. I did some online checking but was unable to determine if cell-to-ear volume was a specific model weakness.  Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new.To date I've found my second phone to be sleek, with the Windows 7 system impressive.  Apps are increasingly available and diverse, not the walled garden of Iphone.Of contacting Samsung:  dealing with customer support (Samsung or any other) be aware you likely will interact with a rep--working from a script--who has no cellular expertise.  Check the manual carefully before entering the customer service ordeal.You'll be directed through two corrections, soft reset, and if the problem remains, hard reset. (You can find both on any model via web search).

Later on moving onto Android based phones and enjoying those as well. When there was a lot of positive feedback on windows 7.5 mobile and my other phone being drowned in beef stock. I decided to take the plunge with this little gem.Upon receiving the phone the packaging was no frills, and made me nervous. Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good!The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind.I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed.Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required)Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough.

I researched the phone to double check it is compatible with AT&T;'s GoPhone Prepaid program and sure enough it is (AT&T; sell this phone in their GoPhone section only at $499). The  phone was delivered the day after in good condition and it was sold by BLUTEKUSA.  The phone looks new and has no noticeable fingerprints or marks that would indicate it's been used, although the box it came in was obviously opened before. It came with the phone, charger, and a pair of headphones.The Samsung Focus is pretty easy to set up. It asks for date and time as well as a Windows Live ID which can be synced with later if so desired. The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color. There are physical buttons for the Power button, Camera, and Volume Control. It's plastic, so the phone is pretty light, although to the point where one might consider it cheap. The back is a thing plastic case that snaps onto the phone. Taking off the back is a bit on the scary side as I felt I might have snapped it the few times I tried. Overall the phone is a nice build just not one that screams high quality.The Camera takes really good pictures and I was impressed with the 720p video recording as well. Again, not high-end, but it's above average nonetheless.I updated the Samsung Focus to Windows Mango and the software is fantastic. The interface is easy on the eyes and is smooth. I have not seen any hiccups on this phone even though it only comes with 512mb ram, although that seems to be a restriction from Microsoft. To me, it has just as much polish as iOS (the operating system that the iPhone/iPad run) although it lacks a lot of the customization of Android (not really missing it). It integrates Facebook and other social network clients into one area and so far I love it. The keyboard is easy to use as well and have not had any trouble misspelling words.*Edit* Fixed problem with the SIM Card. This phone is excellent.

The phones were speedily shipped and came fully boxed and packaged and SIM unlocked.Windows Phone 7  is a joy to use - slicker and more elegant than either Android or Blackberry phones. I like it more than Apple phones as well. The handset and the interface both feel modern and high tech and a very easy to use. And the text on the phone is big - which makes it much easier to read than any other phone. Everyone who has seen it wants one.Two things you need to know.The phone has an AT&T; logo - which is a bit of a surprise when you first turn on the phone. And there is some bundled AT&T; software that takes 30 seconds to uninstall. So this is more of a very minor one off solvable issue than anything.The second is that the phone operating system needs to be upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 7.5 (Mango). This requires downloading and installing Microsoft Zune on your computer, hooking your phone to your computer, and checking for upgrades. The upgrade process also takes 30-40 minutes. This is a bit of a hassle.

You have the mango update right away after you connected the phone to your computer.

The zune marketplace for music and bing search that is really good, you can search for songs even if you don't know the names.Not everything is perfect battery life is only for one day, you have to charge it everyday. You don't have skype and sugarsync apps but they said they are coming soon.The bad part of Windows Phone 7.5 is that you need to integrate the memory card to the file system. Its not hot swap and also you cant transfer files with the memory card because it gets formatted during the integration process. TheThe only way to transfer files to the phone is by mail or skydrive. With the Focus you don't get the Hotspot feature.For the user that is in Venezuela you can use the marketplace, i am in El Salvador.

Before I bought the Samsung Focus I owned the HTC Surround, Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about a WP7 Phone.Dimensions and Characteristicsthe screen size is bigger than iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I prefer the Focus, the image is brighter and color look awesome. This phone is really slim and light, the opposite of HTC Surround, which is much thicker and heavier because of the sliding speaker. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience, but of course, the image quality is much lower than using a digital camera.User InterfaceMicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 (now WP7.5) with \"Metro\". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are \"alive\" and are not static icons like the iPhone or Android or Blackberry. The tile gives you information about your contacts or a group of contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger, Twitter and LinkedIn). Now many applications are using live tiles to give you specific information so don't have to launch the app to see some important information. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them.Zune vs. iTunesAfter using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the user interface is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod.TouchscreenI think Focus' touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!)Marketplace vs. AppstoreIn Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms (but Apple opened many items last week for Ecuador). In US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Google Maps (even though you have gMaps) and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered be the end of 2011). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software, but now you can find almost every great application in WP.KeyboardIf you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that helps you to correct misspelled words (several languages now with Mango Update). Even though 99% of the time I write in Spanish, I have to say that the spell checker works great.Office HubI expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC (without using Skydrive), or transfer files from the PC to the Phone.ConclusionIn conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like WP7 (which is completely different of Windows Mobile. WM was the worst OS I have used!).With Mango Update (also known as Windows Phone 7.5) you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS, but not everything is perfect, now I have to charge the phone twice a day, actually now I have a charger at home, at office and the car (I hope there is a way to fix this because the battery lasts some time 5 or 6 hours, if you play a game then it will last 1 hour).In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS.I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android. I also think this phone is better than HTC Surround due to a better screen, is lighter and has a better camera.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Updates: Great while it lasted", "Author": "Toby H.", "ReviewID": "R1EH735Q4D21QQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone works flawlessly and even better after updating it thru Zune software installation.

Apple's iPhone was tempting because of its functionality, but it was so overly-hyped and trendy I had many second thoughts about it.  I've used an iPhone here and there before and it was simple, but just didn't feel like something I wanted in the long-term.  Windows Phone was already on the scene but there were no stores selling them at the time where I live, so after reading review after review, I decided to take a leap of faith and grab the Samsung I917, aka the Focus.The GOOD:  First, the operating system is head, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs, knees, calves and ankles above anything else on the market.  It's just so simple and intuitive, not to mention beautiful.  And unlike Android, it's the exact same from device to device, so the user experience is consistent.  Zune integration is beautiful.  I can sync all my Zune music on my computer to my phone either by plugging in or over a wi-fi connection.  I can also download from the marketplace over the air and then sync back to my computer next time I connect.  The People tab is great because it lets me see what all my contacts are doing over social networks all in one place.  The phone is also physically beautiful.  I especially like the pinstriped back of the case.  The device is thin and light and quick (after all, it's basically a first-gen Galaxy S).The BAD:  The phone is pretty plasticy, and while it's actually pretty tough, I would really like to see Samsung put out a \"pro\" version made of duraluminum, like their Series 9 laptops are made of.  I'm pretty rough on my phones, watches, etc, so I always appreciate rugged versions of products when applicable.  The build quality is good but it just doesn't feel overly tough to me, which is the basis of my 4-star rating.The UGLY:  Windows Phone marketshare.  Seriously, this OS is so amazing, so beautiful, and so simple to use, this should have been 15% - 20% by now in my opinion.  Give this phone a chance folks, you'll be glad you did.

Let me mention a few of the current downsides.* You must use Microsoft's Zune software to manage music.I prefer mp3 players which act like USB drives.

This Windows Phone doesn't work this way.There is apparently some registry hack to work around this, but it would be nice if Microsoft supported this out of the box.* No sleep timer - There are a couple of free ones on the marketplace, but they aren't ideal.* No FLAC support* No OGG support* T-Mobile users: Sending pictures in texts doesn't seem to work.* T-Mobile users: Seems like the data speed is limited to 2G.

But I like the features on a smartphone. So I didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract. I got this phone for about sixty on sale (wow, Amazon, that was pretty sweet!) and I'm delighted with it. It does more than my old Nokia X2 and I can always upgrade to full smartphone service if I need to. Right now, I have this on pay-as-you-go T-Mobile with my current SIM chip and don't do email or Web. I could change to PlatinumTel and even pay less on texting, and pay 10ct per 10MB of data--enough for email. I don't stream video or do internet on the phone--just need access to email on occasion.The setup was not bad, but took some time. I had the SIM chip (the T-Mobile) in the phone and was able to call and text. However, there was a bit of trouble with the reset--you hold the volume, the camera-on and the power buttons down simultaneously, and as soon as it vibrates, you release the power button but hold the rest until the REFORMAT screen appears. If you get the Download Mode Screen, you have to pop out the battery, power down (just powering down via the button doesn't work as it freezes at this point.) Then try again. I had to try quite a few times to get that screen up. The reformat is necessary for your SIM card to recognize the new phone.I was able to load the stored phone numbers from the previous phone, then access voicemail. The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy.I was not able to find a number of apps I wanted, as Windows Phone is not as popular as Android and that is not as popular as Apple. You'd think, with Windows OS being huge in computers, that there'd be more connectivity to phones, but it is definitely the 3rd best phone OS. Has a way to go.I was able to put it on my home WiFi and link the Bluetooth to my car handsfree system with no trouble at all.For the price, this is a great, functional phone. It isn't the be-all-end-all of phones, but for someone like me who is not a heavy cell phone user, it is delightful.

Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good.The apps selection is okay but their interface is quite different from their Droid and Apple counter parts. Yelp for example is bizarre to use when compared to the latest version on Apple or Droid. It uses a Windows phone style interface which has a different screen flow. I don't think 3rd party apps have a good grasp on how to develop for this platform. I will say the app selection is improving though. If you love apps I'd probably skip this phone. If you need a phone for email and Facebook this phone will work very well for you.Bing maps works well in the US but not as well in Canada as Google maps.

No forward facing camera isn't a deal breaker for me, because If I wanted to video chat, I'll just do that at home on my computer (when I have combed hair. lol..)  I've had windows phones since the first windows mobile os (which wasn't good).  Now they have Windows Phone OS; And microsoft has learned from old mistakes.Since the Mango update Windows phone is awesome.  I love that It has office in the phone.  This feels like a real work phone. The Iphone felt like, well an Ipod with a phone built in.  I also love that I was able to add a 32gb SD card to up the memory. (It now has 36.6gbs free.) That means If I so please I can download movies or Xbox live games. :-) I was spazzing out on mirrors edge yesterday with the Focus. :-)  & the hd video may be only 720p but it's good enough to make quality youtube videos.  And it's flash is better than the Iphones flash.My choices were pay $$$$ for a new unlocked Iphone or unlocked Android or unlocked Blackberry, settle for a cheaper windows phone that only has 8gbs of rom, or get this older focus and upgrade it with the SD card.  For less than the price of a used Iphone 3g, I got a factory unlocked phone that can do all the same things, but adds microsoft office, an hd camcorder, and the biggest factor is that this phone asks before distributing all your private user information.Originally I was onboard for an android, then the same day I was going to get one, a consumer watchdog group out of Santa Monica California issued a request to the US Attorney asking that Google and Apple be sued for billions of dollars due to their letting app developers access all personal data on people's phones.  That, infact, is how many stalkers were invading celebrity cellphones. I'm not so worried about stalkers, but I don't like the thought of someone being able to hack my info just because I accidentally installed a shady app instead of angry birds. (and by the way even angry birds gets all your private info sent to them via Android & Iphone.)If you want to be in with the cool people and don't care about privacy issues or budget, go for an Iphone or an Android phone.  If you want a phone that will do all the same things but won't give free reign to any app developer that wants to hack your phone, and you want to pay $$$ less for an unlocked phone; The Focus is a very good choice.  Just remember to get the right SD card.  Many don't work, and because people wouldn't read and research to get the right one, many people complained that they couldn't get it working right.  Also many people didn't read the fact that the SD card intigrates into the OS, and therefore can not be removed or used to transfere files once it has been intigrated with the phone.  Due to so many complaints by people that just don't bother to read the directions, they stopped putting the upgrade slot on the newer phones.  That means the newer ones might have a better processor, but you have to go up to the most expensive models to even compete with the space you can have on this Focus i917.I may get another for my lady and retire her no privacy having Iphone. She already wants to trade. :-)Update May 1st, 2013:One month on and using the phone feels totally natural now.

If you want to be completely bug free and crash free, avoid this phone. Get an iPhone or something with dual or more cores.

Bratton", "ReviewID": "R2KCBUPEG5K8QL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun.The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now.There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T; phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems.I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need.

This is our second Samsung Focus (the first was directly through Amazonwireless) and we love this phone!  AT&T; has dropped the ball big-time on updates, however, and you can only upgrade it to WP 7.5 Mango.  There are several security/bug fix updates in between WP 7.5 and 7.8 that AT&T; will not allow Microsoft to push to your phone, but overall this is a great entry-level smart phone and you simply cannot beat the price now that it has been out a couple of years.  Since the phone is branded to AT&T; (even though it is unlocked and can be used on any GSM network) you will simply not be able to get any updates on this phone until AT&T; decides to bless you with them (which in all likelihood based on their history, is NEVER).Also, the box that the phone came in was sealed, but did not have \"Samsung\" or \"AT&T;\" anywhere on the box except a printed out sticker.  The original Focus I got from Amazonwireless directly, had a normal flashy orange AT&T; box with Samsung written all over it.  The product manual inside of this new unlocked phone's box also suspiciously does not say Samsung or AT&T; on it.  To make matters worse, the little info sticker with the serial numbers on it below the battery does NOT say Samsung on it (unlike our first Samsung Focus directly from Amazonwireless did).  When I first got the package, it screamed COUNTERFEIT to me.  ***see update below***  But upon opening it, the phone appears to be constructed the same.  I powered on and set up the phone and then installed a Benchmark app on it, and it performs the same as my original Focus does.  To top it off, I called Samsung directly and told them about my concerns.  After describing everything to them and even giving them my phone's IMEI number (serial number), they assured me that it was a genuine Samsung product (but the representative had no explanation for why the packaging looked so suspicious).In any event, the phone itself is a solid 5 stars.  AT&T; gets 1 star for neglecting their customers by not allowing security and bug fixes on phones they offer (which is partially why we switched carriers in the first place).  But because of the update issue and the unusual packaging, I dinged the phone down to 4 stars.  But like I said, for an entry-level smart phone WITHOUT extending your contract, you simply cannot beat the price, and the whole Windows Phone system is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to Android and Apple (IMHO).***update*** I received the Focus and it appeared to work perfectly at the time I wrote the original review, but then when we tried to take a picture with the phone a week into owning it, there was a large yellow-discolored area in the center of the screen as if someone tried to take a picture of the sun or something insane like that and burned out the image sensor.  That got me thinking that perhaps the phone was refurbished rather than brand new (which might also explain the knock-off looking non-Samsung box).  I did some reasearch and have come to the conclusion that I almost certainly received a refurbished phone (an internet search on how to spot refurbished phones was VERY helpful).  The seller had good customer service though and sent us a label to send back the defective phone and sent another \"new\" one at no charge.  This \"new\" phone was actually in the factory Samsung box this time.  However, the box was scratched and the phone itself also had other tell-tale signs of being refurbished (although if I hadn't researched the topic it would have appeared brand new to me).  This time around, however, I ran diagnostics on the phone the moment I opened the box and set up the OS and everything seems to be working perfectly.  A final follow-up question to the seller about whether they might be getting supplied with refurbished phones instead of \"new\" phones from their supplier has so far gone unanswered, but I'm almost positive that's what is happening here.  I can't be too mad because the price we paid for the supposedly \"new\" phone was actually less than other sellers were charging for a refurbished phone, but a little bit of honesty here would be nice.  In any event, I encourage you to research how to spot a refurbished phone on the interet for more information.  In my non-expert opinion, in retrospect, I highly doubt any carrier-branded phone (i.e. with AT&T; logo on the front) can come factory unlocked.  So if you see a listing for \"unlocked\" and \"new\" in the same sentence, I personally doubt the accuracy of that listing and urge you to contact the seller in advance to double check.  When phones come back from the factory after service work, or they get refurbished to be resold, it is a well-documented fact that they are usually unlocked at THAT point.  So be forewarned, if a carrier-branded phone is \"new\" it is most likely locked, and if a carrier-branded phone is unlocked, it is most likely not new.  I have lowered the rating down to 3 stars due to what I think is likely inaccurate marketing.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT \"FULLY UNLOCKED\"", "Author": "fuzzy", "ReviewID": "R2JVGLER9L692", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone itself is set up well.

My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month.  I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.).  I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T; proprietary apps and no AT&T; account, no working apps.  The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded.  I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like.  What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working.  At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web.  So, bottom line:  its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great.  If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number.  It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use.

I would have liked it to be made out of more durable materials, but it certainly looks good. The front is a solid flat surface and the back is grayish with pin-striping that really is well done. The back is curved slightly, which helps to prevent it from being too slippery as it could be, with it being made out of smooth glossy plastic. The screen is very bright, but is made of plastic, so it could easily get scratched.Performance: 4/5It is fast enough. Downloads don't take long, and I have never seen a stutter. It upgraded to Mango without any issues using the Zune software I already had on my laptop. It plays Netflix perfectly with no noticeable pixelation or lag. It could load a couple of things faster, but overall load speeds are quite decent. The OS masks any slowdowns it might have by using fanciful transition effects.  Voice quality has been good, but there have been reports of echoing from people on the other end of the calls.Value: 5/5At $240 I will save $200 or more during my first year on AT&T;, and $400 or more during my second year.

Android, for me, felt like a mess.So I looked for something simple and powerful. It was either a Windows phone or an iPhone.The iPhone had a high price tag, and the Windows phone seemed... different.

No hassle, has everything I want - a great music experience, a fast browser, great apps and games and Facebook integration.The Samsung focus is a good piece of hardware: the screen has vibrant colors, the speakerphone is very strong and clear, it's fast and its design is both elegant and stylish.My beef with this phone has to do with its SD card slot. It was advertised as having expandable memory, but SD cards seem to malfunction when used.

I did alot of research and decided on the windows phone based on the occasional clunkiness of android. Though I really like the iphone, it's just too muchh $$ and a contract.  We recieved the phone in new condition and at first having played around with it a little I really didnt like it that much. I updated to Mango which is cool, but it really took a week of playing with it to decide it really is a great phone. My wife uses her camera alot, and this one has a very good camera. I went out the other night and took some pics outside in the pitch black, I couldnt see what I was aiming at until the flash went off, but the pics were really good. Today we went to the beach as there was a big storm and we took pics side by side and the focus produced much better pics than my nexus one. There are a few things that I like better about android for sure. Live wallpapers for one, and the stupid colored tiles on windows. I mean really, gee I get to pick my color for by big tiles? thats it? I was hoping these \"live\" tiles would be like customizable to a much greater extent then they are.  The other thing I dont like is the app store. It's niether layed out as well, nor does it have that many apps compared to the compitition. So, why five stars? well really it's about the phone. The screen is great, it's very responsive, excellent camera, great call or signal strength and the battery for us has not been an issue. I do like this windows OS. I'm really hoping they will s**t or get off the pot (microsoft) and dedicate themselves to developing this OS.  It has that much potential.

When you put the battery in normally, it stays off until you power it on.Thus, it stalls again. My guess is your attempts to start it restart after doing this as well, because it seems to take a certain number of trys to get it to run.When its on the charger, the 3 bottom buttons lose functionality.

Regello \"YRM\"", "ReviewID": "R220CPYQ5PP1ZK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Returned this item for a refund, not only because it was defective, but poorly designed as well (despite what the experts say) and because the Microsoft 30-day free music download appears to be a deliberate scam.  As for the phone, the exterior Power On and Camera On buttons sometimes did not work.  The touchscreen button for taking photos sometimes did not work.  When positioning the camera lens, the screen constantly switches to a non-camera app, forcing you to start all over.  The onscreen keyboard is infinitesimally small, so mistakes are a constant.  As for the operating software, you cannot download the current Windows 8, but are stuck with Windows 7.  When I downloaded and started playing music (courtesy of the so-called free trial), the phone shut down but kept playing the songs, so I had to remove and re-insert the battery to regain control of the device.  When charging the device, the charge indicator screen never seemed to be the same one twice, and sometimes there was no indication at all of anything going on.  (I eventually discovered that there's a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work.)As for that free music trial, I clicked the \"Cancel this subscription\" on the Zune Marketplace screen, after connecting the device to my desktop computer.  No sweat right?  Wrong.  This just takes you to Microsoft XBox login screen.  After entering your password, MS says it still needs to \"verify\" who you are by sending a code to your email address.  After retrieving and entering that, you select \"Account\", only to find that there is no cancel option anywhere to be found.  The long, convoluted instructions for canceling provided by MS explain that you have to change your payment method first, although this guide doesn't correspond to the screens you actually see.  At any rate, after changing away from the automatic renewal option as instructed, there is no message indicating the trial is cancelled and you're not allowed to remove your credit card info from the system.  On another screen, you're instructed to call XBox to cancel a subscription. Going down this new rabbit hole, you're instructed to fill out a page with your request and provide your phone number so MS can call you in 2 minutes.  But after you submit the request, you get an error message saying it didn't work and you should try again later.  Boy, last time I check, this sort of con game involving interstate commerce was outlawed by the FTC.  The only recourse seems to be waiting for the charge to show up on the credit card and disputing it through your bank.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Pablo Pz", "ReviewID": "R2846C7CBNHUFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone..

It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged.My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps.  I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon.Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is.The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling.Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples).At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "this product come with a problem in the usb conection", "Author": "daniel perez", "ReviewID": "R1J0VKHVFCIFP7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very unhappy.

Very good keyboard it is amazing. I had the HTC aria so the size difference felt so good in my hands, very tactile and the auto correct is really good it does its job!! It actually helps u type unlike some phones. The screen is astonishing, it pops out with such vibrant colors u feel like the picture is right in front of you. Video is also really good, I'd say it is equal to the iPhones except this has more vibrant colors, im in high school so I have alot of essays tht need to be typed and if my computer is ever being used I can type it up on this just as easy with Microsoft word. Xbox live is really good on this phone I can message my friends some games in the marketplaces gives you gamerscore!! On a side note if ur into minecraft their is a really good mobile alternative on here called survivalcraft. The marketplace has about 80,000 apps/games which is good enough for me even though it's about 400,000 less than android and iOS it has everything you need. As soon as I got my phone in the mail I updates it to windows phone mango and it is such a cleaner interface than android and it is alot better to look at than iOS. I was worried upgrading from 7 to mango would slow the phone but it's 1 GHz processor does the job amazingly! If ur into Facebook, twitter, windows live this phone is deff the best choice because it syncs everyone on ur friends list into ur phone and gives all their contact info they have available! I have 60-80 contacts in my last phone but when I synced Facebook (only social network I use) I have 700 some contacts! Also the pictures hub syncs all Facebook pics very neatly in with ur other photos. Talking about photos the camera is great its 5mp with 720p HD recording, my aria had 3.2mp with vga recording the difference was astonishing! It takes better pictures than the iPhone 4 in my opinion (not the 4s). Now the bad the battery life is mediocre I get about 7-8 hours of light use but I usually charge my phone after I get back from school around 2:30 p.m. I unplug it around 6:30 to start the day. But if I stay after school for anything I bring my charger because my phone will not last through that extra 2-3 hours. The other thing I dislike is its full plastic!! It is very lightweight, but it feels sort of flimsy and the plastic scratches easy, so I got a case which I recommend u get this case 2 its on amazon type in Samsung Focus Incipio Feather Case and I'll find it its about $15-$20 but it's worth it.

I was able to purchase this phone without contract for the same price as purchasing a new iPhone 4S from ATT and extending my contract.  I just popped my SIM card in and I was good to go--my grandfathered-in unlimited 3G iphone plan worked perfectly.The device itself is great.  The construction is mainly hard plastic--which versus the iPhone's glass and metal, initially felt cheap to me, but its holding up well even after taking a few spills and SO much lighter than the iPhone.  Nice curved edges and a slight taper from the top to bottom are nice design touches and make the device really nice to hold.  The 5MP camera takes great pictures (flash works suprisingly well) and the 720p video is great.  The 4 inch AMOLED screen is almost unbelieveable sharp and the colors are incredibly vibrant.  If you have never seen an OLED screen, you will be suprised at how nice it looks.The OS is where this phone really shines.

In many ways the windows phone is actually easier to use then the iPhone.  The only downside for now seems to be the lack of apps on the Windows phone but I am sure, that will change.  Of course the other consideration when home is the fact that Verizon's service is much better then either tmobile or AT&T.; Either way, the windows o/s is top notch and given a bit more time, could easily present a challenge/alternative to a iPhone.

I disagree with the other reviewers here who say that the phone is better than the iphone 4. Here are the reasons why:The screenThe iPhone has a much higher resolution display at 960/640 packed in a 3.5 inch screen. The Focus has a 800/480 screen in a 4 inch display. Some people will say \"4 inches is definitely better than 3.5 inch\" but it has less pixels than the iPhone and the pixels are spaced farther apart thanks to the bigger screen. What does that mean? Images and text look a lot less sharp on the focus compared to the iPhone. After using the iPhone, I don't think I can ever accept anything less in terms of screen quality. But if videos are all you watch, then you'll probably enjoy the focus more.FunctionalityThe apps on the iPhone are tremendous, and I am able to use it for whatever purpose that I can imagine be it calculations, looking up drugs, booking my vacation, etc. I work in the healthcare setting and robust medical apps like medscape and epocrates are scarce on the windows platform. I also like to use google voice to text via 3G, and there's no official google app for this phone. There's virtually no incentive for google to develop an app for this phone since only 1-2% of the smartphone population has windows phones. App developers probably have the same view. So unless you're just into posting your status on facebook (the integration which is nice btw), this phone may not be able to accomplish many tasks in your life. Not yet anyway...Camera:With skype around the corner for the windows platform, it will suck since the focus lacks a front facing camera. The iPhone has one. So you'll be limited to voice calling only.ExperienceThe experience on both phones is different, but very nice. None of the phones are plagued by any jittery behaviour or crashes. I think both phones are miles ahead of android in terms of having an overall smooth experience. It is for this reason that I think microsoft has something truly amazing and will not send windows phone to the trash can. I admit, the tile system of windows is kind of strange at first glance and may hamper adoption of the platform because one does not see conventional \"icons.\" But when Windows 8 comes out for the PC and more and more people are exposed to the metro interface on their notebooks, a windows phone won't seem so alien anymore and may speed up its success in terms of app development.Bottom line:I think it's safe to say that this phone is a long term investment since many great apps on iOS and android aren't available yet. That's the only thing holding windows phones back. You can easily overlook the other shortcomings since this phone is so cheap for being unlocked, which is the reason why I got it for my parents.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I got an out of order phone", "Author": "Jorge Aguinaga", "ReviewID": "R38W9PTGK0YAJ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this unlocked phone and has been a nightmare from day 1.

Please help.Tech Reply:Please be advised that once you change your Windows Live ID, a waiting period of 6 Months will take place before you are allowed to again change your email address. Since you mentioned that you already renamed your account, I would recommend that you change your Windows Live ID after 6 months and see if you would encounter any error message.My Response:Wow, that's stupid! Why does it let you change it to begin with? From reading other posts and forums it sounds like this is a big issue. People are changing it not knowing it'll screw up their windows phone. What's the benefit to Microsoft for waiting 6 months to let a Windows Phone owner change their ID back to the previous ID after a screw up? It's not like you guys informed us of this issue. If I've got to wait 6 months to get my phone syncing again, I'm going to drop this Windows Phone for another phone ops at the end of my contract in 4 months.Tech Response:Although I really want to help you with this issue, the system is desgined to have a waiting period for Windows Live ID that has been changed. This is to avoid conflicts on other accounts. Also, please understand that, as moderators, we are bound to follow strict guidlines.
