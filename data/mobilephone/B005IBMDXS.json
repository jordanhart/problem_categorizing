{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An excellent phone for the price despite negative reviews", "Author": "Marcos \"proletariat\"", "ReviewID": "R2IVIYRX7Z1VZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATED 2/17/13This phone has received a considerable amount of negative reviews - compared against similar phones of the same price range, this is an excellent phone. Many of the negative reviewers seem to obviously be expecting the features of a $200 phone from a $80 - $100 Trac phone (UPDATE: Thanks to a commenter the Walmart retail of this phone is now only $28. I have not verified this, but if that be the case, this phone is an INCREDIBLE VALUE).First off the OS on this system is not an Android (it is a Windows based OS), and it is technically not a smart phone but has MANY of the features of a smart phone. The browser is Dolphin, used by many Android based phones, so it is a decent browser, with some things you can do, some things you cannot. The phone supports some apps, others it does not...This phone is a 3G pseudo-smart phone (it has many of the qualities of a smart phone but is technically not one because it lacks a few things, all of which I will mention) with a mid-sized touch screen and runs a Windows based operating system, as opposed to Android, for instance. The screen flips so it can be viewed horizontally or vertically in any screen/view, and texts can be done via regular virtual phone keys or a horizontal virtual keyboard. It is not loaded with apps, but has pre-loaded practical apps that will be covered in this review, as well as additional optional apps available from samsung... it doesn't have nearly the available apps of say an iPhone, which, while they are very very cool, especially things like, for instance, meditation breathing apps to transportation apps, mimic police scanners, and dining/store finders/reviews, and apps that allow you to practically run full programs, etc., however, for the value, the apps available (some installed with the phone, others available via samsung) are within reason and, like I said, are predominately very practical ones, and it also has a sizable amount of available game downloads as well, which run pretty well on this phone's CPU. It includes a decent but not an excellent dolphin based browser, facebook app (w/facebook sync option), an MP3 player, voice recorder, wi-fi capability, downloadable games, email sync, etc., and, again, other samsung apps are available for download. It is bluetooth compatible, and has wifi (which works excellently - when I'm at home or somewhere with free wifi I have no problem using it so I don't use up any of my data plan, which, btw, the 3G data plan on straight talk for $30 is generous - one reviewer had a problem with the wifi but likely was not finding a close enough signal). It also has manageable widgets for your apps that you can place on your phone's home screen(s)... 3 home screens you can slide through, and customize each with whatever widgets you want for quick app access as well as a different wallpaper/photos for each home screen.One reviewer complained that it does not have a GPS option - there is a legal \"hack\" where you can get GPS on it by paying via a separate plan - you would have to do your own research. If GPS is a big thing for you and you're not a techie, this phone may not be for you. I have mapquest bookmarked on my browser as an alternative. It has very intuitive voice recognition app that has worked great for me, just as good as an iPhone, it is excellent for dialing in the car without actually dialing and then just using the speaker phone, for instance... however it will not type a text for you via voice (it will bring the create text screen up and address it, but won't type it by your voice, but, again, for 90 (28?) bucks it's awesome that it has the voice recognition features it has). It has a Micro SD card slot that can hold up to a 64 gig card (a very expensive card, however, the 32 gigs you can get for around $15, name brand Sandisk, if you shop around amazon - I have dozens of tv shows, and full length movies, and tons of pics and other docs and MUSIC as the phone can be used as an mp3 player and for viewing video) plus plenty of phone memory - It also has a SIM card you can save/backup contacts to. It takes photo and video and for only 2 mega pixel (I  think) it is very decent quality (If you plan on taking regular video you should definitely purchase a micro SD card of 8, 16, 32 or 64 GB size). There is no zoom or flash, but there are video and photo effects you can apply. You can watch video on it (I've put movies and TV shows on it using format factory (reformat files using mobile phone setting) and they play and look and sound perfect). You can also stream video via the browser which has Flash but it has some limitations... read on) It works great as an MP3 player in the car, through headphones, speakers, or even through the phones speaker which goes to a decent volume, and although the PC sync is limited (you can't sync your contacts or back them up via data cable, or some other sync options - however - you can do this through straight talk website), you can sync it to your PC via data cable to read and manage your SD card data. You can also use a data cable to use the MP3 player (or just use the line out/headphone jack), and to charge the phone.It has all the expected contact and phone personalization features you would expect from a normal phone, downloadable ringtones as well as the option to make any audio file (from the phone's audio recorder or MP3s on SD) a personalized or general ringtone, provided it is short enough (I've used Audacity to make my own snipets of songs and put them on the SD card for purpose of ringtone), it has a speakerphone and hands free of course as well as bluetooth as I mentioned, and all other contact personalizations (photo and ring personalization for each contact, customizable voice command for each contact, etc.) The phone charges INCREDIBLY quickly via the normal wall charger, and the charge lasts for a long time, even when you watch videos and use apps, browser, etc. (another user complained about battery life - I have had the exact opposite experience, and have had the phone for many months).A couple things about the browser - for not running Android or iPhone, its pretty decent. However, it only supports Flash on certain levels... regular sites are no problem, but you tube does not work from the phone's network, but will work via wi-fi (i.e. when you have wi-fi on and are picking up a home pc network for instance or at a coffee shop, McDonalds, school, etc.), and I was a bit disappointed when I found out it would not support Pandora... its a fairly simple program to run as it is just audio stream (I have not tried this via wifi). It is not compatible with the Pandora mobile app unfortunately either... oh well...The only other reasonable complaint about this phone, which is blown out of proportion by some other reviewers, is problems with the touch screen... It is not the most intuitive touch screen by any means... It is difficult to get used to at first and not as easy as others off the bat, but as with any phone, it merely takes some getting used to and you eventually use it as fast as any other phone. In many ways, for 100 bucks or less (now presumably only about 30), it rivals an Android, early iPhone, or basic smart phone... with a plan of 30 dollars a month for 1000 minutes, 1000 texts and 30mb of data time, it's unbeatable, and the unlimited plan is only $45. The Android for Straight Talk is much more money and you can only do the unlimited plan with the Android, and I am very happy with the $30 plan, so I chose this phone and am very very happy with it. Samsung I think, next to Nokia, makes the best quality phones out there. There is a similar model that is actually cheaper but has an actual flip out keyboard and a touch screen - I chose this phone, however, because it has a larger touch screen.One of the only apps I do miss is Skype - this phone has no skype option. For 100 bucks, I don't expect a flash on the camera. Speaking of the word \"flash\" the limited Flash capabilities are no big deal to me but might be to others that want youtube and other streaming video on their phone anywhere (many sites, however, like yahoo and other major sites will stream video on this phone just fine however)... As mentioned, I miss the pandora option, but it holds tons of music with an SD card. It does not support Drop Box app, which is no big deal since you can put whatever docs you want on it anyway. A zoom and flash would be nice but again for the price its unbeatable. To round up the negatives, again GPS is only available via a legal hack, and like I said before, but mapquest will work, and the PC sync options are limited, as is the voice recognition. In addition, there are a couple of settings that are not adjustable, such as alerts, e.g. you cannot turn off and on the beep alert when you receive a new text or voice message, except by putting the phone in full silent mode.Other than that, I feel like I got more than my money's worth. Like I said, its just a small step down from the Android, for me, anyway, and the features that you may miss are all in this paragraph, but, and not to be redundant, the value is great.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Solid Phone..not perfect", "Author": "Tom Hilpert \"Tom Hilpert\"", "ReviewID": "R2FRCOREKF1BE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As I write this I've had the Samsung T528G for about two weeks, with Straight Talk service.STRAIGHT TALK COMMENT:Straight Talk has been fine so far. Service has been fine. I just spent the weekend out in the boondocks, and I didn't have service. My wife had service with her Verizon phone if she stood at the very top of a hill facing a certain direction. Other than that, Straight Talk has worked out great. And that one incident isn't worth paying $30 extra dollars a month for.THE PHONE:Phones are not a big source of interest or entertainment for me. I simply want an effective communication device that doesn't cost too much, and doesn't cause a lot of frustration. This one fits the bill very well. Call quality is fine.One thing I do deeply appreciate it the easy and effective lock mechanism. Every phone I've had for the past five years \"pocket dials\" - even when locked. This phone, however, is a one-button lock, that stays locked until I say so. It's easy to unlock also, but not accidentally. Thank you!TOUCH SCREEN:I'm in my forties, so touch screens are still kind of a novelty for me. My fingers are about average for a man. Even so, I found overall that the screen  was responsive and easy to use.The QWERTY keypad (context dependent) is a little small. I've only sent about five texts, so in fact, I'm still getting used to it. I'm pretty sure it will be fine once I get used to it. I turned off the \"T9\" feature which guesses which word you are trying to type. It's worthless because you can't keep adding new letters once it kicks in.The other aspects of the touch screen are easy and responsive.WIDGET FUNCTION:This is the only part of the phone which I dislike. I view the whole concept as a design flaw. There is a little side bar that will slide out and offer you widgets (like an alarm clock, or a calculator, or weather report). These can all be accessed through the tools menu elsewhere on the phone. The idea is, the widget bar gets you there faster.Three issues: first, once you tap the widget on the bar, it doesn't actually open the widget - it just puts it out onto the main screen. You then have to tap (or double-tap, depending on the widget) to open it. Silly and pointless. In most cases it is the same number of taps to go to menu>tools>[whatever widget you want].Second, once you have used your widget, it sits out there on the main screen, cluttering it up. Widgets easily get put on top of one another, making them hard to access, which is exactly opposite of the point. Third, I have a lot of trouble getting the widgets to go back onto the widget bar when I'm done with them. The idea is to tap once and drag the widget back onto the bar. You shouldn't have to do this in the first place. But, you do, and it is very hard to convince the phone that you don't simply want to reposition the widget icon to the left side of the screen. You have to find just the right sweet spot to get it go back to the bar.So, I hate the widget function. There, it's out of my system.MUSICThe music player is a decent, functional tool, with the ability to transfer playlists even from my non-standard media library (Media Jukebox). You'll definitely want to get a decent sized micro sd to keep the music on. I created my own ringtone for my wife with few problems.WI-FIThe wi-fi function is nice - when available, you can browse the internet from a wifi connection and not use up any network bandwith. In other words, you can get `free' internet when wi-fi is available.OTHER TOOLS:I often use alarms, countdown timers and calculators. This phone has all three, and they all work just fineCAMERA/CAMCORDERI haven't used the camcorder. The camera is 2MP, which isn't that great these days. It's OK in a pinch (like when I'm fishing) but if I expect to take pictures, I'm carrying my 12 MP zoom camera.WEB BROWSER, FACEBOOKI'm too old to get used to these tiny screens. I don't even like browsing the web on my 7\" Nook Color - so I didn't care for these functions on this phone, simply because of size.APPS:As I said, I don't look at phones as a source of entertainment. I don't think this phone would be a good one in any case. There are \"apps\" available from Samsung. The following sentence will tell you all you need to know about them: There are 22 apps - total. If you want anything that doesn't come standard with the phone, this is not the unit for you.Overall, a good little phone if you want a basic phone with a few of the \"standard\" extras.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung t528g nice phone", "Author": "Devon Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3IVNRF1W2EWN4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this phone from walmart and i must say, that im surprised at how well it functions..Before i added a plan to it, i tried the wi-fi out and it worked fantastically..The youtube only works if your wi-fi connection is good and the quality of the videos might not be up to par with the other touch screens, it's still decent..Im not a fan of the apps, but the ones that are available for the phone are limited if you go on the phone site, but there are other sites that you can go to in order to get more..I heard alot of ugly reveiws about the phone freezing and rebooting itself..As long as i had it, it hasn't froze once...Im thinking i got one of there tweeked phones. They probably got all of the bugs out of mine..But, on the safe side, it might be better to just purchase it from the walmart stores..That way if you don't like it, you can return it for a refund..Overall, I think this phone is really sturdy with good features and The calls are clear. The txt messages are something you have to get use to, but thats y they have styluses...Good priced phone and it is a whole lot better than my old flip phone..Any questions..Just holler", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Phone!!!!", "Author": "MsChocobo", "ReviewID": "R15USFHKE89QSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone yesterday at Wal-mart. The lady who helped me said \"This is one of our hot items\". I could see why. The activation process will make you seem like you messed it up. So when you put the phone card info on it be prepared when you turn it on it will say \"activation required\" then it will shut off and shut back on and say \"activation complete\". Unlike other phones you get three wallpaper screens but, there's a catch you can only change two of them. The primary is that beach scene(I would like to change it but I can't). On your wallpaper screen you will see a little grey tab on your left with a white arrow on it. When you tap that it will open a column that has all kinds of widgets such as Myspace,facbook,Birthday Notices,Web Browser(just to name a few). You can leave them in that column or you can drag them out and put them anywhere on your main screen(or the other two). I dragged a few out but it was getting crowded on the screen.(some of those tabs such as the google is huge)So I managed to put all of those widgets back in the column(it wasn't easy)I have left my screens clear. Iv'e noticed that this phone doesnt go Qwerty unless you turn it sideways it's touchscreen all the way. This phone is very light and fragile(i dropped it on my kitchen floor last night and the battery fell out)it's okay and it didn't get scratched either. I going to get a case soon. Let's move on to the texting. It's tricky vertical is sometimes easy to master,the qwerty however might need some practice and be sure to turn off that greenT9 button when using the qwerty because it will start typing your sentences for you(and it wont be what you were wanting to say). Overall this is a good phone(needs practice to master all of it's applications)I give it a THUMBS UP!!!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it.", "Author": "Sarah Young", "ReviewID": "R1Q6FUK7XJP3XB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is an awful phone.

Davis \"damioncrowley\"", "ReviewID": "R2BFQB1GNSBMXU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Throughout my experience of buying increasingly modern phones, I have noticed the best ones have very intuitive features--that is, even without a manual you can typically figure out its features with a little trial and error hunt and peck.The Samsung T528G is not in this category.The touchscreen is tempermental, sometimes giving you what you want, sometimes not responding, sometimes giving you some other function.  Similar reaction with the keypad.  Try texting letters in, and it will sometimes type in letters not even remotely close to the one you are pressing.It will call what seems to be random number...it won't even necessarily be the last number you dialed.  It deletes random phone numbers.As I purchased it part of a StraightTalk plan, I'm not sure if it has it's own e-mail address (my past two phones, did).  In the process of trying to find out, I connected to my hotmail account. That would be pretty cool, except now I can't get it to disconnect, and every few hours it will vibrate as it receives a message.A very strange peculiarity--my previous 5-year-old phone had the capacity of 300 phone numbers, that could then be divided into 20 categories. This phone supposedly can store around 2000 numbers--but with only 10 categories.The address book has the ability to create birthdays, but then those birthdays don't link to the calendar.  And if you want to create a birthday without an address entry, it won't let you enter a birth year beyond a certain point--and a fairly recent certain point, at that.Another peculiarity--part of the reason I was getting a new phone is that the charge on my old phone wouldn't last 7 minutes once I started talking on it.  However, in a passive state, with just checking time every few hours, it would still hold its charge for two days.  When it was brand new, it would hold the charge for over 3 days. With the T528G, I haven't stayed on the phone long enough to outlast it's charge, but it will run out of power in its passive state in less than 1 day.I was thinking of passing this phone on to my daughter and getting myself a more intuitive one, thinking maybe I just wasn't keeping up with the technology, but then I come here and see the other reviews and realize, wow, no, it's just a crappy phone.  I'm hoping to find my receipt and trade this one in, otherwise I'm thinking I'll have to take a loss.As an additional site, on Samsung's own website, the product only gets 3 of 5 stars.I probably should have checked the reviews before buying the product.(For example, just now, sitting in my loose t-shirt pocket, it went from the home desktop screen to the calendar screen.)I've had the phone for less than 3 weeks, and I've already grouped up more complaints than praises about this phone.  One way or the other, I'm going to find a different product.  The service provider (StraightTalk) doesn't seem to have anything to do with the quality of the product one way or the other, so this is strictly a review of the Samsung T5288G and not StraightTalk (except for them offering such a crappy product at such a relatively high price).", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "I deeply regret buying this!  Terrible UI/interface!", "Author": "JAB \"JAB\"", "ReviewID": "RN10CE9YX8CWM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I'd never bought this phone as it is the most awkward device to try & use.As a phone:  Taking calls is awkward, as during the process of retrieving the phone from a pocket or bag I accidentally hang up on the caller.  Furthermore, there is a lock toggle button which is perfectly placed to always be under your finger when you pick up/hold the phone.  If you are not very careful, the screen will unlock during your phone call and a slight touch to your ear will generally terminate your phone call.Texting:  The screen is TERRIBLE.  Trying to type on a keyboard on a terrible touchscreen = frustration.  Sometimes the screen rotates from landscape to portrait spontaneously and the keyboard disappears.  In portrait mode, the predictive typing is deplorable.  You are much better off slogging through using the poor keyboard (and using backspace like a mad fool).  Sending a full 160 character text can take over 5 minutes.  The \"inbox\" size is arbitrary - even though we've got an 8GB \u00b5SD card inserted, the mailbox maxes out at ~96 message.  There is no association of replies to the original message as in most other systems.Checking voicemail:  IF you configure it, you can have a \"quick access\" item on your screen so all you have to do is press and hold on the voicemail icon.  Problem: the touch screen is so laggy and inaccurate a simple operation like this can take several attempts to get the right little icon selected (sometimes the entire \"quick access\" panel just disappears entirely from the screen and you have to go find it).  Once you DO actually get it dialing voicemail, screen dims and is locked out - just in time for you to hear \"enter PIN now\".  IF YOU ARE FAST ENOUGH, you then take the phone away from your ear, unlock the screen (guess the spot on the dimmed-out screen where you need to press and hold for 2 seconds or press and hold the locking key on the side of the phone).  Now the phone is successfully unlocked, you need to hurry and press the little button for \"dial\" to bring up a keypad (before the screen dims out again or locks again).  Enter your PIN and you finally can hear your voicemail!  Don't worry, the fun doesn't end there.  Want to skip or delete the message?  The fun begins again...Checking email:  If you plan to use the web interface, get ready to spend an frustrating hour.  If you preconfigure an email to automatically be pushed to the phone, reading them is much easier (well, for gmail anyway) HOWEVER, you must have the unlimited data plan because it will chew through 30MB of data (basic straightalk plan) within four days or so.Web Browsing:  Fail, Fail, Fail.  Browsing on my little flip phone which generally only shows lines of text is MUCH more usable. The screen on this phone is terribly small/low rez and the processor/memory are pathetic.  StraightTalk has crippled the web browser so, more often than not, I just receive an error when I try to load a web page.  Trying to quickly lookup an address or phone # using google while on the go?  IF you can get it to work, it'll take you 10 minutes (or more).Regarding the other potential uses (\"Apps\" like calendar, address book, alarm clock, etc):  worthless.  This thing is just painful to use for ANYTHING.  Want to set an appointment in the calendar?

Even the downloaded documentation is woefully inadequate to explain the factory passwords (i.e., no documentation at all -- and they are not the standard numbers such as 0000, 1111, your last 4 digits, etc.)  The Walmart people talked to Customer Service for over 4 hours (yes, I was there, with 3 different Walmart employees, for over 4 hours; bless each one of them - we were courteous and patient) before even getting the factory passwords that were available, and not all of them were. Mostly the Walmart people were kept waiting on the phone with StraightTalk, with an occasional transfer to a \"manager,\" and back and forth, with hours of dead time waiting for somebody to talk to.Significantly, not all of the factory passwords were available, even when we finally reached a living StraightTalk Customer Service representative.  Importantly, one of the security functions, the password function for dialing, never worked, even though it is a feature of the phone.  This is where you if you buy the phone MUST BEWARE!  I and my Walmart acquaintances surprisingly learned that nobody on the face of this planet knows the factory password for this function!  StraightTalk Customer Service was adamant about this.  NOBODY KNOWS!  Nobody in the Indian subcontinent, in the United States, the StraightTalk CEO, its Board of Directors - or anybody else on the face of the planet.Well, surely this cannot be right, my Walmart friends and I thought. We reasoned, this phone was made by human hands, designed by human engineers. Somebody must know (unless, of course, they're dead or something).  Yet, we learned, simply, that when StraightTalk tells you that nobody knows how to use its own phone, the Samsung T528G, well, that's exactly what it means: NOBODY! And Samsung won't tell you because it \"doesn't know who you are.\"I STRONGLY WARN ANY PURCHASER FROM ATTEMPTING TO USE THIS FUNCTION. Once set (it's tricky because you don't need the factory password to initially set it, a password which as indicated above allegedly doesn't exist anyway), you are thrown into a unrecoverable mode (i.e., a passworded function for which no password exists or can be given) which only a new SIM card from Straight Talk will remedy. StraightTalk ultimately sent two SIM cards after both I and the Walmart people in succession made the same \"mistake,\" i.e., simply trying to make the phone work the way the touch screen buttons tell you it will.Subject change: this is not a smart phone, anyway.  I'm not sure what to call it.  Most charitably, it is merely a phone with a touch screen, and at that a touch screen that often fails to accept input. Annoying, at a minimum. Impossible to even use, many times, especially (but not limited to) the corners of the touchscreen. It isn't that one's fingers don't press the buttons or the correct part of the touchscreen.  In fact, the buttons do \"light up\" when you press them. The phone simply doesn't respond to such input; this, regrettably, is a common occurence with this phone.There are no apps to speak of, either, because of the nonstandard operating system that runs it.  Good luck with the few apps it does support (the touchscreen issue again).The phone simply quit after two months. It simply hanged during the power up routine, for no discernable explanation. It wasn't a battery issue or SIM card issue. It didn't get wet. It wasn't dropped or bumped. It just quit.Relieved, actually, I bought a different phone.In sum, this phone is a complete waste of money.  I would have replaced it long before had it not cost so much money in the first place.YOU, a potential purchaser, will be unhappy with this phone every day you own it.

And no, even for the $20 I paid for mine it's was a waste of time, effort and 20 bucks. I have every cell phone I have ever owned still sitting in a pile in a drawer, perfectly capable of being reactivated and used. However upon replacement of this piece crap, which is soon, I plan on smashing this useless piece of junk into as many microscopic pieces I can then flushing them all down the toilet! Yes, the pone is that bad. I' have given it -50 stars if the scale went in that direction, and i'd still feel this way if they paid ME the 20 bucks to take it! This phone stinks beyond the description of words, period.I'm going to open by cutting straight to the chase: This phone is the absolute worst piece of intolerable crap ever assembled. Period.Beyond that I can't even begin to organize my hatred for this piece of crap so I'm just going to start with whatever comes to mind first and let it go from there.The touchscreen is horrible. When you try to make a menu selection on the outside icons, instead of opening the button you touched, it thinks you wanted to swipe to the next page, so you have to swipe back to where you started and try again. After about 3 times of playing this silly game you may get the icon you touched to open. Now a new problem develops, upon scrolling down through menu options instead of reading your finger swipe as a swipe, it beeps when your finger hits the screen and opens whatever it was your finger landed on instead of letting you scroll the list.Texting or composing emails is a tedious, painstakingly slow and frustrating process because A) the keys are way too small, B) there is no way to calibrate the keyboard, you are stuck with tiny little squares that the tip of your pinky finger completely cover.Typing even the simplest of messages is a long drawn out time consuming affair that will have you tearing your hair out by the end of the second sentence. No matter how low you get your finger to the bottom edge, the space bar will always yield 7 no responses, then a couple of C's V's or B's thus requiring you to use the backspace button, which in turn yields an \"enter\" key strike, or an \"ok\" hit. Once you finally get your space, try shifting to capitalize a letter and you get an A or a Z, forget about trying to change from letters to numbers / symbols, you'll hit shift or get nothing for your first 10 taps on the key as with the space bar. If a particular message contains 100 characters, you may well have tapped the key pad 500 times to accomplish your goal. Oh and by the way, trying to use the number pad old school to text with is just as bad. You can tap as accurately as you want, and 1/3 of the time you will inevitably end up with a character from an adjacent key. The keyboard just sucks, no 2 ways around it.The browser? Forget it. It's a joke. Tiny little display that can't show a fraction a page, and when you zoom it it always says \"page to large to display\" then shrinks it back down to microscopic size. Scrolling is a tedious chore too. If you get lucky enough for it to open something and you want to scroll down while holding the phone width-wise, you can stroke the screen 1,000 times and it just sits there like it's frozen, then after you tilt it back upright, then back sideways again, you might get it to scroll a swipe or 2 before it ignores your finger again. Its frustrating as all F! Half the time when you want to negotiate around a page, instead of moving the image it thinks you want to zoom, and pulls up the up/dn arrows for zooming. You get those to go away then you start opening links when you want to scroll (as with the phone menus themselves noted above)Now, say you got through all that and you do want to open a link, good luck with that. Thus begins another game of \"tap tap tap tap tap TAP TAP TAP DAMMIT!, open you mother ...!!\" The finally, it happens you see the activity icon indicating you successfully clicked the link on the 147th tap, and now you get........... \"site not responding ok/cancel\" *&%@!!!!!! so you hit ok, and back to tap tap tap tap tap tap tapNow for all its faults to this point, it only gets worse. Straight Talk touts this as a smart phone with \"app\" capability. WRONG! The only apps available for it are proprietary pieces of useless garbage from a proprietary site. You can't even put keyboard managers like SWYPE on it to make using it remotely tolerable.Another annoying and unacceptable \"feature\" I guess we'll call it, is that despite how Samsung built and intended this phone to work, Straight Talk sees fit to disable and neuter it's functions down to a level of uselessness. For example, I downloaded the Samsung PC interface software, bought a USB cable only to discover that all the pc to phone uplink capabilities are disabled by S/T. I mean come on seriously! I'm paid for the phone based on published specs and abilities, I'm paying for 30 days of so called \"unlimited\" service, but the provider shunts you from utilizing it to it's full potential? What kind of BS is that?Then I discovered that after setting up the e-mail client it would only send over the wifi connection while at my house (or wifi spot) it will not send an email over the cell network. I asked CS about it and after an hour of F'ing around they told me that my NEW out of the box phone that I had just configured would have to be factory reset to get that feature to work properly. Yeah, factory reset after just having manually entered all my contacts into it because there was no other way to sync it with my other phone.The last thing I will say is that their customer service absolutely stinks. The people you talk to never know WTF you're saying, they don't comprehend anything and I have never once ever added a service card to my account without some sort of interruption or SNAFU. It never credits my phone on time, I'm left with service drops for hours on end until they open CS the next day. Who ever heard of a cell phone customer service center that wasn't 24/7 this day in age?Conclusion: There is absolutely NO reason on the face of this green earth why anyone should subject themselves to this sort of cell phone hell at any price. If all you want is a cheap \"burner\" for emergencies to make or take voice calls, then sure, whatever. But if you even remotely suspect that you would want to experiment with it's other features or in-capabilities, forget it. Just simply forget it, you WILL BE SORRY, I promise you!I'd love to know what the guy who said this was an excellent phone for the money despite all the negative reviews was thinking, because he sure couldn't have been using this phone to draw that conclusion!

This was because the screen wold not stop flipping.  I figured I could look past this.  Then my phone would randomly delete contacts nevermind the fact that everytime you try to go online it takes about 10minutes for the page to pull up and thats if the phone doesnt shut down.  Oh yes it does that too.  On my commute home my phone will turn off and on about 3 times within a half hour.  This phone sucks.  I've dropped it a few times on the ground and no damage was seen.

I was so excited to get a \"smart\" phone, but all I was able to do was check FB and e-mail. The keyboard is way too small. You have to touch the letter over and over again to type anything and most of the time you hit the wrong letter. You have to keep hitting erase to fix everything and the ok key is right below it so you constantly send a half message or even worse, this phone will send an empty text and you get charged for it. When you turn the phone to use the full keyboard half the time it doesn't display until you shake it around several times. This is very frustrating. Their t9 is a joke, as most of the time it's faster to type out the whole word then to to look in their suggestion box, where the word won't be there or you tap the word and another appears and you lose the suggestion box. You then have to erase the word and retype! Twice I completely lost all my contacts!!!! This was the worst since I manually put them in and it took forever. Another time I lost everything I had in my memo, extremely frustrating. It took two weeks and two different sim cards just to get the phone going. Not having a phone for this long was the worst. Each time I had to call customer service they were mostly polite but nobody could get my phone started until I spoke with a manager. This took countless frustrating hours! When I called to complain about the problem I was having with the phone the lady I spoke to did not believe I had replaced two sim cards, since her records showed they had only sent one. Isn't the customer always supposed to be right? I know I replaced two sim cards on this phone and she made me so angry I hung up on her. I called again and was told I would have my phone replaced. I was then sent an empty box with a bag to replace the phone. So, I have to send my phone first, go without a phone again until they send the new one. I am buying a cheaper phone, I just want to be able to talk and text! They do have the best plan that is the everything plan with 1000 talk, 1000 text and limited internet. I'm buying the LG 900g, I read some good reviews on it. I just wish I had read the reviews on this phone before I wasted my money!

Luckily, a friend bought me this little phone through Straightalk. Since my iphone retains most of the features except making phone calls, I am thinking of keeping the iphone and using it as an ipad, and keeping the Samsung for calls only. (Did you know you can TM on a \"dead\" iphone as long as the other person has an iphone? Pretty cool! You can also text internationally--for free! But only to other iphone users.)Using the Samsung for calls and the iphone for everything else will save me $140 a month!Keep in mind that the Samsung is just pretending to be all grown up and \"smart.\" It really isn't. So forget about surfing the net and all that. It's just way too hard and the screen is itsy bitsy....If you truly want an iphone or a real smart phone, sign a two year contract with AT&T; or whoever and you can get an older model for CHEAP. (I originally got an iphone 3 for 99 cents. I lost it so they sent me an iphone 4.) When your contract is up, you can keep it handy for all those handy apps OR I believe you can transfer it to straightalk and pay $60 a month (someone told me that, don't quote me!).NOW, this Samsung model has some quirks that take a little time to understand. I was having trouble bringing up the keypad when making a call, which made answering voice mail prompts impossible. I finally looked around the internet and figured out how to do that. Texting is REALLY irritating on this model, especially as I had become so comfortable with the iphone. So if texting is important to you (not so much for me), then you need a better phone.I am pretty much pleased with this baby phone. It makes calls, which is all I need it to do. And it's SMALL, which is very nice. And my iphone 4 does all that other stuff just fine: google, facebook, mapquest, etc. Some apps need a wifi connection though, so I can't listen to Pandora in my car with the iphone. But big whoop--I have all kinds of music uploaded, so I put it on shuffle and go about my merry way.I am so very pleased to pay $30 a month instead of $140!

I might have just stuck it out with this phone  for a little longer if not for the gray smears on my screen from Chinese food sauce (sauce leaked from container onto phone because it was in same bag and forgot to clean out inside/battery side of phone when I cleaned outside). Besides that self-inflicted injury my phone works beautifully. I don't really talk on the phone but when I get a call the ringer is loud and the voice quality is crystal. Text are good even though I would have liked a conversation layout. I also have no complains about the internet.The battery life is great,but then I mostly did web,text, and just the MP3 player. It as a pretty good memory for pictures and other data but I use my  MP3 player along with a 16 GB SD card I brought separately , now I got about 2000 songs.The only pet peeve about that is I was never able to get my cover art.The camera is not the best and it has no flash but it takes pretty good picture if outside or in well lite area.

As a basic phone for calls and texting, it's a great phone.  The service that's \"required\" when purchasing online from Straight Talk, is for unlimited data, so with that you expect to be able to get online and do data stuff.  Afterall, you're paying for it.This is an older phone so it's not made for today's web; it's slow and hangs more than is acceptible. The phone is supplied with the Samsung Dolphin v1.5 browser, and the home page is the Trac-Phone account page, and if there's a way to change it, it's hidden and I surely can't find it.  I've yet to be able to find a video I can watch. Youtube videos are inaccessible. The virtual vertical and horizontal keyboards are extremely sensitive and so small it takes forever to type in anything, but it must be done with one finger, and that's only IF you can do it without hitting other keys. This is no exaggeration; it's not possible to type normally so  it's very frustrating.As far as Apps are concerned, it's true that Samsung only has a few basic types to download.  Straight Talk has several at $4.99 each through it's Trac-Phone homepage, however there are a few websites that cater to this phone and you can find game apps galore for free.  Type in \"T528G Apps\" into your browser and several links will show up. I didn't see any of the popular games listed and they didn't interest me, so I'm unsure if they're any good.  Productivity Apps are almost non-existent but I did find a few English to Spanish, etc. dictionaries.If you need a phone that can access videos, lots of Apps, and do web browsing, this phone is not the one to choose.Update:  Straighttalk.com recently had this phone for FREE on their website.

We ordered through Straight Talk's web site and they apparently switched our sim cards or something along those lines according to the customer service rep. and my phone's sim card wasn't even registered with the company.

Online we've only been told to call directly to speak to a representative making the online help unuseful and when making a complaint to costumer service, I simply received a canned response saying to call their direct line. I responded back that in having no useable phones that calling is difficult and inquired if there can be any help online. In short, the answer was no and that is exactly what everyone's answer should be to straight talk services.As for the phone, I can't say how it works since mine doesn't.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "my mms is not work", "Author": "destry", "ReviewID": "R2GM7DP8OH9RCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this phone about 2 month ago and it a good phone bt the mms is not working dosez anyone know how to fix it", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "SIM Card Issues", "Author": "Cory Morrison", "ReviewID": "RVCEAB15W0R3H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is in excellent condition and came with a fully charged battery.

Some problems include;1. A very delayed response touch screen. Sometimes you have to press the unlock button several times to access your phone. The delay also makes texting extremley difficult especially with the buttons being so small. It takes a long time and a lot of patience to write out a text message.2. The widgets (most of which are pointless as widgets because you could just access them from the main menu) move very easily when you are trying to scroll through the screens. Also, if you get a widget to close to the edge of the screen it will get stuck and impossible to move. The missed call widget often dissapears and you have to put it back on your screen.3. My phone would not stay charged. It would say it had 3 battery bars and then die in the middle of a text message. It was also very difficult to get it charging, I would have to plug it in and out o the charger several times before the charger was recognized.These are just some of the issues. The phone is also very small and not very sturdy.4. Don't be fooled by this phone having \"apps\" The only \"apps\" that come with this phone are things like calculators, calendars etc.I had mine for about 6 days before I got tired of it and traded it for a samsung t404g, a phone that didnt have touch screen but has a slide out QWERTY key board. It is about 20 dollars less and works 20 times better. I also have the option to download java apps.
