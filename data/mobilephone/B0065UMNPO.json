{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Next Best Thing To A Full Stereo System", "Author": "Sonny J. de los Reyes", "ReviewID": "R1YCBQQEHL9GUB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone unlocked about a week or so ago and WOW.  I'm partial to Samsung because of the feature set, but I wanted a phone that had \"umph\" when it came to music.  This is the International Unlocked Version of the US'/T-Mobile's HTC Sensation 4G.  And while the two are identical, the Beats by Dr. Dre Software/Hardware was the key factor in buying this version (as the T-Mobile version lacks the Beats Audio).First, the hardware is sturdy in the sense that it has weight to it.  Unlike my Motorola's and Samsung's I have had in the past, the weight comes from it's metallic/ceramic like casing.  And unlike Samsung which usually feels more plastic and thus lighter, I feel the weight of the HTC may play a factor someday in it falling out of a pocket or purse.  Should you decide to by this, I recommend a case of some sort, just in case.This phone has the usual set of features as in other Android phones with Android 2.3.  To my surprise however, as soon as I got the phone set up with Cellular and Wi-Fi, I was prompted to update to Android 4.0 or what's known as \"Ice Cream Sandwich\"!  After about 20 or so minute between downloading and installing, I had a brand new Android 4.0 phone with Beats Audio!  I don't think the HTC Sensation at T-Mobile is updated yet?  Even if it were, it would be bloated with T-Mobile branded software, which is almost always difficult to remove and wastes space in the memory.  Thankfully, this unlocked International version does not have such software (as far as I can tell), leaving space for more music, apps, ect.A few hindrances for an otherwise great phone; 1) the Beats Audio software seems to only work with the native Music app.  There's nothing wrong with that, except that I use Google Music to stream files that are not on my device.  Something to keep in mind if you think that the Beats Audio is a deal breaker. 2) the device came with only an 8GB memory card.  While that may be OK (last year), trying to load that large playlist of favorite music or take pictures with it's fantastic 8MP camera will be difficult as you will run out of space rather quickly.  However, a 16 or even a 32 Gigabyte MicroSD isn't that difficult to find, especially on Amazon, but it's also something you need to factor in when considering this phone for purchase.Simply put, one of the better Android Phones out there.  I highly recommend it!", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "...", "Author": "Kenyon", "ReviewID": "R21LC3HTP8X5ZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i enjoy my phone. i love that it came with beats.
