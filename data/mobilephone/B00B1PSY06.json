Cool)How easy was it to setup?1) Removed the SD Card and SIM from my Galaxy2) Placed in the new Note II3) Turned the phone on  - It immediately recognized the TMobile SIM Card and SDCard4) It prompted me to ask what SIM CARD to use for calls, text, etc. (I only have one - but uniquely this phone is setup to allow for 2 SIM cards, allowing you to choose which performs what actions)5) After this, I went into the menu, and the Google application, entered my info - synced up my contacts, etc..And I was good to go - there was nothing hairy about the process!! And un-trained Monkey could do it, pretty sure..+ I noticed this phone immediately responding quickly - as fast or faster then the Galaxy 2.+ The 8MP camera has really really great resolution+ Has the panoramic ability (press the shutter button, slowly turn phone = panoramic photo)+ DID NOT HAVE BLOATED SOFTWARE LIST+ Scrolling through menus, opening / closing apps, VERY fast+ I use the IM+ application to connect to a chat platform at my work-place, worked wonderfully (DATA CONNECTION)++ Came with a pre-installed screen protector! WAY cool!Overall I honestly cannot tell you a single negative thing about this phone yet, except maybe the resolution of the front-facing camera, which to me is so minor I wouldn't knock it - it's GOOD ENOUGH.I'll do more tests as I'm driving to different cities for connection quality, and I'll add more details in a week.I would jump on recommending the phone - it's a LOT OF PHONE for such a nice price!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Going to keep this short and sweet!", "Author": "Sully", "ReviewID": "R16NI3RLSN17T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I find alot of the these \"cloned\" phone reviews quite laughable to be honest. Check my other reviews.. I am a real live boy.. Not a seller.Going to keep this short and sweet! After reading almost ALL of the reviews on clone phones here I picked this one (at first).The people making \"poor\" comments, in my opinion should not be buying cloned phones. These phones should be purchased by people with a ABOVE AVERAGE working knowledge of computers, cell products, and the supplying companies. News flash - EVERYTHING IS MADE AND SHIPPING FROM CHINA - Including what you bought from ATT store! If you need to be walked, hand held, and more to get your 200$ savings bragging rights - maybe the ATT store IS THE ONLY place you should shop.. and yes you WILL PAY MORE! Remember folks: Its a business, not a hobby.As for the products:Number Bought:2Service used on: Straight TalkCapacity: H+ G service - Picture attached - approx 4 mbs Down / .5 Up - If you do not know what H+ is, its 4G before they branded it 4G - Google it.Quality: 1 perfect and very happy - definitely not as fast as a GALAXY NOTE 2, but then again MOST wont use it to that level anyhow. And if you want to know if it will play WOW or some other mindless game - NOT as good as your computer will so use that!! Its a phone, and a work tool, which your not going to use as because you probably do not work because you live to play video games!One of the phones did come with a small \"crack\" in the lower part of screen - sent it back because i didnt want to chance it. It was working fine though.Feel free to ask questions - I will answer them if I can, when I can. WARNING: if you asked a question that deserves a brunt answer - you are going to get just THAT!!

I moved to streight talk from walmart with a GSM SIM. I came across this phone did alot of reading up on it and through hey why not.Wel lets get down to the phone itself.Amazing is all I can say. I use my phone all day for work and the phone did not fail me.Super fast amazing screen, so far has ran every app I have thrown at it (just started to play simpsons tapped out and its looks great on the 5.3 inch screen.Battery life was good with my GS2 I would get home after a 10 hour work day and be on about %30 this phone has kept me going all day of hard use.all in all does perfect for me and what I use it for.Now the downside.The front camera is very very very low quilty, yes it can be used for skype and such but you will notice  how bad it looks when you use it. on the upside the back camera is very good.Sound. The speaker volume is not really up there with other phones, the ringer volume as well is pretty low. I listen to a lot of music in my car and with my music turned up you cant hear the phone ring at all (and I don't have it that high) all in all my GS2 crashed this phone in volume.Case. Don't order a note 2 Case for it it wont fit, the front camera is on the wrong side to fit a note case. also the note 2 is slightly larger, so dont buy the cool otterbox clone case that they recommend on here when you buy the phone, trust me the case is bad ass really nice but it wont fit.All in all I love this phone the fact that it comes with a second battery too is just amazing.I honestly will never buy a name brand phone again when I can pick up this damn good quality clone for a 1/3 of the price and have very little downside to it.I just got my kid the GS3 clone and my wife owns a really GS3 and honestly I like the clone better, the camera blows the real GS3 away.If you want a big phone that's going to run all your apps then buy this.P.S also I have read alot of people ask about how easy is it to set up and so on, no different from my S2 or my Wifes GS3. same droid setup. and yes straight talk worked perfectly on it slid in the sim and your done apart from setting the apn settings (which you have to do with every phone with ST) there was nothing else to set up just add your Google account and your off.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well........", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "RCGBUQWZ6W6ZL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well I must say, I am \"almost\" completely satisfied with this phone. It runs fantastic, is quite large and was a snap to set up. I do have to agree with the other reviews that mention the life span of the batteries, now I know why you get two. It reeeeeeally drains them quick. No wonder it came with two.....lolUpdate: Okay, so it is a little \"glitchy\" at times. Especially when it's charging. I have found that when the charger in plugged in, even the slightest touch sends the screen into a fit.It should also be taken into consideration, since this phone is coming from overseas, almost EVERY word you text will need to be entered into the phones dictionary. Which can get quite frustrating.The phone does have the S-pen like the Galaxy Note however, no S-pen software in installed and when it is removed from the phone it does not react like the Galaxy Note.Ring tones, I always set my phones with different ring tones to distinguish work from personal calls. For some reason this phone finds it funny to just switch ALL my ring tones back to factory tones whenever it feels like it.I will update again if any other \"perks\" arrise.....lol", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice, but glitchy", "Author": "F.

Camera was sharp and fast. I liked it at first until I started finding the flaws. I am grateful that I only order through amazon prime and returns are no hassle. Amazon is awesome.1.Proximity sensor was fading brightness in and out constantly when there was no visible external lighting change.2.after making a call the screen would just go blank even when removed from your face. So you could not use the keypad or even hang up.....That was annoying and is the reason it was returned. I'm sure it has something to do with the proximity sensor also.3. A few times the screen just started flickering, not sure what that was.4. The battery drains fast, and takes ALL night to charge.5. I was unable to find anything on rooting the phone. According to forums and also what I noticed, the reason battery drains fast is the cpu never sleeps when the phone sleeps..It only goes to min speed instead of \"on demand\".", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "SORRY PIECE OF CRAP!", "Author": "aaron helms", "ReviewID": "R1H8K5VO1884AC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone really seriously sucks.

Don't expect this phone to be perfect, keep in mind its a china made phoneI ordered it on Sunday and got it on Friday so it took about 5 days ( I live in Kansas if that makes a difference). The shipping was reasonable and fast. I only used it for about a day and got a general feeling for this phone.My Package contained:A White phone ( I heard a lot of other people receiving grey ones. I think the color is completely random, you get what you get)Silver Stylus located at the bottom of phone ( NOT GOOD AT ALL!!! Stylus is unresponsive and takes a lot of effort to use on the screen....)Head phones ( they aren't that great... but they were free:) I recommend using the headphones with the phone ONLY! I tried using them listening to music on the computer... and the sound was bad)White Flip phone case ( I receive one case... I heard other people getting two... again its completely random... you get what you get. The flip case is HORRIBLE. The flip part doesn't stay on the phone and it gets annoying to use... I advise to use the normal case already attached on the phone)Charger ( Not much to say here. It does the job)User Manual ( One side is Chinese and the other is English. It's not very detailed)Strip of Paper with SIM instructions ( Very helpful)2x BatteriesWhat I LIKE about this phone:It looks really good and sophisticated. The screen is huge (5\"3). The phone is thin and lightweight which makes it easy to hold and carry around.Touch screen is extremely responsive and smooth.RECOGNIZES the SIM card immediately (big bonus). I just insert the card in and it took the phone about 2 seconds to read it and bring service.It easy to get use to and navigate around. Very simple and user friendlyWhat I HATE about this phone:The BIGGEST issue with this phone is BATTERY LIFE. This phones drains sooooooo fast. Gaming, web surfing, facebooking, etc. can cause the phone to die within 2 hours of full charge. It was no wonder that this phone came with 2 batteries....Audio is not the best qualityCamera! Ok, the back camera takes decent pictures but the front is horrible. This phone makes it difficult to  video chat, takes selfies, etc. with the front camera quality.Tips for Extending Battery Life:Turn the BRIGHTNESS ALL THE WAY DOWN!!! Its the number one thing that drains the batteryWhen possible turn off GPS, Cellular data, WIFI, Task ManagerDon't use Live Wallpaper.... Use the normal onesConstantly shut off unused Running AppsHIGHLY RECOMMEND! Go to the Google Play store and download Battery Doctor, Go Power Manager, Quick Setting,Super Task Killer, Go Task Manager, and Battery Indicator... those are the apps I use to help conserve battery, shut off unwanted apps, and figure out how much time I have left before the phone dies.Shut off your phone when you aren't using itCHARGING takes FOREVER on this phone... it takes about an hour for this phone to charge 20% I'm guessing it takes about 4 hours for this phone to fully charge. I highly recommend charging it overnight.* Carry around an extra battery... I know it sounds silly but with the rate of how fast the battery drops on this phone... It's safe to carry around a fully charge battery just in case your phone dies unexpectedly* This phone can last all day if you moderately text, call, game, web surf, listen to music but if you use it heavily 2-4 hours is about as much as you can getExtra Cases and Batteries:This phone doesn't have that many cases to choose from. But if you need a replacement, type Star N7189 in Amazon or Ebay to order new onesSame with batteries. Search Star N7189 on Ebay or Amazon to get extra batteries ( you are going to need it :p)Would I Recommend it?IF you need a fast short term phone to mostly text and call, I highly recommend you to take this phone into considerationbut If you are looking for a long lasting phone.... I would get another phone.... I read that this phone lasts about 6-12 months before it starts breaking downIF you are the type of person who mostly text or call and moderately use it for games and web surfing... This phone would fit youBUT if you are the type of person who does heavy game playing, web surfing, facebooking, watching videos, etc. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this phone to you... you are better off with a more expensive and reliable phone.Overall, this is a good phone for the price and it works but I wouldn't count on it lasting long", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "BEST FOR THE MONEY", "Author": "David W.

When I first boot up the phone regardless if it says 1GB or less of RAM it came on within 15 seconds very impressed.

However, it wasn't the grey color that I ordered, it was white, (I can live with it). I was really excited when I looked at the box that it came in, which said MT6589 Quad Core Processor 1.2 GHz. Sadly, the box lied.  AnTuTu tests showed it to be the dual-core MT6577 as advertised, but what is advertised, that isn't true, is the 4Gb ROM. Testing showed it to be just under 1Gb.  The RAM measurements were a bit odd, too. Test showed  512Mb RAM internal and 1Gb external (I haven't added any external RAM yet). Otherwise all of the other specs appear to be spot on, ie..8MP camera. The instructions could been better. Pictures of the icons, for example, were black. Real men don't need no stink'n instructions anyway, right?There are some irksome apps pre-installed. Can't for the life of me figure out how to delete the bookmarked Chinese websites in the browser, for example.Overall it's a pretty good phone.

I have had this gem for just about a month now and my only concerns are very trivial. I would say this phone is 98.9% 5 star worthy. My only concern has been the need for an extra long mini USB, but if you don't move it too much it works on a normal one, the back cover is a bit thin, and the speaker can be a little quiet on some but not all calls.I use this phone on Straight Talk's network. I can download apps in seconds, peruse the internet with no qualms, and the battery life is decent for a phone that can run so much at a time.I am so happy with this phone I plan on buying another for my fiance, or one just like it!Thanks!", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Died after 11 months", "Author": "Ralph H.

For starters, I  ordered this phone 10/20/13 and received it on Halloween 10/31/13. Whoo hoo!!! It took only 10 days included weekends to come from China To NY so that's a Plus. When i received it, it came with everything it said it would (2 batteries, flip case/screen protector, Rubber skin case, 1 back covers for the back of actual phone, Charger  - with usb and plug port separate and of course the phone). **Key Note must put in SimCard to turn it on or else a little green Andriod will be displayed with his body lookin like he is missing something and a red caution sign will appear**This phone Can WORk WITH ONE SIM CARD so don't believe the hype about the phone has to have 2 sims to work because thats what i did and it works. (I Only have One ATT Sim card) In addition, Apps are easy to install,  Back Camera Works very fine, Front Camera is poor quality looks very dull even when Bright lighting and can not be adjusted  by the settings like the Back  Camera. Otherwise this would be my ONLY pet peave.As for the actual screen size, It is alil bigger than specified. The screen is a 5.5 inch screen rather than a 5.3 inch which does kinda make a difference if you had a desired case that would fit a samsung galaxy note 3; This phone would not fit because it would be slightly too big. Otherwise, this phone's response to commands are even Faster than the blink of an eye. Its probably faster than any phone with a Brand name.Overal, l I love this phone despite the Front camera's dullness which i'm kind of sad about.BUY BUY BUY!!! I would say.

G3 works OK w/ good speed, WIFI and Bluetooth connection are both good, light sensor, GPS, proximity sensor and G sensor all working good.  For the price i m paying, its totally worth it, ringer is loud if you wanted it to be.  the screen dosent die as other claimed it will , it was just a wrong proximity sensor calibration, there is nothing wrong w the product plus its an easy fix, the phone is not defective at all.  one thing that annoys me is it dosent  come with any good documentation or manual for the explanation on its features and functions, like what are the actual sensors installed in the phone, sensor calibration etc.  i have try to checked on  the available sensors and some of them are either not present or dont work well, like the internal compass, so i wasnt able to use it as a navigation device. also i dont think this phone is compatible with retrofitting a wireless battery charger like other late model branded smart phones. correct me if i m wrong.This phone's Antutu score was only at 8400,  the 2D and  3D rendering suck on this phone, so games dont play well on this,Taking and watching HD videos and photos is acceptable though.  all these shortcomings are so, because the phone is only a dualcore cpu phone w/ QHD display screen. for a better gaming phone, one has to look at a quadcore, with full HD display, then the games should play really well. i think i would have bought the quadcore w/ full HD display phone. but its also 50 bucks more expensive than this model at close to $180.  for what i do ( basic communication, text msg, net surfing, social networking, watching and taking HD videos and photos and a very occasional gamer) i think this phone's capability is adequate for me, and i am totally satisfied with this phone.
