Since I live in Argentina I had the phone sent to a friends house in Miami and when she came to Argentina she brought me the iphone. I was surprised when I found out that the cable USB/charger was broken. However, I used the one from my IPAD that perfectly fits. After a week, the battery stopped charging, so I took it to a Mac store in my country.  I was told that the iphone was not new device (it was refurbished) and further, had missing parts inside.

Here is the correspondence about the purchase and you can make up your own mind about the seller.Buyer - I ordered the iPhone 4S as a present for my wife's birthday. The day she opened the present, she found that the ringer button does not function at all. The phone is always in the ringer mode and cannot be silenced. The only work around is to turn the volume completely down each time she goes into a quiet building. We have compared the settings with another iPhone 4 and found that it is indeed the function of the ringer button that is not working.Seller - I am so sorry about this issue. \u00a0We can have you refunded to repair the item at a local repair shop of yours or we can refund you in full with a return of the item. \u00a0For now she can also turn the ringer off by going to settings, then to sounds, and dragging the volume all the way down. \u00a0Once again I am so sorry for this issue and we will take are of it 100 percent until you are satisfied.Buyer - My wife attempted to have the phone repaired yesterday at an Apple Store. They were not able to repair the faulty ringer switch. They checked the phone history and found that it had been originally sold in October 2011 and had been registered to someone else. It had been purchased in Kansas from an Apple Store.I am extremely disappointed to find this out when the item description on the Amazon website described the phone as \"Condition: New\".I expect a full refund for this purchase. I also expect an explanation of why an item described as \"Condition: New\" is in fact second hand.Seller - I am so sorry about this entire situation. \u00a0We purchased the phone from a customer and they had informed us it was new. \u00a0We looked the phone over and from what we could tell the accessories and phone was new. \u00a0That is why we sold it as new. I am not sure if they had just gotten it in 2011 and not used it or what happened exactly. \u00a0We buy these phones from customers that come to us wanting to sell their iphones. \u00a0I am so sorry and we did not mean to mislead you in anyway. \u00a0We will have you refunded in full if you will return the product or can have you refunded to the used price of an Iphone 4s. \u00a0Please let me know which one you prefer.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "i can get my own iphone 4s unlocked for 649$ from apple store", "Author": "not cool price", "ReviewID": "R1XBJFP2OT31RY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "not so cool price ,, i can get my own iphone 4s unlocked for 649$ from apple store and ship it to my country :p", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Estefy", "ReviewID": "R3HT2L0WTXZ8GS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "El producto llego en excelentes condiciones, en el tiempo indicado.

The sound quality of the calls were very poor, crackling noise and the sound had no body, such as if the call was coming from the inside of a can, very low and sharp metal like sound.In summary I think I paid over the top for handset that underperformed overall. I am dissapointed. I contacted the retailer, who informed that if I shipped it back to them, they would fix the earpiece issue and then return it. This would mean I would be without a phone for many days, which these days isn't good enough.I can understand that they can repair it and then return, but I think that is not good enough.

While there are many many features that are obviously copied from Android, Apple somehow made the drop down bar, being my favorite feature in Android, annoying and bothersome to use!!! I am very glad however that iTunes is no longer required to anchor the phone down. Everything from the Screen to the battery life truly disappoints. On top of being an over-promised product, Apple has refused to help support it even though its only 21 days old!!! The closest Apple store is a 250 mile round-trip. If i would've just gone with the GS2 as I had wanted to, i wouldve been able to go to Sprint and had them take care of all my issues.I truly don't recommend this phone unless you absolutely cannot live without an Apple product or live within a decent range of an Apple store, other than that, I'm finding my friend's ATT GS2 far above the 4S in almost every way and will be getting rid of my 4S to get one as soon as i can.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "WIFI NOT WORKING", "Author": "FRANCISCO CAAMA\u00d1O CERNADA", "ReviewID": "RYRDI3JBVOJXM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I BOUGHT IT FOR A FRIEND IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.

Unfortunately, the mobile operators in my country do not support FaceTime and sell a local iPhone 4S version without the application; some local retailers sell iPhone 4S with FaceTime and charge significantly high, but I managed to save money by purchasing it from Amazon.com plus the ship-forwarding. Even if the mobile operator does not support FaceTime, I can still use it with Apple ID and free of charge through Wi-Fi. I am also very pleased with WorldWide Distributors since they shipped the phone free within one day and delivered it to my US address in four days. The only one issue I had is that when I tried to set up the phone for the first time, it failed to verify and gave me a message that the phone might be damaged; I tried many ways to get it working, including a hard restore back to manufacturer using iTunes, but I still get the same message. I reported this to WorldWide Distributors to request for a replacement, but four days after when I was about to ship it back, I gave it a final try and surprisingly it passed the verification and worked. I do not know what happened, but the phone was probably suffering from jet lag and needed few days to recover.
