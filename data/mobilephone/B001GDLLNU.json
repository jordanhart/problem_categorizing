Upgradable memory (microSD is very convenient) and memory is accessible as a disk drive on a computer so you are not tied to proprietary software to upload music.Cons:  Buttons are embedded under screen, take some practice to get used to.  Not the best texting phone.Phone is a bit on the large size - about the size of an iPhone.  On the other hand this means there are a wide choice of iPhone cases which will work with this phone.Phone does all that I wanted (phone+music+radio+quadband) so I am quite satisfied with the phone.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "My Son was Happy", "Author": "Rhonda R.

The face is one solid piece. I like that. Makes it harder for liquids to enter the surface. This is a very good phone. I wanted two things on my phone, a camera, and a music player. This phone had both and they served me very well. Unfortunately after about a year of use, I dropped it pretty hard and the keypad stopped working. Disappointing. It was a good phone. I prefer it over the $400 touch-screen I have now.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent phone, great for music", "Author": "Jules", "ReviewID": "R2V6DTCFVKWOK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great low cost music phone. I love how the keys light up in music mode, it no longer looks like a phone, it looks like an MP3 player. And with a microSD card, I'm keeping tons of songs on it. It also has a regular jack, so you can use any headphones or earphones with it, and the radio reception is good.I've been having it for about a year now, and I've been satisfied with it. It did freeze a few times though, I think it was because of some intensive web browsing that I was doing at the time. I didn't use the camera that much, at 2MP the pictures are decent but nothing spectacular. Battery life is ok. Oh, and I could use it abroad without any issues, on different carriers, it's quad band so it worked.Of course, it's not a smartphone, but if you need a cheap practical phone for talking, texting, basic web browsing and most importantly MUSIC, this is it.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Phone for Kids", "Author": "TamaSamoa684", "ReviewID": "R1LELU00EP8PGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is the best you can get without breaking the bank.

The phone has been durable so far. Haven't had any problems using the phone. The only negative thing I have to say about the phone is that the numbers aren't always lit up. Once the light goes off, the numbers go dark also. Hasn't really been an issue though. I don't have texting on my phone, but I'm not sure it would be the best for texting because of the lighting on the numbers.Overall, I like the phone a lot!", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Motorolla EM30", "Author": "ARIF MALIK", "ReviewID": "R1I1NOE9VG8BA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IT .

However, when I tried to replace it, I had much difficulty since the L9 seem to have discontinued.  And so, I purchased the Motorola Motorokr EM30 with great expectation that I was upgrading.  Though, this product operates well (clear visuals and sound) like my old L9 (yet to play the FM radio), I'm unable to send and receive text messages which makes the equipment almost useless to me as most of my friends and relatives communicate through texting.  As such, in the past weeks since receiving this product my communication has indeed suffered.  It shouldn't be too hard imagining that I'm not too happy with this purchase right now.  Therefore, if anyone can share why I'm unable to send or receive text using my new phone I would greatly appreciate after spending all this money.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "The phone has problems", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "R19B8OWVXPW4EX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It'll freeze for a good 15 seconds at times, mainly when someone is calling, and therefor not allowing you to answer the phone, BUT it'll still ring. It has actually turned off a few times when i tried answering the phone. and the \"2 megapixel\" camera, sucks majorly. At the finest and highest quality, the picture looks like it's not even 1mp quality. Really though, the only GOOD experience I've had with this phone is that, the sound quality is awesome... when it decides to let you pick up the phone. I bought it about almost 2 months ago to replace my old Sony Ericsson. But even with the 2 years of use, i think i'd still prefer the Sony over this phone. Oh... and this phone screwed up my proxy settings for my text messaging and what not. I do like the fact that you can use the music you put on the phone as ringtones/alarms though.But Overall.. this phone is a piece of crap... 2/5", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Moto EM30", "Author": "ABC", "ReviewID": "R5P1PS920FN3H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hi,The product is good, i have not received the specified accessories.Hence,i have landup to return.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Got charged twice for 1 ITEM!!!
