With the misguided hope that, apart from a tolerable downgrade in the hardware specifications and a minor reduction in the plethora of software features, it'd be pretty much the same user experience. It wasn't....well at least not quite. A few of what I've heard people term as the \"gimmicky\" features made it's way to this tiny twin, for example, smart stay (which is the only feature I found that doesn't work all the time for me...or at least not the way I expect it to, i.e., my eyes are open, I'm staring at the screen reading an article or something so the screen won't time out...but it still does sometimes), there's the IR sensor/blaster coupled with the watchOn app that controls almost any smart TV and cable set top box (I found this pretty useful - very easy and simple to set up and functions how it should - it integrates with the calender so you can set reminders for your shows from within the app). There's also the floating video or picture in picture \"gimmick\" (this only seems to work with videos played by the native video player, so some fb videos, recorded videos, etc., will able to be played like this, but not youtube videos - from my experience at least). A few camera modes that I was soo looking forward to were also disappointingly not included, such as drama shot, eraser and animated photo; you can't take a pic of yourself while taking a regular pic either [insert sad face here]. The display is bright and has good visibility in direct sunlight. It has very rich colours, which is noticeable in (properly lit, focused) photos as well. There are slight pre-programmed adjustments you can make to this feature. The anti-shake camera feature does nothing for me, pics still looked shaken. Air gestures are also not present (at least this one I knew before purchasing), so no hovering your finger above the screen for magnification of text or pics and no waving the hand to scroll pages. There is no LED light to indicate missed events; which might not be SUCH a bad thing considering that they've instead included a feature to notify you of missed events when you pick up the phone from a rested state - the phone gives a single quick vibration. This, however, seems to only work for sms messages and missed calls; no other social application's missed event is recognized...not even an email. This, in my opinion, is a fail for two reasons, 1. because of  the foregoing statement and 2. the vibrations cannot be customized as how the LED notification colours could be specified for different apps. A better alternative to a LED notification light could have been what the LG G2 or Motorola X does for missed events notifications...but now I'm just ranting.Overall it's a pretty good phone, I like it. It looks neat and simple with a band of aluminum around the edges, fits snug in the average sized hand, and I prefer this S4 shape to the shape of the S3. Simply put, it's a smaller version of the S4, with noticeably less software features and lower hardware specs., but looks, feels, performs well enough and carries over enough \"gimmicky\" features from the S4 for you to be satisfied... with what you can afford to purchase ;)", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a huge upgrade... if you come from an S3 mini!", "Author": "H. S. Marquez", "ReviewID": "R3HCS5E43CKKW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The headline summarizes much of my thought: not a huge upgrade if you come from and S3 mini (GT-I8190). The screen is brighter and clearer... however is narrower (you can notice when you read your emails or the news). Faster than the S3? just a little! Battery life? almost the same: it should be recharged night after night. What I do liked most: the beautiful and stylized design and user interface as well as the WatchON App wich allows me to even use the phone as a remote for my TV and the DirectTV receiver and saves me much of the zapping :)-----Espa\u00f1ol----El t\u00edtulo resume gran parte de mi pensamiento: no es una gran mejora si vienes y S3 mini (GT-I8190).

Campbell", "ReviewID": "R1X2K6XYULQV8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to use with a U.S. pay-as-you-go carrier that I won't name here, but I've been happy with them. And I'm very happy with this phone. It's important to keep in mind that this is a scaled-down version of the S4. It's smaller in size, which makes it a lot easier to get out of my pocket; I'm not going to be watching Avatar on a cell phone. But it's got a lighter-weight processor than the S4, so it's scaled down on some of the features, too. Things like being able to make gestures without having to touch the phone - after you make your friends say gee whiz once, who cares? Less bloatware means the S4 Mini performs quickly with the processor that it has, and the battery lasts all day for me, too (though like I said, I'm not streaming movies). What I do miss, though, is no notification light after you get a text, email, missed call, etc. Also, its on-board memory is a skimpy 8 GB, and the system is going to use about 3 GB of that, so you definitely want to buy a high-speed micro SD card to expand your memory - especially if you want to listen to music, take a lot of photos and videos, etc. It will handle up to a 64 GB card; I got an inexpensive Class 10 32 GB here on Amazon. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, I can't get the \"I'm looking at you, phone, so don't turn off the screen\" feature to work either. But considering you're paying far less than you would for a grown up S4, or for an iPhone, the S4 Mini is a great bargain. Also, this is the 3G single-SIM version - know what you're buying before you blame someone else for you buying the wrong model.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Robert L.

Obviously like comparing apples and oranges since the U8800 is much older technology and the S4 Mini uses Android 4.2.2 vs 2.2.The camera is incredible for a phone camera. Images are sharp and colors are true. It has a rapid fire feature that makes it even nicer. I did have to contact my carrier, Consumer Cellular, in order to get MMS working properly and sending pix messages. But the tech was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and courteous. She walked me through the steps to set up an APN and I tested it by sending several pix to a couple of people.I haven't rooted it yet and might not.

Larger phones are an ergonomic disaster and very uncomfortable to use.  This becomes obvious once you try a phone like the S4 mini.  The cheap plastic backs of Samsung phones makes them more drop proof and the screen resolution and camera performance was adequate for me compared to the Nexus 4.  The problem with this phone are the many software bugs and the hit or miss screen responsiveness and after a couple of months it gets to be very annoying.  The cursor jumps around far from the point of contact on the screen when typing.  The desktop screen widgets sometimes blink annoyingly.  Google voice functions never work when the bluetooth is connected - you hit the mic icon, music is paused and then the phone recognizes nothing.  Google voice functions with the bluetooth off are better but not nearly as smooth and reliable as on the nexus 4.  Bluetooth transfers to my laptop rarely work and never work with any speed even though every other phone I had worked well with my laptop's bluetooth.  Finally every single Samsung branded application is a nuisance and a failed attempt to get users to sign up to yet another service/digital content provider to buy media and apps - stupid.  I will probably be replacing this with a Nexus 5 now that it has an acceptable 32gb of storage.  Is is much larger and less comfortable but I will probably end up breaking the S4 mini for being so aggravating to use.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Luiggi Restivo", "ReviewID": "R2D45ZLXUPKL34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great phone simple powerfull and faster i recommend for all people i use this in venezuela and nice for that", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "the best cellular", "Author": "Luis A.

The phone they sent me has a stuck pixel to the right side of the screen which flashes red from time to time (and sometimes just stays there, as a red dot). They knew about this and still sent it to me, how do I know? Because they had turned on the phone before, android didn't even ask me to set up my google account, something it always does when first turning on a factory reset phone, that's because they had already turned it on and installed some Region Code Lock away app or something like that. It's good that they took the time to do it if they at least informed me beforehand but this phone is supposed to be UNLOCKED from factory. If they didn't install this then it was the person they sold this to (and returned) before me.. and they didn't even had the decency of factory resetting it. Also, this page is for the galaxy s4 mini BLACK not BLACK MIST, the one they ultimately sent me. Luckily I also like that color but they shouldn't send something different than the one the page advertises.I had to go overseas right after getting the phone so I'm unable to return it (I also can overlook most of this, even the stuck pixel issue, which I think can fade over time) but beware of this SHOPEBEST SELLER since it is full of crap.UPDATE 05/25/2014For custom roms users: for me the battery life is way worse with cyanogenmod. I have always used custom roms in my previous phones but mostly based on touchwiz. This phone is the first one where I have used cyanogenmod intensively and while I love all the power user options of the rom I was extremely disappointed with the battery life. I just could not make it through the day without having to recharge it at work and I HATE to charge twice a day, it also isn't very good for the battery's health over the long term. Also, the battery life indicator was incredibly unreliable once you reached under 20% levels. You could have 15% battery life (on stock the phone can make it home safely with that) left and after ten minutes the phone will be at 4% and turning off. I was left out hanging because of this more than once and when I needed the phone the most (as I was just going home from work). That was using default cyanogenmod settings of course (default scheduler and governor, no overclock or undervolted, etc) but most of the fancy stuff disabled (location, gps, data sync, nfc, etc) the same way I have it with touchwiz. In fairness some people on XDA forums seem to get good battery life out of this phone on cm but I don't know what kind of customizations they have used (most undervolt) or how they use the phone I'm just talking of my experience here. Me? I happen to like touchwiz, a lot actually, always have. I specially like how it looks (I don't know what all the hate is about). I even used a touchwiz theme on cm (it never looked quite as good as touchwiz though but that is expected). About the cm power options I miss? I can have them using the Xposed framework with the touchwiz-specific Wanam Exposed module (make sure you know what you're doing before meddling with it, but is mostly safe, needs root). I had never used the Xposed framework before and IT IS AMAZING. Glad I found it since I now have alternatives in case I don't find good custom roms (for this phone they're all mostly cyanogenmod-based). I hope this helps. PS: I initially posted this on my 9195 review since that is the model I own now but it applies to the 9190 too, since I have used cyanogenmod with both.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "galaxy s4 mini", "Author": "william joseph", "ReviewID": "R2X3OCT8FI2ZH5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got it for my wife and she absolutely loves this phone.
