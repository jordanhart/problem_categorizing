{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Cell phone!!!!", "Author": "Fireman26 \"FireMan 18\"", "ReviewID": "R27OAHVZRLGKKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My service is Net10 (Straight Talk) in Northern, Va. Everything works: Data, Text and Picture Text. You would have to go to its website to setup the data service with a new APN.I only have this phone for a day,  got it yesterday (03/18/2014).  I got it one day in advance ( Thank you Amazon for that) and I'd started to play with it right away.**The Best things about this phone (Version D802) is that, it does not come with any pre-loaded and annoying software packages from neither AT&T; nor T-Mobile or any other cell phone company. Thank You God!! So you are not limited by them.  However It does come with some LG applications as expected.You will love that the you can activate the Tethering on this phone since it does not have any limitation from Att or T-Mobile.  I have done it with my Net10 service, but I cannot abuse it otherwise my service will be cancelled by Net10This phone is like a rocket, very fast. Responsiveness is for a person whom want everything for \"yesterday\" like me. Again this phone is lightning fast!!.  The phone has a gorgeous and perfect HD screen. The colors are bright and the details are amazing (I'm not going to be too technical about this).Playing Videos (Netflix, Hulu Plus, The CW and more) are play without a hiccup, very smooth like a silk. Going through the movies on Nextflix is not frustrating anymore, you will see the icons almost right away. Now  my internet Service is Comcast 50MB Download, this also can play a difference while using applications that connect to the internet. Your responsiveness might be different.Streaming music via Pandora and Spotify is not a problem either.  Both applications work like charm while streaming.Speaker, i think is the weakest point on this phone. It is an average speaker.  I think LG could have done a better job with the speaker considering that this is a high-end cell phone. But not a big deal for me since a use headphones or my Vizio 5.1 speaker system.**Battery Life is amazing if I compare it with my previous LG G Optimus. The LG G2 with mild (phone call, internet use, chat, audio stream, emails) use from 6:00 to 18:30 I still have 76%. My one-month-old LG G from 6:00-16:00 is with 5-10%. I have not have a heavy use yet, but I will let you know how that goes. This phone also come with an international adapter and a head phone.The 2 taps on the screen to \" wake up\" the phone, I like that. I found out that it is easier that trying to push the power button to \"wake up\" your phone.I found out that that it is easier for me to use both the volume and the power button on the back of the phone, since my index finger is right on top of the them while I'm talking.  I do not have to guess where the volume is anymore.I haven't taken my first picture  with the 13mb-camera or use skype yet.This phone has a Guest Mode, like the computers do. If somebody wants to use your phone, just switch it to Guest Mode and that person won't be able to screw up your phone, change anything or look at your personal information.  You can also decide what application(s) that person can use while on Guest Mode. Nice!!! Specially if you have children whom like to play with your phone or watch videos.Being an iPhone user (up to iPhone 5), I can tell that this phone is way better, even better that the iPhone 5s.This is everything for now, I will be back to let you know the rest.  I hope this humble review help you to make a more inform decision and remember that you might have a different experience base on your cell phone company and your internet service provider.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "awsome!!!!", "Author": "Zafir Khan", "ReviewID": "R3IEOQ94DQ5ETH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an LG user for some time, great phone, really quick.

The phone came in the perfectly-shielded shipping box, without a scratch. When I opened the box, I could see that the factory seal of the box is broken, however covered with another circular LG sticker. May be it's something genuine, like the open box merchandise you get from Best Buy & other places. The mobile box contains the phone, headset, USB cable, & the charger unit. All of them are sealed & with new tags/plastic covers on them. The phone is not marked by any provider's logo.I'll update my feedback once I use it abroad. Overall, it's a positive first impression", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Doesn't last", "Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "RQZ24ZZ6FDH7A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ive hd my phone for about a month now and it will no longer hold a charge and it takes a full day to even charge the phone.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "lifestyle cellphone are scammers... do no lift 3g in 1900 band", "Author": "Judit &.", "ReviewID": "R10SI0GO8W8271", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ok, let's begin, it is possible that my phone lg g2 sold you do not lift the band 3g 1900?? it is cheating the consumer, the seller is cellphone lifestyle are swindlers, it hurts not in USA because I demand ...", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "AMAZING PHONE", "Author": "Phillip Ray", "ReviewID": "R38SJ21BJX18NI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price there is no better phone on the market.

I've just passed my iPhone 5 to my wife, after many years of using Apple smart phones. I am aware that the Samsung market penetration should have a strong reason, and I wanted to experiment a change in my life. But before to make a decision I checked the reviews and discovered that LG has a better ranking than Samsung, and is cheaper, probably because is not \"in fashion\" as the latter.  I am using the LG G2 since one week, so I am still discovering his features and trying to get used with Android. So far, I am very satisfied with the phone and I think that will fulfill my expectations.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "the better cell that I have", "Author": "Jurdi", "ReviewID": "R3B8CW4GP5P5MY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In a lot of senses is much better that the Galaxy s4 in hardware and the software is very practice and nice,", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "G2", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R152LUQ9PZJQ6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do like LG G2.

It's not justified the fact to take it out of my pockets every time I want to change stations. Hopefully this will be improved in updates.I really like the three Front Touch Buttons on the screen 5.2 inches. However, this buttons greatly reduce the real screen size to 4.8 inches most of the apps. I suggest a new option to hide/show this buttons in order to maximize the screen usage.
