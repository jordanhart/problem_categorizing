{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy to use feature rich basic phone", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R2C87DBQTP223M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this with a 2 year contract with Verizon awhile back. At the time it was a great phone that served all of my needs. The QTRY keyboard was easy to use, plus it was light weight user friendly. Sending text with photo or video attachment where as easy as any phone I've had or easier. I loved this phone and the only reason I upgraded to a smart phone was there was a huge discount on the Droid on my next contract.Over all I liked this phone better than the droid 2. It's a very simple to use phone that really is packed with features ( though smaller the display is tiny compared to newer phones ) for a basic phone. I would recommend this phone for someone that  wants good quality phone calls, plus texting with picture/video attachments without having to take a class to use the phone.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": ".", "Author": "Dashisinthis83", "ReviewID": "RUGPBZ5PA7R9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This good phone but it is held back by a suspect battery and there is a high chance that some or most of your keys may stop working.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "jabo", "ReviewID": "R15G9FV38B38VP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "have had this phone for 4 years, never had any trouble with this phone, even after all this time the battery still holds a charge great", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone! Best feature phone out there!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RWIMTWEH0PRE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a hardy non-smartphone that's great for texting with a great camera that has a long battery life, this is for you. This is the first phone I ever bought six years ago. The phone took a beating (the worst being a fall off a roof into a bucket of water), but held together for over four years. When it came time to get a new phone, rather than upgrade to a smartphone and pay absurd data fees (which I was told was the only option from Verizon), I came on Amazon and purchased the phone and took it in to Verizon to have them activate it. They weren't pleased, but I am. This phone has great software, loud speakers, big screen inside, texts fast, and feels solid in your hands. I can't say I have any reservations about this phone.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "no scratches, terrible battery", "Author": "lindsay", "ReviewID": "RD7IFUYDGZEP8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone looks brand new and all the buttons and what not works.
