Well, after a long search, I found an answer in this phone the Samsung D900.  This is an unlocked GSM/world phone, and will work out of the box on any GSM network woldwide(in USA: T-Mobile and AT&T;/Cingular).Have had it for over a year now, and am quite pleased with its impressive array of features, which include a great 3mp camera (with Camcorder- unlike iPhone) and mp3 player and terrific polyphonic sound.It also allows mp3s to be played as ringtones, (although you will need to crop them down using various software) which means no more purchasing the same song twice- once for your musing device, and then again for the phone).It is a slider design, which I have grown to really like, over clamshells. The sliding mechanism opens and retracts smooth as silk, as only Samsung can seem to do. Reliability has been great, as I dropped it on the street once, and it didn't even get a scratch.The one drawback I found is I can't get it to save my sent text messages. Also, could use an fm radio, which I believe is in the works. Also, this is not a heavy email/internet type device, but is loaded with features in an exceptionallly small package.Even after a year, i think this phone is still at the cutting edge.", "Date": "November 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "review", "Author": "M.

The numbers pad is flat so it's a bit harder to text with than most but but that is the only complaint. It has a very bright light for taking pics and video or if you need a handy light to find a keyhole or whatever. Have had it for awhile now and NO problems.
