Christensen", "ReviewID": "R3KHVD03VXFYOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned way too many phones. Based on the reviews I decided to also try the Galaxy N7000 which is also called the Samsung Galaxy Note. It is a smart phone with a serious sized screen. The phone runs android 2.3 so be aware that it is not the lastest android version and it is not clear it will be released with sandwich. The call quality is excellent. The internet speed on AT&T; is also great as it uses the real 4G (LTE) network features. The system comes with the standard Samsung application package, it is entirely OK, but I am not too crazy about their calendar app. The phone has pretty good overall performance. The GPS tracking for google map, yelp, ... is slow acquiring a satellite fix (5-10 times slower than iPhone). The big screen is excellent for email reading/web browsing. However the big screen does imply that it barely fits in one hand and for example for running using Run Keeper or a similar application, it is really too large. So great for sit down use, but less convenient for use on the move.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Vicente E.

Is the first one a US version. Both phones have the single home button though, which makes me think that both are international versions even though amazon doesnt specify whether or not the Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 is an international version. If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know. I want to buy the US version that allows me to use the Galaxy note with Tmobile and get 4G after I radio hack it. thanks!!!!", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great...for an Android Phone", "Author": "SudsySoper", "ReviewID": "R20YRYAJOVONFS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this 'Phablet'(half Phone / half Tablet) for my wife as she had tried it and really wanted it.
