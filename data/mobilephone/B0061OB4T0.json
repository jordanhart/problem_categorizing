The headpiece was terrible, we had a lot of problems carrying out a conversation - it was frustrating.My advice is to spend the extra money and get a better quality phone or you can try your luck, who knows, maybe I got a bad one.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "awful phone.", "Author": "Whaddyathinksintheburgers", "ReviewID": "RA844ZTVBXID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the screen resolution is lousy that when someone sends you a picture you need to zoom in to see any detail. There is a huge lag between when you begin dialing and when it starts entering. For instance from the home screen if you wanted to call 123-4567 you would begin dialing. you would press 123 and it would show nothing for about 2 seconds and show a 3 only. Now you have to erase that and start over. This phone is really bad. My guess is that they're trying to get you to go for one of their \"smart\" phones by offering as bad a phone as this. Worst phone I've had since the 90s.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poorly made", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "ROBQJL5JP8HGJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a replacement for someone who had the previous version of this phone for at least 2 years and needed a new phone due to the lettering wearing off on the buttons.  Needless to say the phone didn't last 4 months. The screen is white and has green lines going through. The phone has been in a case since day one to protect it.
