I used iPhone for the past 3 years and I was happy with it. I checked the new iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 and I wasn't impressed... it look all alike the prior versions and just a \"faster\" phone. I have a tablet with Android 4.x for the last couple of months and I'm not impressed either, it's a nice toy but will not entirely suited for work and will never replace my or be useful enough to compete against a small netbook. Prior to the iPhone I had a Windows 6 phone, Treo 680, Treo 600 and others no-smart phone.I ordered this phone a couple weeks ago, it is one of the cheapest phone with very decent hardware specs. The only downside is the storage capacity but since I don't store music or videos on my phone, it is more than enough for me.So far, is the BEST phone I ever had, I'm impressed everyday about the integration of my contacts and how easy it is to do everything. From the regular contact page of the phone, it integrates with all your emails accounts information (MSN, Gmail and Outlook), your facebook profiles including pictures and activities and your LinkedIn profiles. You cannot find a better way to have everything under a single contact page.Since this phone connect to the 4G network, it is fast and accurate. I'm just waiting for the 7.8 Windows Phone update to make it complete. I couldn't be happier with my phone. I am definitively going to recommend Windows Phone to anybody and any of future phones will be based on Windows.It has 2 cameras, front camera is low quality but look decent when doing facetime. The rear camera is 5MP but very good quality. My Girlfriend has a 8MP camera on her cell and my pictures look better than hers....6 stars out of 5...NOTE: In case you need more storage, look for the Samsung Focus S, it has 16GB and 8MP camera instead of 5MP....", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best affordable 4G mobile", "Author": "safeer", "ReviewID": "R3DP4GMZUY6UY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first windows phone, I am so excited to grab the features.

However, I will go through the pros and cons as thoroughly as possible:Pros:1) As advertised, the phone will be able to use 4G LTE. As advertised, it is an unlocked phone so you will be able to use T-Mobile as your provider with this phone.2) Screen size, phone size, and screen clarity are all up to par. Wifi goes fast, the layout is intuitive and responsive.3) Microsoft office is a big plus.4) Syncs your social networks together (will link your email to start screen, facebook pictures automatically to your contacts)5) Skype is nice6) Front and rear facing camera of good enough qualityCons:1) My biggest issue is that if you plan to use T-Mobile, your MMS MAY NOT WORK THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. I downloaded 3rd party apps and tried to manually change the APN but it was only a temporary fix and it seems T-Mobile is purposely trying to block people with unlocked phones from using MMS.2) If you plan to use Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, Tinder, or many other famous apps that many Android and iOS users use, DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. This is a Windows Phone 7 (upgradeable to 7.8) and they currently do not have these apps. In my personal opinion (I may be wrong), Microsoft has forsaken Windows Phone 7 and these apps will NEVER be released for Windows Phone 7.3) There are many games available at the Windows Store, but most of the games that come free in Android and iOS will cost money. They are usually anywhere from $0.99 to $3.99 each.My overall impression with the phone is that it has decent hardware specs and capabilities but is underutilized by the lack of apps, effectively alienating you from other users that has iOS and Android.If you are big on apps, Windows Phone is not the way to go.If you are not big on apps and only want the phone for social networking and internet browsing, this phone is a good deal for the price.I hope I helped", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Rosemarie Guarino", "ReviewID": "R2H7G8E56DQFS4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was able to get a phone - new from store for 1/2 the price.

Simonsen Jr. \"sunkid4ks\"", "ReviewID": "R27692FLV4TRB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These were my wife & I's first shot at Smartphones for personal use; previously we had Samsung Brightside Touchscreen 'smart-capable' phones from Verizon that got us acquainted with touchscreens.  I won't tell you all the things that I did not like about the SCH-U380, but I have always had luck with the reception of Samsung phones- and being able to talk on your phone is the most important aspect of any cell- in my opinion.  Ultimately the motivator to move to this phone was the monthly service bill being 25% more for less service (no data); so we needed an inexpensive alternative to the expensive 'gucci' phones that are $500-700.  We found it in the Samsung Focus 2.  Comparatively I have had Blackberry, iPhone4, and iPhone5 work phones; that aren't as capable as this phone.  It has everything you could possible need for business or pleasure with a price tag well under half of the other smartphones (bought outright with no contracts).  The Focus 2 allows you to easily access call lists, voicemail, number dialing, phone book, texts, email, camera and photos, internet, games, calendar, calculator, alarms, and has great preloaded Apps like Marketplace (App Store), Local, and Maps.  This is a Windows 7.5 Mango OS phone, so you don't get quite the selection of games that you do with an iPhone; but the important 'productive' ones like Weather, News, Stocks, GasBuddy, CardStar, Skype, and Dropbox are all available.  My wife is perfectly content with the game selection that she perhaps has time to play 15 minutes a day before bedtime.  So other than the Windows 7 game selection, I would say that the only other two slights would be the 5.0 mps camera that does not have quite the clarity or quick shutter speed with time-delay between the button-push and the snapshot, along with the SLIGHTLY slower 1.4 GHz processor speed- but honestly, who can tell me if they have 28 Mbps or 12 Mbps wireless internet speed?  If you can, you might want to spend the money to step up to the Odyssey.  That is all I can tell everyone from experiences of the past eight months.  We both love the phones, they are white and chic (thanks to Apple, I guess), get great reception on GSM networks, were half the price of a Windows 8 Phone (when looking 6/13), and have had zero problems with them thus far.  My wife is not 'tech savvy' and she has figured out almost every feature on the phone easily with her background of MS OSs and her MS Surface that I bought her.  If you are tepid about getting this for your first Smartphone because it is a couple years old; don't doubt yourself, jump right in and get it!
