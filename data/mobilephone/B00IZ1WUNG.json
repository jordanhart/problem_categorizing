{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Evolutionary NOT revolutionary!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R2GZ37FQL0R2MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers!  I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available.Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery.  I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the \u201cundisputed king of the Android smartphone space\u201d. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products.If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5.  (please see my stats below).  In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don\u2019t advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801,  MSM8974-AC  Processor:  Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5\u201d is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don\u2019t use it as a primary phone.  The display in S5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it!ANDROID UI:S5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface hasa flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery, Qi charging receivers for wireless charging on Galaxy phones and they were in awe.WATER PROOF:Obviously I have not tested this!,  but a very nice to have feature and gives a peace of mindCAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. S5 has a 16MP camera with super-fast autofocus, HDR mode with real-time preview, and support for 4K video recording. Definitely state of the art.  I took several indoor photos and they look great. It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release.S-HEALTH:I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5. It has driven my fitness regimen to a very good progress and the design of app is nothing short of buttery and beautiful. I am often too in good favor of Samsung loading the phones with S-Ware, but their design of S-Health is definitely breathtaking. Heart rate monitor is a great addition to the fitness tools. I used it for walking several steps and found it same as in S4.PROCESSING POWER:Don\u2019t bother about it.  For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:I wonder why Samsung does not release wireless charging built in. You have to get a external Qi wireless charger and open the back, align it and use with a Qi charger. It should be integrated, but you can do it after the fact.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch (  I mean  around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when  I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both. I am programming my S5 also to do host of things.128 GB Micro SD card!!This is just incredible. If you see my reviews, I have been saying having external capacity is very key. With a 4K camcorder you can fill your space in a blink of the eye. Movies take up space. Who would have thought a 128 GB tiny card can fit in  a phone. This is just incredible. I tested with a 128 GB  and it works wonderfully! A 16 GB phone memory will have around 10 GB spare initially.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews.  On the GO USB cable + S5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don\u2019t necessarily have to open  a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don\u2019t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:I tested fingerprint scanner, but I am not sure how reliable it will be over time with scratches/oily fingers etc. I have to test it further, but for now I will settle on traditional passwords till bugs are ironed out.  Apple\u2019s initial fingerprint software had bugs which was fixed subsequently. There are so many other features in S5. Some of them have become so standard that they are not review worthy!  e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up).To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they hve for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5.

Sprint wanted $200 for me to upgrade to this phone I searched on Amazon and I found it for only $100 can't beat that.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Galaxy Series is finally Getting there (Sprint Edition)", "Author": "Amadeus B. Klein \"MG\"", "ReviewID": "R1BGTQXYC1EMQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, First off, I had to get my phone through Sprint, since they only offer the \"Easy Pay\" plan online or in store... (I would go with an Amazon Easy pay in about 2 seconds of it existed.)**Update 5/9 - I had my first experience of the IP67 Waterproofing Yesterday...  I was working in my yard and had my phone in my shirt pocket, while up about 4 feet in a ladder my phone slipped out and dropped straight into a bucket of water!  Honestly despite the certification I thought my phone was toast...  But Nope, it didn't miss a beat, it was still working and playing Pandora without a problem.  I was worried so I took off the case and back cover and found no water penetration into the phone, (The phone was submerged for about a minute)  This was very satisfying to see and definitely increased my happiness with the phone....**Also this review won't go into Tech specs or Vs the major competition, Specs have been covered and \"Vs the competition\" is pretty subjective..  I owned an S4 so I'll compare it to that.Size: no major difference, it has decent hand feel, no it doesn't have a metal case and it isn't perfect but it works for me just as well or better than the S4.OS: I haven't rooted it yet or replaced the OS.  The stock touchwiz seems to do fine in normal operating mode (It does stutter a bit in heavy power saver mode)Battery:  It performs as well as my S4, and on most days a bit better...  I used to get 8 hours even before I got the 15% battery warning, Now I go between 8 and 11 depending on use.Screen:  It is significantly easier to see in sunlight than the S4.  It does seems like it gets brighter...Samsung Features: Air Gesture and Smart Stay seem to work well.  At least I should say better than the S4.  I still have trouble with smart stay as I wear glasses, but it does seem better.  The heart-rate monitor is a neat feature, and works well, but not something that influenced my decision.  The Fingerprint scanner works better than the one on my work PC, but it is still more of a hassle (IMHO) than just punching a code or swiping a pastern.  If I could just press my finger tot he screen and it would unlock then it might beat out the other lock methods for me.So in general I think it's a decent upgrade from the S4, but nothing that can't wait a  year until the \"S6\" in 2015. (Except the inclusion of Tri-Band LTE which the S4 doesn't have).  That all said if you have a sprint S4 and your LTE signal is good, you are safe to stay, but if you are on an S3 I would recommend the upgrade.It does do wireless charging either with an adapter or with the \"Charging Cover\" just like the S4, and I can't see any difference in the speed of charging between the S4 and S5...One caveat I found:  The Tri-Band LTE no longer allows SVLTE (Simultaneous Voice and LTE Data) This means like AT&T; you can no longer use data while you are talking on the phone (While on the network, Wifi still allows it)...  So no checking a website while talking is out)Overall I give the S5 4 Stars:5 Stars to start with.-1 Star for no SVLTE-.5 Star for Fingerprint Scanner Quirkiness-.5 Star for Plastic Design again+1 Star for Smoothing out Touchwiz Android SkinSo 4 Stars overall, It's getting close to what I want a phone to be, but falls just short.It has replaced my S4 and I won't be switching back, but I Really hope the \"S6\" Addresses some more of the design quirks and brings battery life up significantlyJust my thoughts,AK", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "The first time in years I've been absolutely stoked on a new phone; Samsung's best Galaxy", "Author": "NotSteveB", "ReviewID": "R6VHUHG8OI6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, being a relatively practical smartphone guy who admittedly doesn't explore the world of apps or features nearly enough - the most important things first:(Sprint PCS 16gb Black Model, Phoenix Area)**upgrading from an HTC One**1. The mobile data, which previously was erratic 4g coverage in my house/neighborhood or 3g only, has gone from averaging 1-2mbps to 7-12mpbs. There are about 4-5 spots in my house that I use when running SpeedTest on any device, and the S5 kills it. I've had the HTC One and the Galaxy Note II/S3 over the last 3-4 years and they all seemed to struggle with the data network in my actual home or surrounding area....2mbps on Sprint was the best I usually got.2. The size and the casing of the phone finally feel \"right' - imho, the S3 felt a bit too cheap and the Note II was a bit gigantic. The screen size, whatever it is, is exactly in what I consider the sweet spot (and looks incredible). It's not made of metal or the heavy material that I associate with iPhones, but it feels durable in all the right areas.3. If I end up being wrong about this, I'll update the review, but it appears to not have nearly as much pre-loaded garbage apps or bloatware as some of the earlier Samsung models. Out of the box it's lightning quick, and after about 5 minutes it was customized to my liking with all layouts/widgets/apps/feeds in their proper place and all security features configured and ready to go.4. Keyboard input is noticeably better than other phones I've used lately. The default layout has a Swype-like feature on it, but also is surprisingly accurate when typing on the standard qwerty layout as well. Swype's keyboard was on the phone when I first checked, so either Google synced it up immediately or it was standard on the phone (I suspect the latter, as my account wasn't linked to it....gotta re-enter all of my dirty words).There seems to be a lot more to this phone and the OS is inviting enough that I may finally cave and start dinking around with apps and sHealth and all of the Web 2.3 (or are we at 2.4 yet?) toys my friends are obsessed with. But regardless, I can sum up how I feel about this phone with two sentences and the TL;DR:TL;DR - if you're used to Galaxy phones and like Samsung's previous models, consider this to be their best without question. All of the small upgrades seem to work as expected and have a clear purpose, and the Sprint network itself has massively improved functionality on this model (vs. the HTC One or Galaxy Note II).", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "FlynnTwinning", "ReviewID": "RSJRL0REF1PX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I've ever owned!

Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the \"natural\" setting, as the \"vivid\" and even \"standard\" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the \"back\" and \"menu\" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59\" x 2.85\" x 0.32\"(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury \"F\" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and \"Google Street View\" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Smart Phone", "Author": "Lori E.

Seems like every review has a gripe with plastic as a material on this phone - Ive owned iphones (1,2,3,4s,5s), HTC's (one), and Galaxy's (SIII) - and I enjoy the feel of this phone. The back is dimpled soft, if youve seen or held a (Asus) Google Nexus 7 2012 the back is exactly the same, soft to the touch and provides great grip. The plastic sides may scratch, but honestly not as easy as a HTC with its brushed finish. When I first opened the box, I held the phone in one hand and the battery in another and couldn't figure out how, together, they would create a sufficient weight to 'feel' like a phone. You get used to it. I didn't like the riveted bezel in pictures, and while its grown on me, I still don't think aesthetically it was the best choice. The phone is IP67 which means dust and waterproof, something I have yet to voluntarily test. After a few minutes the phone felt just like it should in my hand. I can operate almost all features with one hand (6'1\" / normal hands). The S5 is truly a slab of a phone, thin with an exquisite screen. The screen pops with color and is hypnotizing when you throw a good image or video on there. The camera is great, though I would highly recommend the Google official camera in the play store. The stock Samsung camera is good, but has so many options and settings a nerd like me gets too lost in technical aspects. Google camera uses the Samsung's 16 megapixel sensor beautifully - the panorama and photo-sphere modes blew everyone away at the beach. No matter the camera app you use, low light is a large problem for this sensor, and it shows in most pictures I've taken inside. The video is 4k, though I've read its not technically 4k playback, fact is, I don't have a 4k TV so it doesn't matter. The video looks good on my 23\" monitors and that's good enough.The s-health app is pretty much useless with its heart rate sensor constantly unable to measure or reporting vastly different readings, and the pedometer was different than a few other fitness wearable I've compared.  Touchwiz is less bloated, but since I've used Cynogenmod 10.2 on my SIII and stock Android on my HTC I still see allot of unneeded stuff there. The reason I haven't tried to flash this S5 yet is that some of the features really are cool, like power saving mode, right now with my S5 @ 88% it estimates 11.0 days of standby time in 'Ultra Power Saving' mode. This may come in handy soon, because the screen (as gorgeous as it is) hogs the battery. Right now its using 32% of my systems battery resources and its set to about 45% brightness. The Touchwiz over Android KitKat is snappy as hell, only lag I get is with my Google Voice integration stuttering when I open the Google Voice app to text. One other thing that is trivial but worth a mention is that the USB 3.0 charger is bulky and tough to attach to your phone, you first pull off the sealed port on the S5 (b/c of waterproof) that is held on with a small piece of plastic, and to get the USB male end into the port, youve got to be firm. It does charge fast, about 2 hours to full charge from 3% for me so far. I think that the Samsung Galaxy line is truly a workhorse of a phone, and plan on having this for at least a few years.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really Nice", "Author": "Josh Clark", "ReviewID": "RZR0DAN4ZSUET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great device, without a doubt.

I've been happy with the battery life and it charges quickly. I've been able to take some super nice photos with the camera. fingerprint sensor always works (except when wet). I could care less about the health apps + heartbeat sensor. I only really used a few of the 'app extras' that samsung bundled in, most are like a few months free premium access and then they want you to pay for continued use.Waterproof is great - i've had people asking what phone this is, i took it to hawaii and submerged it in hot tubs and the ocean, took video underwater of fish with it. The controls are difficult or not really able to be used under water. The headphone jack did get some gravel in it + was hard to clean, and while it was drying out it kept giving me the headphone notification which was annoying.I'm not giving it a 5 star because the phone still lags at times, probably samsung's software and other apps causing it, and the chrome band around it nicks pretty easily - they could have used tougher plastic for that.You should probably still get a screen protector or cas... somehow i managed to get a decent scratch on the gorilla glass, and that would also help the dents on the rim.All in all, i really like the phone, if you're on the verge, get it.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "First day with, will update after time, but everything is great!", "Author": "Chauncey & Stacie", "ReviewID": "R1SE4BL7BPXSDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Haven't had it for long, but I am loving it.

It does OK sending pictures, and once you find the picture file location, it's easy to grab and copy pictures. Removable battery. External memory extension slot.Cons: (so very many)Finger swipe security feature takes several swipes, and recent (May 2014) update will not lock the phone completely for 30 seconds after 5 swipes (Previously it force a password entry). Been trying for days to find a way to back up, but no go.Backups fail, restores fail, and doesn't sync well with outlook. Sync feature will lose data from phone to Outlook on a computer, particularly Contacts. Tasks are hidden within the calendar feature, making them all but useless.  Backup will say \"complete\" but onlly phone log and alarm will actually back up.Samsung apps like S-Health will randomly erase all data, and apparently can't be downloaded. It takes several tries record a pulse (the sites will say, \"don't press too hard\" but I found I don't press hard enough). You're forced to sign up and share the data with Samsung, yet it keeps getting erased from my phone, and I can neither back it up nor restore it, despite having it set up to automatically back up every three hours.If you set up Picasa, you cannot delete pictures that have synced.Samsung's support is aggravatingly useless. The Kies software has options for synchronizing Tasks, but their support says it's not supported. Based on searching the Samsung site and other forums, along with using the Kies software, it's clear that the app isn't fully supported by Samsung itself, and they have no documentation at all, except basic \"how to.\"  If you try to get answers from them, they'll insist on getting carrier-specific model information because the phone is supposed different for each carrier.  I have a hard time believing something so basic as Tasks is different.It will continually tell you the back cover is loose when it's clearly not.There are also multiple on=board apps for things; Samsung's brand, Google brand, and the amount of bloatware is insane.I regret buying this phone, and Samsung's responses to technical support requests have guaranteed I will not purchase another Samsung product again.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best", "Author": "Laerte", "ReviewID": "R2WT3PE58KV8HO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don`t have noting to speak about this smartphone, simply the best of the world, worth the investment!! !! !!", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "April E.

I had the S3 for several years and was very happy with it.1) The day after I received my phone, I stopped receiving text messages completely.  I worked with the T-mobile rep to rectify it.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone.  Although I never received my missed texts, it seemed to work after that.  I was told that the phones were shipped with faulty software that Samsung was aware of.  Texts have worked fine since them.2) The speakerphone is a half-duplex instead of full duplex.  That means that when the other person was talking or making noise on their end, they could never hear me.  I was never sure if they were hearing what i was saying or if it was actually going through.  For example, if I was talking to someone on speakerphone who was in their car and had a lot of noise on their end, they would never hear me.  As someone who uses speakerphone a lot, this is a major problem.  My Samsung S3 was full duplex.  I never had this problem.3) My email never properly synced with my server.  If i looked at emails on my computer, they would still show as unread on my phone even AFTER I hit the sync button.  I would delete emails on my phone and after I synced, they would re-appear.4) I would choose a specific ringtone for different friends and it would only work SOMETIMES.  One time I might get the ringtone that I specified and another time I might get my generic ringtone.  No rhyme or reason.5) Because I live in NYC, some subway stations have cell service and others do not.  If I sent a text when I didn't have service, it SHOULD simply send when I got above ground or to a station that had service.  It wouldn't.  The text would just sit there and never send.  I would have to copy/paste it to a NEW text and send again.6) I used the map service to find a friend who was several blocks away.  I had an address and when I put it into the phone, it sent me in the complete wrong direction.  In fact, the map started spinning as if it had no idea how to locate where I was or where I was going.7) There was a serious lag because of Touchwiz.  It's almost as if the phone is thinking about what it needs to do.I'm being shipped a new phone but I'm not sure if it will fix ANY of these problems. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to choose a new one.
