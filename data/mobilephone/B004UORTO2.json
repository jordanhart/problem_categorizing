I mean in my opinion there will never be a perfect phone there is always a flaw; however there are a couple of things I do did not like or disagree about. First I do not like how the text messages pop up on the front of the screen like as a screen saver, but no biggie you can change the settings on that! Next I did not like the battery life span, it is very little and should last much longer. Then the volume on this phone is not loud enough. Don't get me wrong I can hear it, but I need something loud as if im in another room and the phone is in another. Instead when I get to it I see that I had like 3 miss calls. I have not had any other issues like it freezing up. Other than the flaws I stated I love it! I would definetely recommend this to a friend. Like they say you get what you pay and I am well satified....Thanks Sony!", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent phone", "Author": "Lucia", "ReviewID": "R1VZB5LHMQ8MN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works perfectly is such a pretty an elegant thing I'm from Ecuador, the phone works very welll with the 3g and wifi and all....

I tried WAP in the late 90s and it really sucked even though I could see its potential already then. Mobile data has finally come of age. So I love this phone.Everything is good, except:1. Some useless SonyEricsson preloaded software, but those can be avoided or removed.2. Sometimes a bit slow. A dual core processor would probably be helpful. If I bought a phone today I would seriously consider Samsung Galaxy S2, but that phone wasn't available 1/2 year ago3. Battery life could be better. After having used the phone daily for 1/2 year, I can sense that the battery is not as good as before. In any case you need to invest USD5 in the application JuiceDefender. That will improve battery life with at least 25%.4. The GPS distance measure algorithm is not as good as Garmin's. This means that you need to fiddle around quite a bit with the settings to get accurate distance readings if you are into cycling or running. The algorithm seems to be designed for driving.

When I first got it I was very impressed with it. It was sleek, light and blazing fast. Recently updated the Android Version to the most current update and now my phone is slow, it freezes a lot and lags. Doesn't matter what I do, sometimes I might be texting or browsing the web or simply listening to music. The phone will lag or freeze for  a few seconds. Sometimes it will work again on it's own other times I will have to tap the middle button or pop the battery out. I don't have many apps of my own in this phone and 98% of my media is on the memory card. Hopefully a better android version will come out soon that will fix this. Never had the problems before. The only problem I had from the start was a bit of over heating after an hour or 2 of heavy use. The heat was noticeable and uncomfortable. So I gave this phone 4 out of 5 stars. One thing that I really loved from the beginning and still do and if I had to rate it separately I would give it a full 5 out of 5 stars is the Arcs 8MP built in cam. Picture and video quality is superb, simply amazing. Check out my flickr some of my posted pics are taken with the ARC. Oh yeah, I got a gel case for the arc not long after I bought it for some protection taking it off the other day to wipe my phone with a dry cloth I noticed the sides of the phone (silver area) the paint is chipping away and it looks like it was nicked. Yet paint never came off for me to notice it before and I never dropped or scratched the phone anywhere. It's a bit unsightly but the gel case covers it.Find me on Flickr~Go to Flickr~Then type in a \"/\" then \"photos\" then \"/\" and last type in \"suipeter\"And that should take you there.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent!!!

The new recent android and SE firmware update has enhanced the camera reaponse issue a lot! It also made the OS more smooth and faster in opening application and i don't need an App killer any more. Also, SE has improved the touch sensitivity which is much better than beforeI don't know where to start but let's start first about the cheap (although light wight) materials that SonyErcson used to build this phone compared to the iPhone4 which feels like a Bugatti compared to SonyErcson !Moreover, Sony is known by making the best LCD  monitors but they did a bad job in building the Arc screen which looks like that it came from the 70's compared to the iPhone4 \"Retina display\".As for the camera sony claims that is an 8MP which i figured out it delivers the worst shots I ever seen in terms of shooting response! If you try an iphone4 cam you will know exactly what I'm talking about ! A leica camera compared to maybe a fujesto crappy camera!!! And Ohh! not mentioning that it doesn't have a front camera!!! :(The reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is one the 4 inch screen which I see it very nice and a star for Android which is ok especially the screen wedges but still light years behind Apple iOS.Android OS has lots of tweaks and settings to play with but eventually you will find that you don't need them! and it laggs ur smartphone.PS: The reason why I bought the SonyErcson Arc is  cuz i was sick and tired from using an iPhone and i wanted a change, a new blood of handset in my pocket!", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony Ericsson Lt15i Mobile Phone Sony Xperia Arc *Midnight Blue* International Version", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tS-fvwrOL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004UORTO2"}}
