{"Reviews": [{"Title": "iPhone 4: A Good Smartphone With Many Similar Companions", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "R3HO4I4QC941PV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I submitted the same review for the 16GB model, as the only difference is file space.The Apple iPhone 4 is one of Verizon's best all around smartphones. While it no longer sets the pace in the smartphone realm, the iPhone 4 does an adequate job of handling nearly all basic smartphone tasks and offers well rounded performance; which is all that many smartphone users really want from their device. While it is not for everyone, and no device is, the iPhone 4 is a solid device and is definitely worth a look for non-power smartphone users.1. Design.1. The compact and svelte design of the iPhone 4 is refreshing, as the smartphone ecosystem continues to evolve from \"brick\" to \"cinder block\" sized phones. It is slim and pocketable, and the side keys are arranged in an intuitive manner. Volume keys and the power button (which doubles as a screen lock) are very tactile, and the ring/vibrate toggle on the top left side of the phone is a great addition. While the phone's physical appearance is subject to personal taste, i'd wager few would find the phone unattractive. I have the white version of the phone, and find it much more vibrant and visibly appealing than the more unassuming black version, though some may find the white to be too loud on the eyes.2. Despite the phone's relatively small size compared to other smartphones, there's a bit too much wasted space on the front of the phone for my liking. While the screen is clear and bright (there is no pixelation whatsoever due to the 960x640 resolution), it's a tad small when considering the width and length of the device. In fairness, problems due to the screen's size are more a product of the operating system and not the physical dimensions of the screen, but the OS also has no relation to empty space on the phone's front face.3. Both the front and rear facing camera's are flush with the phone's design, which is a big plus. Apple also hit the correct layout for the charging/data port and the 3.5 mm headset jack; the former is located on the bottom of the phone, while the latter is at the top. Several phones i've used (feature and smart, and from almost every manufacturer) had the headset port on the bottom, which is fine if you like to hold your phone upside down all the time, and also featured charging ports in the middle of the left or right side of the phone. If Apple changes anything about the physical design of the next iPhone, these two items should not up for discussion.4. One thing that should be up for discussion however, is the back of the phone: it is made out of glass. Many iPhone 4 users lament this, but Steve Jobs didn't amass a fortune by mistake. The more people that drop the phone and break the glass on the back, the more money Apple makes. It's a design flaw, even if it was intentional.Performance1. Calls: I tested the iPhone 4 on Verizon's network in a variety of locations across Louisiana. Call quality has been very good; I have not encountered any dropouts or conversational blips during any call. Callers do not sound overly warm through the earpiece, but they do not sound robotic either. Callers also sounded good through the included headset and on three different bluetooth headsets I tried, but speakerphone quality was abysmal at best. The speakerphone is not loud enough and suffers from \"the wax paper effect.\"2. Reception: the iPhone 4 gets above average reception on Verizon's network; like many Verizon phones, I generally have 3-4 bars nearly everywhere I travel. It rarely has full signal but I haven't dropped below two bars either.3. Battery Life: the battery will take you through a day of heavy usage and two days of light usage. Phone calls use surprisingly little power, and I only lose 2-3% of juice while the phone is on standby during the night.4. Data Speeds: While this varies from location to location, I find that the iPhone 4 isn't as quick in this regard as other phone's i've used, particularly Blackberry and Android devices. Depending on the location, I generally get about 10-20% slower speeds on average with the iPhone 4. In fairness, I've observed the same with my fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t;, so it's not a carrier issue. Regardless, I haven't had any problems loading large webpages, streaming audio and video, and moving files. In the two areas I spend the most of my time in, my download speeds range from 0.6 to 1.4 MB, and my upload from 0.5 to 0.8 MB, which is normal for many Verizon phones in many locations. With that being said, it is clear that Verizon's 3G network is slowly clogging up, which i'm hoping the influx of 4G upgrades and devices will address. Despite these notations, Verizon's 3G network is far more consistent in terms of speed and connection than other carriers in the area. My fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t; ranges anywhere from 150 KB to 3 MB down and 50 KB to 1 MB up, and even though At&t; theoretically has a faster 3G network than Verizon, my data connection seems far more reliable.Features:1. Operating System: After using several smartphones with different operating systems, i've concluded they are all more or less the same with a few differences here and there: tap an icon on the screen and go. Up front, I don't find the iPhone 4's OS any easier or harder to use than Android, RIM, WebOS, and Windows Phone 7, and I also don't buy into the idea that iOS is simpler and easier to use than those offered by its competitors. There are a few differences here and there; Android offers widgets, Blackberry offers a few home screen icons and a drop down menu, and Apple offers...a convoluted mess of icons and programs with little rhyme or reason. It's simple to use, but that does not mean it is always pleasant. A drop down menu would do wonders for this OS. Personally, I miss the widgets than Android and Windows Mobile offer, but I understand Apple cannot become too much like its competitors (well, maybe not until OS 5). However, there is little organization going on when you first fire up the screen.Where iOS really begins to look like every other OS is when you delve deeper into the menu. Again, there is little rhyme or reason to how anything is arranged, and for a couple of weeks until you memorize where every option is located, it can be a frustrating experience. My favorite example was browser settings; you cannot access them from the browser, but only from the overall settings menu itself. Is this any better or worse than other OS? No. Is it any easier though? Well, no again.A final side note: iOS does not require \"babysitting\" and constant attention like Android does in order to get your battery through the day. I know rooting solves many of Android's babysitting issues, but a lot of people have jobs, families, and other hobbies that make rooting an unnecessary annoyance. While I personally like Android OS better for the customization it offers, the entire babysitting/rooting issue is a turn off to some, and I myself don't miss them either (even though I never had a problem rooting an Android device).2. Business functions: Apple does not have the business reputation of RIM or even Android yet, but nothing from my usage suggests it is inferior to either OS in this regard. Push e-mail works like a charm, Exchange works as it should, and Office files along with PDF's open and render as they should. I am not a power business user and cannot offer comment on such, but the iPhone 4 gets the basics down in this category.3. Multimedia: This is a big of a mixed bag for me. The iPhone's 4 camera is one of the best i've ever used on a smartphone; both the rear and front facing. Though the rear camera is only 5MP, images are clear, sharp, and beautiful as long as there is adequate light. Night shots with flash were less than stellar, which should surprise no one with a smartphone. The front facing camera is only 1.3 MP, but still takes images with little distortion. Beyond this, i'm not blown away with the iPhone 4's multimedia capabilities. iTunes integrates files nicely with the phone, but i'm not sold that Apple's ecosystem is any better than dragging and dropping. The iPod is perhaps the most underwhelming feature on the phone; I find it no different or more impressive than any other smartphone music player on any other device. And the speakerphone performed no more impressively for music and video playback than it did for voice calls; multimedia audio sounded waxed over and washed out on the speaker. The AppStore will only impress those migrating from RIM, WM7, and WebOS. But one thing I've noticed about using applications on the iPhone 4 is that they don't seem to crash nearly as often as they do on Android and Blackberry, and in fact, I don't think i've had even a handful of them in a month's usage. And the lack of Flash does not seem to be a hindrance on the phone's multimedia capabilities; QuickTime handles things well, and the YouTube app helps too. Again, multimedia is a mixed bag on the iPhone 4, but that's more a knock on the hype the device receives rather than the device itself.Conclusion:Other than subtle differences in the OS, the iPhone 4 offers the same similar features that many other smartphones offer. It does a good job of handling core functions and basic business needs, and its multimedia package is somewhat overblown, yet still more than adequate. If your looking for a mid sized smartphone that requires little maintenance and don't need LTE services, the iPhone 4 is definitely worth a look. For the price however, it offers few features that stand apart from any of the other top smartphones in Verizon's lineup.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best phone on the market", "Author": "jrb213", "ReviewID": "RVTR5GBEJ49Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been wanting an iphone for ages, but was not able to acquire one until it came onto Verizon. I debated waiting, but I am very happy with my decision to buy it the day it came out. I have had no problems with it working. No need for any troubleshooting, no glitches. The apple app store has more applications than you can imagine. Even 4 months after purchase, I continue to learn something new about my phone that makes me love it more and more each day. In addition, it's size is decently small and light. It ridiculously easy to use and to learn how to use. The battery life is incredible. As a heavy texter, I use my phone constantly throughout the day. I also spend a lot of time on the internet with this phone, especially watching videos on youtube and netflix, and the battery lasts the full day without needing to be recharged in the middle.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "got it fast, and love it!", "Author": "Mandanicolew", "ReviewID": "R3TAOAB429VX3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I ordered my iPhone for VZW on Sunday and it arrived Thursday!

One was for my wife and the other was for me.  I recall my wife saying, \"I don't need one because I won't understand how to use it!\"Now we have unlimited data plans, and unlimited text messaging and 128 apps.  My wife is an iPhone freak and I feel like an iPhone widow.  She is constantly texting and playing her favorite games and working on photos for Facebook.  We both love our iPhones and they are the best phones we have ever owned.As a CEO I always had the most advanced phones and equipment available.  The iPhone is simply the best phone and communication system I have ever owned.  I will not mention the names of the other manufacturers I have owned since the beginning of cell phone technology but to be honest the best of the other brands were problem ridden and just junk when compared to the iPhone.  I wish I had purchased the iPhone much earlier but we were locked to Verizon due to a corporate policy, my own rule, and we didn't use the \"other guys\" with the iPhone.We love the phones performance in making phone calls and texting and the apps you can get are great.  We have not had one issue with these phones since day one.  Other brands I have used had serious connection problems or major software glitches.I could go over all the technical features but I won't because the bottom line is that it works, it is easy to learn how to use and the apps are wonderful.  I will never own another brand as long as Apple keeps innovating and leading the pack in quality and performance.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "quick response and delivery", "Author": "ndblu", "ReviewID": "R1FE8XZWZUO808", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the phone very soon after order and well before the estimated arrival date. i initially had a problem with phone and contracted the seller.

This 4S has not been modified, jail broken, or received any new apps since delivery 1 week ago. Having owned 2 Blackberries, a Motorola Droid, a week with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the 32-gig i-phone 4s has many of the same frustrating problems of the former Droids. Type anything longer than 4 lines and the text screen is likely to hang. Unlike the last Droid, it has enough volume to be heard and it receives calls. Hard resets temporarily fix the text freezes, but the tactile type screen is not big-hand friendly and the auto-suggest manages to anticipate the correct next word about 1/3 of the time and often balky to undo. Sending email is a problem as the phone is likely to respond to send commands with nonsense like \"the destination carrier does  not accept Relayed messages\".

Sound is great, controls are great, Siri is great, apps are great. This gadget full of gadgets is already making easier my daily tasks, my appointments, shopping, traveling, and curiosity-satisfying and making them easier in ways I did not forsee - all for the positive.Only the batteries are less than great -- but battery technology is lagging behind everyone's electronic developments for now. My last phone was a hardened Gzone Rock. I had to charge it every day because I used its pedometer and gps all the time. For now, I expect to recharge all the time if I want to use advanced features. However, I bought car charger and a second iPhone charger and cable. That solved most battery problems. Then, I bought a New Trent 7000mAh USB External Battery Pack as a back-up and it has ended all battery worries for all our electronic devices.If you are thinking of a smart phone, do not hesitate to go with the iPhone 4s!", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this phone", "Author": "Cory Lidle", "ReviewID": "R3UALZ29UU964H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the options you get with this phone.

I could probably hand it to my mother and she'd figure it out.  I could certainly place it in my Wife's hands and she'd probably be happier with it than her current phone.  For me, I have to have a keyboard, so I look very carefully at virtual keyboard functions.  I am unhappy with the iPhone virtual keyboard and I really miss Swype and Graffiti from my Droid2 (this is a work phone).  So, it's an admittedly good phone and if you don't miss a real keyboard, this is probably your next phone.Some notes: the iPod functions on here are good, not great.  It's not a very good management tool for on-device songs but like all Apple products it plays music very well.  Sound quality is superior.  The dual-camera Skype functionality is so good it should be mandatory on any future smartphone, it's well-worth the iPhone itself.  GPS and mapping is just okay, Google does this much better.  One thing Android folks will miss is the ability to see the filesystem.  Apple has been rightly criticized for their closed platforms and associated policies, and this is no exception.  You are forced into the Apple ecosystem, and it's the compulsory nature that I dislike.
