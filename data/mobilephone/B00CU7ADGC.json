Problem is, it appears to be re-furbished rather than new, and came in a Samsung Note 2 Box. Likewise, the charging port doesn't fit correctly. I previously had the PAE 7100, it crashed, I got a refund, and now am having to send it back, to. Will try one last time depending on seller. When it works (if similar to PAE7100), is awesome, but am starting to have concerns. I've talked to Amazon who have emailed Electronics Mart and now must simply wait and learn patience.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "This unit was returned", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R3CF3795UQ1I80", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sorry, I don't like giving a bad rating on a product, But this phone deserves it. It is very user unfriendly for a first time smart phone owner. Finding ringtones on the thing is not easy. After 3 days the speaker stopped working and I had to send it back. The return was easy because the staff is helpful and friendly. I opted for my money back and got a full refund quickly. I then purchased the real smart phone from Amazon and I am very happy. Thanks Amazon for another smooth purchase.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great device", "Author": "tim williams", "ReviewID": "R2U7QL2UG1T0L7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast service, I ordered this phone after reading the reviews on other sites and on amazon so my fingers were crossed on not having a horror story.
