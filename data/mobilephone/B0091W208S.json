As a 24 year old  my friends and family give me a hard time because I don't care for the keyboards and touch screens on my phones these days. This phone looks so classy, the buttons are good size, the main screen is big and awesome!  The outside cover is shiny and very sleek. This phone has a great camera too.  I've owned three of these phones and they have always been great! I highly recommend this fabulous phone!!!", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
