It's an awesome phone, does what an Android phone does, although there are a lot of apps that aren't compatible with this. Nothing too fancy! As with a lot of android phones, it comes pre-loaded with things that you wouldn't really use. I bought this because I didn't want to pay for a data plan and this had wi-fi connectivity, but the internet is slow and temperamental. It doesn't have good internet connectivity and drops the signal even when I'm two feet away from my wireless router.Lately, I've been having to charge my phone EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. I'm not a heavy phone user (so unpopular, haha!), and it's on standby for most of the day. Literally. I only use the phone to text and not much of that. I check running apps and there are a lot that do not need to be on. I shut them down but they come back on automatically minutes later. I even downloaded a task killer app, but that still does not suffice. My phone is running programs it doesn't need to be running for any reason because I haven't turned them on!I do like Sony, but this phone can't even last a decent two years. My last phone was a Samsung t809. It was pretty simple and lasted 5 years!", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Angel Luis Gonzalez Olivero", "ReviewID": "R2HJRFEUI8IMMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent meets my expectations, not that great, do not hesitate to buy this product.

Then it stopped working.  Turns out the problem is not with the phone or the ATT Microcell, but what ATT told me is they tagged all phones not bought from ATT as 2G phones, therefore it won't work.  So... don't buy this phone if you want it to work with an ATT microcell.
