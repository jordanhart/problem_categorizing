Just make sure you look up coverage before you buy since Virgin's coverage can be kinda spotty.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "TRULY EXCELLENT VALUE!!", "Author": "k_tree", "ReviewID": "RUQQ1OMHI6020", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Blackberry Curve is a great small, compact but feature-filled cell phone. All the usual features work just fine, plus there are many terrific apps available at the Blackberry AppWorld Store, directly through the phone. Virgin Mobile's various plans let me pay for just what I need, with no contract.  That means no onerous \"Early Termination Fees\", like with the contract companies. Plus, I can change my plan as my needs change, and I'm not stuck with the same thing for the length of a contract. Personally, I'll never go back to a contract.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good product", "Author": "LorraineJ", "ReviewID": "R1CSMIUUJWNNZ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The BlackBerry 8530 is very fast, easy to operate, dependable, real small, and attractive.

I recieved it a few days past the expected delivery date, so that was a week and a few days there. When I finally recieved it and turned it on all of their contacts, messages, emails, pictures and other stuff was still in the phone. I had to sit for one hour with the Blackberry company to program it, at that time it was basically deleting and changing past info that was set in the phone. After that everything was going great, I was quite surprised! I had it for a couple days and after those couple days (about 2 or 3) I pressed the red power button and the whole screen came off!!! I put it back on as good as I could get it for about two more days, then the keys started not working. I had to go to just about every phone shop in town, to see if they could repair it. I had to go out of town to  phone shop that's charging me $90.00 for a new screen and keyboard, that's a whole front of the phone!! It is in the repair store now and I'm getting it at around saturday (next week). So, here goes another week without a phone, this time over nonsense! I decided not to bring the phone back because I really do want a Blackberry and have been waiting for one for a while now. The good part is that I do have a really good plan :) $35.00 a month for 300 voice minutes (talking on the phone) and the rest is unlimited!! I also love the keyboard and just the way the Blackberry feels, very productive, good camera, decent battery life I think, and more.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "virgin mobile rocks", "Author": "Ken Campbell \"nowarken\"", "ReviewID": "R21A6H5SCO0DZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "get it  if u can ?,(it,s not a iphone,)or a crapy, att,verizon one,it,s a Virgin Mobile!!its all we have now!!!and it works good to", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Lilly", "ReviewID": "RXF02SZ3PZMW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Blackberry phone was in excellent condition and I would have enjoyed using this phone but it is a CDMA and these type of phone don't work in my country.....ensure you have all the info so as to ensure that it can work in your country....", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "deceiving phone and service", "Author": "thatguy", "ReviewID": "RM18TRHQUYURE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this BlackBerry 8530 Prepaid Phone for Virgin Mobile from Walmart for $100.00.  I am not going to write a long review so here it is.  The phone it self is good quality, the service and restrictions are very poor and just stupid all around.  The phone and service was advertised as \"Unlimited Talk, Web, and Text for $45.00 a month.  Not true.  The first couple things that I did was to try to get on YouTube using the cellular network, that did not work, and post a picture to my Facebook wall using the cellular network and that did not work.  After both attempts it stated that a WiFi connection was needed to do that.  What a joke!!  Then it is not \"Unlimited Talk, Web, and Text!\"  Last time I checked, YouTube and Facebook were on the internet.  This was false advertising and misleading.  Most of the time I do not have a WiFi connection, and I figured with this phone I could use the internet over the cell network.  I basically live on Facebook and YouTube when I am on the internet, and I can't use this phone to to that when I am out and about.  All I can say is watch out.
