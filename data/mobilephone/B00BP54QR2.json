Reminds me of my old K750i. Roughly the same size as the Galaxy S2Screen - Bright, clear and the viewing angles isn't an issue for meOS - Sony's typical foot print. I prefer this over Tmobile or any carriers in general because they don't install a ton of bloatwareCamera - Very nice, the smile shutter? feature is awesome. Taking pictures in 9m mode will be 16x9 formatCons:Speaker isn't as loud or clear as previous Sony phonesPhone runs HOT.

I was on the market to purchase a new phone because I was looking for cheaper service and all of my phones were on Verizon's network. I've always been a Sony fanboy, and I already own their Tablet S, PSP, PS3, and Vaio. The Xperia ZL Allowed for seamless integration between them all, and shares data and media between them easily. The phone is comfortable to hold and doesn't feel too light or heavy. I opted for the ZL over the Z because i wanted the physical camera button, and I wasn't a huge fan of all the flaps that Sony had used on the Z to make it waterproof. The Camera quality is amazing and all of the filters and add-ons have been fun to use. Sony adds a slight skin on top of Jelly Bean 4.2, but only so that icons and transitions have been a little stylized, making it an easy transition from my Nexus device. I ditched my data plan with Verizon, and am using a call & txt plan with Red Pocket Mobile. I'm reliant on wi-fi for data, but surprisingly it hasn't been a problem. I would definitely recommend this phone to others who love a pretty screen, a good camera(13mp), and value a quality build.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works with T-mobile HSPA+ but no LTE", "Author": "Van Lam", "ReviewID": "R1VT6N48325C9Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Base on some commends on the web, sounded like this one would work with T-Mobile's LTE.  Well I give it a shot.  So far, I have tried to enable different radio software and all I got is HSPA+.  But the HSPA+ is faster than my Galaxy Nexus.  Good news is, this phone works with my $5.00 Tzone plan.  Will T-mobile stop it in a few days.... time will tell.The speaker is loud, but not clear like the HTC one.  I like the screen size and it's very stylish.

The only real issue i find with the device is the battery power which i really think should be improved and i don't know if its just me but sometimes whenever the device is charging the touch seem a bit slow at responsiveness and getting to the camera app from the lock screen or even on an unlocked screen by long pressing the dedicated button is a bit slow but none-the-less it gets you there but other than those two obvious flaws i found so far it is absolutely fantastic and i love it, was definitely not a disappointment. I would recommend getting the Xperia Z or ZL without hesitating if your on a $500 budget and want something great and unlocked but cant find that extra $150 USD to reach for a GS4 or HTC One because you'll love it unless you're just downright biased at performance.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect phone", "Author": "Rafael Santos L.

While some may be put off by the aging software, Sony's tight user experience makes up for it in my mind. The hardware, while not the best available anymore, is still certainly top of the line and more than adequate for anything you might throw at it. The build quality is fantastic and the audio output sound quality in comparison to my old HTC One X is phenomenal(that phone did not sound good at all and had some awful white noise that was always present when listening to music).The only reason I didn't give this phone a full five stars is because of the screen, but I don't have a problem with the viewing angles as some people do. My problem is that it appears easier to scratch then the other smart phones I've seen recently and appears to scratch easier then my old HTC did. The camera is also fairly good and I think it has more accurate color portrayal them some other phones do(no fake over saturation). The Sony Xperia skin on top of android is very light as well and if you mix it with a launcher app it is very pleasant. The included music playing application works perfectly and it very easy to use. Far better than the experiences I've had with other companies included software.If you want a good quality phone that is a little more unique then some and aren't after the very latest in hardware/software I feel like this is a good solid, reliable, choice.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "Aniccia Oropeza", "ReviewID": "RQHGVAIFD1X7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love love love my new cellphone!!!

I was able to pick up how to use it really easily and over all I prefer it. This phone is easy to use and its very powerful. The built in memory is plenty for Apps and there is an easy port to add an SD Card. switching the phone to my carrier was simple too, all It took was to slip in the sim card (this applies for AT&T;) as it was the same size as the one for the Iphone. the Xperia support program that you can install to the PC took a bit of work, as long as you go to Computer and install from the phone not the site you should be fine. Get a screen protector, the screen is very large so there is alot of potential for scratches. The only major complaint that I have is that there is no Physical Home button but there is a portion of the screen that serves as the home button. also the power button is on the right side so that could take some adjustment.

My last phone was the Nexus 4 and although it is very fast and worked well in general, the really average to bad camera got me to start looking into phones that come with good cameras.  I read a lot of reviews and did a ton of research and ended up deciding on the ZL.  Glad I did. The camera is really a huge improvement and colors jump out with great resolution plus the camera software is point and shoot caliber,  I am very happy with the camera.  Beyond that I didn't expect much but the screen is sooo much better than the Nexus 4 it is shocking!  Esp for videos with the Bravia 2 engine built in, it really is amazing and has to be seen.  On top of that the FM radio is a nice plus and the IR Blaster is interesting as it actually works with my non Sony TV.  Bonus.  The inclusion of the SD card is another huge plus, already it has really come in handy.  In conclusion I truly never though I would end up with a Sony phone but am so happy with this purchase.
