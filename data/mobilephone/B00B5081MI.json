It was my understanding from my research that this phone was compatible with my old Motorola Razr cell phone. However, when I received it I discovered my sim card was a little too small and would not fit as it should in the slot. I checked the refund policy of Amazon and resigned myself that I was stuck with it. A couple of weeks later I was reading some experiences of others and how well they were treated by Amazon. All I had done was open the package, open the phone, and attempt to install my old sim card. So, I e-mailed Amazon and they were very nice and  understanding. Amazon agreed to accept the phone back and give me a full credit of $39.99. The phone appeared to be \"new\" and first class for an old \"dumb\" phone so it is probably a great phone.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for the price", "Author": "Brian Wong", "ReviewID": "RAGRK9FA4OD2A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We thought the phone was supposed to be new but it seemed refurbished.It arrived fairly quickly after we ordered it - maybe within the weekThe phone worked with the SIM card we bought at 7-11.The only drawback was that the battery was drained after only about 12 hrs and a few short calls, so we needed to charge it every time we got back to the hotel.Didn't use any of the other features ... we just needed to phone to make reservations and meet up with friends", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R28HEGCN9F0UO8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone is slender and compact but has internet access.

This one fits the bill.  I suppose it has capabilities that I do not use (eg. texting, browser, etc.).  I do not have a phone plan that accesses those, nor do I need them.  All I care about is that I can hear the person at the other end of the phone clearly; I can hear my phone ring; I can hear my voicemail messages; and, the person I am talking to can hear me.  This phone satisfies all of those requirements without all the costly frills!  So it is OK for people who do not wish to spend outrageous amounts of money on a phone that they will not use to:  Take pretty pictures; text and drive; use while ignoring life going on around them up close & personal; IMing; GPSing; and whatever else these megabuck mini-communications systems do.If all you want to do is talk & be heard & to hear (NORMAL telephone conversation), then this is the cell phone for you!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A simple phone for talk and text", "Author": "Shrikant Swaminathan", "ReviewID": "R1A2BNNXF1EK6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a simple phone to talk and text.
