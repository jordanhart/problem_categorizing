{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly great phone!", "Author": "Dillon W", "ReviewID": "R1E42TZAJLU1YV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this and was definitely surprised by the quality. Its very solid and feels just like a brand name phone. The MTK6575 processor is very solid and overall the phone had scored a 3656 on the Antutu Benchmark, it would have scored higher however the SD Card I had in scored low. The only negative I have for this phone is that I still have yet to be able to get the 3G working on the Straight Talk Sim network. The APN settings that Straight Talk gives you did not work with this phone.So overall, the phone itself is good quality, battery lasted all day with heavy use on WIFI. Screen comes pre-installed with a cover. Once I get the 3G working I will be very happy with this phone.UPDATE: Okay so I have had the phone now for 2 weeks and am now able to give you a good update.HOORAY!! I was able to get the 3G to work by playing with the APN settings more. Straight Talk says to create a new APN and delete the old one if possible. Well the original APN is not capable of being deleted so I believe that this is what was causing me to have issues before. I fixed this by just editing the original APN to the Straight Talk settings exactly as they say, except you need to change the APN Type to default,mms,supl. That will give you 3G :D OH! And don't forget to Enable your 3G in Mobile Network Settings!The phone is still running great, battery life is good, and its touch response is still great. I have found that the only downsides to this phone is that the external speaker isn't necessarily the best. It seems to be high in treble and crackly at high volumes. Also the Camera, while yes it has good resolution, has bad color. Any low light photos seem to be just black and white. Oh and the flash on it is reallllllly poor. The flashlight app puts off less light than a completely white screen. Besides that the RAM could be a bit higher, you usually have about 150-200MBs of free space after killing your apps.Positives-Great Value-Nice Screen-8 mp cam-Front facing cam-Solid feel (friends keep thinking its a Samsung)-Ice Cream Sandwich-Dual SIM-Quadband-and more!!!Negatives-External Speaker is a little crackly at high volume-Camera has poor color-Flash is ineffective-RAM may be 512mb but its usually at about 150-200 after killed appsOkay well thats about it, I still highly recommend this phone for its price. The positives out weigh the negatives by far!", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "very impressed with the phone", "Author": "shark90", "ReviewID": "R2VKB9T1A6QG3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very impressed with the quality of the phone when it arrived, which was in only three days without upgrading the shipping. As it turns out this is actually the international version of the samsung galaxy note, just without the name branded. All cases and screen covers for note ( international version) fit this phone perfectly. So, how is the phone? Iys amazing it has great memory, speed, nothing to complain about. I have read many reveiws the say the camera is no good however it seems to be perfectly fine. The battery last all day even with heavy gaming the large screen is perfect for web browsing and video calls. I use this phone with a straight talk sim card and everything seems to be good 3G works good there's no 4G where I live so I can't comment on that. Setting up the new APN took about 30 seconds using the instructions provided by straight talk. I would deffinatly recommend this to others, and have.UPDATE:I have had the phone for almost a month now and am still very happy with it, when i entered an area where att had 4g service the phone was lightning fast i compared it side by side with my friends sprint iphone and it was a little bit faster. I still say the phone is good quality nothing has fallen apart or stopped working and the camera is still taking good pictures.IMPORTANT UPDATE: 6/27/2013so a sad story my phone was destroyed, i know terrible, anyways a decided to purchase the same phone again because its really that awesome. so this is my new review of the new one, and i know i ordered the exact same phone because i ordered it from the link on this review. with that said the new phone which has just arrived actually has android 4.1.1 which is honestly a bigger deal than it sounds as many flash oriented apps tend to stop supporting older versions of android and the update requires a firmware install. Otherwise the phone seems to be exactly the same, GOOD! I do have one gripe which is a little out of place but it took 11 days from the day it shipped for me to get the phone, now with that said i got it in half of the predicted shipping time so they did a pretty good job, but last time i got my phone in 3 days so i felt a bit like a spoiled rich kid who suddenly found himself living in the projects. perhaps i was just too spoiled by the awesome fast delivery last time.Now i did run into a serious issue when trying to get the data to work on the phone this time. i finally got it going and i realized why i struggled. The directions on the straight talk web site are different and no longer work, now this could be because i have an older sim card but i finally found a \"how to\" from the same time frame as when i got my sim card, which was about a year ago anyways if you find yourself in the same situation this is what worked for me: being sure to create a new APN and not reuse the pre-loaded one.Name: Straight TalkAPN: att.mvnoProxy: proxy.mvno.tracfone.comPort: 80Username/Password: none (change these to blank)Server: Not setMMSC: [...]MMS Proxy: 66.209.11.33MMS Port: 80MCC: 310 (did not change from default)MNC: 410 (did not change from default)Authentication type: Not set (did not change from default)APN type: default,supl,mms (did not change from default)Bearer: Unspecified (did not change from default)Note: this phone doesnt seem to be letting me delete the old APN but as long as it continues to mind its own business i dont think that we will have any problems. also if the field is not mentioned above then that just means i left it untouched.hope this helps.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "For now I'm happy", "Author": "Whitetiger", "ReviewID": "R1F7DB2SDDOTFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After Looking around for a better Cell phone for weeks This one might really be good. Okay this is only my third phone to own and so far I'm loving it, even though it's not a name brand thing. And some times name brand isn't always better. Even thought this does look like a name brand phone, this phone is less money to own (almost a 2/3's less depending on what you want).  I'll try to see if in a few weeks how it is, since I just got the phone today. Also it is a lot different from using a prepaid LG Prime phone(last phone). And for a phone that uses a 3g too, this works way better. As well as that I can still be a prepaid phone user and that's fantastic.So far the phone looks good and works find. After waiting 3 days, I got it using 3 to 5 business days. I was told that it wouldn't come in until Friday or monday at the latest, so I'm happy that I got it 2 days early. I did hear  certain people say they got their phones 2 weeks after ordering it, but I think it depends on location or how you want it shipped. Still you can get free shipping with 3-5 business days using amazon.It can be a little different than what you are use to in cell phones if you've never owned an Android or top of a line phone with special features and qualities. So it is best if you read the instructions (just Basic instructions on how to get your new cell going and tips on how to use it) on what to do if you are not update on cell phone workings like this. And I'm not as high tech as I think, since I'm very much lacking and pretty much used cells for basic things. I only could really use the Lg prime for making calls, send very limited Texts, taking pics, alarm clock, and Calendar.With this phone I can still do all of that, but much more without some worries. Like for instance I can use wi-fi without paying to use the internet where my old phone wouldn't allow it really and I would be charged for it. Of course you have to make sure one of the boxes in setting your new phone to work with the sim is not checked or the phone will automatically think to charge you on using the internet. So make sure to check your settings and that you are in wi-fi area to get away with using the internet for free.Another thing I like is that when you can use that free wi-fi, you can see if you can download free game apps to play games if you want. Using my old phone I was only allowed to play demo's of the games that were program on the phone and that sucked, especially when it only plays one level before quitting and offering you to pay to play the full version. So far now it's a big plus. Still I got a lot to look at with this, so don't put me to my word on it fully since I'm still learning.Battery life: I don't know at the moment, but hopefully it's not for one day from what I'm hearing about from most phones. Plus I'm hearing that it can be some of the functions (certain apps) that you use on your phone that causes the battery life to drain. So I'll try and update later to give an Idea on what should be wise to save battery life or how long I can get it to last.Camera: I like it a lot. I'm so use too just using one, but now I have two ways of using it. Front or back you can choose. However if your taking a picture of yourself holding the phone it won't be as good as taking pictures from the backside of the cell from what I can tell. I'm still getting use to the phone, so give me time to get use to it and see what I like about this feature on the phone.Sound: I can't really find anything bad about sound so far it's good. I still haven't figured out what the radio sounds like and I haven't had a chance to store some music on it yet to test it out. Volume could be a little higher to hear, but it's still loud enough to hear.The look of this phone: The phone is big for being a phone, but then again I've just upgraded from a small prepaid lg prime touch screen phone. And its little big holding in my hands and I'm female with average size. When I compare it to my sister's phone (which she has a Prepaid Myphone Touch from t-moble. Me, I'm with at&t.;)her's is slightly smaller. I still like it, even though it's bigger than I'm use too. Also when holding it, it feels solid and weighs a little more than I'm use too.Over all of the little while of owning and messing around on the phone, I found many things. From what I heard already and looked into myself I found that the phone is very good for a 3g. And if I compare how fast using some of the functions to my sis's 4g My touch phone, the fastness of this phone is equal and that surprising. There are many other functions I like that my old phone didn't have, like using wi-fi, getting free games, an extra camera on it,and many more.So for now this is all I have to say or can really say that I do like. Just give me a few weeks and maybe I can give more info than I can now. You never know until your given time to check things out and get use to it. Yet so far I'm liking this phone a lot...in a few weeks...that all depends on how the phone turns out after awhile.Update. Dec. 21, 2012Okay after having the Phone for about a month, I'm still in love with it. I've already had people commenting about it and asking where I got it. Even a couple people have asked me if it is an Galaxy Note and I told them no it wasn't. I have a younger Step Sister that is jealous of me that I own a cell, where our respectable parent's have told no to her on getting one. yet she would like one that is like mine. However she can't get one for 2 reason she doesn't have the money to afford one and two she is still a beginner Teenager where I'm in my late twenties.Besides that she isn't the only one that wants a phone like mine. My mother has been lately considering whether or not to by new cell phone with dual sim compartments on it to replace her two old razer Phones that she has had since 2006. I've told her that there are many opposition for future phones and that she should wait and see how I like mine before making any future plans on a phone or phones. Well after having it and using it for the last month she has seen that I really do like my phone, which has given her enough evidence that it must be a great phone.Now on to the more important things. After using it for a while I've picked up on things that I still like. Yet there is a couple things I don't like, but I can live with it.Battery:The Battery Life on it is okay, but could be better. In today's world I get it that most phones overly high tech in functions is going to have less battery life when not fully charged. If you are one of those people that are going to be on you phone 24/7 then expect to have a day's worth of battery life. However I have found it that I can last on averaged up to 3 day and that is only because I have very limited people I contact with on my phone. If not used too much I could make the battery life last for about 5 days (And that is only if no one has called you or you calling them or you haven't really used any of the apps on the phone but to check the time). Tip you can go into battery life in setting and it will give you a daily run by on what things you have use the battery life on in between charging it up.In addition you have to make sure to turn the brightness of the phone screen down when in use. I found that that can waste the battery life. Plus the brightness of the screen when active is still just as good when turned on the lowest setting. Also when using the wi-fi make sure to turn it off when not in use. That also waste the life of your battery when left on.Camera:The camera is okay too, but kind sucks when the room is dark. However if you brighten the room a little you can take some good pics. Down fall I haven't figured out how to use the flash on it. Also the zoom and focus on it at times could be a little better. However when your not dealing with that in and your in good lighting it's an alright camera. Of course I haven't really use it a whole lot, but Of the pics I've taken they are still good.Making calls and Text messages:Making calls on it works find and is great. I haven't had any problems with drop phone calls or anything and communicating with the other person on the line is clear to hear or talk to. However making text message can be a little tricky. I found that on my phone i have to type in the persons number to send the text. Every time I had trouble pressing the contact that I wanted ( Contact name <number here in between these>) I would have some trouble sending messages that way. Either way it may have something to do with just my phone and not other phones like mine, I still don't mind as long as I have a way to text.Deleting the Call log or Messages or Removing Apps.Some people have been saying that they have trouble on deleting things from their phone and had to download certain app to remove the calls from the call log. I at first had a problem, but after messing around I found a way and it is quite simple. You have a choice of deleting one by one if you want or all together. All you have to do is press the phone button then it will bring up previous calls along with a dial pad. At the top you have your phone, next a clock symbol, and then a smiling person (that takes you in to into your contacts.). Press the Clock symbol in the middle and then it will show you ALL (for all the calls coming/going out/or miss calls) with the different arrows. This is your call log area. Then at the bottom of your phone is where  your menu is (looks like a half of a square with two lines in it). Once pressed on the screen 'Delete and Setting' pops up. Press delete and you can select which or all you want to get rid of from call log. When done with your selection just press the trash bin. From there it should be easy.Deleting messages is easy too. instead of pressing phone, press the green smile face commit box that stands for messages on the phone. In there you can then go to the menu and delete all messages from your phone. However you can if you want and you don't want to delete every messages but certain threads within the messages you can do that too.Removing certain apps that you download from your main screen is easy to do. all you have to do is press and hold the app until a box from up top comes down saying Remove. Move the app up to remove and done.Sound:Sound on this phone has no problems that I can find yet.New things I like:In using the phone's camera I like that you have several options on how you can take the picture and latter modify or edit the same picture.Text messaging I have add ways on how to send things in my text messages.When dealing with main screen on the phone I have five ways to modify how I want my desk top on it to look, when scrolling side to side. Or in this case where to put my apps. Like for instance in the center screen I can have my Calender (that allows me to see upcoming dates or events), Clock, Setting app, Camera app, and calculator app on. On another screen going side to side I can make it my game choice on it with the apps that I like to play. Then sliding side to the next screen I could have something different until all five screens on the desktop of the phone are fulled if I want.When using the voice command on the phone i get the contact I want or other things I want, which is pretty cool. I even used it once using the internet to get to facebook. With my last phone, the voice command on it sucked and I would get the wrong things every time.Using the phone is pretty easy when needing to get to certain areas on it, once you have gotten use to it.Using the web is easy too!! You can shrink or make the web bigger on your screen when reading context of things. Last phone I had gave me difficulty. As well as that it was harder to stay connected and pressing to another page took forever. Not this phone it stayed connected and the speed was fast.Other thing to know about your phone:Depending if your phone comes with a phone case. Your set pretty much and don't have to get another case for it. I will say this that the phone is slightly smaller than a Galaxy note so it will be hard to get a right fit for cases to cover the phone. However if you have case that comes with your phone when ordering your phone, I found it that if you get a Galaxy Note siclone casing for the phone and put it over the hard case that comes with your phone works well too. Basically your double casing your phone in a way. If that doesn't work for you, you can always look into getting a pouch that can hold your phone well.Another thing if your looking for screen protectors, the phone comes with one on it. However it's never wrong to get extra if you want, but a Galaxy Note screen protector's you will find come a little bit big for the phone and you may have to find a way to modify it, if you can. Other than that you could try seeing about going the store and seeing if they have screen protectors for different uses of phone/cameras/etc. that you can modify with some help.Hopefully I have given you a little more insight since my first review of the phone. Over all I still really like my phone and I'm glad that I have it. Even though there are some things I don't like some what, there are still a lot that I like that out weight the little down falls in it. Not every phone is going to be perfect and I know this. This is just my opinion on what I think. Plus when I went searching for a new phone I looked into the many different reviews for whether it would be worth the chance on a new phone and the quality each phone has, especially when searching online. I'm one of those people that prefers go to the nearest store and checking out what I want to buy it or not, instead of looking over the web.In the end I took a chance and I'm glad I did because I have gotten a great phone for a great price.

It is now 7 months after I purchased the first phone and it has died dead.  The second phone will not maintain a wifi connection and has iffy cellular connection.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, period.  You will be sorrry later when it is too late to get a new one.Older - Got this phone 4 days ago and so far I am pleased.  I use it with a Straight Talk SIM and once you set the APN settings exactly like indicated on the Straight talk web site it works fine.  One issue I have had is that the Google Play Store would not operate on the device when I received it.  I googled the problem and it seems to be very common on all cell phones coming out recently with Google Play already on them.  I simply uninstalled the Google Play Store updates (had to do it twice) and the store started working, odd.  Build quality seems good, except for the back, which seems a little cheesy.  The screen is very bright and responsive to touch.  Phone calls come in with good clarity.  Documentation is abysmal but comes with directions where you can download a better manual.  Another issue is lack of accessories but those tend to come with time I find as people start manufacturinng them.UPDATE 1, the screen is susceptible to scratches.  Use a cover of some sort or never put anything that can scratch it in the same holder with the phone. Taking these basic (and common sense for that matter) measures will save you the scratches.  It seems to be fairly durable when dropped. I have dropped it twice from about 4-5 feet with only the included case and it is no worse for wear.  Another issue I had was making it work with my car's blue tooth. However, this is an Android 4.0 issue not a this phone issue.  Google the problem and you will find several solutions.Update 2, The wifi hotspot is great! My wife bought this same phone to use only as a wifi device since she didn't want to have such a large cased phone.  However, she did really like using mine as an ereader.  However, even though she doesn't have a SIM we can turn the wifi hotspot on mine and she can use the wifi on her phone when we are travelling that is major cool.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "PAE8000", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R13PZBJGP1R1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for over a month now and have tweaked it to my liking.  It's an upgrade from my Nokia E71.  I have a Straight Talk Sim Card in it.  I downloaded a bunch of apps from google play to customized it.  I changed the camera it came with and downloaded the new ICS version that is available.  The flash works on it and also the stock camera but you have to go into settings and enable it.  I downloaded Fresh Network by McStealth cause I was experiencing a lot of dropped calls and that app is suppose to help with having stronger signals.  I also downloaded GO keyboard with all the fancy styles and skins to go with it.  I bought JuiceDefender Ultimate for it and that app saved my battery. For sms and mms I downloaded the Handcent sms app. I don't have any problems in sending and receiving sms and mms.  I went on a droid forum and found an APN app that worked perfectly with the phone.  I created 2 APN. I inserted my sim in the GSM/WCDMA slot.  Under settings and mobile networks I enabled 3G and for Network Mode I selected GSM/WCDMA mode.  I live in Vermont and service is sketchy around these parts.  It's always showing an H for network and sometimes an E.  I can force it into remaining on H network which is a faster version of 3G by changing my network to WCDMA, but I experience a lot of drop calls when I have it in that mode.  Overall it's a nice phone for its price, it works better in the city where there are more AT&T; Towers.  The in call volume does not go higher than 6, I can hardly hear what callers are saying when I'm on the road.  It drops my call a lot.  But overall I love, love, love my phone, it works great for my needs. I have my B&N; Nook and also my kindle app.  My boyfriend saw mine and loved it, so he has the same identical one as mine.

Seller was fantasic. The phone was in China for two days and actually took longer in the U.S. (three days). The seller said I would have the phone in 5 business days, and I did thru DHL Express.I bought the phone because of the dual sim cards and Ice Cream Sandwhich operating system. The only thing faster right now is Jelly Bean. The phone works very fast on the internet with straight talk (making like it is AT&T;) when u call in. The display looks great for a $200 phone, and everything works well. I actually bought the phone before my trip to Panama (the country) and gave it to my friend. She put in her sim card from MovieStar and went into their office and the rep put some numbers in the phone and now she is using Internet effortlessly and downloaded some games off google play store. The games work well and easy. She can even watch TV shows because they still broadcast analog TV in Panama. I used it for the entire three weeks  in Panama and was very happy with the overall quality and construction of the phone and all of its features and compatiability with applications and use. The camera on the phone shoots pictures on the dark side, and the flash doesn't really function well. The man I talked to at \"The Super Savings Store\" really impressed me(I wish I could remember his name (it's short).

I'm ready to give it a fair review at this point.NOTE:  I purchased a SIM card from \"Straight Talk\" ($15) and setup was simple using the instructions provided on the Straight Talk website.PROS:- The PRICE!- The MTK6575 Dual Core 1 GHz CPU boots the phone quickly, accesses and runs the Android 4.0.3 OS and apps smoothly.- The phone shows total on-board storage as 1.95 GB. I also have a 32 Gig SD card installed.  Plenty of storage space for me personally.- Front and back facing cameras.- WiFi setup was as simple as it can be and it receives the WiFi signal really well from anywhere in my home.- Bluetooth setup with my car was easy, and the connection is always quick.  When I call out or receive a call in my car I don't hear complaints about poor sound quality like I have with other B/T capable phones I had in the past (Samsung, Nokia, Sony Ericsson, etc...).- The 5\" screen makes typing phone numbers, URLs and text messaging easier. Getting a 5\" screen at this price is a good buy. Not to mention the display is quite clear and clean.- The phone comes with two batteries. I cut the WiFi off while I'm away from home and use the B/T in the car.  Normal 3G access is active all day long. the battery goes from 100% to 35-40% after eighteen hours of use.  Not bad.  I purchased 2 more batteries from AliExpress.com for about $15 for both in an attempt to maintain longevity of the batteries.CONS:- Cameras and Flash: The front facing camera is very low res (0.3 MP).  Poor quality, but works good enough for SKYPE. The back camera is only 5 MP, not very good quality pics and the flash isn't very affective.  But I already HAVE a real digital Camera and this is really a phone. Besides I paid $175.00 for an Android phone, and I wasn't expecting SLR quality photographs.  I'm just saying you know :).- It's IMPOSSIBLE to find a decent form fit protective case for this phone.  I've search for 3 months and came to the conclusion that it does not exist. I contacted the Amazon seller for this phone and was told that since this is a \"No-Name Brand\" (generic)phone, no protective cases has/will be made by companies like Belkin.  I was able to find a flip cover type case that offers little or no protection from falls, but it provides some screen protection.- The speaker phone volume is mediocre at best, but is somewhat usable.  You'll be better off using the provided headphones or a B/T earpiece.All-in-All:  I like the phone for what it does and especially the cost.  Coupled with Straight Talk Mobile Non-Contract with service that's truly unlimited, I getting way more bang for my buck than when I was with AT&T; or Verizon on one of their \"$50\" plans that really ended up as $80 a month for limited voice, text, and data.The product exceeded my expectations.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would have loved it", "Author": "Roberta", "ReviewID": "R3B8GN6E8GX43C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I agonized over buying this phone, not knowing about a non-name brand product.  When it arrived, I was impressed by its apparent quality.  Good heft and construction.  Took me a little while to figure out how to configure it for my service provider, but once that was done it was great fun to start using.  It came with Android 4.1 and seemed to work very smoothly.  Bright screen, responsive, good installed apps, and as others have said adequate cameras and voice quality.  Two batteries!  Accessories, too.  Almost all the things the higher priced phones have (and some things they don't) at a fraction of the cost!  Alas, it was not to be.  About a week in, the troubles started.  It began with the camera rapid firing for no apparent reason.  Then I noticed the power button would not 'snooze' the phone, nor turn it off.  Screens were appearing randomly.  Okay, I'll take the battery out and let it reboot.  This worked the first time, but not for long.  When the series of events began again, I knew the party was over.  Fortunately, David Chen at lolbuy was always responsive to my emails, if not always completely understandable.  I decided to opt for a refund rather than a replacement being a little gun shy now.

I took the phone in to have it looked at and sure enough she was right. The phone could make calls and text but no browser. The worker informed me that because its a t-moible phone that straight talk is having issues with the 3g with t-moible. So the only way I would be able to get internet on the phone would be if I was connected to wifi. Even after changing the APN settings to straight talk still no internet. The worker informed me that because this phone is from another country that is another issue why its having issues not accessing the browser. I live in Michigan and when the phone said could be used with straight talk they were half right. So as of right now I am returning the phone.

The phone I received is a T-Mobile compatible phone and I had assumed it would be an AT&T; compatible phone since that is what I use at straight talk. In my area it would be better to have an ATT compatible phone. Consequently I have not used the phone due waiting on the correct sim card and activation.

There are a few things to consider when rating the overall utility and user-friendliness of the phone and I hope to address them here. I am a Straight Talk customer and contrary to customer service, this phone will work for the MMS picture mail settings. You simply have to enter the APN settings for Straight Talk twice, dedicating one of the settings to MMS as primary and the other as Default.Aside from that, I have seen where having a generic phone may have it's disadvantages. If you want to hook the phone to your computer to transfer files, you have to work around the fact that Microsoft cannot readily detect what driver to install for this phone. I honestly haven't played with it more to see if a standard driver or a Galaxy Note driver would work, though I suspect it would. However, that would be something more advanced, so novice users may find this to be a detractor from the overall utility of the phone. Apps work great, battery life is pretty good considering I use my phone for a lot of data activities and online games, I have to charge it at the end of the day...but that's to be expected.I have had this phone randomly reset on me twice now. I don't know why it did it, but I wasn't involved in a serious task at the moment so it was just an action I noted. Make sure you have a good micro SD card to add to the phone upon activating it as the phone memory is VERY LIMITED.This is not a phone for a novice. If you aren't willing to invest some time learning to use it and work around the generic aspect of it, you will not be happy with the phone. If you want a good product, don't care about paying for a brand name and are willing to take the time to learn how to work around the quirks, then by all means take the plunge.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a QUAD CORE PHONE!", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R3EOK98RU6V6PD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone description is a complete lie.
