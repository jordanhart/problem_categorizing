{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really pleased - great value for the money", "Author": "Sioban Lanigan \"Irish Crone\"", "ReviewID": "R2LH62KWPFNU3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great phone. I did not want another Android. I have an IPAD for wifi. I want a cell phone to be a cell phone but I am one of those who MUST have a qwerty keyboard. The keyboard is great, the phone is reliable and easy to use and the display is good too (I need a good display for my vision). The battery lasts well too.(I should warn you that Boost's website does not have any ringtones for the phone which is just bad website design really and Boost blocks purchases of ringtones elsewhere) - hopefully Boost will fix it soon but,of course, that is not the fault of the phone. And Boost monthly plans beat the competition by far. This Samsung phone is really good buy,I recommend this purchase.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "best prepaid phone thats not a smart phone", "Author": "robert j schulten", "ReviewID": "RT1VZBPLZG1PQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was prompt on delivery of phone, and the phone has some nice features even though not a smart phone, slide out keyboard was nice and easy to use, and boost being on sprint network works really when for coverage.

Being a teen, its definitely not that fun to use.Web: Is okay, even though I could get on fb and twitter the small screen just  took the fun out of it. It was kind of a hassle going on fb trying to like and comment things but overall I would give this feature 2/5 stars.Texting: With the keypad, it's pretty easy to text but over time I started not receiving peoples texts.Since I text a lot, I guess it wasn't a good thing because it kept telling me to delete some of my messages so I could receive more. I'm not sure whether it was the company or my phone service but I would have conversations with people through text and I would be the last one texting. Really annoying. 3/5Calls: I can hear fine through the phone, but people were complaining sometimes that they have to say hello twice before I say it.3 way calling is kind of confusing also. I got a lot of dropped calls while calling my friend. 3/5Battery/ Life: It only lasts a day if I'm being a normal teen on it. But if I just text it lasts about a day and a half. Literally have to charge my phone everyday. Not to mention the charger that came with it began to not work. The wire messed up. 2/5Music: Is OKAY, if you love to listen to music like me this may not be the phone for you. Its very annoying when I try and add on music and there are no options of changing anything about the song once it's on your phone. I also tried to delete a song from a playlist I made and it ended up deleting it from my phone period! Navigating trying to find a song you want to listen to is a hassle too, you have to use the arrow pad and constantly press up or down. Good luck if your song starts with a y. Oh yeah, The music turns off when you go into other apps. 3/5Camera: It's better than I thought, it may be the best feature on the phone. The camera zooms, it does collages, you can take pictures at night, and also does video. The only thing I don't  like is that you cant edit the photo on your phone. After you take it, it is what it is. 4/5Memory: I dont really remember how much memory was on the phone but whatever it was, it wasnt enough for me. I had to buy a micro sd card because I love to take pictures and have music with me while i'm out. In order to put things on the phone you need a micro sd card. I still ran out of memory after buying an 8gb card.Apps: There really arent any apps on here, you can pay your boost payment from the phone, gps, and there is a store to buy things and that's about it. Nothing that really interests me.Games: They could have put more games on here, I mean c'mon there's not much else on this device. The only FULL games on here that you can play are Family Feud and Tetris I think. The others you have to buy and  are only a demo. 2/5Other things I didn't cover: I saw someone commented on ringtones saying you can't download them, that is true. The phone looks okay, being my age I wouldn't take this phone out in clear sight where everyone could see it. This phone is also DURABLE, I dropped this phone a lot (more than 5 or 6 times) but then it finally broke when I dropped it in the toilet. Once you get the hang of the calender it's pretty nice to use but it will be confusing. I kind of miss my Motorola theory, I had more freedom with that phone.Overall this phone is just basic and I think is not meant for teens. It will have a long life and be more beneficial to someone older who just wants to talk and send occasional texts.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG ARRAY (BOOST MOBILE)", "Author": "ANDRE VAZ", "ReviewID": "R3U84LH1WC9GIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this device which works perfectly fine and has been attending accordingly my needs.

I asked if she would like to switch back to her old phone and she said the new Array had grown on her and was fine.  It took a week or two but the phone actually performs great.  Voice conversations sound clear, good signal in most areas and excellent battery life.  It feels well made and doesn't look bad either.  Don't expect to do much in the way of taking pictures or viewing media.  It will view and send picture messages fine but forget internet use.

Got really hot in my hand. Most of the games on it are demo's and ill try to make U pay for full versions of game. Tetris I think was the only one full on there. It does play MP3's nice, but that's about the only nice thing I can say about this phone. it sounds good with headphones. No since in recording with it too since mine doesn't record with sound and look like crap anyways. Using it as a phone itself was a joke. it also too overheat when talking to long. The customer service was a joke too,they didn't believe me, said there was nothing wrong with the phone.
