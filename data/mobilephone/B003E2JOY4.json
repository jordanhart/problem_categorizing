B. Gaxiola", "ReviewID": "R29YBDS6K6A9ME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone in itself is as good as I've come to expect from Sony Ericsson. It's a nice, sleek & small phone, which is , along wiht the nice Camera why I chose it. The battery life, though is awful. It doesn't last a  work day without being depleted - and I don't really use it that much. I tought it may be the battery so I changed it (for an original, even) and still got the same.I don't know, I'm just wild guessing that maybe the screen gets accidentally lit on while in the purse or something, but if that is the case, then I think the design should've prevented the phone from potentially depleting the battery while not in use - I mean, the blocking could maybe have been a sliding bar instead of a touch button.UPDATE: I've had this phone now for almost a year, and I completely regret buying it. It freezes and shuts down constantly.  I don't have enough money to buy a new cell, but when I do, It won't be a Sony Ericsson anymore, I'm very dissappointed.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Short battery life time.", "Author": "Zaiboot", "ReviewID": "R14O76G7DS52JF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Short battery life time.I use it for 3G internet, SMS, audio player, radio.
