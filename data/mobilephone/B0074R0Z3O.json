I come from a family that has at least 2 Apple products in their possession but I always steered away from them.They seem too common and very popular, I always wanted to stick out with something different but I ended up with this phone. And the reason why is because it was free, why not?After I received it, I opened it up and the device is beautifully crafted. I was impressed but not extremely wowed because I'm already familiar with them and the layout.Like all Apple products the iOS is very fluid and easy to learn and master in seconds. It's very nice but it's outdated. I believe it's nice to keep a good layout but I believe the same OS does get old since it follows the exact same initiative the first generation iPod touch had. But again it works, it's reliable, and easy to use.People seem to shoot for huge phones that are light in the hand and has the biggest screen.Not in my case. I love the iPhone's screen size. Bigger is not always the best. In fact I love this screen over other competing phones. The Samsung Galaxy SIII has a huge screen but why? I understand its easier to play games but its not convenient the iPhones screen is big enough to display a lot but be portable as well.I have more coverage with the iPhones screen. I can touch anywhere on the screen with my thumb without any discomfort. I can use the phone completely with one hand and one thumb. The galaxy's screen is too big and you have to hold in two hands for the most comfortable coverage.  And if i wanna watch movies I'd get my laptop or vita to watch videos. I don't like watching full movies on cell phones anyways. It's a waste of battery when you can watch it on a full size tv. Bigger screen can be an inconvenience and is really just for bragging rights.The iPhone 4 has some weight. But I like a heavier phone it feels like a nicely crafted unit. Not light plastic but not cheap glass either. It is the perfect weight although the glass finish makes it slippery in the hand. Nothing a good case can't fix. And with such an investment go ahead and protect it. With either an otterbox defender or a griffin survivor some of my favorites.The battery life is decent depending on what you use it for. Text and calling only it lasts a day. Or if you're like me and play games, watch YouTube videos with your friends, and text frequently it dies within a day. So it decent.Overall I'd give this phone a 5/5", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "So much to make life easier", "Author": "Todd7", "ReviewID": "R10S8B3GWO2FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 8 gb iPhone is absolutely magnificent in its design and seemingly infinite features. The phone is durable, but I still recommend getting a protective covering for a modest sum of money to protect your investment. This iPhone has everything one needs to navigate through their daily lives at a time of fast-paced living. It's surreal that something so small can do so much. The best part is the extremely user-friendly interface that makes owning one of these phones a very attractive endeavor instead of a nightmare. The jury is still out as to whether 8 gb is enough for me, but it seems to be as of the moment.

It would shut its self off in the middle of calls, texts, apps, ect. Finally the phone shut its self off and would not turn back on. I fallowed all trouble shooting from apple and nothing worked. Today, I took it to Verizon (my wireless provider) and they told me that the phone was in fact refurbished, the battery was put in wrong and had started to corrode.

Also  got him a Life Proof Case but he dropped it and the back of the phone cracked and it stopped working. Took it to Apple Store and was informed that they could not fix it because when they opened the back they found 8 non-apple components, which means whoever sold it to Amazon must have done their own repair work on it.  Apple said not only there was no warranty, but that they are not allowed to work on Apple products that have been tampered with. I called Amazon and was told that the phone was not covered by warranty because the phone was dropped.  So basically we have to buy ANOTHER phone. By the time we get another phone we could have just bought new.  By the way, the Life Proof company says the do not protect the phone, only their case and since their case was not damaged when he dropped the phone, they are not responsible to replace anything either.

UPDATE", "Author": "elchamber", "ReviewID": "R2TLX3RI9RNVAP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "*Update*iOS 7.0.4 has made this iPhone 4 act like my old Motorola Droid X, which means it's giving me a head ache.  It doesn't do want I want it to do.  I have to jailbreak it to make it work normally again... once I jailbreak it though.iOS 7.0.4I CAN'T TURN OFF ANYTHING ANY MORE!I can't upload music into this phone anymore via iTunes. When I TRY, it leaves my phone hanging on \"waiting for changes to...\"I can't sync it to iCloud without having a pop-up message telling me to put in my password to an individual email account.I can't go to the app store and download an app without telling me it can't download and install the app at this time. The only way to do this is go back to the app store in my phone and RE-DOWNLOAD the same app.I can't restore everything from the iCloud when I do a \"factory reset\" AKA \"Erase All Content and Settings\" like before.When I need to take a quick photo of something, there is now a pause for my phone to open it on.I have to constantly turn off background apps even though they're not truly on. They basically require another load as if you're loading them for the first time.*Before iOS7Apple will take advantage for your phone's free hard drive space to download the latest firmware update without your knowledge. It will take up space until you allow for the change. Until then, you're out of luck with your free space.Never trusting Apple again. I'm jumping back to Android. This is ridiculous.*Original Review before iOS 7*I decided to jump off the Android wagon when I was having a hard time with my Droid X and another Droid Motorola makes.  Though I enjoyed its use, the problems with it was too much to ignore. Bad Wifi connection, the constant lag/freezing/auto-reboot, and camera problems were just so annoying.  So I got this and was surprised, since both the Droid X and iPhone 4 came out the same time.Wifi:The iPhone 4 had better Wifi connection and speeds.  I did a test run on both at the same time using the same router and same app, and notice that the Droid X was much slower.  Also, the Droid X stop downloading after a short time versus the iPhone 4, where I could finish a whole movie from Netflix without any connection issues.  The Droid X would show that it's connected, but nothing would be downloading.Battery:The battery life about the same.  But, since I've only had the iPhone 4 for a month now, I hope it last longer than the Droid X where it barely lasted 2 hours of use.  The good part for the Droid is that the battery could be replaced easily.Both phones seems to have crash issues for me.  But apps crashed less on the iPhone 4 than on the Droid X.Notification:The annoying thing about the iPhone 4 versus the Droid X is the notifications.  If you get a call or message, you have to turn on the iPhone's screen to see.  You could have it blink the flash behind the iPhone to go on and off when someone sends a message or calls, but it only happens in a short time and then the only way to know if someone sent you message or called you is turning the screen on.  On my Droid X, a blinking light on the top would tell me if I missed a message, call, and if the battery was low.  And on the notification bar on the Droid X was much better.  It told more info on what was being notified, and you can easily erase the messages.  On the iPhone 4, the notification bar was basically bleak on information, and an annoying red dot with numbers would appear on the apps.  The only way to erase the red dot is going into that app.  Sometimes, it still wouldn't erase the problem.Customization:I guess I was spoiled after going from an Android to an iPhone.  Unless you jailbreak the iPhone 4, you're not getting much.  The looks is boring.  It's basically the app draw on an Android.  At least the Droid X had some short-cut widgets that was available than having to go to the settings menu and it's sub-menus to do what you want.  On the Droid X, I could turn on and off the wifi, rotation, sound, airplane mode, etc.  I never thought it would be missed until I got my iPhone 4.  GIF and videos can't be live wallpaper nor the phone can't automatically change backgrounds by itself like it did on the Droid.Size:Like the customization, I miss the bigger screen.  Playing games on the iPhone 4 is so much better, but enjoying all of the games on iTunes is limited... for me.  Also, using the GPS is hilarious on the small screen than on the Droid X.  I've been using NavFree which lets me download maps and has an actual GPS that works.  I've never had a problem with it though some people are asking too much for a free app that can work without any data.  The only problem is the traffic, which doesn't show unless you pay for it.Firmware:Hate it on the iPhone 4.  It takes too much space and it constantly reminds me to update.  It even download's itself on to my iPhone 4 with out my permission.  At least, it doesn't install by it's self.Camera:iPhone 4 had a better camera.  The pictures and videos were a bit more better than on the Droid X.  Though the pictures and videos look better on the iPhone 4's retina screen, I had to see it off the phone to really see the difference.  And I didn't see that much of a big deal.  The video file was much smoother from the iPhone 4(not talking about how it looks in the phone).  Pictures wise, they were both okay unless the pictures was taken on a sunny day or in low-light.  Those two situations, the iPhone 4's camera created better pics and videos.  But indoors and on regular lighting, they both were somewhat the same.Multitask:Droid X wins.  Again, if I \"jailbreak\" the iPhone, it would be much different, but the stock version is okay.  Yes, you can play a radio app in the background while doing something else that doesn't require sound like surfing the browser.  But to turn off apps playing in the background, you'll have to delete each and every app one at a time.  Yes the Droid X does that as well, but there is at least a several task managers in the Google Play app store to delete the tasks and cache easily.  I have yet to see anything on the iTunes store.  I did see it available on Cydia, but again, I'd need to jailbreak my iPhone 4 to be able to get an all in one task/cache clear.I do like my new iPhone 4 though.  A lot more accessories are available.  I can count on using the camera when I needed it... even on the lock screen.  It's solid phone I hope it last like my iPod Touch 2nd gen.  I say it cause I still use it and it hasn't fail me at doing what it's meant to do.

I called Verizon and they recommended ordering a phone from Amazon, for a much lesser price.  So I found a \"brand new\" I-phone 4 for $190.  I ordered it and received it 4 days after the \"2 Day shipping\" I paid extra for.  When the phone showed up it was in a brown unmarked box, there was no invoice, no receipt, just a slip from, \"HQ Select.\" This was my first indication that something didn't seem right.  I turned on the phone, got into my i-cloud and everything looked normal, normal; EXCEPT that I had a different phone number and it could not be changed.  I called Verizon and they told me the phone was linked to another account and it was unusable (they verified this through the MEID settings in your i-phone).  So HQ Select sold me a phone that was someone else's and I could not use it at all.  Amazon could do nothing but offer me an advanced refund.  Verizon recommended, \"hard erasing the phone immediately and sending it back.\" The number associated with the phone was a verizon wireless carrier and the sales rep told me that this person just got a new phone activated with the same number.  I did a hard reset and bought a new phone from Verizon.  Here's the bottom line: When ordering a phone from Amazon for, \"much less\" than the normal price; Make sure its definitely not from HQ Select, double check the third party vendor is legit, or just make sure its from Amazon and not affiliated with a third party vendor.  I hope HQ Select gets an inoperable tumor at the base of their spine and they rot in hell.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very, very disappointed!", "Author": "1coolgramma", "ReviewID": "R1E8EKWJZA89FD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very disappointed with this phone!
