I thought these reviews are meant to be reviews of the product, not the quality of service you got from different sellers? Who knows maybe I'm confused.This is by far the most functional \"budget phone\" you will ever buy. For little more than a hundred dollars you can have email through a wifi connection. The interface is impeccable compared to any other phone in this price range. Calendar and contact applications are all very intuitive.  Not to mention you have iPod on the phone too.For an even better deal you can get an unlocked iPhone and use it with any prepaid service like Net10 or GoPhone, save a boat load of money compared to traditional AT&T; plans.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple iPhone 2G 8GB", "Author": "levaniko", "ReviewID": "R3OPEKTFC2NFV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was kinda nervous when I ordered it, because it was first ever used thing that I've ordered from amazon, and seller had no rating at all, but phone that I got was in very good condition for money that I paid for it. no scratches on screen and no major scratches on back side. only power button was not working but it was very easy to fix.

It seems to be years ahead of its competition. Like imagine in 1998 a motorola razr being availible, where what would phones look like now? Will this iphone is the same analogy, imagine the iphone in 2007 where would we be now. This phone will set a precedent to many companies, that they have to raise their bar. Ok so the review:Design: 5/5- cant complain about the glass and aluminum which makes the devie surprisingly thin and very light.Functions: 4/5 I would like there to be a flash player meaning i can watch trailers and other things like that use video on a website.Battery: 2/5- battery is horrific. Dont expect to be able to listen to your music, browse the web and talk at the same time. If you listen to your ipod and browse the web at the same time, the battery is draining exponentially. And when it reaches the 20% mark it seems like theres only 5 minutes of battery life left no matter what you are doing with the iphone. The battery issue is a huge problem and hopefully when i send it back to apple they will have invented a much better battery for its users. I would say that if you use your iphone's ipod 2 hours a day, and browse the web 2 hours (including email), and talk for about 2 hours you pretty much used up all the battery has to offer. This means charging the phone nightly. The more you charge, the weaker the battery gets. Now if you talk lets say for 1 hour listen to music for 1 hour and browse the web for 1 hour, you'll still need to charge daily because overnight the battery will still drain because the phone never really shuts off when its on stand by. If you do shut it off at night though, you probably wont have enough battery to go through the next day anyways. It seems like the first 50% used is twice as long as the last 50% used.All in all the phone saves plenty of room in my pants and is a great phone and practical. Careful walking around with it on your belt. Its probably the #1 desired item for pick pockets right now. However dont forget that the battery is atrocious and offensive that they couldn't give us a battery as strong as other pda's. But enjoy it while it has power.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "It Could've Been Better!", "Author": "Willy Francis", "ReviewID": "RTGK89DGHBGI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this phone hoping there would be no dings but unfortunately there was but the phone works perfectely fine!", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "apple iphone", "Author": "Ellie", "ReviewID": "R256KLON12WSTB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The description said nothing about it being cracked and it wont turn on!
