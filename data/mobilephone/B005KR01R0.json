I have had it for over two years now and I have literally beat the crap out of it and eventually all good cell phones have their areas where they go. With Verizon telling me they will be getting rid of the basic phones and forcing people to charge outrageous prices a month for data plans. I have decided to just go ahead and buy this cell phone brand new again because it has worked so well for me and looks stylish and new like those expensive data phones. Plus with it being older I can easily find accessorizes on amazon to purchase for cheap such as cases : ) so i am very happy to be ordering this soon as my lazy butt gets to it ... Verizon you suck for screwing over your customers who dont need flashy, internet cell phones! : )", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "What the phone is, and how 3 turned out when all bought at once.", "Author": "Tim the enchanter", "ReviewID": "R28F4BP7HA1PIV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Writing this review because most of the reviews I see either love or hate the phone. Since me, my mom, and little sister all got this phone I thought people on  here would find it interesting to see how all these phones turned out. We got them in October of 2010 so here's how they turned out:My little sister who had broken a screen on a phone previous (and got a replacement) broke this one in about 4 months. Definitely not a good one for young kids. She went and got a different phone, which she liked more, but also broke. So this was more negligence than actual wear and tear.My mom has had the phone and it works great but she doesn't use it very often. Typical use is an occasional text and phone calls. Has good service in a bad area (where only Verizon works) so its pretty typical there. She had a battery problem at one point (only lasting 1 day with no use) but somehow the phone corrected itself. It typically can last a week when not used very often. (just calls, texting, check your email quick etc)My experience was a bit more hectic. I got it my senior year of high school and used it excessively. Even more than my little sister who was a freshman. However I took good care of it and it never got any sort of damage or even noticable scratches. The phone appears to be pretty fragile so it would be a good idea to buy a case to put on it if you are considering buying it. I have dropped my phone a good 4-5 times in its lifetime from about shoulder height and it held out with a case over it, not sure i would've been so lucky without a case.Generally not a bad phone. It is one of the few phones left that still has video and is cheap to get. Its picture/video sending capabilities leave much to be desired. It can take upwards of 5 minutes occasionally to send a simple picture message in very good phone areas which is a bit ridiculous. The games this phone can play are plentiful but cost a lot. I do not buy any of them I only play the free ones but i'll say free the ones (or demos) actually are not that bad. So as an alternative to a smartphone this phone can handle this if you're willing to pay the price. For texting i have a complaint, its pretty handy to be able to use both a number pad (like an old phone) or you can set it to keyboard like a new phone so its the best of both worlds, however it DOES NOT remember new words. Ever. It remembers for about 3-7 days so if you use the keyboard for a unique word not already in its WORD database it will remember for a week at the most. Pretty disappointing, its generally better to use the keyboard because of that odd problem.The huge problem with this phone: the touchpad. It uses touch-resistant technology. In other words, it wears out over time, pretty cheap technology. You have to be very gentle to make it last, my little sister broke her phone because she touched so hard she wore it out and it wouldn't feel any touches anymore. (in other words, she pressed the screen and it didn't register) So she started using an actual pen (yeah, brilliant idea....) to touch it hard enough that it would feel it, because punching it was her alternative and that wouldn't have worked out either. Well one time she pressed it a little too hard and the pen went through the screen and smashed the phone. Verizon wouldn't fix it either because it was her fault for breaking it. She hated them and the phone for this and got something completely different, end of story for her.Mine did the same thing as hers, wouldn't register anymore after about a year. I was pretty gentle with it so it lasted well against the barrage of texts I created and sent with it. However it got bad after about 10 months, in the summer following it basically wouldn't work anymore. So I got rougher with it and pressed much harder to get it to work. All was fine for about another month and then I guess my hard pressing killed it in that short period of time. Suddenly it started pressing things on its own! Even in the night it would press itself on and keep the light going and kill the battery. I guess it lost the \"touch resistance\" it once had and was registering touches that never existed. It was pretty bad, I tried to text and it instead texted gggggggggggggggg for me. Very hard to explain to people. So I called up Verizon and complained, so they shipped me a new phone free (excluding battery, you have to use your old one, they are cheap like that) but luckily got the phone I still use today. At this point I went to college and didn't text nearly as much and so the phone has lasted me ever since, however it is starting to press buttons on its own and starting up applications randomly. So it might die before October. Keep in mind the warranty (if you get it at the store with a 2 year plan) is only for 1 year so i'm kind of doomed if it dies again unless I switch to an older phone.A decent phone overall. Very good if you don't use it much, just occasionally. My mom's phone acts like its brand new even though its over a year and a half old. Good battery life for a touchphone, and gets things done. I DO NOT recommend getting a data plan. My mom, little sis, and I got 10$ plans with it and we never use it. Its just not that useful. Its kind of ridiculous that we pay 30$ a month for something we don't use. Typical scam of Verizon here, just buy it online (hence why this review is on amazon) and not get a 2 year plan with MANDATORY data plan. To be honest I only use the internet on it for email. Thats it. It can be used for facebook but its not very good, just get on a computer. The only real use of it for everyone is that you can google search with it. THATS IT. Only use for its internet. It can browse websites but it can be hard to navigate, its pretty impractical.Sorry this review is so long but I felt a detailed description of experiences and features with this phone would do it some good. Probably too old now that no one even buys it anymore.EDIT: It is now October 2 years after I originally got this kind of phone. I've had the replacement phone (after the first broke) for a year and 3 months and its still good as new like my moms phone which is now 2 years old. Only difference is battery life has diminished greatly, however not as badly as one would assume. Both used to last about a week but now only last 1-4 days depending on how much usage. (1 day if used a lot, 4 if no usage). Not as bad as some phone batteries get after 2 years though. To me as long as it lasts longer than 24 hours i'm happy, and its not failed that except one time I had to sit and wait for a couple hours and had to play the free demo games, but you can expect any 2 year old phone to die after 4 hours of game usage.If you want the newest technology, skip this phone. Its an \"outdated\" phone now and doesn't support many things people want/expect from a phone. Only a couple  \"apps\" that are useful and free, no new games, or even a high quality touchscreen (or even fingerprint resistant touchscreen).However I prefer to use my computer for everything that people want to use their phone to do. Games, internet browsing, fancy apps, this phone isn't practical for those, I only use it to occasionally do a google search and to do email, just like before. Nothing changed, those truly are the only uses for its data, so if you can avoid data do so. I use less data than it costs per megabyte anyways so its wasted money. The texting is good if you can touch a virtual keyboard you can only see, and for voice this phone is great.If you do not want a fancy phone, but want a touchscreen (or to try out a touchscreen), and something reliable that won't die in a year (unless with excessive usage or great carelessness) you can get this phone. My upgrade is due but I'm not upgrading anytime soon. I'm pretty happy with this phone and will probably use it til it literally falls apart and save the upgrade. No need to fix what isn't broken.EDIT: May 2013New thing i have found. Games for it. I finally decided to hunt thoroughly in all game categories and get every free game and try it out.For the most part all of them are a bit sub-par in many ways. Speed, graphics, and a critical out of memory error are all slight pains you have to deal with when it comes to the games provided. I'll explain in detail..The speed and graphics just need a pretty simple explanation. This phone has been out roughly 5 years old now. You can't have high expectations for it. It runs okay for most games but certain ones with lots of detail and use lots of memory will slow it down drastically.Basically the main problem with this phone in regards to it's games is the OOM (out-of-memory) error that people seem to get on older computers or on newer ones in which they haven't put enough RAM into the computer. I'm not quite a computer expert yet (I've never had a computer give me this error so I've never researched it, just heard of it) but i believe it has something to do with the RAM of the phone. In other words the phone has to store the game that is running in memory and if you don't have enough memory it won't work. Since i use 80 mb of it's 100 mb to hold everything so that may just be a problem for me because I've filled it so full. So in simple terms don't fill it up too full or games won't work. The easy fix that works almost every time for this error is to shut off the phone and turn it back on and it'll work any game that gives this error.I'd give names of games but I don't think I am allowed on a review. But basically I've found 20 or so games that are rather simplified in format. In simplest terms most of the good games for this phone are either card game programs like black jack or poker, or construction games where you build cities (or zoos, or a farm, you get the idea) they all \"encourage\" you to buy an in-game currency so in order to fully enjoy most games on this phone you need to be an okay gamer in regards to smart constructing, or be good at cards to never run out of chips (or GUM in the poker game) so you can have hours of waiting made bearable by games from this phone. The main trick is finding them. I just barely found them and I've had the phone for years! I searched before but just missed the good ones. You have to devote an hour or two to find all the free games amongst all the lame ones that cost 5.00 a piece.Finally an update on the phones again. Not a whole lot has changed except battery problems. My moms phone still lasts 1 day on a charge and hasn't changed. Mine used to last a few days now I get just 2 days or 3 if I'm not using it at all. Both touch-screens still work. My little sister has seen the games I've just got on it and now she wants to buy a new one from here so she can get them! She still uses the Samsung Intensity 2 as a replacement phone. Which by the way I will mention briefly is an absolutely abysmal phone. I'm going to write a review on that one. My little sister has broke 2 of them, and my girlfriend who was always super careful with hers all the time accidentally got it wet once and it broke. Most phones are like that hence why I've devoted time and effort to this review so that people know this one stands out a bit from the crowd (as long as you don't smash the screen with a pen at least) I've been a bit careless with it and dropped it a few times in the last while but it still works. Mine is 2 years old now and my mom's is almost getting to be about 3 years old now in October. Batteries are deteriorating more and more but since they always last at least 24 hours we can't complain.Final update: After 4 years of using this phone. Me and my mom have finally retired this phone to upgrade. It should be noted that even though we are finally replacing these phones we did use them for a double cycle (we should've got a new phone in between since upgrades come every 2 years) but this phone was good enough we never worried about it. At the end however was when we finally did upgrade. I still had issues with it pressing buttons occasionally in the night and then lighting up to drain the battery, but it wasn't a big deal because I don't need my phone during college classes so i'd just leave it to charge while i was at class and come back and THEN start using it.Well we finally started having a few problems so we decided to upgrade at last. Mine was that the pressing things on its own got excessive. It opened up games (the free ones I had) that had in game currency that would have to be paid for through your bill. Well i never bought this currency so in a sense these games were free. Well on two very unlucky occasions this phone opened up two different games (out of 10 of the free ones you can get) and purchased two different 10.00$ packages. I had been playing these games for over a year to 2 years and had most definitely completed these games and had no need to spend money on them. But Verizon didn't believe me. In fact they don't believe me when I say it would open up programs on it's own. Let alone purchase things. They did refund ONE of the purchases though to make us leave them alone. I immediately deleted all the games and that was the end of that mishap.My mom's also started having trouble with this \"ghost\" touches. Hence why we finally upgraded. While I learned to adapt to ghost touches she however could not. She got quite annoyed when she was writing a message and would have to occasionally hit clear to get rid of a ghost letter popping up. So we finally upgraded.So the greatest conclusion i can come up with for this phone is that it is an excellent basic phone and in my opinion one of the best. I'm not sure if the 10$ data plan is still mandatory but if it's not this is unquestionably a great phone and one of the best \"basic\" phones you'll ever find. I cannot confirm if it requires the 10$ data plan or not. If it does it's just a great phone but doesn't need the data plan. If it can be a basic phone I think it is one of the best based on experiences from people using roughly 10-15 other different basic phones.Just know that usage will determine it's life. So here's the sumup from my experiences and my families. It's not guaranteed but using 4 of them (3 of us and 1 replaced) gives a good idea:Excessive use: 1 year of life from touchscreenHeavy use: Will last 2 yearsModerate use: 3 years before replacingLight use: 4 yearsThis is assuming you are gentle to the touchscreen. If you are not careful to make it last it won't make it post 6 months.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS PHONE!", "Author": "THE BEST!!", "ReviewID": "R2VQWAQ3Z4GPTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WELL THE OTHER REVIEW I READ WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE AT ALL!

I'm a teenager and I absolutely loved this phone. Sure it didn't have internet on it or it wasn't an iPhone or a smartphone but I was able to easily text on it, receive picture and regular text messages easily, and talk on the phone. I never had any glitches with it and it was pretty durable after I dropped it many times over the course of 2 years. A few months ago I upgraded to an Android smart phone. All I can say is I want my Chocolate Touch back. As a college student I was ready for a new and improved phone-a smartphone. A phone that had GPS and internet to help me while I was away at college. Now, my android does all those fancy things and more but is extremely glitchy and slow. Today, the phone screen started moving up and down without me even having to touch the screen! That just tells you how spazzy it is. It started doing weird abnormal things less than a month after I first got it. Now I know smart phones will have issues but that is ridiculous. Even though the Chocolate Touch is not a smartphone, it is so much better on every level (except not being able to see conversations and autocorrect like on smartphones). It doesn't glitch and it's simple. I also rarely had to charge my Chocolate. I charged it probably once a week and I texted a lot and used my phone constantly. I'm not against smartphones-I think they are awesome (especially iPhones) but for anyone looking for a regular phone with a touch screen this is a good choice.

Pilgrim", "ReviewID": "R296OVSLBWTVYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a phone that was trendy yet not too basic looking. My last phone was one of those slide the keyboard types and the keypad was not working so texting was a real pain. This LG is a real touch phone. I need it just for texting and speaking - don't need anything more and don't need a phone with all the other features that I do not use and paying for them too. I prefer to use those other wifi options on my computer. The LG arrived 2 days after I ordered it, well before the given delivery time, and I started using it immediately. Seems as if you have to phone in an activation these days and not dial the three digit activation code but that went smoothly also. If you are not fussed about being too high tech with your phone, this is the one to choose. It is trendy enough to look like the smart phone but basic enough to do just that - basic communication.23rd April: one thing to note is that this does not have a QWERTY keyboard that is the downside. The touch screen blacks out but seems to be motion sensitive when I am needing to dial 1 for this and 2 for that in those recordings.29th April: While texting the other day I noticed that if you turn the phone 'landscape' the keyboard becomes QWERTY so my concerns about that are over. I keep discovering these things about the phone. If only it came with a manual.....it would save the time trying to learn all the functions.11th May: Just a little more information. If you purchase this phone, be sure to charge it with the cables and power cord provided. I connected mine to my laptop to charge and it did but when I disconnected it, I could not use it so I plugged in with its own power cord and that corrected the problem. I also just this minute found out that this phone is discontinued by LG. Be sure to download the drivers for it to your computer. Seems they are still providing support because the drivers are still on their website.21st June: In response to a customer question, I thought I should put this information in my main review. When I got this phone I thought I was getting a 'basic' phone for talk and text only. I am charged a $10 internet access fee because the phone supports 3G connections. I do not use it for the internet so I am not happy about that. The touch screen is slow to respond sometimes and when trying to scroll it either opens what you are touching or flies all the way through several pages bypassing the item one may be looking for.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Poor!!!!", "Author": "Myriam Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R3SLR89YCOB2GO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought and the buttons would start moving by itself.

I wanted an all-touch basic phone for Verizon (requires CDMA) and this is the ONLY phone I could find that fits the bill. I wanted the full virtual QWERTY keyboard as I text more than I talk. This being the most important factor, it holds the most weight with me. I also found this phone is the perfect size for a front pocket, looks great, and had many extras that I thought I wouldn't use but started to once I had them. I bought the Otterbox Commuter series case for it and couldn't be happier with it at first as it did everyting I wanted it to when working properly. However, after a couple weeks the virtual keyboard started malfunctioning making one text message take 5 minutes or more to send out after corrections. I looked the problem up online and it proved to be common. It seems to be luck of the draw with each individual phone. It's frustrating enough to put me back on the hunt for a different phone as I don't want to deal with a series of returns hoping to get a phone without the problem.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "verizon lg vx 8575 chocolate touch phone", "Author": "bouchra.madih", "ReviewID": "R3FGYN8CU6TOR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just got my phone chocolate , i really enjoy it i can see better the screen, and it easy to touch  yah", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE / phones ok not the best", "Author": "J.

The phone was amazing! Anyways, the phone is really sleek and thin, and pretty light. I could put it in my pocket and completely forget I had a phone in my pocket! The touch screen can be a little annoying when trying to type or sometimes even call, but that was just a minor problem. Call quality is overall good. It does get a little disoriented once in a while, and reception is hard to find in remote areas like Alaska, or even while hiking here near SFO. We got this phone with the 75 M.B./month plan so we got alot of features like mobile email and internet. But you still have to pay for things like V.Z. Navigator. But I wouldn't recommend this phone for people with the basic talk and text plan. Also, Internet with Bing was a little sluggish. All in all, this phone is a great phone.

The touch screen in very unresponsive and often freezes.  Texting is nearly impossible, as the phone does not recognizes the key you're trying to press and goes haywire easily.  Even with a stylus, the phone goes off to nearby keys and it'll take you forever to get  your message across.  Even on the home screen, it will often go everywhere except where you want it to go.  Often, I can't even get the dialpad to show up, so even a simple phone call can be difficult to make. The back lid is also difficult to put on and it doesn't seem to fit properly.  Always looks slightly lopsided and easily falls off.I also didn't care for the seller (cellphones4u) I gave them a poor feedback for packaging and poor quality product and they harrassed me, via text messages (over 40, starting at midnight on the day I wrote the feedback) and then phone calls, until I had to block their number with Verizon.  They made numerous general offers of refund in exchange for my removing the feedback, but I didn't trust them because of their unproffessional behavior and preferred keep the phone and buy a different one from somebody else. This phone has been the stragest shopping experience I've ever had with Amazon,or anyone else, and sadly it's not even worth it.  Verizon has great service, but their handsets stink, unless you want the full data plans, which I really don't need or want.This phone has been horrible.  The only thing good I can say about it is that it has FM radio and it actually takes good pictures.  But I haven't been able to download music onto it, as you'd need to subscribe to V-cast to do so. But again, that's more of a Verizon issue.  When I had AT&T;, I was able to just download it from my music files on my computer.Don't waste your money on this phone.

Came in original box with battery, wall charger, car charger, and computer connector. It's a nice looking phone, with a sharp looking screen. I had to push very hard to get the back too seat into place. The screen is controlled by pressure instead of heat sensitive. Because of that, scrolling is a challenge and can be very frustrating. If you want to search through your contacts, for example, you have to do a lot of swiping with no movement until suddenly it moves to far and you have to repeat the process to go the other direction. I have two prepaid smart phones I seldom activate, but scrolling on them is a whole lot easier, I mean smooth. I have always used basic flip phones with Verizon and decided to try a different style of phone that still worked on a basic plan. While the phone seems to work well enough, I will probably get tired of the scrolling problem eventually and try another phone. If a person isn't into the latest and greatest phones, you can get great buys thru Amazon on the older models. Update: When you go to your contacts a key board pops up. I wondered why it did, so instead of removing it like I was doing, I pushed a letter and bingo up jumped my contacts starting with that letter. That solved the scrolling issue as far as my contacts are concerned.
