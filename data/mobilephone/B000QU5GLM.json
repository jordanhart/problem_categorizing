It has features dripping off it. The PDA looks and acts exactly like an HP Ipaq. It is however a bit bulky and the buttons on both sides tend to get bumped very easy setting off a barage of functions. Functions like the lady saying \"Please Say a Command\". All in all the phone is feature-rich. It has a full qwerty keyboard that slides down. The voice commands work well when setup properly. If your address book has all the phone numbers filled in, it will ask you when you say a person name if you want to dial their home, cell or work number. A good phone and PDA that is a little bulky in todays market. Made by Samsung is a real plus.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Scam operation", "Author": "customerevaluator", "ReviewID": "R1PU9U2HSKCHXI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is obviously a scam operation -- you order presumably a phone with PDA (at a cost of close to $16) and, instead you get a 10 cent highlighter that the scam artists call \"bible highlighter\"  Wow! and Amazon is obviously cooperating with the scammers and maybe running the scam itself since similar story was found here beforehand, but I was fooled by descriptions of the phone by other \"customers\" Do not get fooled, the \"customers\" describing the \"phone\" are the scammers themselves. I have sent Amazon a letter threatening them with a lawsuit for running a scam operation. Will see what the response will be. Stay tuned!The \"rating\" is there because dumb amazon does not let you post, without the star rating", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "dont trust", "Author": "shota", "ReviewID": "R1R26G4OTH1F40", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "you will riecive the marker.i ordered this phone and riecived the marker.so choose what do you want phone or marker", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outdated cell phone", "Author": "L.

I sent it back regardless and then they didn't want to credit me for it, but Amazon came through with their buyer guarantee and I did not lose my money (except for mailing it).
