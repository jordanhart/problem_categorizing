Liang", "ReviewID": "R2C75MAUY8UV7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently purchased this phone, but I got the international unlocked version (ST21i) which is identical- just a different SKU. It is a joy to use. It cannot be overstated how refreshing it is to finally use a small handset again. The phone is snappy and quick due to the low amount of pixels it has to push. After swapping the stock launcher for something like NOVA, it is simply brilliant to use.I originally was going to use it as a backup/burner but I am seriously tempted to use it as my daily driver. The only thing holding me back is the very subpar camera. It is fixed focus, and you cannot even tap to focus/adjust the metering. Regardless, the phone itself is great and if you don't plan to take pictures anyway- I cannot recommend it highly enough.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it from this seller.", "Author": "gypsyair", "ReviewID": "R1NN94SVCYLBRV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the package came in with a broken package, the seal was good, but the bottom was opened, looked like a returned item, according to their return policy, there would be no way for me to return it to them. plus, they charged restock fee for 20%, so please think twice before you submit your order. I just made a mistake to order the wrong model, the one I want was a dual-sim model. this is my first ever review.update on 12/15/2012,Since no return is possible, I decided to try this little phone. Here is what I found:Pro: 1)speaker is great;  2)battery is good enough at 1500 mAh,  3)call quality is better than Samsung GS II.  4)the pc companion software is easy to use.Con: 1)bad design for the micro sd card slot, you need tools and 10 minutes to take the card out of it.  2)no media player recognizes the mp4 file transferred from pc to the phone, the file can only be played by the xperia gallery.  3)no flash led for the camera, picture quality is below average.  4)just like other small screen phone, typo is common. to avoid call a wrong #, use contact instead.end up buying a sony ion hspa L28h from amazon, well worth the extra $200.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awkward.", "Author": "Eyaare", "ReviewID": "R2YCG8R1I7J29X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked up a Tipo to replace a Samsung Exhibit II 4G Prepaid Android Phone (T-Mobile) I got when I signed up with T-mobile prepaid. The Exhibit is a pretty standard smartphone, so I'll be half comparing the two.Now the first thing I noticed was touch screen issues. It is not something all these phones have, but it is a common issue. Supposedly any Sony Service Center will fix this, or you can get a third party fix online pretty easily. Or you could return the phone. Apparently, though, it's more common that it should be, but not an issue you get stuck with - five minutes and I fixed mine. It's still a pretty cheap touchscreen but it works okay.It's awkward. This phone is chubby. It's short. Weird dimensions. Personally, I like it, but typing takes some time to get used to (as the keyboard is a bit more cramped) and it just feels different to hold in your hand than most smartphones. It's small and fat, which would probably work a lot better on an old Nokia than an Android smartphone. Again, I like it, it feels good to hold, but I can't say it's the most practical thing. Every once in a while I miss a key or two that I wouldn't on my old Samsung.The USB port is on the lower left of the phone, which is just weird. The phone does take a microSD card, but it's a pain to try and remove. It isn't impossible but if you plan on switching cards constantly.... try somewhere else.Additionally, the vibration is cheap. It's difficult to explain, but when you hit a character on the keyboard, the phone gives more of a rattle than the clean thud.Now for some good.The phone has a very premium feel. The Exhibit II follows the typical Samsung attitude of being cheap. It's a light, cheap plastic, something I can only assume is common within Android smartphones of the price range. The Tipo, on the other hand, has a very upscale feel to it. It just feels and looks nice all around, so it's definitely a phone you can feel good about.Tipo's Android has also been Sony'd out. Icons, backgrounds and a custom keyboard (with Swype-esque \"gesture control\") give the Tipo a very unique and premium feel software-wise as well.It's also probably louder than my laptop. There's a logo for \"XLOUD,\" an audio engine hackers are busy porting to other phones. That's a good sign, right? Either way, it makes it very easy to hear Netflix in a loud restaurant, even if the phone's size might make the image a bit hard to see.As a minor point, it's well packaged. It comes in a very small box, a little rectangle about as big as the phone itself.THE VERDICTUltimately, Tipo probably isn't the best phone for the money. It comes off as a bit of a fashion item that takes a bit of a hit in practicality for the sake of good looks. If you can get used to the size, it is a great looking phone, albeit a bit cheap under-the-skin.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incompatible with most headphones", "Author": "Ruth I.

It is on the small side (which some people might like) but that does make typing harder.

The bad news: Sony has already said they don't plan on updating this phone to Android 4.1 JB so don't expect any updates. There are no headphones supplied with the phone which make the fact that most headphones don't work with this phone even worse.

Mediocre long shots, forget zoom as all attempts result in a terrible image.  Naturally, no flash.  Surprisingly, video was not overly bad.There are so many apps forced on the buyer, preinstalled in this phone, and cannot be erased without adding special apps which present problems of their own.  It took a long time to get the constant excessive advertising stopped.The phone has a problem remembering its settings.  What worked yesterday has no clue in the settings tomorrow.Sunlight is a problem with all smartphones, but with this one you are limited to shade strictly at best.Sometimes you have to nearly whomp the touch screen to get it to respond while at other times it is overly sensitive and it is not adjustable.One shining light---conversations and volume are stellar.Overall at 2 and a quarter by 4 it is a compact unit for a smartphone.

I've had some problems,but it wasn't necissarily the equipments fault. Some horrible U.S. Gov. employees were using some of the most powerful technology and hindering the equipments possibilities especially being that i use it in some of the most amazing ways with some of the most amazing intentions improving the quality of life and helping improve the quality of life including i standing up against some of the worst individuals of the world whom are pedophiles,sexual rapists,racists,sexists and so on including some whom were and,or are U.S. Gov. employees that had and,or have access to some of the very most powerful technology that can remote control equipment and remote control individuals including humans and being that i did,do and will contribute so amazingly with such amazing intentions individuals can be more hopeful,more inspired and other correct things being that such amazing individuals exist that did,do and will risk our own only life improving the quality of life and risk our own only life helping improve the quality of life being that improving the quality of life and helping improve the quality of life during our only life is what we most amazing worldly individuals do during our life. This is a very amazing multiple tool and i've had some problems with the music quality and know it's being hindered by some U.S. Gov. employees whom are horrible and some proof is being that so very many people have a mp3 player and FM radio and yet they enjoy listening to them alot and wouldn't be so much if it were such quality as this mp3 player and this FM radio has been being forced to be by horrible U.S. Gov. employees and there are more justified reasons aswell that i know some horrible U.S. Gov. employees are unjustifiably hindering the music quality. The mp3 player and FM radio haven't been being much help and is barely loud enough to listen to especially in public areas that are loud. I've looked for a efficient application that i could try and then purchase if it's worthy and found one that seemed like it's more efficient than the installed applications and it did work alittle better,but that one wasn't working very efficiently either and was being hindered by some U.S. Gov. employees. The size and weight of this multiple tool is very efficient in some ways being that i'm very into athletics and much more correct things and is more efficient than having a big and heavy tool that would hinder me exercising efficiently,although i haven't been able to use it much while exercising and listening to music being that the mp3 player and FM radio isn't able to work properly being that it's being hindered by some horrible U.S. Gov. employees unjustifiably,but like i've stated i've used it to do some of the most amazing things with some of the most amazing intentions contributing to the quality of life improving. I don't steal music and don't record it illegally. I respect alot of music,appreciate alot of it and typically purchase it when i can. I would be very amazingly wealthy if people did,do and will do the same for my work being that my work was,is and will be some of the very most needed work of all time,some of the very most vital work of all time and some of the very most dangerous work of all time that almost no one is willing to do being that some of the worst individuals of the world had and,or have access to some of the most powerful technology that can remote control individuals and people can't just put a bullet proof vest on or hide behind a wall and be safe being that the satellite signals go through the vests and through the walls as if the vests and walls were not even there and to do it unarmed while such horrible people have the tools to remote control individuals and i don't is very dangerous,but i exist and care alot about the quality of life improving and have only one life to contribute to the quality of life improving and i did,do and will during my life because that's what i do being that i'm one of the most amazing individuals of this amazing universe that's truly very amazing,but i don't want to be paid money for the amazingly correct behaviors i've been doing and do that i'm refering about and it's more of a thankyou and your welcome towards the other greatest individuals of all time around the world. The universe has some parts of it i don't like much and yet it still is very amazing and is more amazing because of the most amazing individuals of it that help it be more amazing,that's certain. Being that the quality of life would be so enormously amazing if it were up to the most amazing worldly individuals and it isn't so very amazingly improving more and more efficiently and being that such horrible things happen it's very obvious that the most amazing individuals need help being that we don't want such horrible things to happen and yet horrible things did and do sometimes. I'm one of the most horribly treated individuals of all time and one of the most amazing individuals of all time and i don't condone such attacks as 9-11-01,Oklahoma City bombing,Virgina Technology College shooting spree and Columbine High School shooting spree and i'm one of the most horribly treated victims of all time and being that i don't condone such attacks it's proof that the very most amazing individuals even if treated so very horribly as i have been treated don't condone such attacks or they aren't truly one of the very most amazing individuals and that some of the U.S. Gov. employees that are watching over society with some of the very most powerful technology are very horrible individuals and that the amazing people of world need help. Please don't ever state it as facts that the U.S. Gov. employees whom had and,or have such access to some of the very most powerful technology that can remote control individuals are guilty of doing horrible things if they are truly not at fault or partailly at fault of those horrible things being that it would be so very disrespectful towards us amazing individuals to do so and because of many more justified amazing reasons including it even hurts the most amazing individuals whom are also real victims and hurts really amazing people of the world whom aren't such horribly treated victims too not just the horrible people by putting the horrible people in danger of being punished. We very amazing individuals are truly working on improving the quality of life and also working very hard trying to stop such horrible people that have such access to some of the very most powerful technology that can remote control individuals.

Some tools are very amazing when in very amazing individuals hands being that very amazing individuals do very amazing things being that doing very amazing things is what very amazing individuals do during the very only life each individual has and partailly why he or she are so amazing is because of the amazing things each do.
