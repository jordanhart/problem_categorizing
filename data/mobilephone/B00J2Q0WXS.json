It is easily handholdable, thin and is a wonderful smartphone. It uses a1.3 GHZ MTK6572 Cortex-A7 Dual-Core Processor. I had absolutely no hardware or hang issues with this phone. Look at my video review for a detailed review of processing power. A play of Temple Run Oz and Youtube streaming.  Screen was crystal clear. I also have lot of screen shots and they speak for themselves. I strongly urge you to go through the video review to see the power of this phone. The phones are fast getting commoditized and this phone is a proof of that.It has a 4GB ROM and a 512 GB RAM. This runs Android 4.2.2 Android. I will go into the specifications and review based on my user experience. Most of Android phones have ARM based processors. This makes sure all of the Apps in Google Play ecosystem available. The screen resolution 4.3\" IPS Multi-touch screen + 800 x 480 pixels screen resolution. It is very clear on this 4.3in screen. The phone comes with a backup battery as well. This is extremely useful when doing long travels/camping etc. Cellular frequencies are  GSM 2G 850/900/1800/1900MHz WCDMA 3G 850/2100MHz with Dual SIM, Dual standby. I am using with _TWO_ T-Mobile micro SIM. The phone has a dual SIM, both are normal SIM card can be had. This is an awesome feature lacking in most mainstream phones (at least in US). This Tagital phone supports a wireless with Wi-Fi (802.11 BGN). Has 2 cameras. You can use an extensible SD card slot (up to 32 GB) as well as cloud storage. Battery came for day with moderate usage. Battery usage really depends on how heavy you use the system. Overnight it drained very less. The capacitive touch screen was really good, pinch-zoom, highlight, Copy-Paste all worked very well.I used phone in speakerphone/head mode and had no issues. Used for long calls - incoming/outgoing, I can say with confidence it works great as I used extensively for calling for couple of days. No signal issues with T-Mobile in my area. Google synced all my contacts automatically.Speaker was loud enough. In a room, once I keep the phone in a stand it was good. FM is supported with provided audio headphone cable as well as Bluetooth is supported.Android smartphones are really customizable to your heart's content. It is here where Tagital shines. Using a native Android 4.2.2, they have achieved something at a low cost. This can have a very wide reaching audience. This phone is highly affordable and you wonder how they have pulled it off. It is a great little computer. This phone can be a great gift for students who want to develop applications on Android. Excellent choice.I tried Google Voice Search and asked \"what is capital of United States\". The voice recognition part was great and it was able to recognize and dictate the answer. I also tried Wolfram Alpha and asked bunch of questions. E.g., what is world population, what is population of China etc? The microphone picked up correctly and answered through Wolfram Alpha. Apps like Calculator, Gmail performed flawlessly.I watched multiple video through few applications. Obvious first choice was YouTube. Was able to search and watch videos. I used TwIT.TV app and watched some segments of a podcast (video streaming through Wi-Fi). Again smooth playback. Handholding is really easy given the weight of it. It was a colorful blue; no heat observed handholding the phone. It is plastic, and buttons are made of plastic. For a kid, this is perfect also though the feature set is equally appealing to an adult. I was so enamored with low cost computers in late 90s and it seems I am reliving them with phones. If you want to listen to podcasts/watch video then this is perfect. Just keep it in a stand and connect to power. See my video review to get an idea of what I am referring to.For a computer geek, it is a challenge to design something with minimal resources - screen resolution, RAM, storage, chipset. Tagital has designed a smartphone with budget conscious customer in mind. Out of the box, it worked to my satisfaction given the specification and price. Once powered on, it directly came to a working condition. No need to setup account prior to using. I signed with Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi router was in one bedroom. I configured in another room separated by two rooms. There was no issue with Wi-Fi signal. Once connected, I created a Google account as well. I generated a Application Specific password as I had 2 factor authentication. Once signed on, I updated applications like YouTube, Google Keyboard etc. I also downloaded few applications like TwitT.TV, Tetris from EA, etc. I downloaded Chrome and browsed few websites. Listened to Audio / Watched Video. Out of the box battery needed a full charge. Initially without charge, I did a video stream and wanted to see how device shutdown. Sure enough it shut down as battery drained. Powered on after charging and everything was fine.I am impressed enough at the engineering for the price/value/budget it delivers. The Cortex-A7 processor is a very energy efficient applications processor designed to enable low-cost, fully featured entry-level smart phones in addition to other low-power embedded and consumer applications.The Cortex-A7 processor is widely used as a standalone applications processor in entry level smartphone applications. It is also used as a LITTLE processor in ARM big.LITTLE processing technology - which powers high end mobile platforms today.This is from ARM specification. Tagital has pulled in many off the shelf components and assembled at a terrific value. I was particularly interested how it performs to streaming video. That is the golden test and it performed beautifully!I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00J2Q0WXS"}}
