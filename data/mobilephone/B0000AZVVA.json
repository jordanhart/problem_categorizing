It is NOT a world phone. (The European version - T610 - is a world phone.) The T616 is for the North American market. The GSM standard in The States isn't yet as far reaching so there is now an 850mhz frequency to supplement the 1900mhz. The T616 is equipped with this \"filler\" frequency as well as the standard N. American 1900mhz. The third band (1800) is used in Europe and other places as well. So, this is a tri-band phone, but it is not a world phone. True world phones us 900mhz instead of 850. 900mhz is used in Australia and New Zealand. If this important to you, DO NOT purchase a T616. World phones need 900/1800/1900. Keep in mind, most salespersons aren't aware of this.That \"said,\" the T616 has a clean, elegant design. It's very well equipped with lots of functional features. Fits anywhere. Holds a decent amount of photos, even more if you delete excess ring tones and games. Picture quality is as good as camera phone photos are. It has both bluetooth, infrared and USB connection. The phone also allows callers to conference call with up to five other parties... and even click one aside for a private while the others chat. Great feature if you need it.The screen is hard to see in the outdoor sun light.A speakerphone would be nice, but for the price and size, it's a VERY well equipped phone. As it is not a flip phone, it can be answered with one hand and the body integrity is solid.Aside from the world phone lie, this is the best of the seven mobile phones I've had over the years. Because it has the additional N. American frequency, it probably gets better GSM coverage than other tri-band GSMs with only the 1900.", "Date": "December 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "After reading all 85 reviews.....", "Author": "Tom Swift \"boy inventor\"", "ReviewID": "RLHONQ6QO3EKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "....I would have to agree with most of them.In the interest of saving you some time (if you choose not to read all of the reviews), the phone itself is of excellent quality, well-designed with aluminum and high-quality plastic construction.The T616 has almost all the features you might want, probably more than you are going to use. Lacking is speakerphone capability and the ability to see the screen in bright sunlight.One reviewer suggested getting a quality Krusell case for the phone and I agree. What nobody mentioned is that you can get free (no charge at the time this review is being written) incoming daily alerts for news, weather, sports, etc from mobile.msn.com. (Go to the web site and input your cellphone number and specify when and which alerts you want.)Of course, no phone is any better than the network it is on, and your mileage may vary. For me, living in NYC, I get excellent reception from my 27-floor apartment building. I've also used the phone upstate and had perfect reception there in what would be called \"the country\".So what's not to like?Customer service. As you will find in some of the reviews, mostly going back a few months, ATT had embarked on a project to \"upgrade\" their customer service capabilities. For _months_ nothing worked right. The customer service reps couldn't find the information you needed to know and, worse, you couldn't even access the ATT web site to find something as basic as minutes used. (Yes, you can also find minutes used through the M-mode feature...and be billed for data charges.)Now a suggestion, and I am being deadly serious, before you consider the phone and the network, I want you to make a phone call to ATT Wireless Customer Service. If you are pleased with the time that it takes to get through to a human who can answer your questions, fine. Otherwise, consider another service.I hope this review helps in you making your decision and I thank you for reading it.", "Date": "April 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "Tiny package packed with goodies", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R1IMGXOOGVHOGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My seventh mobile phone and easily one of the best. The reasonable price combined w/ the small size make this the best featured phone on the market.Sony spared no expense in giving the the T616 both bluetooth and infrared, a camera, email client, 65k colors screen. One of the neatest and rarely mentioned features is an alarm/calendar system which can be programed to alert even when the phone is turned off. Save your juice and still get. Of course it has all the too fancy ring tones and games which only take up memory and might be better in a teen flip phone.The design - modern, sleek and simple. I'm not a clamshell fan, so a small, solid, one-piece unit with a large color screen is right up my alley.On the down side, AT&T's service does not allow for one-touch voicemail pick up. You must enter your password w/ evey call. A security feature, I guess, but annoying. Additionally, the screen is difficult to read in bright sunlight. My only other gripe is that there's no speaker phone. Sony was clearly going for sleek and small and for the money and size, how much more can one expect?As for AT&T's service, keep in mind quality of service depends on the region you live in and where in the region you live. Every company has cities where their service is great and where it is lowsy. So these sweeping generalizations about AT&T's service should be taken with a grain of salt. Additionally, this phone operates on a GSM network which isn't yet as all-encompassing as TDMA/CDMA... but unlike the 'DMA's allows for international use. So, whether T-Mobile or AT&T, GSM service is GSM service. On that note, only AT&T offers both GSM and DMA, though the Ericsson is designed only for GSM.Be ye warned, although this is a tri-band phone, it is not a world phone. World phones include 900/1800/1900 mhz frequencies. The T616 carries 850 in place of 900. 850 is a second N. American frequency at the expense of the standard 900mhz which covers Australia and New Zealand. If you're jonesing for this unit, the T610 substitutes 850 w/ the standard 900mhz.I highly recommend this phone for style, quality and features.

Generally speaking, T616 is better suited for US residents than T610, which had generally worse RF reception on 1900 MHz GSM than T68i that it replaces. T616's reception should be comparable to T68i now. It is worth noting, however, T616 drops the 900 MHz GSM band popular in Europe while adding 800 MHz GSM.While T68i wasn't exactly lauded for RF reception quality, it was adequate. In areas with good to excellent signals (3 to 5 bars), T616 should be equally capable of high quality phone conversations. But deep inside the building where 1900 MHz signals have trouble penetrating or in areas where signal is low, T616 will generally perform poorly. For instance, Nokia 3650 sounded fine in areas where T616 stuttered or dropped out entirely.Signal quality aside, T616 is a good phone. If anything, it is arguably one of the best looking phones. While slightly larger than T68i, it is still strikingly thin and tiny. Turn the phone on, however, you may be disappointed by dim LCD output. It is virtually unusable outdoor. You must vary the angle of the phone to see anything even with backlight turned on.The UI sports pretty icons rendered with rich color. However, it remains largely unchanged from T68i, which could be positive to former Sony Ericsson users, but disappointing for those wanting latest and greatest. Worse, rapid key strokes will cause T616 to lag quite a bit.It would be unfair to ignore T616's greatest asset: Bluetooth. Whereas Nokia and other manufacturers add Bluetooth as a mere marketing feature (poor Bluetooth signal quality, incomplete support for many Bluetooth devices), Sony Ericsson took the time to do it right. It will sync and communicate with pretty much all applicable Bluetooth devices out there with virtually all the functionalities intact. It also syncs beautifully with Apple's iSync software.Although built-in camera results in decent enough pictures for MMS or quick email, it will not replace standalone digital camera. Considering 99.9% of the camera phones are also poor, I will not single out T616 for this weakness.It is worth noting that upcoming T630 will fix much of T616's ongoing issues: much brighter LCD, larger keys, less slipper body, and improved RF reception.

After much research, I chose the Sony Ericsson T616 because of it's rich feature set (camera phone, bluetooth, infrared, mMode, joystick navigation) and teensy weensy size. I had seen the model in an AT&T Wireless store, but when it arrived from Amazon I was still surprised at just how small and compact the phone really is. I immediately started exploring the phone's features and was very impressed with the beautiful LCD, polished interface and nice features and games.Buzzkill time...when I was done playing with the non-phone features and started making calls I got complaints from the other end about poor voice quality. And that was when I actually had enough of a signal to make a call. I'm in the greater Boston area and was surprised by the lack of strong coverage. I would rarely have more than 2 out of 5 bars of signal strength any place I took this phone. Granted, this is a knock on AT&T and not the T616. Every time I looked at, and held, the phone I made up reasons to justify keeping it. Unfortunately, a nice phone with poor service is really a poor phone.

I can't get my Outlook to sync with the phone using Bluetooth, after SEVERAL fruitless tech support calls and going over every manual with a fine-tooth comb.2.  Signal is awful.

They were both great phones for their time, and the T616 is pretty much in the same class.As soon as I bought my PowerBook two years ago, I thought it would be neat to be able to use Address Book for my cell phone. When Apple released Bluetooth support, I bought a dongle and got the T68i. I loved it. It was small, it was sleek, it had a color screen, and there was never anything I couldn't do with it. It had one fatal flaw: A volume slider on the left hand side. Which broke off. And which was going to cost $100 to repair.So I bought the T616, and was awestruck as soon as I got it. I'm kind of a gadget fanatic, and this phone is great for me. The screen is amazing, beautifully crisp and colorful. The body is only a tiny bit bigger than the T68i, but actually feels a little smaller. The Java games support probably strikes most people as slow and mundane, but I love the idea, and the games available for the T616 are better than I ever saw for the T68i. And of course, it can still synchronize with iCal and Address Book, something I love. The camera is kind of fun, even if the lens is awful. I have no idea what use a camera which can only take (approx.) 300x200 photos is, but hey, why not?I can't speak to mMode because AT&T;'s pricing is beyond ludicrous. Although if they'd ever just get Mapquest service I might just pay for their insane $8 plan (the $3-plus-per-kilobyte plan is a major rip-off). I'm told the phone does not have the greatest WAP browsing, although having used the T68i's once or twice I can't imagine anything feeling sluggish in comparison.The OS is actually much easier than most people think, once you get the hang of it. The trick is to remember where the icons go and to always check the contextual menus. Once you do that, you can do almost anything without thinking very hard on the T616.There is only one thing I dislike about the phone and its design. The fact that there are two buttons which can SOMETIMES have overlapping functions ('Back' and either the left or right side top button, depending) and that the left and right side buttons don't have predefined functions drives me insane. I'm always clicking on the wrong one, with, yes, predictable hilarity resulting.I'll give the T616 a two-thumbs-up review any day of the week.

It is smaller than my old flip phone and does not have any antenna to poke out.  I'm a bit concerned that the screen will get scratched over the years.I use Microsoft Outlook on my work ThinkPad which has built in Bluetooth.  Once I figured out that you configure the bluetooth as a serial device, I can now sync my contacts, calendar and task list with my phone.  This has allowed me to ditch my Palm and still have reminders for all my meetings.  The phone has a distinct ring as a meeting reminder.  It is a bit of a pain to add a meeting or task to the system, I'm not very fast entering text using the key pad, so I mostly use it as a read-only device.I have configured and used the wireless internet, it was a pain to setup and Cingular was no help.  I eventually found instructions on someone's personal web site.  I do not see myself using the web directly through the phone more that once in a great while.  The WAP browser is so limiting, every password you type takes a minute to enter via the key pad and the amount of info on the screen is tiny.  But if you need to check a flight status or movie schedule, you can if you are patient.I have a bluetooth IPAQ on order which may pair with the phone to make an acceptable browser, email platform.  The main capability I want is to be able to pull up an occasional email, the phone allows this in theory but sifting through my huge volume of email (50-60 per day) to find the ones of interest on that little screen is not practical.The reception works seems about as good as any other phone.I don't have any problem hearing but I understand the complaints that others have, the phone is so small that when the phone is up to your ear the microphone is against your cheek.The camera is very limited but it entertains my kids (I did not really want a camera phone so I don't care much about the quality).I have played with voice dialing and it works but is tedious to set up and I always feel stupid talking to the machine in public but in the car it is handy to call home without searching through the menus.One complaint is that whenever I drop the phone, it has fallen out of my shirt pocket a few times, the SIM gets dislodged and a message appears telling me that the SIM has dislodged \"turn the phone off and on\" but it won't let me power down the phone so I need to remove the battery to reset it.  The good news is the fall does not seem to damage the phone and once I reset it, everything works as normal (no data is lost).Some day I hope to have time wo write some JAVA utilities for the phone.  I'm a software engineer by trade.  Ericsson apears to be very open in allowing others to write tools for the phone.  You can download all of the developers kits from their site.  I beleive most other phones lock the average user out by charging for the info or by \"locking\" the phone to \"uncertified utilities\".  Even if you never plan to write your own software, I would not be supprised to see a large number of free applets come out for this phone over the next year based on the open-ness of the system.Pros:Good form factorBlue tooth is very handy for connecting to a computerSyncs well with outlookOpen programmes interfaceCons:A pain to set up for wireless data and bluetooth syncing.Open screen may scratchLimited web browsing support (more a function of all WAP phones)Needs the battery removed each time you drop it.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great phone!", "Author": "A.

It did freeze up on me again when I tried selecting a WAP option from one of the menus.  I also get a message periodically saying that the SIM card has been dislodged, and in order to fix that, I have to turn the phone off and back on again. Other than that, the phone has worked fairly well.  The back cover is very difficult to get off, though, in order to access the battery and SIM card.So far, I get good reception. I haven't had a call dropped yet. I've called AT&T; 3 times so far. The first time was when the phone first froze up.  (Yes, each time I called AT&T;, I was on hold for a very very long time). The lady almost immediately said it was the phone and not AT&T;'s fault. She was very snotty and short with me.  The 2nd time I talked w/ someone at ATT was to port my number. Surprisingly, this took only 2 days to port my old number - that was a pleasant ATT experience.  The third time I called, it was about my first ATT bill, and the lady was very friendly and helpful and answered my questions with a pleasant attitude.The phone is nice and small and almost plane, but I like that a lot.

The Sync for addresses works, but unfortunately the formatting of the files means that businesses are listed separately from individuals, and many entries do not end up in proper alphabetical order.  Advanced features like email and Internet access are essentially worthless, and cost extra; in no way can they compare with a laptop computer.

I use the email function for the phone as much as I do making calls, and Mmode is kind of a joke.

Too many gaps in documentation. Worse, AT&Ts; website provides no help, the OEM for the sync software (Extended Systems) refers you to Sony Ericsson for help, and the Sony Ericsson help desk in Toronto was counterproductive. Their suggestion was to sync one record at a time! And they were rude when I suggested there was probably a way to sync all records at once.Screen is very hard to read outdoors. This is probably the biggest flaw, and one which may be beyond the tolerance of many people...2mb of memory is not enough. You can store a fair number of contacts (500-ish) but not enough pictures, even after deleting all the nonsense pics/sounds/themes they include with the phone.The web browser function is ok on the sites formatted for the cell phone's screen.The \"Find Top Ten Best Near Me\" function is hysterical. This will find the Top Ten, say, mexican restaurants near you, based on the position of the nearest cell tower, which is probably within a half mile or less. I was in Plano, TX and had it find the Top 10 mexican restaurants nearest me...there are probably 30 within 10 miles, but the closest it came up with was 15 miles away in downtown Dallas...even funnier, it was The Mansion at Turle Creek! The Mansion is easily the costliest restaurant in Dallas; it is famous for having invented \"Southwest Cuisine\" but it is as far from being a mexican restaurant as, say, Spago's is from being a NJ pizzaria.Voice command - To be fair, I first programmed my voice commands in a noisy hospital waiting room.

I don't understand the attraction of flip phones, so this tiny little gem from a consumer electronics giant is a welcome addition to a marketplace that offers the likes of Nokia 3595 (ugly!). However, I might choose another phone if given the choice.The color screen is fairly large and very readable. The sound \"system\" is wholly satisfying; you can hear the sweeping grandeur of a waltz. By simply posting a midi file to an ftp server, I was able to set it as my ringtone. It was quite necessary as the factory defaults are sad, incomparable to Nokia's. The menu system is clean and easy to learn. You may be surprised at first at the tiny buttons, but you'll easily get used to them and won't have trouble with wrong keypresses except for the joystick button.Games included on the phone are alright and you may decide to keep a few. The quality of the camera is good for the phone, but don't epect more. Samsung probably has a better alternative there.So far, so good.A few serious defects mar an otherwise excellent product, however. Most importantly, the maximum sound level is teeny in your average environment. Unless you spend your day at home, you'll prolly miss calls. The vibration is inadequate prolly due to the tiny size of the phone, and even in an empty pocket will only slightly alert you to an incoming call or alarm -- and I mean slightly  The phone won't even vibrate when you receive a message, for which you can't set your own ringtone. The alarm sound level is audible only when you hold the phone up, a strange decision by the phone designers. These notification problems make it almost useless to find a good ringtone (cuz others can't hear it), and will most likely make you miss calls. On this alone you should prolly avoid the phone.Also, I conditioned the battery but it runs for only one or two days with minimal usage. I've to see if I can convince Sony or AT&T; Wireless (tough luck as it took them 18 days to send me my phone). The signal is great and has much improved since August 2003 and my brother has had great experience with AWE in Philly while I've greatly surprised by the service in NYC. Customer service lags, tho.I don't know if this is a real problem, but the phone rarely shows even one out of five bars in signal strength. A Nokia 6800 (frustrating user interface) shows great signals in the same locations at the same time. If you hold your hand across the top of the phone, it'll usually show two bars...I haven't had real trouble with any noise during calls or making calls, however.Another thing the phone misses is a real alarm system. You can only set one one-time  and one recurrent alarm. You can set one-time event notifications in the calendar, but this is wholly insufficient with a phone that can run Java games.  Voice control is hard to configure, while it's all too easy to move the joystick in the wrong direction while at standby mode and get connected to the internet. Over time this will cost money.All in all, this is a great looking phone with great musical abilities that are undermined by poor sound levels, few alarm possibilities and possibly low battery life, which I'm not yet sure about.", "Date": "January 14, 2004"}, {"Title": "Feature Packed Phone", "Author": "Plsailboy \"Michael\"", "ReviewID": "R1T53YY7B8RG2J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The feature packed t616 cell phone from sony ericsson packs so many features into such a small place that you wonder how the makers did it.

For me, the main advantages of the phone are its very small size and the very hefty battery life. I feel like I really do get several hours of actual talk time before needing to charge.

The rings are generally loud enough to be heard under most circumstances, and the vibrate is strong enough that I can feel it even when I'm carrying the phone in a waist pouch.That said, I'll reiterate things such as you can't read the screen AT ALL in sunlight. And the UI design is a bit odd. It takes a lot of effort to do simple things like turn off the alarm clock before its gone off. You can't program any quick dial buttons which is annoying since I only call about three different people on a regular basis.

The display is pretty hard to see during the daylight, that can't be denied.  I'm ok with that though.  What I don't like is how, especially with the special ring tones, the phone will receive a call, light up, and then wait 5 seconds before it makes any noise or vibration.  It's not a big deal if you're looking at your phone, but if it's in your pocket, it's already been ringing for 1 or 2 rings on the other person's side before you even know you've got a call.  Also, it has flat out crashed on me a handful of times in the last 6 months of ownership.  When I say crash, think of when computers crash - it won't do anything until I take the battery out to turn it off, but it back and then turn it back on.  I've also had intermittent problems with buttons not working unless I press them at just the right angle and things like that.Last week though, the thing went completely dead.  I couldn't turn it on, it didn't light up when it was on its charger, nothing worked.  After a few days, it started working again.  Maybe I have a loose connection somewhere, I don't know.  AT&T sent a replacement overnight to me for a twenty five dollar processing fee - although they overnighted it to the wrong address (due to a really bad customer service person on the phone) and I got it 6 days later.Anyway, the Bluetooth is cool, it talks to my computer and transfers contacts and calendar items and pictures and all sorts of stuff.

I've had AT&T; for years, though this was my first digital. I've always had great customer service from them ....T616 Positives:- Beautiful looking, small, lightweight.- Display has great color graphics and themes.- Bluetooth synching my contacts via isync on my mac was fantastic. See below for limitations though.- Bluetooth for internet access: My friend uses his to access the internet via his Powerbook. When I saw that was when I wanted to buy this phone! But he has Sprint with unlimited data. AT&T; doesn't offer an unlimited data plan. I imagine with AT&T; internet access could get pricey.- Fun taking my friends photos (yes, grainy, but fine for a phone) and and assigning them to their contact info so that their photo would turn up when they called.- Good loud rings, sounds great though the first ring is softer.- AT&T; customer service and return policy.However, other than that, this phone was pretty limited:- It took quite a bit of manipulation to get my mac's address book fields matching (several syncs to see what went where and reorganizing the contacts on my computer that were going into the phone) and it does not store addresses. Limited length on what you can save in the Calendar or transfer from iCal. Not a PDA replacement by any means.-The keys are so small (and this phone was the same dimensions as my last phone) I was constantly hitting the wrong ones. Forget texting or trying to enter an appointment.- Display: Tiny display fonts very hard to read. Agree with other reviewers too that its unreadable in daylight.- Slow response time. I like that you can press the joystick to select (rather than having to use a different key like you do on Nokias), to search for a name in a big contact list is slow... it hestiates between each step.- You have to have it positioned exactly right on your ear to hear what the other person is saying, so each call is this moving around the phone to get it just right. Once you do that though, the sound quality is crystal... but what good is that if you aren't getting your calls or can't make them?- Battery life. I am a very light user and had to charge it every other day at least. Other phones I've had could go many more days.- I couldn't get the phone to send pictures to anyone. Friend on Sprint couldn't get his photos to send to me either. Couldn't figure out how to bluetooth them into my computer but didn't try too hard.- Navigation system is counter-intuitive, though I was using this phone for 28 days and read the manual. To lock the keys if the phone has to go to sleep requires pressing a key to wake it up, then clearing what you've pressed, then pressing two more keys. Everything took more steps than my previous phones, and in the end the annoyance was too great.- Reception was awful compared to all my previous phones. Sitting side by side with someone also on AT&T; digital, their phone (Nokia 6800) got two bars and mine was red with no service. This was in LA, NY and Boston metro areas.

So, not only can I not receive phone calls on my new phone yet (I have to carry around the old one with my still-active T-Mobile service), but I'm also being billed by both vendors!  I cannot believe that AT&T is already billing me fully on half a service!To give you an idea of my AT&T wireless nightmare: I've tried to call their PAG (Portability Administration Group) at least 20 times in the past month.  Most of the time, I can't even get through and give up after 2 hours on hold.  But on the 5-6 occasions that I have gotten through and explained my situation, I've always been assured that the problem would be rectified soon.  Well, that has yet to be the case.  As I speak, I'm on hold yet again - this time, I'm going to insist on talking to a supervisor (but I don't have much hope that this will make any difference :-(  So, I'm stuck in this hell hole.When I called customer service to find out whether I could cancel my service - they told me that I would probably be charged an early cancellation fee since the service WAS activated (despite the fact that I can't receive phone calls on AT&T WS) and that I would have to write a dispute letter when I do get charged.In summary: AT&T Wireless may be ok for totally new activations without number porting, but they've got to have the most inept number portability group among all the major carriers (for comparison, a friend had his number ported from Cingular to T-Mobile within a couple days!)", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Hotness", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3PZE59456LASJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgrading from the simplistic Nokia phone to the more complex Sony Erricson was the best thing that I ever experienced...phone wise.

Just ask a cs rep.Positives.-Nice Design, compact easy to carry.-Pleasing looks.-Attractive Display.-Nice standby time.-Sturdy design.  Feels solid.Negatives.-Slow button response and sometimes no response.-The end call button and back button are different buttons.  So when ending a call and then starting a new one or using a different function, you have to press 2 different buttons to get to the main menu.  With the slight delay in button response and sometimes the buttons don't click when you think they do, it means you have to be looking at the screen otherwise you'll end up in a completely wrong menu.  No easy navigation simply by getting used to the feel or buttons.-This leads into the next and most frustrating problem.  Glare.  The phone is impossible to see in any sort of overcast or bright situation.  And in Seattle, overcast is every day of the year.  I've put away my phone in disgust many times because i simply can not read who's calling or can't see who to call or what menu i'm on.  Even if you're covering the phone with one hand it's very hard to read.-This would be less stressful if it had a true speed dial.  But the only 1 button speed dial is to voicemail.  All other speed dials are 2 buttons.  And speed is definately not the key word.  Apon starting a speed dial... it takes almost 5 seconds to even start dialing.-A typical calling situation would be something like this.  Grab the phone press 2 buttons to unlock, 2 buttons to speed dial, wait 5 seconds for it to start dialing... wait a little more... look at my phone, cover my phone with other hand and look harder at my phone... realize I still haven't even dialed because one of the buttons didn't respond or it stored a random number before it locked, then get locked out again and start over.-Photo quality is weak.  Photos will look good on screen then look awful when sent.-Not enough memory and slow storage.  If you use the camera, you will constantly be deleting text messages, photos and sounds to make room.  And when you do take a picture... it will take 10-15 seconds to take the next picture.-Poor to average reception quality.  It's nice to carry an internal antenna phone, but not to talk on one.

I also conditioned the battery and did an optimized charge.  I am lucky to get 2 days out of it which is kind of disappointing.  Another little picky thing I don't like is the battery icon.  When the battery is fully charged, you see a battery icon that is green, but only half green up and down (I've let it charge for 2 days and can only achieve the half full green icon).  When the power starts to deplete, you see an icon where the meter changes from left to right and then the color changes to yellow etc.  What kind of goofy icon shows a full battery with a half full green icon?  Just plain stupid if you ask me.Also, don't plan on looking at the screen in sunlight.  You can't read a thing on it.

That is the only thing that has saved me is that I couldn't bring myself to sign the contract.
