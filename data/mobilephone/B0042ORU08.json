{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Durable, rugged world phone with only a few minor quirks", "Author": "Pete S.", "ReviewID": "RZ776MUJJNLXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Be sure to check out the updates at the bottom of the review!)This phone is built like a tank. It's ruggedized, water- and dust-resistant, yet is pleasant to use.I've sorted my various comments on this phone into numbered sections below:Package Contents:The package includes the phone, a manual each for English and Spanish, an AC wall charger (a two-prong CEE 7/16 Europlug, supports 120-240 volts and 50-60 Hz, also comes with a Europlug-to-US-plug adapter in the shipping box), and micro-USB stereo headphones with a built-in microphone (for phone use) and an integrated antenna for the phone's FM radio function.Data/Charging Connections:The phone can charge with any standard microUSB power source. I have connected it to my PC, a different brand USB charger, and the phone's included charger and all of them were able to charge it without complaint. Please note that the trim around the charging port on the phone is such that standard-thickness microUSB plugs may have some difficulty fitting. The included charger has a permanently-attached microUSB plug with much thinner trim so it fits properly. A standard-thickness microUSB cord I had lying around the house was able to fit for charging and data-transfer, but it didn't seem as securely attached as the thin-trim one. Using the Samsung Kies software (downloadable from their website) and the standard-thickness microUSB cable, I was able to connect the phone to my computer, charge the battery, and synchronize contacts.There is no need to buy the special \"Samsung Data Cable\" listed at the time of this writing under the \"Frequently Bought Together\" section for this phone. That cable is not microUSB and will not connect to any port on this phone. That cable seems to be for older, non-microUSB Samsung phones and is not needed for this phone.To use the microUSB port one needs to open a small, gasketed flap on the side of the phone. Thus, the phone is not dust- or water-resistant while plugged in.Call Quality/ReceptionCall quality on T-Mobile in the US is quite good. The built-in earpiece in the phone produces crisp, clear sound. The microphone is also good (somewhat better than other mobile phones I've used), but is not on-par with landline phones. Considering that the microphone is water-resistant, this is is not a major problem.Reception in the Phoenix and Tucson (Arizona, USA) metropolitan areas on T-Mobile is excellent and comparable to other phones. There are a few dead spots on the interstate between the two cities, but this is also the case with other major networks like Sprint and Verizon and other model phones. Outside my apartment in Chandler (suburb of Phoenix), the phone displays \"full bars\" of service. Inside, it is about half of the outside coverage, depending on which room I'm in. Call quality in either case is the same.The phone supports four GSM bands: 900/1800 MHz (used in much of the world) and 850/1900 MHz (used in the US and Canada), and so can be used anywhere in the world that has GSM service for voice, SMS, EDGE, and GPRS. Additionally, the phone supports UMTS 900/2100 MHz for faster 3G data speeds. If my understanding of frequency allocations is correct, 900/2100 MHz UTMS service is not available in North America and nearly all of South America and so this phone is not capable of 3G data speeds in these areas.I'll be moving to Switzerland in the next few weeks and will update the review accordingly to see if UMTS service is available there. (It is! See update #1 at the bottom.)Battery Life:Battery life seems excellent, going several days of light-to-medium usage between charges. The phone comes with a 1300mAh battery.User Interface:The rubberized, water-resistant keypad is easy to use. There is a very slight raised dot on the \"5\" key to help identify it by touch, but it is subtle. Other than the keypad (which includes the directional button for navigating the interface), there are three external buttons: the two-button rocker switch (used for turning the volume up and down and for zooming with the built-in camera) and the LED flashlight button. The flashlight button is not affected by the \"keypad lock\" option in software, and so may turn on while in one's pocket (this has happened several times to me, though I usually catch it before it drains more than one bar from the battery).The top of the phone has the LED flashlight and a built-in loop for connecting the phone to a strap or other restraint (nice touch!). The loop also extends to the back of the phone, which has the camera (no flash for the camera), the speaker (for speakerphone, ringing, etc.), and the locked door for the battery compartment/SIM card/microSD card. When viewing the front of the phone, the flashlight power switch is on the top of the right edge of the phone, while the volume rocker switch is on the top of the left edge.The display can appear somewhat dim in bright sunlight, and is completely unreadable in sunlight if one is wearing sunglasses (tested with non-polarized sunglasses). The screen is perfectly readable indoors or at night. The brightness control is entirely manual: it will not auto-dim indoors, or automatically brighten outdoors like some other phones. There are options to adjust the time the backlight of the keypad and screen stays on. The menu system is usually quite good, but there are some quirks: the Bluetooth settings is listed under the \"Apps\" menu, while the GPS feature is under \"Settings/Phone\".The \"Apps\" menu can have items added based on your carrier and SIM card. For example, my Orange Switzerland SIM card adds an \"Orange\" App to the menu, which includes things like information about sports, finance, etc. while my T-Mobile USA SIM does not.The very top of the main menu shows the signal meter, EDGE/UMTS status, and indicators for Bluetooth (enabled/disabled/transferring data), microSD (indicates whether the card is present and flashes when accessing the card), current sound profile (Normal, Silent, etc.), a battery meter, and the clock (hours/minutes only; seconds are not displayed). The remaining portion of the main menu can be customized in various ways. It comes by default with the \"Smart home\" enabled (which includes options for text messaging, contacts, displaying the calendar, etc. on the main menu), though one can switch to one of several simple clock displays if one wishes.Language/Localization:The phone supports numerous languages, including German, English, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Dutch, and several other languages I do not recognize (each of the languages is displayed in that language). As the phone seems to be made for the European market, the English text has a distinctly British feel (with text such as \"Synchronise\" rather than the US spelling of \"Synchronize\", along with \"Organiser\" instead of \"Organizer\"). There is no option to use a localized dialect of a language (that is, there is no US English option).The date format can be set to several options: DD/MM/YYYY (Europe), MM/DD/YYYY (US), YYYY/DD/MM, YYYY/MM/DD. It can display the time in 12- or 24-hour modes. There is the option of automatically setting the date, time, and time zone from the network; doing so also respects your date/time display preferences. One odd language quirk: The \"Downloads\" option on the main menu always displays its contents in Spanish, regardless of the chosen language (I've tried both English and German).Due to the various formatting of phone numbers used worldwide, the phone does not attempt to display phone numbers (either dialed directly or when stored in the contact list) in any particular style. For example, if one wished to dial toll-free directory assistance in the US, US-specific phones would display \"1-800-555-1212\". This phone simply displays the numbers as \"18005551212\" with no formatting.Navigation:The phone has a built-in GPS receiver which can, after acquiring satellites, display your latitude, longitude (both in DDD.DDDDD\u00b0 format), and altitude. The altitude is only displayed in meters, and there is no option for displaying it in feet if one wishes. It takes about two minutes to acquire satellite signal and acquire a position fix while outside with a clear view of the sky. It does not appear that the phone caches GPS data between uses (presumably it completely powers off the GPS receiver when not in use), as if one gets a fix, closes the GPS application, and immediately re-opens it, the phone still needs to go through the time-consuming acquisition process again. Unless one has a map with detailed latitude/longitude grid squares, the GPS receiver is useless for navigation. It does not allow one to enter waypoints or coordinates as a destination, but simply displays its own current location. The phone supports J2ME (Java Micro Edition, for mobile devices) applications and there are several fairly barebones navigation applications available for J2ME-enabled phones, but they don't compare to standalone GPS receivers or smartphones in terms of functionality.There is an included Google Maps application (as well as Facebook and Twitter), but this requires use of data services which I do not have on my T-Mobile subscription, so I have not yet tested them.The phone also has an application for accessing the built-in magnetic compass. After a simple calibration procedure (turn the phone as depicted on the screen), the compass is reasonably accurate. However, it is extremely basic and not really suitable for serious navigation.Bluetooth:Bluetooth connections are easy to set up, and I was able to transfer 144 name cards and several digital photos to and from my other mobile phone in about two minutes. Due to the lack of a data plan on my carrier, I have not yet tested the phone as a data modem. Transferring lots of photos to/from the phone is relatively slow, as the phone does not support the latest higher-speed Bluetooth standards. If you don't mind waiting, it's perfectly functional.Text Entry/Messaging:In addition to regular text entry, the phone also supports T9 predictive text entry which can make text messaging faster. Not all text entry fields support T9: composing an SMS message does, but entering names into the contact list does not.The phone can store 1300 SMS messages on internal memory. My T-Mobile SIM can only hold 30. It does not appear that one can store text messages on the microSD card.microSD Storage:I installed a Kingston 8GB microSD card in the phone (it fits under the battery, next to the SIM card, rather than in a slot on the side of the phone). After being formatted by the phone, I am able to access the card as expected (saving photos, sound, etc.)From the box, most of the phone's internal memory is filled with the included ringtones, images, themes, etc. I highly recommend using a microSD card.Multimedia:The phone has a simple MP3 player, which works as expected. It's not really a substitute for a proper music player. The phone can play MP3 ringtones. The built-in 2MP camera is ok, but not great. There's no flash for the camera.Interestingly enough, the phone has a built-in FM radio. The antenna is built into the included microUSB stereo headphones/microphone cable, and so the radio is useless if one doesn't have the original headphones (which are not bad). It can auto-scan for active frequencies, so one doesn't have to scan through static. It can also record audio from the FM radio to a sound file on the phone's internal memory or microSD card. If the station broadcasts additional data (e.g. station name, artist, song name, etc.) on a sub-channel, the phone will display this information.Data:The phone has a basic web browser and other data functions. It's no replacement for a smartphone or computer. I would not recommend using this phone for data-intensive functions as you're likely to be disappointed.Conclusion:This phone is only slightly larger than most phones and is built much more ruggedly. It's reasonably priced for an unlocked, unbranded quad-band phone, and appearance-wise it looks nice (it doesn't look as \"chunky\" as other ruggedized phones).It's a refreshing change from feature-rich yet fragile smartphones with a one-day battery life. It won't win any beauty or feature contests, and there's a few minor quirks as noted above, but this is a solid, everyday phone.==========Update #1: August 27, 2011: Greetings from Switzerland! As expected, this phone works great on the various Swiss networks (I've used it on Orange and Sunrise, and it works on both their GSM and UMTS/3G networks without problems. It's a shame that the phone won't work on UMTS frequencies in the US.). Call quality is good on either network, and battery life is in the \"more than one week\" range (though I habitually charge my phone when it reaches about 1/3rd charge, just so I'm never stuck with a dead battery).As a test, I immersed the phone in a sink filled with water for several minutes, and the phone worked as normal (though it did bubble ominously for a short while; this is normal, and is just air bubbles between the waterproof inside and the outer shell escaping). Similarly, I've made calls in the rain without any problems.The built in camera is not bad for a phone camera. Nothing to write home about, but I'm satisfied.My requirements for a phone are simple: place and receive calls, send and receive the occasional text message, and occasionally use the camera when I don't want to carry my \"Look at me! I'm a tourist!\" Nikon DSLR (or when it's raining out). I don't browse the internet, check my email, or do anything like that with my phone. For these purposes, I've been quite satisfied with this phone.==========Update #2: May 14, 2013: As part of a recent university-sponsored research expedition, I traveled to the desert of Oman to search for meteorites. Naturally, I took my phone with me. As expected, the phone was completely resistant to the rather extreme environment: days were hot and dusty with kilometers of foot searches (the phone was in my pocket) and car searches (the phone was in the cupholder, bouncing around), nights were cool with moisture condensing on exposed surfaces (we slept outside and the phone was exposed to the open air at night and was completely soaked with dew in the morning), high winds and dust storms, etc. The only improvements I'd like to see is some sort of inductive charging so one doesn't need to open the sealed charging port in order to charge the phone -- I had to charge the phone in the vehicle's glove compartment to minimize exposure to dust while charging -- and support for higher-current charging. The phone only charges at 500mA, so it can take several hours to fully charge the battery. If it could charge at 1A or 2A it would dramatically speed up the charging process.It's had no problem charging off of both the official Samsung wall charger, third-party (both wall-socket and car chargers), and improvised 5V DC power supplies I cobbled together in the lab (some capacitors and a 7805 linear regulator or a switch-mode regulator with the associated external components work well) when I let the battery run down by mistake.The phone also continues to work well in Switzerland, both in my lab and outdoors. It has survived (brief) splashes of liquid nitrogen (about -200C/-320F) in the lab and longer-term exposure to -10C to -20C temperatures outside. Even after several years of fairly heavy use the phone appears to be in good shape: there are a few scuffs around the outside of the phone, a few scratches on the screen (though less than expected. None affect the visibility of the screen.), and the silver coating on the rim of the directional pad button is beginning to wear off, exposing a copper-colored material underneath (though it requires a close look to see). The battery still holds a charge for over a week on UMTS/3G, with an extra day or two if the UMTS/3G radio is disabled and one only uses GSM. The seals are still intact and the number keys have not worn off. It's definitely not in \"like new\" condition anymore, but I'd definitely rank it as \"good or better\" condition.Conclusion: this is one rugged phone and has held up well to some punishing service over the years. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Built like a vault.", "Author": "T. Patocka", "ReviewID": "R203UOO7A5LRUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I have only had this telephone for one week I have already used it in a variety of environments, wet and dry, and it does deliver as promised. This phone is solid, well constructed and can stand up to the elements.  As for features, I don't want to get into too much detail as there are plenty of other resources online that you can use to find out the technical specs of this device.  As for usability, in terms of signal quality, clarity and basic interaction with the phones operating system, I fell like this phone should last out my newly renewed 2 year contract and do what it is designed to do, function well in all environments.  I was just coming off a contract with a Blackberry 8900, which I loved, but just didn't like paying for the extra data plan on when I decided to go smart phone cold turkey.One of the things I did like about this model was how the interface was very similar to some of the Nokia's that I had previously owned.  This is the type of OS that only takes a click or two to access exactly what you need and with enough practice, can get where you want to by memory without even looking at the screen.While we are at it, let's talk about the screen real quick.  There are a ton of adjustments that you can make to the background, fonts, layouts, size etc. and I find the screen easy to read and very sharp...indoors.  Outside, the screen can be a bit darker than I prefer but I wouldn't say it is totally unreadable, but is a bit dark, even with the brightness turned to max.  I have heard some people say that this is a deal-breaker with this phone and if you live in a bright and sunny climate, you may want to reconsider, especially if you are outdoors a lot.  I didn't feel like docking this phone a star because of this flaw because to me, as long as the screen is usable, I am happy.  Like I said, indoors, the screen is sharp, colorful and can be configured in a variety of ways.What I can't report on, however, is the efficiency of the web browser as I don't have any type of data plan that I can use without being charged. Like I said, I went smart phone cold turkey but I would imagine on a 3G network this browser would handle most basic cell phone apps just fine.  It does have some options to set up e-mail accounts on it but I just use it for its basic organizer tools and phone calls.I do recommend that you check out the youtube videos on this phone.  For me, the proven durability was a major selling point as I was always extremely cautious with my Blackberry and want something not that I can abuse, but can drop and not panic over.Oh yeah, this phone does have a built in flashlight and compass which work very well and while it doesn't look like it, I find the sealed keypad easy to use.  The company that I go through for this phone is a regional GSM network that roams on AT&T; but, any cell phone company that will let you bring in an unlocked GSM phone should let you bring this one in.  As for the price, well I have always felt that cell phones have an unnecessarily high retail price and mine sells for $79.99 with a two year contract.  I feel that Amazon's asking price is fair as you are buying a fairly rugged phone that should give you years of service.Reception-wise, in the steel and concrete high school that I teach in, I always have at least one bar and overall have better reception than my 8900 previously did.  Also, the battery barely goes down.  I might go down one bar in three days with an hour or use per day.  Of course, the battery is only one week old but the battery is rated with a decent amount of talk and/or standby time.Hopefully, I have covered enough basics on this phone and may add to it if I think if anything else.  Let's see, yes it can play mp3's and it does have a built in FM radio that comes with headphones that double as a mic for phone calls.  I believe it can accept up to a 16GB micro sd card but again, you will want to look up the tech specs on your own.Go to [...]gsmarena.com for more details on this phone and don't forget to check out the youtube reviews.  All in all, it has been rough kicking the smartphone habit bit this phone is making that transition a little bit easier.UPDATE:  If you want to see just how durable this phone is, look it up on gadgetstress.com and you will be blown away by the durability of this device.  It rates 94 on a 100 point scale.  Basically after the apocalypse three things will be remaining...cockroaches, Twinkies, and the Samsung b2710!UPDATE #2:  I just added a 4GB Micro SDHC card to this unit and...my PC refuses to recognize it without any software.  So, I popped the card in the larger adapter and then into a Sandisk reader and I was able to drag and drop albums from my music folder (WMA format) and the phone had absolutely no problems reading them.  I have several options such as artist, album and genre view while using the phone to play mp3's.Unfortunately, the headset is proprietary mini USB and I honestly haven't checked to see if there are any aftermarket ones out there, but the supplied headset (which is also used for hands-free talking) puts out pretty good sound.  A decent amount of bass and they were loud enough for my taste.  The phone also supports album art and I may actually use this phone as a substitute MP3 player instead of my old 30GB Zune that has faithfully served me for the last 3 years.  The loudspeaker puts out pretty good volume for listening without the headset, although if you want to use the FM radio, you need to have the headset connected as I would guess it functions as an antenna.  With the headset attached you can also play music through the built in speaker.Really, this phone is almost like the Swiss Army Knife of cell phones.  Yeah, I am sure that there are smartphones out there they have many, many more features and as a former recovering Blackberry abuser, oops, I mean user, it is nice to have a slightly more limited set of features that you can use really well instead of being inundated with a ton of Apps they you probably wont use anyway. Oh, hey, could your smartphone survive a dip in the pool, lake or ocean for 30 minutes or more?  Didn't think so.I still get stellar battery life with maybe one bar out of five disappearing after 3 days of average use (around 45 minutes of talk time per day).Finally...Pro'sRugged quality buildGood battery lifeColorful screenLots of featuresFlashlight and compassGood 2MP cameraLarge easy to read keysShockproofWaterproofDust-proofSimple OSThe Hummer of cell phonesCon'sDim outdoor screenA tad heavySpeakerphone doesn't get as loud as I would like in a noisy environment but is usable.I don't know what I will do when this model disappears because if you are someone who wants a fun, simple to use, regular cellphone, that can survive a tumble off the table, or down the stairs or the occasional roll down the side of a cliff, you really don't have a lot of options.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tough phone option for US customers", "Author": "Bench", "ReviewID": "R1RADFDN3C8YDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The many highlights and pitfalls of this phone are outlined in previous reviews. My intention with this review is to provide a quick check list of items that will allow you to decide if this phone is appropriate for your usage needs. Also, further down, I have provided the settings I used to enable the multimedia messaging features of this phone for the AT&T; network.Who this phone is for:- People unhappy with the current United States tough phone selection. It is highly limited on AT&T.;- People who are looking for primarily a calling and texting phone. Advanced media features are here, but not always available (if you are using AT&T;, you cannot get 3G speeds) and also clunky compared to true data featured phones. If you are on AT&T; and want data, this phone is not for you. If you are on Verizon, this phone will not work. If you are on T-Mobile, it would appear all features should work (however, I cannot attest to that statement personally).- People who do not wish to renew their 2 year contract, but still get an affordable phone. This phone was only slightly more than renewing my contract with AT&T; with a far inferior tough phone - the Samsung Rugby.As a previous user of the Samsung Rugby, I love tough phones. I use my phone for calling and texting. That's it. So the fact that this phone cannot use high speed data on AT&T; is of no consequence to me. If you are like me, and looking for an affordable and practical phone -- this is it.I love to go into the woods and not worry about my phone. And I love being able to leave my phone out around my nieces, nephews, and dogs and not worry if it will be broken. This phone is more than capable of handling all that abuse and more. Call quality is good, texting is very simple with T9 predictive text, and it boasts a wealth of little extras that make using the phone enjoyable. I'd recommend this phone over the Rugby hands down. Product arrived very quickly (less than 1 week) and boxed appropriately from HassleFreeCell. They included a US power adapter in the box, as the adapter that comes for this phone is not suited for US outlets. NOTE: There is no data cable in the box, but you can easily swap files with any Bluetooth enabled device.Now, unlocking the multimedia messaging takes some finesse. And here are the settings I used to get it to work on AT&T.;Go to: MENU > SETTINGS > NETWORK > CONNECTIONSCreate a new connection.SET NAME: Media NetACCESS NAME: wap.cingularAUTH TYPE: NormalUSER ID: (leave blank)PASSWORD: CINGULAR1 (all caps)Protocol: HTTPHOME URL: [...]PROXY ADDRESS: 66.209.11.32PORT: 80LINGER TIME: 300ADVANCED SETTINGSSTATIC IP: OffLOCAL PHONE IP: 0.0.0.0STATIC DNS: OffSERVER 1: 0.0.0.0SERVER 2: 0.0.0.0Traffic Class: SubscribedAfter you save this, go to APPLICATIONS > MESSAGES > MULTIMEDIA MESSAGES > MULTIMEDIA MESSAGE PROFILESAnd select the Media Net profile you have established. That's it! You should now have access to send and receive media text messages.UPDATED: Note I have encountered a quirk with this phone on the AT&T; network. Common with unlocked phones, I am unable to turn off the voicemail notification icon. I have no voicemails, and have tried all the usual phone tricks to remove it. After some searching, this seems to be an issue I'll have to live with.But it is a MINOR issue, as call reception, battery life, and durability have all surpassed my expectations.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Build Quality, Great for Calls--Plus Flashlight/Radio/OK Camera", "Author": "Nozama", "ReviewID": "R24ZMPMRROCV0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**2.5-YEAR UPDATE (4/2014): Phone still going strong. Battery lasts just over 5 days on one charge--still pretty good. The flashlight is such a handy feature. I will be buried with this phone.**ONE-YEAR UPDATE (11/2012)**This phone can use the same charger that the Blackberry Bold uses! I do this all the time now. Also, you can use the BB Bold USB charger as a download cable for the Samsung; just remove the USB tip from the cube-shaped outlet adapater and then plug the USB end into the computer. Then search for \"Samsung Kies,\" which is free software from Samsung. This will allow your computer to recognize the B2710, so that you can download photos to your PC. (I don't have a data plan, so I can't text them to myself.)Also, I finally tried the FM radio after over a year of owning this phone. It rocks! You have to have the earphones plugged in, because the cord serves as the antenna--but you can go to \"options\" and choose \"Speaker\" to use it as a room radio. What a great feature. (It even has presets.) That, the flashlight, the ruggedness, and the insane battery life make this phone a great emergency tool for when the power goes out--or for camping trips.**QUICK REVIEW**PRO: Incredible battery life; extremely drop-proof and water-resistant; outstanding, unparalleled sound quality; bright LED flashlight; FM radio; decent camera for a phone (esp. in good light--e.g., outdoors); fake-incoming-call feature; ability to block specific numbers and to hide your number when calling others; fits in front pocket; great hand feel and big buttons.CON: Screen will eventually scratch; camera could be a little more high-res; due to some quirk in using this phone on a US network (AT&T;), every voicemail I receive results in a (free) text-message of a weird triangle symbol that I must open in order to clear. (I'm used to it now.) Somewhat heavy (if that matters to you)--maybe a little lighter than an iPhone.OVERALL: 9.75 out of 10. After over 1 year of use, I love this phone. If you are looking for a something mostly to surf the Web with, there are better choices. (But you knew that.)**DETAILED REVIEW**BOTTOM LINE:IF you just want a phone for phone calls, look no further. Great call quality and almost freakish battery life make this probably the best option (though the Pantech Breeze III is a contender). If you want multimedia texting or web surfing, and you're in the USA, there MAY be a way, but don't count on it. (Regular texting does work just fine.) The bright flashlight and radio are surprising and useful features.BACKGROUND:I bought this phone after months of research. I just wanted a basic, durable phone for making calls, that would fit in my front pocket. That's it. No Tweening or Facefool or whatever the kids are doing as they wander aimlessly into traffic with their faces buried in their phones. None of this \"internet\" business. I'd been using a barely tolerable call-dropathon Samsung Go Phone. I wanted as close an approximation as I could get of my long-lost, seemingly indestructible LG VX3400 flip phone, from my days as a Verizon Wireless customer. (I flipped for the rollover minutes.)GOOD:Reception is great, as is call quality. Even from our basement. Even on the AT&T; network. Even in Home Depot! It must be the antenna, because I'm pretty sure I've been on the GSM network the whole time.Battery life is excellent on GSM. On its first full charge, it lasted 10 full days. That's with a moderate number of calls (including one long one), one text, many photos taken, frequent use of the flashlight--but no internet use. I find myself charging this phone once a week, and even then, it still hasn't run outta juice.I don't have a data plan, so I can't comment on the phone's web-surfing abilities. If you're in Europe, you can reportedly use all the included features (web and multimedia texting). But in the US, I wouldn't count on it. (Just to see if I could, I did try setting up the network the way one reviewer said he did to get multimedia texting, but it didn't work for me.)I'm particularly pleased with the build quality and the overall feel of this phone--very understated, with a solid and expensive hand feel. I think it resembles some of the more low-key Vertu phones, which go for several grand. It's solid but not bulky. Probably about the same weight as an iPhone--just enough heft to feel solid but not enough to become onerous. The keypad has a nice matte finish, with great key separation. Stevie Wonder would love this keypad. Overall it's very masucline and understated.Although it's rugged and can survive all sorts of abuse, this phone is still pocketable. (Probably not in skinny jeans, but if you own a pair of those, let's be honest: You have an iPhone.) And the size is perfect for a medium-sized man's hand. I keep wanting to pick up this phone; it feels that nice. It's about the length of a Snickers bar, but it's thin enough that in khakis, I don't have a giant bulge in my front pocket. (Not from the phone, anyway--heh, heh.)The speakerphone is incredible. Callers on the other end say I sound great, just as they do when I don't have them on speakerphone.Stupidly, I tried submerging the phone in a glass of water for a few minutes. (After seeing the gadgetstress dot com tests, this seemed like nothing--but the instructions say not to do this.) Afterward, my voice came through muddled to other callers. But a few hours later, the phone was fine.Other cool features: Super-bright LED flashlight; fake call (\"Sorry, it's the wife, so I gotta take this--but I really do wanna hear about your toddler's excretions!\"); voice recorder; camera that lets you release the shutter when the person smiles; the ability to block certain numbers; and a host of crazy Euro-ringtones that are downright hilarious. (Fortunately, some all-business ringtones are also included.) The camera even lets you edit photos after you take them, to make them black and white, sepia, blurred, etc. There's a pedometer as well.The user interface is similar to that of my old Samsung Go Phone (SGH-a107), but they've made some significant improvements; it's much easier to find the ringtones now, and there are 18 speed dials!NOT-SO-GOOD:The screen did eventually scratch (a little), but it's a rugged phone, so I don't care that much. Hopefully Samsung will upgrade to Gorilla Glass in the successor to this model.Other reviews complain of a balky texting interface, but I'm now used to it.Due to some quirk in using this phone on a US network (AT&T;), every voicemail I receive results in a (free) text-message of a weird triangle symbol. I have to open this text in order to clear the \"new message waiting\" screen alert. (I'm used to it now.)A super-minor quibble is that the flashlight button is a little jiggly. You have to hold the flashlight button down for about a second for it to come on--but that's probably a good thing, lest it come on while in your pocket.The camera is only 2MP and probably does not have a large sensor--but it's good enough. It's not great in dim light, but few cameras are. Outdoor photos are excellent. (A phone camera should really be a \"just in case\" thing--just in case you see a dog driving a car and want to get evidence.) This camera does have a TON of features: In addition to the zoom and edit/crop options, there's even a timer function. See my update at the top for how to download photos onto your PC without a data plan.The Google Maps and the GPS don't seem to work without being able to get online, via a data plan. And the included games are only trial versions. But I didn't buy this phone for those features.This phone is a tad heavy, but not compared to most smartphones. But if you're considering this to use as an FM radio/emergency phone while running or cycling, that might matter to you. I actually like the heft, because that's part of what makes it so durable.FYI:The language options this phone vary by what market it was made for. On my particular phone, the included languages are: Slovenian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Croatian, Serbian, Hungarian, Latvian, Estonian, Lithuanian, Russian, and I think Macedonian and Ukrainian--along with English and Korean. But no Spanish, French, German, Chinese, or Japanese. Not a problem for me, just kind of interesting.Unlike many phones these days, there is a volume control on the side, thankfully.The battery compartment is a bit tricky; you have to turn the little screw so that the slot is angled at either 1:00/7:00 (to lock) or 11:00/5:00 (unlocked). You don't keep twisting lefty-loosie like a regular screw. When it's in the unlocked position, slide a fingernail into one edge and gently pull out to loosen the cover. You may notice that on the battery cover, one of the two little tabs at the top looks broken, compared to the other tab; it is not. It's cut away so that the screw won't grasp the battery cover in the unlocked position, so that the cover can come off. (I've seen more than one phone, so I know this is just how they're designed.)CONCLUSION:Great for hikers, travelers, people who work outdoors, or people who just want a very solid, reliable phone for talking/light texting. Fantastic bonus features that you will grow to find useful. AT&T; should strongly consider getting this phone as an official device, to replace the mediocre \"rugged\" offerings it currently has.BUYING TIP:If your phone is listed as new by the seller, make sure it really IS new; there should be an intact Samsung seal across the seam that opens the box (NOT a blank seal), along with an illustrated Samsung manual specific to this model (also downloadable from overseas Samsung websites), Euro charger and US adapter plug, battery, and earphones.

The default phone firmware is a bit buggy. I haven't tried to update the firmware yet. Texting with T9 causes the phone to lock up periodically while composing messages. About three weeks ago, after getting the phone wet while kayaking, the microphone started to act up. People complain they barely hear me or hear a lot of static on inbound and outbound calls. I thought it was because water or sand got into the microphone port. I checked the microphone port a week later with a magnifying glass and the port is dry and debris free. All o-ring seals are intact and clean. The internals are totally dry with no trace of water exposure. The only workaround for now is to use a bluetooth headset. Other than the microphone issue, the phone has performed like a champ. It's slipped out of my hand while cycling and I didn't have any problems. The gorilla glass is tough but I recommend putting on a screen protector. The screen scratched while washing car with my phone and keys together in my trouser pocket.11/14/12 - Phone is still going strong. Battery life is still admirable. However, the latest firmware updates still haven't resolved the T9 input crashing issue.  I also noticed that after syncing my Google contacts using Kies in June 2012, the phone would start hang randomly for several minutes and then continue to operate as if nothing happened. The hanging was getting so frequent that I decided to factory-reset the phone a few weeks ago. After loading up my pre-Google sync contact list, the phone has been operating normally. The phone doesn't seem to either like the Google's formatting of the contacts or the sheer volume of contact info.

I get better signal with this phone than I did with my previous 15 yr old Nokia. My Nokia would pick up a signal when no other phone would... this one gets signal where the Nokia was spotty or had no signal. I showed the phone to a group of friends at the college I attend and told them it was a tough phone. One friend showed me his android tough phone and pointed out that mine was not a touch screen and could not browse the internet as well as his. I don't use the internet... I have T-mobile and pay for unlimited Talk/text. I don't want an android or an I Phone because I have a laptop that performs online tasks with better efficiency. Long story short I had my friend agree to put his phone to a test along with mine (this was about 15 min before our Microbiology Lab). I dropped my phone down the center of a 3 story stair well (each story being 12', so about 4 stories in some structures) and the phone was absolutely fine. My friend was very apprehensive about repeating what I had done, but after some intense peer pressure he complied and his phone's face broke off, the touch screen cracked, and the battery compartment fractured (he had insurance and was not as upset as one might guess). After this we put my phone in a fish tank throughout the duration of our 2 hour lab and then called the phone when we got out... the screen lit up inside the tank and reported an incoming call. I took the phone out and answered the call and could hear clearly.I was an Infantry Marine (Sgt. in 2/3 Wpns Co. out of Kaneohe Bay, HI)... I wish I had found this phone when I was in to say the least. I had a couple of 'tough' phones and countless other phones during my 4.5 yrs of service and I did manage to destroy each one of them. Amphibious landing drills claimed the lives of 2 phones. I brought a motorola tough phone to Iraq because I thought the camera built into the phone was tough and took great pictures... it took a hard blow when I fell down a wadi and began turning on only when it felt like it; later a phosphorous IED burnt it to a pile of nothing. Another phone (the second tough phone/ Iridium phone) I purchased was a satellite phone that cost me about $250/month... I brought this thing to Afghanistan and it stopped working after being left inside a HMWV in the sun for about 9 hours. That phone was an absolute tank, but I guess the heat was able to breech its defenses. I am going to the Mojave desert next summer to see a buddy now stationed at 29 Palms Marine Corps Base and I plan on bringing the B2710 with me... we'll see what happens (plan on doing a good heat test).

I can't speak to long-term use but I can give initial impressions. So far I love it. I am amazed it is as light as it is for being so rugged. The size is a little bulky but is to be expected considering its build strength. Reception is good and sound quality is pretty decent. I wish earpiece volume went a little higher but its still adequate. The user interface is simple and clean. My only concern is the cover over the Micro-USB connection. With the regular use it will get, I expected a little more solid piece. Still very excited to have it though!I have used it for a couple days and I am subtracting one star due to overall audio quality from the ear piece. The loudspeaker for speaker phone calls is really good for such a small phone. But the ear piece I use most often is very low. The voices sound almost canned. At max volume there is distortion from callers on the other end so it needs to be backed down by one notch for better sound quality with a little lower volume. Overall good reception and no dropped calls of many made. Very happy overall.I now have two weeks of solid use across much of Florida and I still continue to like this phone a lot. A small improvement that might be nice is not having to press and hold the unlock key for so long before unlock occurs.

I did put TrekBuddy on it for more useful GPS features.  The cockpit displays are useful for location and speed but the maps are difficult to see.Camera: Photos are decent for 2MP.  Video was not all that great.Flashlight (a.k.a Torch): As mentioned by other users, the switch is not locked with the keypad.  The light can get turned on any time in a pocket or pack and run the battery down.  It is bright enough for finding your way in the dark.  I have used it as a bike headlight in a pinch.Calendar: Useful for basic appointments and anniversaries.  Does not support advanced repeating events such as \"Every month on the 3rd Tuesday\".Quirks:1) I managed to create an alarm event which disappeared in memory somewhere.  It was still active but I could not see it, delete it or edit it until I made enough new alarm events to get back to that spot in memory.2) Similar to what was mentioned by another reviewer, after updating something, maybe firmware or events in Calendar or adding Contacts, the phone would occasionally just stop responding to the keypad for upwards of about a minute and a half.  It seemed to happen most often while moving and may be related to the hand-off from one cell tower to another.  I tried all sorts of changes to the settings but nothing seemed to help.  One way to recreate the problem was to power off the phone and turn it back on.  Once the normal display shows, start pressing a keypad button and watch numbers show up on the dialing display.  I could get about 4 or 5 digits in before the phone would stop responding and just sit there for about 97 seconds.  A Master Reset seems to have corrected the problem.  I don't know what caused it in the first place but I will check the phone more often now to see if I can discover a likely cause.----------------------------------Update:After extensive testing and some luck, I think I have narrowed the problem to Calendar alarms.

The manual does not help with that point.When connecting microUSB cable to your B2710 check first if your microUSB plug is long enough to go through rubber armour of XCover. Also the microUSB plug shoul be oval in section rather than rectangular. Many people complain of bad computer connections with B2710 which I guess might be due to the above. I find genuine Blackberry Pearl microUSB cable very suitable, also Amazon Kindle 3G genuine microUSB cable fits well when pushed hardly into XCover socket.Solid B2710 has great digital voice recorder (dictaphone). The sensitivity for the human voice is very good, as well as the quality of *.amr sound files (play your *.amr sound files with QuickTime or RealPlayer), which are also well compressed and small in Mb. For many in-case recordings I often prefer to quick use my handy XCover rather than separate digital recorder. Please keep in mind to set up your B2710 phone into the Airplane (Offline) mode before starting voice recording, otherwise the first incoming call stops your recording.What I heavily need is phone call recording (both parties), but I cannot find the way to record phone calls with B2710. There was a rumour about Java app, but B2710 has very limited Java capabilities. If any of you heard abot phone recorder for XCover 271, pls let us know!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Almost 2 years of heaviest abuse, phone made its last breath yesterday night", "Author": "Andrei Nosenko", "ReviewID": "R1FA4RK7EQ8IFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have four of these phones among our friends. The levels of abuse, which were applied to these telephones in our hands are really overly harsh.Sinking in vodka, rum, beer, cold water, hot water, throwing them at the walls, throwing on the floor, falling off enduro bike, doing canyon hikes etc.There are downsides, of course, slow, bad screen, you name it. But it does what it is build for, it works in any conditions. Battery life made me lazy, I simply forget that I have to charge the phone. I can easily take it to 5-6 days hike and be sure that I won't need to charge it at all.GPS function works okay, we used this rugged baby as a GPS navigator when doing offroad enduro trails two-up.I mentioned that my phone died gloriously yesterday. It was abused by throwing it, it already had less than half of side buttons/protectors left, the protection glass was broken, but screen itself holds off liquids pretty well :P My drunkard friend was stomping on the phone with fury and it's what finished it all. Phone was still working, with damaged screen, but later at night it died from heavy injuries. :)What am I planning to get? Same phone, for sure. Fits me 100%.

Set-up was super easy and fast. Very intuitive, which a tech-challenged person like me appreciates. The phone arrived fully-charged. And then I saw something I've never seen on my old AT&T; phone: bars! My house is pretty much a dead zone for tower signals, but this new phone picked up the signal and held it.Getting the Samsung phone to work on my AT&T; account was just a matter of switching the sim card to the new phone. I didn't have to contact AT&T; or do any programming.I use a phone just for talking. No voicemail, no texting, no going online. That means the phone has capabilities I'll never use. For example, I can set up fake calls if I want to (though I never will). Say you are going into a meeting, but you want to be called away from it in 30 minutes. You can schedule that call (from yourself) so you'll have an excuse to leave: \"This is an emergency. I'll have to cut this meeting short.\" That sort of thing.Something I appreciate is the ability to block calls from specific numbers. I pay extra for that from AT&T.; Now I can cancel that added expense.The flashlight is something I'll use because I have trouble finding where to put the house key in the lock at night. Others have mentioned that the flashlight is very bright. That's an understatement.The only thing I would change about this phone is the weight. It is significantly heavier than my old Pantech Breeze II phone and not as nice to hold when talking, but I never have long, drawn-out conversations so it really doesn't matter all that much.I give this product an enthusiastic A+.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This phone rocks on a little, tiny island in Greece!!!

The integral flashlight is decent, more powerful than a Photon keychain light, about equal to a 1AA or 2AA LED flashlight.I am currently charging and programming the phone, so it is too early for a true comprehensive review.The included charger fits loosely at the plug and the micro USB port.The screen boots to a foreign language.  Resetting to english is simple.The date is formatted to European system (day/month/year), I have so far not found a way to set to US system.Removal of the battery cover is simple, the screwhead is large and easy to rotate.  Just be careful and do not use force.  Below the screwhead are small symbols representing 'locked' and 'unlocked'.Navigating the menu takes getting used to as of now, haven't gotten to the programming of shortcuts yet.On most of the functions it requires that you press and hold to initiate.I have not yet tried my SIM card.I do not yet have a SD card.I have not yet tried the camera.I will be posting updates in the future.UPDATE:While initially charging my new phone, I found after 7 hours that the battery status icon had not advanced, staying at one bar.I sent an email inquiry to the vendor regarding this.  Despite being late at night I received a reply in a matter of hours by early next morning.

Didn't use all of the features anyway, and I'm pretty hard on phones since we \"play\" outdoors and I do some service work in my job as well.Looked for \"tough phones\" at my local ATT store, they had a Samsung flip rugged phone that led me to search until I found this one.  This model actually has more features and was a better deal for my use that what I could buy in the store at no contract pricing.  If you just need a tough phone that makes calls, basic texts, etc. (feature phone) then this is it.  I use a netbook for email and internet access so it sure was nice to simplify.Read all the specs, the GPS really works, compass isn't bad, never knew how much I needed a flashlight on a phone. The FM radio feature is much more useful than I thought.  Manufacturer says \"don't do it\" but of course I dropped it into a clear container of water and called myself from the office phone while my co-workers waited for an aquatic disaster. Took a little while to dry out the microphone, but no damage!  Maybe this is the 'swiss army knife' of phones?The folks that reviewed the strong signal strength were right on, sound is good, fairly simple to use.  It's a great conversation piece  when others see me using it. (ha ha)This phone does everything it is supposed to, I just put in my sim card, Bluetooth transferred my contacts and I'm off and running.

This  model sold everywhere else in the world except the US of course as Xcover 271, and others.  No touch screen to clean or break, just make calls and answer them...what a concept!So if your carrier has GSM, and you are tired of contracts, and breaking your phone, order one up, it came with a European charger, but with a US plug adapter, you can charge it via USB with a micro usb cord as well.BTW, the first one I bought for my wife, I liked it so much, I had to get one too.

Service is great as well - I live in Oklahoma and during tornadoes it is impossible for most people to make or receive calls/texts - I have never had an issue.

When it crashes, it will sometimes self-restart if I wait for a couple of minutes, but usually I need to remove the battery.  Removing the battery is challenging to do without a tool like a flat-head screwdriver.  Crashing usually seems to occur when the T9 word list is triggered.  It's not possible to permanently hide or disable the word list, unless you disable T9 texting altogether. 3) There is a noticeable typing lag/delay.  When texting, I often type faster than the phone can handle, and must go back and correct the resulting typos. 4) The phone's ear speaker is very quiet, even at maximum volume.  The headphone volume is great, but hearing to a caller without using headphones requires positioning the phone \"just right\" against your ear, and even then is difficult to hear a caller, especially if you're not in a quiet environment. 5) The micro USB headset/charging port is kept watertight by a tight-fitting, gasketed rubber plug.  If you don't have strong, long fingernails, accessing it is a challenge without a tool of some sort. 6) The voice mail notification indicator remains permanently on, once it's triggered the first time.  There doesn't seem to be a way to clear it.  I've tried many things, including AT&T;'s FAQ web site instructions.  On AT&T;'s network (and perhaps others), the phone will receive a coded text message when checking voice mail.  This message doesn't appear on AT&T; branded phones, they may use it to clear the voice mail icon.  From what I understand, phones require special AT&T; branded software installed on them, for this to work properly.  I am using the commonly recommended APN settings for AT&T;, the same ones I was using with my AT&T; branded phone. 7) The default radio volume is not saved or configurable.  If you're listening to the radio and switch out of it temporarily to take a call or use the camera, the radio volume will automatically revert to half-volume, which is unpleasantly loud. 8) The radio can be played on the phone's loudspeaker, but only if the headphones are plugged into the phone.  If you remove the headphones, it will turn off.  What the heck kind of logic is that? UPDATE: I've learned this is likely due to the headphone wire doubling as an antenna, as it does for other phones. 9) The phone's two shortcut buttons are not user-configurable.  They are permanently set to Menu and Contacts.  Only the center 4-directional pad can be configured with custom shortcuts, from a fairly limited list of options.10) Text messages cannot easily be backed up, saved, or exported to PC from this phone.  The Samsung Kies PC software is supposed to have an import/export tab that allows this for most phones, but it does not appear when the GT-B2710 is connected to a PC.  I've spent hours searching for an alternate method, but there doesn't seem to be one.  The only way to save or export text messages from this phone is to individually forward/send them to an email account or other destination.If I knew of an alternative BASIC (ie. non-smartphone) SIM-compatible phone with an ergonomic, robust, bug-free design which supports easy text-message exporting from the phone to a PC, I would definitely prefer that to the GT-B2710.

I upgraded from a 7-8 year old Nokia brick.  I wanted another tough phone (the Nokia wasn't formally ruggedized but it was a Nokia, enough said).  I looked at AT&T; phones available on contract since I haven't upgraded in 3-4 years.  Their basic phones were all pretty poor, the nice phones are all \"smart\".

Sure it's a gimmick, but I often use my phone as a light (especially when I can't find my flashlight), it's nice that it has a dedicated one.Con's:> The UI is kind of crappy.  It's not a smartphone, so I don't expect much, but some functions (sound profiles, bluetooth, etc.) could be easier to access.> No 3.5 mm headphone jack, uses the mini-usb, that's annoying and doesn't allow me to use a universal headset.> Crappy ringtones - though to be fair, only Nokia has good ringtones and you could import whatever you want.Untested/Neutral:> Camera - I took a picture, it worked.  I don't expect much of a 2.0 mp camera on this phone.> GPS - It tells you your current GPS position.  Doesn't track or give direction (though there is a compass which works sufficiently well).  It works, though I'm not sure how much I'll use it.> Music - I don't really listen to music when I'm out and about, so I can't rate this.> Data connectivity/web/email - I'm not using the phone for data, but I can guess that email/web surfing on this would be subpar.

I already have an iPhone which is also quad band but AT&T; rates are a bit expensive. An unlocked world phone allows you to buy local country SIM cards with far, far cheaper rates.  In Jamaica for example, current rates to call back to the US are approximately 1 cent per minute. Local calls are also cheap, or free. I'm just back from a 3 week trip and I think this phone has already paid for itself.  This phone has not disappointed.  It immediately recognized SIM cards from Haiti, Jamaica and USA, so far. I have had the phone only about a month, so I haven't used all the features but I'm completely satisfied at this point. The clarity for hearing and speaking is excellent, reception has been excellent (no dropped calls), battery life is very long, features are reasonably intuitive to use. The phone has a robust look and feel to it, actually people have been admiring it! A cell phone as a status symbol! Who knew!?  A couple of minor disadvantages...the display is hard to read in outdoor sunlight; also the keypad locks up to prevent pocket dialing too quickly, while the unlocking button is slow.  I haven't found a way to adjust that. But those are are minor issues.

I bought this phone 2 years ago. I have tested this phone almost everywhere in every emergency situation, from freezing rivers to sand dunes and it worked as intended. Before that, deliberately dropped from 7 meters high building(roughly 20 feet) and it still works. The only weakness of this phone revealed is its 2 adjacent volume buttons on the left side. Both buttons got damaged after another drop from the same 7 meters level, so don't try it, believe me... and unfortunately these buttons turned out to be substitutes for zooming buttons and thus my phone lost both zooming ability and volume control simultaneously. So, couldn't make use of GPS function anymore. Zooming anything like map or text became impossible and calling volume control got disabled. This options are not vital but still serious problem. Despite everything I do not know any other cell phone capable of taking such abuse under 200 dollars. Sonim phones are probably better than this one but difference in price is crucial for me. I rate Samsung B2710 by 4 stars because Samsung failed to deliver promised quality in case of volume buttons, however I give it 5 stars comparing to competitors on the market.
