First I would relocate the power button; it's current location causes inadvertent powerings on and off; and second, for the music lover(which I assume this phone was designed for)I'd add some EQ options as well as a cutoff or sleep timer to the music player settings.

The phone is quite a looker. Without feeling clunky and chunky, the phone feels incredible in the hand. The screen is also absolutely gorgeous. Yea you can argue it doesn't have top of the line processor, but android and HTC sense has made that a non-issue. The speed is great. I have had this phone for 3 months and the entertainment value + battery life makes everything worth it. I watch netflix on my phone everyday. The boomsound speakers are even louder than the HTCOne's. Incredible.

Although the Note 3 appeared a step above in several features & characteristics, the HTC shined in most all other attributes.  So, I stayed true to my brand loyalty - especially after toting HTC's wonderful EVO 4G for three years.  I just knew I'd be happier with their product again.I use my smart phone mostly for browsing, emails and for portable entertainment.  The dual front-facing speakers were my final convincing feature that I wanted.  YES...they're pretty awesome!On the other hand, I don't do allot of phone calls and I'll admit that this phone is a bit awkward to hold when actually used as a PHONE.  SO, if you talk much on the phone, that may be a deterrent to your choosing this phone.I purchased the One Max through Amazon without ever actually seeing anything other than pictures of it.  I'd suggest NOT doing that and, instead, try it out first at your local store.  I say that only because its size may be a bit too much for some people.  It took a minute for me to get used to how big it is.  It dwarfs that old EVO.  That's funny, considering that the EVO was the largest on the market when I got it.My phone service is through Sprint.  After some price comparing, I made my purchase through Amazon and saved well over half the cost that Sprint was advertising on their website.  I also bought an Otter Box case w/holster, which significantly adds to its mass.  However, it's really not an issue to carry when strapped to my belt.  But...you'll know its there for sure.Final note:  The other day a friend who sports a Galaxy Note 3 asked to see my HTC to compare the two.  So, with the Note 3 in one hand and the HTC One Max in the other, it took all of three seconds to say \"I gotta have that HTC as my next phone!\"", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love The Phone with minor aggravations", "Author": "ore", "ReviewID": "R13L9O1HE08Z9Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let's get this out of the way...Amazon customer service is TERRIFIC and so are the prices. They have been very responsive to me requests. I will keep shopping with them for a long time to come.Now the phone. My phone is my mp3, alarm, clock, radio, web browser, flashlight, gps, source for news, and did I mention...my phone. So before I purchased this phone, I read a lot of reviews and watch several reviewers on youtube. Some reviewers took points off because the phone, they claim, was too large. That's like marrying someone fulling knowing that they are very tall, large, or very short, and then complaining about it. Why would you do that? You know going in before you inked the deal what you were getting in to. If you didn't want a large phone, you won't have gotten one. So, hopefully, if you are like me, part of the reason why you want or purchased this phone is because it has a large AND beautiful screen. Watching movies, surfing the net, and videos is a REAL treat.Then others take point off because the processor is not as fast as the latest and greatest. Can I ask you a question? Can you notice any difference in the performance? I sure can't. This phone is lightning fast. Also, the hardware is beautiful. Nothing including Samsung comes close. The battery lasts a LONG time. For me, probably a day and half of quite a bit of use. I like the fact that the UI is not as bloated as Samsung's.What has me aggravated is that the LED notification light is now working at all. There is an androidforum blog of people having the same problem with the HTC one. Some have fixed this with a hard reboot and then reinstalling all the apps one at a time. I don't want to nor do I feel I should have to do that on a NEW phone. HTC needs to come up with a fix. Second, I have not been able to locate an FM tuner. I wanted that so I could \"tune\" it to the television in my gym while I worked out.If you are willing to overlook some of these irritations, and you want a beautiful phone with a great screen, speakers, long battery life, at a lesser price than a Note 3, this is your phone.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this phone.", "Author": "Ranju Mathew", "ReviewID": "RGUNUFJEVLNG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone because of the screen size, display quality, sound, responsiveness, infrared emitter, and fingerprint authentication.  I read a lot of reviews before I purchased it and I've had a lot of different smartphones(BlackBerry, iPhone 3g, Galaxy Epic, S2, S3) and this is by far my favorite.  A lot of people complain about the power button being in the side.  It is perfectly placed so you can hold the phone screen up in your palm and press the power button while sliding your index finger on the fingerprint scanner.  The scanner is really close to the camera and you can mistakenly smudge your camera.  I use the TUDIA Ultraslim Melody TPU case with this phone and I've grown accustomed to the feel of the case and cutouts.  Now I rarely smudge the camera.  The fingerprint scanner is fast and responsive.  I am usually able to unlock the phone on the first try and even if I had to try a few times, it is still faster than putting in my pin or password.  The only thing I didn't like about the phone was the placement of the home and back buttons.  I wished they followed convention with other android phones, but its easy to get the hang of after a week or so.  Other than that, the display is awesome, the sound is amazing for a phone, and the OS, apps and GUI are responsive and reliable.  I would recommend this phone to anyone that doesn't require multiwindow or stylus support.  Those are features that I rarely used on my tablet, so I don't really need them on my phone.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "love my htc one max", "Author": "ElyDi", "ReviewID": "R2WCPRLQL8YM7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is one of the best phones ever!

It's big, it's beautiful and it's powerful. Now I know it's not the fastest phone out there but it is plenty powerful. Plays 1st person shooters with zero lag. Have yet to have a problem with it being slow. The space is a big plus, I added an additional 32gb SD card in it as well. I have yet to find a way to transfer apps to the SD card, but you can set your photos to save to the card which will save space on your internal storage. Before you buy this understand that it is very big. I came from a galaxy s3 and the max dwarfs it. I think it will be fine after a little time with it, but it really is large. Fits fine in my relaxed fit jeans pocket, but I can see it being hard in some skinny jeans. Also the back removable panel is an absolute pain to put back on. The corner by the switch to pop it off doesn't like to go back to being flush with the phone and stay in place. Took me probably 5 minutes just to get it back in flush. Ridiculous, but I don't plan on removing the back often. Speakers are great, they don't get as loud as I was thinking they would, but they are much louder than the s3's, so I'm very happy.
