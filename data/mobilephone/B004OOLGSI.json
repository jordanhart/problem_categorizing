{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect Little Pink Phone", "Author": "MariaEC", "ReviewID": "R3T3FLO68L8MPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this cell phone from Amazon... I got it from T-Mobile over 2 years ago, and I've been in love with my cell phone since.  In the two years I've had it, I have no complaints. It has great reception, super-long battery life, is compact (and pink!), the menu is very easy to use & configure. There's a camera on the phone, but it's not meant to be used for any kind of serious photography... I use it more for quick snapshots of things I want to remember. I don't care for text-messaging, or going on the web with my phone... I just want my phone to be a phone that works when I want it, and that I don't need to charge every single day. I usually go about 4 days before I need to charge it... it's that amazing (granted, I'm not a big talkaholic).", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "memory card slot stereo Bluetooth\nadvanced voice dialing\ndual color displays.\n1.3 megapixel camera\nEDGE data", "Name": "Motorola W490 Pink", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317DDZwLz4L.jpg", "ProductID": "B004OOLGSI"}}
