Ended up rooting the phone, getting rid of the main battery draining apps, setting the CPU to scale between 300mHz and 1gHz depending on need, and setting up a task killer for everything else. I can now use it all day, including streaming a good bit of music and only have to plug it in at night before bed. If I didn't use it for streaming, I'd probably get a lot more. Basically, if Motorola/Verizon didn't load it with so much crap it would be an almost perfect phone. The screen's not as big as some of the other phones, like the Thunderbolt, but I like the overall size of the phone better. Would definitely recommend if you didn't intend to keep a stock configuration. Otherwise, look elsewhere. It also feels kind of cheaply made compared to some of the other offering out there, but I haven't suffered any hardware problems with it.Pros: Excellent internal memory. Good camera.

It has a nice resolution, so no problem reading at it.  The only unfortunate thing about the xt610 is the size and layout of the keyboard.I got the phone because it is the only candy bar style phone with decent hardware out there.  And I got it to replace my ageing BB-7290.The xt-610 is fast (with an Cortex-A8 running the show) but the size of the keyboard ruined it for me.  There just is no space for an adult size hand to type in this crammed keyboard. And,there is no way to hold it while typing because there is no space below the keyboard to hold the phone while you type.  Not to mention there are no cursor keys. no up, or down or left and right.  so good luck trying to correct a typo.  there is a software thing on screen but it's worthless because it does not activate on every app.  you can backup typo's on evernote but on the browser it will not work. the idiots who designed this keyboard should loose their jobs!Old style blackberry's had a nice keyboard and lots of room for an adult hand.  I do not understand this running away from the keyboard by the phone industry.(??).  I don't care what sales people tell me at phone vending places, but typing on a hard screen is irritating.(a keyboard makes typing a breeze), of course there will by lots of typing on a smart-phone, the thing is a portable computer.I guess I will have to wait for the new windows phones, I have seen prototypes of nice and wide keyboards WITH a nice and big screen. WITH cursor keys.  the Galaxy note is popular, and it's huge.  Why can't phone makers make a decent candy bar phone with a decent screen with cursor keys????Too bad, the phone is fast and has plenty of memory.

My phone of choice was the BB Bold, but I couldn't afford it so I searched high and low for another option and discovered this phone. So far I love this phone, and I think the reason the reviews are either hit or miss is because there are two different versions of this phone being shipped.The first phone I ordered turned on fine, made calls and texts, but the wifi  would not work. I loved the way the phone was made so I returned it and ordered another in hopes that the first was just a defective phone. Imagine my surprise when the next one I received worked perfectly...because it's a different version of the same phone. The LED notification light is steady instead of blinking, the available wallpapers and apps are slightly different, the phone feels lighter overall, and the back is rubbery instead of slick and shiny. The second phone also came with the ugliest charger I have ever seen (the first once came with the light up charger that's pictured by the seller) and no memory card. So far all features are working perfectly. The phone is quick, responsive, and customizable. You do have to search around in the settings to disable many of the \"helpful\" features (man do I hate predictive text lol), but you can change many of the factory settings. It doesn't have the latest and greatest version of android, but it does have some useful shortcut widgets and other features. You just have to play with it a bit to find them. I looovee the keyboard, but then again I do have skinny fingers so maybe that's why it doesn't bother me.As far as carrier goes, I use a GSM cell service that's unique to my local area, but it's very similar to AT&T; and T-Mobile and the phone is working fine for me. I'm sure not all features are compatible, but that's a risk you take when you order online.

It's only $100, so I guess you \"get what you pay for.\" The design of the keypad is terrible because the letters are so close together and my fingers are pretty small so... I guess it's something you just have to get used to it. The camera quality is 5 megapixels but it's a lot more grainy than it should be.

I have small hands, so the small keyboard and screen are easy to use.I would have given this phone 5 stars if it weren't for the trouble I've had. The first Pro I ordered would \"power cycle,\" constantly rebooting itself. And I do mean constantly. It would stay on for about 5-10 minutes before turning itself off and back on again. I'd have to turn it off completely during meetings because the phone shouts, \"DROID!\" every time it boots up. So Verizon exchanged it, and I was thrilled with the phone until the Android OS updated itself and immediately the screen stopped working properly. It freezes randomly and often. When it does, I touch the power button to turn the screen off, but when I push it again sometimes I can't even unlock the screen because it's already frozen. I've missed phone calls because of this, which is unacceptable if you use your phone a lot for work.The result, of course, from the constant freezing is that the battery drains a whole lot faster.

It was fast, had WAY more features and was everything I wanted and more; plus I love the keyboard! About 6 months in the battery life went to nothing. I found a battery on Amazon for about $3 and the problem was fixed, no biggie.One year in to owning....I have never dropped the phone, it has always been protected by a case, and it has no water damage to the device or the battery. Starting month 10 the phone would click on random apps I had never clicked on and open them. No big deal, I would just click the Home button a few times and everything would be fine. By month 11 apps started moving to my home screen and disappearing from my home screen because the phone thought I was clicking on all these things at once, so I constantly had to fix all my apps on my screen. It was annoying, but I dealt with it because I still really liked the phone. Then, month 14 comes (mind you, phones should last 2 years) it started freezing up and I would have to take the battery out just to get it to work. It would function for about a minute and then freeze again, leading me to have to remove the battery and replace it again. After a day of that headache, it wouldn't turn on. It sits there and says \"Droid\" over and over and acting like it's loading to turn on, but never does. Again, I need to remove the battery and put it back in. This phone has no damage to it whatsoever, there is no rhyme or reason to it, it just stopped working.For the price, maybe it's worth it to some. If you plan on having this phone for any longer than 6-12 months, it's perfect for you and you won't regret it. If you're like normal people and want to keep the same phone for the length of a forced 2 year contract, think again. It's not going to last that long and you're just going to end up having to replace it.I would recommend this phone for short term use, or for someone that doesn't use their cell phone a lot. I do a lot of texting, talking, emailing, and the use of apps to play music (which it sucks at by the way!) and other apps/games, so my use was quite frequent.Either way, feel free to take a risk with this phone, maybe it'll be worth it, but maybe not.
