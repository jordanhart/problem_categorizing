I've had it for less than 5 hours and I'm already in love with it.WP7 is the sleekest, fastest and most sexy OS out. And this is coming from a person that's been using an Iphone for the last three years.Until you've used a WP7 phone please don't pass judgement, as that would be an injustice to the handset & OS.For me it's WP7 and onward. can't wait till the updates start coming in.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very underated phone", "Author": "Michael Wright \"Michael\"", "ReviewID": "R2N57DQCUR021F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son has an iPhone and my daughter has an Android and I have seen and used them both myself. This Windows' phone matches them in everyway possible. I really like it and have trouble understanding why it's not doing better in the market. Many people see MicroSoft and jump to quick conclusions that it must not be any good. The OS is very good and due to get even better with the soon Mango upgrade release.The HTC Trophy itself is light but feel very solid in your hands. I am very please with my choice so far. It is a very easy phone to learn and use.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Uh, pleasently supprised", "Author": "Darijo74", "ReviewID": "R1KDNS8LIEYKGQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok....I'm Apple person from head to toe and as soon as I hear \"Windows\" i have alergic reaction...I have purcshased this phone as a gift to my girlfriend and I have to admit here, after I received this HTC phone with Windows 7, I was realy supprised with simplicity and functionality...Screen is amazing, responsive. Camera is really good...Interface is really user friendly and I like idea of big real time tiles on the home screen...Sure there are some things which are missing, compering it to iOS (therfore 4 starts) but hey, I'm sure improvements are on the way...With this price this phone is more then a good deal...I wait for an iPhone 5 but I really recommend it to people who does not want to spend 650$ on a iPhone..", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does all I want and alot more out of the box", "Author": "N. Nagir \"Power User\"", "ReviewID": "R2QKFF0SVI3K41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, fast and simple. Updated to 7.5 with ease (Google instructions to force update if necessary). Only complication was the Hotmail/Live account email addresses being pulled into the People (contacts). To work around this simply create a new email account or delete all email addresses from an email account (hotmail or live) you dont really use (I'm sure we all have one). Next export your contacts from Outlook into .csv then import into email account. Simple. PS. If you already have all your contacts synced into your people you can remove them by removing the contacts from your email then refreshing the email on your phone, it will remove or update the contacts as necessary, no need to erase phone.Once you got that done you will soon realise the iPhone is just an overpriced name brand phone. Granted they made the breakthroughs etc etc. other phones basically do the same things whether it be Android, WP7 etc. They all got the same apps, games etc. Its like buying a Mac or PC and all we gonna do is browse, type documents and socialize. How much more can the iPhone or other overpriced phone really do?As for doing alot out of the box, voice commands work great, you can even place a call without unlocking the phone great for driving. Great free apps like Tasks.BIGGEST DOWNSIDE as with almost all phones except probably the new iphone 4s which claims a longer battery life just like the iphone 4 claimed to have, is the battery i got a full day (24hrs) out of it running games like angry birds checking emails, placing and receiving a few calls, wifi always on and bluetooth, 3g off. Streaming vidoss and recording videos drains it fast.So until some brilliant phone company decides to incorporate Seiko Kinetic Movement or Citizen eco drive technology or similar into phones, (which to me is long overdue) then we could safely say the phone is truly a smartphone.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth a hard look!", "Author": "earache", "ReviewID": "R37O3PKASQSWA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the past year my wife and I have owned an iPhone 3GS, Motorola Atrix, a Motorola Bionic, and a HTC Rhyme.  It is a long painful story to explain the number of cell phones over the past several months.  I purchased this phone used as temporary replacement secondary to cost - I was not expecting to like to this phone. Windows 7.5 and this phone are amazing! It is elegant, simple to use, and rock stable. I enjoy the ascetics of the MetroUI and how easy it is to navigate emails, contacts, and the web. The phone build quality is very good.Pro's - Windows 7.5 aesthetics, elegance, simplicity, and stability. Build quality. Zune Music player.Con's - Windows Marketplace is anorexic compared to iTunes and Android.  Inability to \"tinker\" with the user interface (like android), but this plays on the strength of it's simplicity.  No flash support.  Turn-by-Turn requires user to touch map between turns (not a huge issue for me).  The power button can be hard to find by feel.I'm hooked on Mango!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "mostafa", "ReviewID": "R2TJ7TXN35RNY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a great phone,great apps,slim design overall good phone sound is beautiful but there is few things which are difficult to handle so if they can handle that in the software it will be good but overall a fantastic phone", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good budget smart phone", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R2Z9NI6D6WTSIZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok i bought this to give it as a gift. Never tried wp7 phone so I was curious about it. This phone had nice big display. It takes 5MP photos BUT the picture quality is not great For 5MP. I paid 190 for a brand new one. So for the price the phone is super nice! But don't expect it to be like iPhones or Galaxy phones! Widows is nice but I don't like it.if you like IOS or Android or both. You will not really enjoy windows. I am an apple IOS fan but also love Android.  Let's get to the hardware of this phone. The phone looks really nice the screen is nice and bright! Again this is more like a budget smart phone but it is great for the money. If you don't mind windows then you will like the phone. If you care about the picture quality and can spend some more then don't get this. Oh by the way the videos look excellent and crisp on YouTube!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC trophy", "Author": "ATARI 010", "ReviewID": "RACKEL6IHB5CF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok i got this phone for the Xbox games not a big fan of windows phoneshad turned on for a week love the game but windows still needs to growswitched back to my droid X2 phone but still use the trophy as a handheld gamming device just turn on the wifi and download more games and play.I still get achivements for the games. does what I got it for....", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, HSPA/WCDMA: 900/2100 MHz\nPlatform: Windows Phone OS 7, CPU Processing Speed: 1 GHz, Internal phone storage: 8 GB, ROM: 512MB, RAM: 576 MB\n5 megapixel color camera with Auto focus and flash, 720p HD video recording, Built-in scenes include candlelight, landscape, and portrait match the environment of your subject\nBluetooth 2.1 with Enhanced Data Rate, Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 b/g/n, Internal GPS antenna\nBattery Capacity: 1300 mAh, Talk time: GSM: Up to 405 mins, Standby time: GSM: Up to 360 hours", "Name": "HTC 7 Trophy T8686 Windows Phone 7 Unlocked GSM Smartphone with Touchscreen, 5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi and GPS - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S84466KAL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004CZ135U"}}
