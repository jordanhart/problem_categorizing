{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly great Android phone with exceptions", "Author": "Mike5mser", "ReviewID": "RS0DEVEJS9Y0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very cautious when I bought this phone I was unsure of what to expect. I can honestly say that the phone exceeds my expectations. It is very fast with little no lag, it also has the Android Play store pre-installed so that you can get up and running downloading apps. The battery life is excellent and the phone is very light. The screen is a little dull because it is not amoled display. The camera is definitely not 8mp and the quality is very poor. The phone only has 2gb of internal memory so one has to keep this in mind when downloading files. The phone call quality is average with calls sounding a bit low but the speakerphone is fine. Most apps work with the exception of gameloft games, I tried shadowgun and grand theft auto 3 both ran flawlessly which was really impressive. Overall a great product, I recommend giving it a try. BTW Im using simple mobile as a provider and the device is only capable of edge internet speeds on t-mobile's network.Added 8/5/12Unfortunately, the display began to malfunction, the display would show garbled and i would have to remove the battery to reset the phone. Eventually the display just stopped working which is disappointing because I really liked the phone.Added 1/12/14I do not recommend this phone at all. I'm now using a Samsung Galaxy Note 1 which is a far superior phone in every aspect.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO WAY 8MEG CAMERA", "Author": "Richard E Haugh Sr", "ReviewID": "RQ2JS51RM2JDR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "5.3 Inch Capacitance Touch Screen I9220hd Android 4.0 Smart Phone 8 Mp Camera Wifi Dual Core Mtk6575 1g Mhz. I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY SON. RECEIVED IT TODAY. FIRST OF OFF THEY SAY ITS ROOTED. ITS NOT. SECOND THE CAMERA IS TO BE A 8MG NO WAY!!! I TOOK MULTIPLE PIXS THERE HORRIBLE. I HAVE A DINOSAUR CELL PHONE THAT TAKES BETTER PIXS. THE PIXS ARE WASHED OUT AND FADED TO A POINT THAT THEY LOOK BLACK AND WHITE. SO IF YOU WANT A PHONE THAT TAKES GOOD PIXS THIS IS NOT IT. THE PHONE IS LOUD. THE SCREEN NICE AND IT LOOKS NICE.  MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE CAMERA. I BROUGHT THIS SO MY SON ALWAYS HAD A CAMERA WITH HIM FOR THOSE PERFECT SHOOTS. VERY DISAPPOINTED. WOULD BE A GREAT DEVICE IF THE SPECS WERE CORRECT. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS DEVICE.after calming down because the of the camera issue. i installed several gameloft games and to my surprise they all work. this phone would be perfect if the camera lived up to what it is supposed to do. outside the pixs are average. not a inside camera. so to update over all the phone is a pretty good budget phone. if its games you like this is for you. it has loud sound and plays videos very well . in conclusion i would give it 4 stars for gaming. 5 stars video and music. and 2 stars for camera.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME!!!!", "Author": "Jennifer Henderson", "ReviewID": "R3NMOUROTPQ24B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my phone in records time!!

It kind of seemed too good to be true. I received it in the mail and was pleasantly surprised. It looked great, the network was fast. I had a little trouble inserting the sim card but realized I was putting it in wrong lol. The only negative about it was that it didnt have the best camera. I didn't really care though because I have my own digital camera and I dont think camera pictures ever look nice anyways. All and all, I will definitely recommend this to anyone. I've had it for almost a month now and I am very happy with it. :)", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "would have been 5 stars, but not dual core", "Author": "Geoff K. Hart", "ReviewID": "RXNPPNN181DTM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I love the phone for what it is: big screen, excellent speed, very responsive to touch controls, thin, fits in my pocket with no problem, good battery life, cameras work fine for me.  And the seller (Super Saving Store) is excellent (I had a problem with the proximity sensor being mis-calibrated, so I emailed the seller, and within an hour I had a step by step guide to how to fix the issue - and it's now working fine).However, I specifically chose this phone, because it is listed as \"dual core\" (I wanted something a little more future proof).  But when I received it, I discovered it's not (it identifies itself as an \"ALPS A9550\", and the Passmark benchmarks confirm it is, ranking it just above a Galaxy S in performance).  Last week I also purchased this phone (same seller, for my wife):http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084S70Q2/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00which benchmarks the same (even slightly faster).  That phone identifies itself as \"Alps E1808_v75_jbl2\".Both phones have impressed us (I'm coming from an Optimus T), and so far no serious problems (my wife's phone is finicky about how you hold it and WiFi connectivity, probably the metal rim doubles as an antenna?).The seller is the most responsive I've had the pleasure of dealing with on the Internet, I recommend them (also very fast shipping, less than 1 week from China).  I contacted them about the \"dual core\" issue, but they say the product listing description is not under their control.In case you're interested, rooting it presented no problems (I used SuperOneClick to get the USB driver, then TPSparky).UPDATE:Netflix was laggy, until I found the \"Force 2D GPU rendering\" in Settings, under \"Developer options\", that fixed Netflix.  I read that some games don't like that option, but Angry Birds, and GLWG don't seem to mind.Some benchmarks:PassMark 1107CaffeineMark 8386Vellamo 1031/363 (1139 on Vellamo1)(for the most part, these scores compare favorably against the dual core MT6577[...] )", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "More than expected", "Author": "Joel Bennett Ramos", "ReviewID": "R1FD42LV33H4E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well got the device today, it's fair to say that it's a Samsung Galaxy Note Clone, it even has a back cover that reads Samsung, but not to the specifics, it's a good little device, it's got great power and it's fairly equipped, the camera, not bad under sun light but not that good in dark places, but 'hey' it's a clone so what would you expect, I'd say it's even better that I expected, it brings an extra battery witch is good, earphones are not that good but who cares, compatible with most gameloft games, my only concern is whether it will last or will it only be a temporary toy, but only time will tell, in general, I think it's a great deal and you definitely get more than any other deal for that price.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works - Cheap alternative for a large screen", "Author": "JasonTheBarber", "ReviewID": "R3HLZIBI1UDWEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I previously owned a Samsung Note - well ... it literally got ran over by a semi when I happened to drop it while taking off on my motorcycle ...  ANYWAY .. I needed to replace that phone but didn't want to shell out the big bucks.This phone works for what it is. The camera is definitely weak - I'd say about 1.5MP (cheap optics).

The phone itself is quick and of reasonable build quality, and the processor works just fine with the OS.  The problem with mine was, it wouldn't recognize an AT&T; SIM card.  It recognized T-mobile just fine, but since I get no T-mobile reception where I live, the point was a moot one.Having played musical SIM cards for more than two weeks, some online research revealed that this particular phone is manufactured under several different makers using the shotgun approach: if 1,000,000 phones are made, and 10,000 of them don't work, then the losses are acceptable because they are so cheap to manufacture.  I have absolutely no problem with cheap---unless it ships from mainland China and takes five weeks to get here, which mine did.So the bottom line is this: if you get one, and it doesn't work, have a backup plan.  My backup plan was a Sony Xperia S from a stateside seller, which I should have done to begin with, but then, I wouldn't be here writing this review for your benefit, so I guess it works out ok.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00839GZN6"}}
