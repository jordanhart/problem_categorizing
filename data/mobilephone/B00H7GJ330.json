{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I have this phone.", "Author": "Lynn", "ReviewID": "R1FYDIR06AW2PI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought 4 of these phones 9 days ago for $149.00 each.  Ours is for Straight Talk prepaid phone cards.  First Straight Talk's customer service is terrible.  Secondly, out of 4 phones, mine is messed up.  To make or receive a call, there is NO sound through the ear piece, however, I can hear over the speaker.  Also, I had failed texts tonight.  Don't know if that ties in or whether that's a reception issue.  Otherwise, I like the phone, and this is my first smart phone experience.  Will exchange tomorrow, and hope it goes better.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "NET10 - ZTE Savy Savvy Mobile Phone Black (No-Contract)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413-WmTG4YL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00H7GJ330"}}
