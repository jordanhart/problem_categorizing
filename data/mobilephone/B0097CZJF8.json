There is no Unlocked version of the phone yet to be released in the United States.  So be aware of this.

D. Borley \"Xenthos89\"", "ReviewID": "R2TYY60D0XCZMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Iphone was a replacement for my non-smart phone and 64gb Ipod touch.It's slim enough to fit into your pocket with the right protector and is very, very light.I can get the battery to last a full day with moderate data usage, some calling, and a bunch of text messages.I went the unlocked route with a monthly carrier, and am going to save over $1000 in 2 years when compared to a 2-year contracted carrier.Headphone jack is on the left underside, and not the right side like the 4th generation.Camera is great with an auto-focus feature, editing, and great resolution.There is a switch right above the volume controls on the left side of the device that changes the phone from vibrate to ringer or vice versa, which has come in handy quite a few times just in the past few weeks.Replacing/changing the SIM card is difficult and requires an unbent paper clip to push an release the clipping mechanism on the right side of the phone.Volume and clarity of phone calls meet and exceed my expectations.The Siri voice commands are a neat feature.  I have used it when hands weren't very free to text.  Just make sure environmental noise isn't very prominent in comparison to your voice, otherwise Siri will just keep thinking and never come up with any text. (from my experiences at least)The ease of operation and speed at which the Iphone performs tasks is considerably quick in my opinion.Overall, I am super satisfied with this particular Iphone!Would recommend getting it if you're already on the verge of wanting one, have high familiarity with the Ipod touch, like a very user friendly interface, or like Apple products in general.Thanks for listening!", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coming from an iPhone 4S...", "Author": "Muiz awan", "ReviewID": "R1MC42PX3AYMNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have an iPhone 4S and considering to update to a 5, I recommend waiting for a 5s or try an android phone or windows phone.

WorldWide Distributors refuses to deal with me anymore.BEWARE OF ITEMS Sold by WorldWide Distributors...they coud be defective as my i phone 5 is.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good but not without flaws.", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R2Z0CIEHALYQD1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I heard they are making this phone thinner than the iPhone 4S, I wondered why on earth they would make a phone so thin and then when I finally weighed it in my hands, I was surprised at how light it was. The iPhone 5 is very light, it makes the 4S seem so much heavier in comparison. The phone looks much better than the 4S, the display is better, it is lighter and eventually this did help me in typing much faster. My previous phone was a Blackberry Torch 2, before which I was using an Htc Sensation XE. I lost the Sensation but it was a great phone and I really like Android a lot.Why I picked iPhone over Android and the rest-a) SOFTWARE - Apple gives users less optimizations/customizations and this I somehow like. No matter what I did with my Android, people would come to me and ask why I don't have it like this and why I don't have it like that. I don't like feeling like I am missing out on something. With Apple, everyone gets the same thing. It somehow is fairer and a lot time consuming. Of course you can move your icons around into multiple screens and that is that. Would I ever jailbreak? NEVER! Don't care much for that.b) Say what you want the iPhone has the best camera in the world, works without bug. Yes, the camera is astonishingly good and the color reproduction is way better than HTC, Samsung, Sony or Blackberry. The Lumia 920 has a great camera also if that is of primary concern to you but because of the easy fool proof \"lack of customization\" and the simple straightforward simplicity, I'd take the APPLE iPhone.c) ULTRA FAST TYPING -  I can type faster on the iPhone 5 than I can using any phone in the market (including the new z10, torch 2, htc sensation, samsung galaxy note, s3, etc)  Do I type portrait or landscape? Portrait.  I never need to make my device horizontal because i am fast enough straight up (candybar) Writing emails is a breeze.d) GREAT CALL QUALITY - Best quality for talking, the calls are crystal clear, people on the other end are envious about how clear my voice is. The Htc was a bit of a nightmare, maybe they have improved now but I think the earphone volume was terribly low and I had to leave the room to get a word through.  On whatsapp when I send voice notes, the iphone is the loudest and the clearest.e) iPod/MP3 - With 64GB, I carry many thousands of songs around with me and can play them right away. With Blackberry/Android, I never bothered using the mp3 player much but now this is the ideal solution. You can click an image without disrupting your song playback. For a video though, you will have to temporarily switch off music.After having used this for 4+ months, these features I found shockingly good -1) Browser Speed - It is simply the fastest browser on any phone and the screen resolution is perfect. Again, much better than Android.2) With internet off, the battery life goes up substantially so if you have 14% battery left, just switch the internet off and it will last you the crucial 2-3 hours.3) Despite loading hundreds of apps, I have not seen a decrease in speed.4) Call quality and reception is always good.5) Google maps on the iphone is a priceless gift. For google maps alone, I would RECOMMEND you try the iPhone out.6) The lightning port is the best charger I have seen on any phone. It beats the purpose of Micro USB, old Apple charger, anything else. You can invert the charging plug anyway, up or down. Brilliant innovation and I dare use the word brilliant.7) I have 3200 images and videos after just four months.8) iBook is lovely.THINGS I DEPLORE -a) The battery life is so bad. I have to switch 3G off and then I will get a day out of the battery. At home I keep the wifi on, because it is supposed to save the battery but still I can barely can get more than 12-14 hours out of it. No software update will help this. This phone consumes a lot of battery and you will need to charge it 2-3 times a day depending on usage. I actually feel like taking off 2 stars for this but that will be unfair. To be fair, it CHARGES SUPER FAST.b) Apple ID - The App Store is a very annoying feature. Sometimes when you are trying to update certain applications, it will randomly ask you for verifying not just password but credit card details. Apple is an absolute death angel about this. I have two apple id's, both in different countries so nothing gets saved. The iPhone is only recognized on my Macbook Air, not on my iMac. I haven't bothered fixing it and don't want to delete my library.c) Backing up images - Apple doesn't have a fool proof way of backing up images you take. It should be as simple as connecting it to your computer right? Wrong. iCloud gives you 5gb of usage so if you try to photo stream (seamless use it between apple devies) you will run into a wall because it's only 5gb and most of my 5gb is used elsewhere. Apple wants you spending more money. The limit should be 25GB and the paid. I didn't exactly pay $300 for this phone you know.d) The Camera Flash - It adds white/yellow to some eyes making them like a cat's. Many photos have been ruined by the lack of perfection. Also taking micro images (images of written text, printed text) should be much better.e) The Ringer - Sometimes on, sometimes off, the overall settings of the ringer on Iphone is very flawed. you go to settings, and then check it there. Its always confusing. Make sure you customize the vibration or else you will miss important calls.f) Siri is an idiot. Period.g) Because of the customization, Apple is never able to make best use of the wallpaper and all wallpapers will seem boring and useless. Android was much better with wallpapers.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "False advertisement.", "Author": "Steve-O-", "ReviewID": "R2GM3P1LIKQ9QA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I totally love the phone but was deeply upset when I found that the phone shipped to me came with an AT&T; nano SIM and I was unable to use my Ethiopian and Afghan SIM cards.

Since there are many reviews of form and comparisons to other smart phones, I will simply concentrate on my own experience.Pros:1. Lightweight, beautifully crafted.2. Significantly faster than the 3GS.3. Addition line of icons on the home screen.4. Much better camera(s).5. 4G LTE6. Better speakers.Cons1. Airplay broken - this is probably a iOS 6 issue because my 3GS still works perfectly with my stereo. Note that if you are considering a Pioneer stereo for your car, be sure to check if it is compatible with the iPhone 5.2. Wifi/Bluetooth issues - legion (Google for more information). Again, maybe iOS 6 but since this is the software running this phone, and since it interferes with the use of the phone, I feel it is legitimate to list it as a con for the phone. I will not list the Maps fiasco as a con, however, since that does not interfere with my use of the phone, only my respect for Apple, nor will I list the headphone socket change as a con, since that is a personal preference issue.3. Lightning connector - incompatible with all my accessories, outrageously overpriced adapters. Note that you will need the more expensive cable adapter if you have your new iPhone 5 in a case. Also be aware that the current crop of cheap lightning connectors are hit or miss, since they haven't perfected the copy, so at this time you are stuck with the Apple product (if you can find them) if you want a sure thing. My local store has not received them as of this writing.4. Sensitivity - for some reason, the touch screen of the iPhone 5 is less sensitive (in my experience) than my 3GS. It sometimes takes multiple touches to activate an area of the screen. Obviously, this is deadly when playing games like Temple Run or Canabalt. And no, currently I am not using a screen protector since Jesus Diaz over at Gizmodo assures me that the iPhone 5 is made of aluminum casted by Asgardian dwarf blacksmiths and put together with magicomicronometric precision by virgin she-dragons made of living gold.

The new model is so light that causes fear of dropping it; worse, all the time you put your hand in your pocket to make sure it's still there. The new screen size make a much better experience for the user, that is easy to notice when you try to use safari and the apps. The response time to any task is faster, everything seems smoother and more engaging. You just need a little handling at the new iphone to see how he looks better, with a more sophisticated visual and materials. Apple has thought of every detail. After spending a few minutes with the iPhone 5, you change your opinio in relation to 4, finding it heavy and absoleto. I think the person who gave an upgrade from 4 to 4S is obliged to upgrade to 5, because the differences are more pronounced than the other two models. iPhone is still the best smartphone in the world, even if the competition is already dropping the hot breath near Apple`s neck.
