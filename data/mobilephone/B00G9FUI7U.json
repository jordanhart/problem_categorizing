The superb Natural Sound technology,  beautiful screen, and quick accessibility to everything, is exactly what I had hoped for.  I manage television programming at a large TV network, so I needed a more business oriented phone anyway, and it has more than fulfilled all my hopes in that area.  But I was truly surprised at the solid build quality and performance, and management of personal data as well.  Better than I expected.  The widely spaced HQ speakers provide the best sound you've EVER heard in a cell phone, and the 4 microphones with noise cancelling make for such a pleasant audio experience to your callers, even in noisy environments.  The new antenna technology is great too.  There is this pesky hole in the cellular coverage on my commute to work; where the signal drops to nearly nothing.  My old DROID RAZR HD would lose signal; so did my wife's Galaxy S3.  But the BB Z30 holds the signal all the way through it.  VERY happy with that.  :)  The BB hub is truly fast and efficient, corralling all your communications in one well organized spot.  You can quickly tap out a message or respond to one from anywhere in the phone, no matter what you're doing at the time.  Video is sharp and smooth, and did I mention audio?  Yes, fabulous!  And there is no beating BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) for direct communications with others in the most secure platform available.  Adding and using apps is fast and efficient.  And there is no better touch screen keyboard around.  As you're typing away, suggestive words appear in the rows between the virtual keys that can be just flicked up into your message or document; making typing on a cell phone very fast and efficient, once you get the hang of it.  Do yourself a favor; forget about what's popular and think about what you really need a cell phone to do.  First up, it should be a good solid phone, don't you think?  The availability of over a million apps isn't worth much if you're traveling or on vacation in a fringe area when you really NEED it to connect.  And BlackBerry's are legendary for focusing on being good at communications of all types.  Secondly, you want a phone backed by a company that cares a bit more about your privacy and security than Google or Apple does.  Solid, fun, beautiful, and incredibly handy.  I can't praise the BB Z30 enough.  And no, I don't work for BlackBerry and never had one before, but now couldn't imagine myself without it.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "\"Best New Smartphone on the Market\"....

Do not let the negative news about BlackBerry or a sales rep talk you out of this phone. It is snappy (faster browser than the Iphone 5s and Samsung S4 according to HTML5test,com). This device is a communication machine. It has the best virtual keyboard on the market (effortless one hand typing with flick typing). You can respond to messages without leaving whatever app you are in (as far as I know the only platform where this is possible). You can always check your messages (which are conveniently all in one location) without leaving whatever app you are in by \"peeking.\" Long gone are the days of switching back and forth between apps. This phone keeps you moving.The lack of a home button is liberating. Closing apps and viewing active apps is a breeze. And by no means is this device just meant for communication, if you minimize a Youtube video, it will continue to play in the background. Also, with the new operating system (10.2.1.1925), you can download android apps straight from a third party Google app store. Showtime Anytime, Netflix, Starbucks, Snapchat, and Google Maps all work flawlessly on the phone.Did I mention that the battery routinely lasts me two days? Also, it has a special antenna installed so the phone gets better service in tough cell reception areas. There are many areas around town where I now get perfect service where my old phone used to drop. BBM video with screenshare is also a useful service. Seeing as it is difficult to share large videos, I can BBM video my parents while showing them videos I have taken on my phone. Do yourself a favor and get the BlackBerry Z30.

THE NEW BLACKBERRY IS AMAZING!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R7MLC0XXZ0K0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start by disclaiming that reviewing a phone these days is more about the OS than the physical phone itself, so I will start by talking about the OS first, and then move on to the hardware itself below. If you're deciding between the Z10 and Z30, I give a few thoughts below on both, since I own both. I am also posting this same review for both the Z10 and the Z30, since it applies to both. (Purchased the Z30 directly from Verizon.)First and foremost, and I wish BlackBerry made everyone aware of this:THE OLD BLACKBERRY IS INDEED DEAD!I emphasize this because most people don't realize this new OS is not in any way an *upgrade* to the old BlackBerrys; it is a COMPLETELY NEW operating system, with far more in common with Android, iOS and Windows Phone than the old blackberry. Except for one thing: it retains its focus on ease of communication and security. What does this mean? It means they took all the modern aspects of smartphone OS's and made them better! Did you know the new BlackBerry has the best web surfing experience of any smartphone? That's according to BGR, PhoneArena, TechRadar, etc. Now the Hub. Oh my, the Hub...Once you have used the Hub, anything else will seem clunky, outdated, inefficient and cumbersome. Why? Because anything else is indeed clunky, outdated, inefficient and cumbersome compared to the Hub. I predict the other OS's will eventually have an equivalent of the Hub, because it's just so much better than having to: open an app for texting; open an app for calls; open an app for gmail; open an app for yahoo mail; open an app for work email; open an app for WhatsApp; open an app to check voicemails; open an app for notifications; etc. In the Hub? Just swipe left once, and that's it. They're all there. Together. They are NOT merely notifications; the Hub is a conglomeration of all of those accounts (apps), together, or sorted by category with just one touch. You have to try it to really understand just how useful it is. And it's always just one swipe away.What I also find amazing is how bug-free the new OS is. I'm very picky when it comes to bugs. I simply cannot deal with Android, and even iOS got under my skin, but this OS has fewer bugs than both of those, despite the fact that it's brand new. Kudos to BlackBerry for that. (I'll admit my only experience with Windows Phone is with the Nokia 520, which was less than stellar, but is such inferior hardware that it wouldn't make for a fair comparison.)The apps: yes, for now, there are far fewer apps on this platform than others. Personally, I have everything I really need on this platform. I wish there were more Bank apps, but frankly, nowadays, the mobile sites are usually as good and even better than the apps anyway, so I use shortcuts to the mobile sites in my app screens for whatever is still missing. I don't buy a phone primarily for gaming, and most big name games are available, as well as thousands others, so I have all I need. I'm not a huge app user myself; I use my phone primarily as a work tool, and this phone has everything I need: DocsToGo is included (and works well); built-in integration of DropBox, EverNote, etc; a native File Manager; great communications as discussed above; the usual suite of apps like videos, music, pictures, calculator, tasks, lists, maps/navigation, weather, calendar, etc (basically all the same stuff as other platforms); as I said, pretty much everything I need and actually use. If there's an app you really need but is not available, BlackBerry OS 10.2.1 is capable of running most Android apps, and it is now a fairly easy process to load these onto your phone.Onto the hardware:The Z10 is a great device. Size is perfect for me (4.2\" screen), but that's really a personal preference. It feels good, looks great, and is extremely fluid in handling the OS and all apps. The one downside is the battery life, which is OK, but not great (1 to 1.5 day with average use). The advantage of the Z10 is that it has a removable battery, so you could pack an extra one with you to swap in if need be (kind of a pain though, better off using a battery pack like the BlackBerry Battery Charger Bundle, which is about the same size as a battery and can just power any microUSB device).I recently upgraded to the Z30, which has AMAZING battery life (3 days with average use, which includes web browsing, emails, phone calls, texting, streaming music, playing games, downloading, etc), although I'm struggling with the large size (5\" screen), and may go back to a Z10. The Z30, however, does not have a removable battery, but frankly, who needs it when the battery lasts that long anyway? The Z30 also has better speakers, but be warned that because of this, if you have good hearing, you may notice a slight hiss coming from the speakers when the phone powers the speakers in preparation for various sounds, which is normally inaudible on phones with inferior speakers. The Z30 can also act as a DLNA server, and OTG USB capability (which means you can plug in a flash drive directly to the phone, using a USB to microUSB cable). The Z30 will also be capable of playing the radio directly, when it gets the latest update released by BlackBerry, 10.2.1 (Verizon Z30 is currently on 10.2.0 as of this writing).They are both great phones. They both have good specs, but you will find phones with better specs out there, albeit they won't run better, because this OS is far more efficient and requires less power to run. Simple as that. For the average user, between the two, I think the only truly relevant differences come down to battery life and size. The Z30 has MUCH better battery life, but also has a significantly bigger screen. I love the battery life, I don't like the bigger screen.One final note: you may wonder, if these phones and the OS on them are so great, then why is BlackBerry not more popular since it released this new OS? Well, remember that line from Rain Man (the movie): \"K-mart is caca\"? That's pretty much what everybody thinks of BlackBerry now, because they lagged behind for so long until now, and their previous OS really did suck compared to the competition. Unfortunately, old perceptions are hard to change, and that's what BlackBerry is struggling with now. Most people still feel that way, because hey: they have NO IDEA that the new BlackBerrys are completely different, and that they are actually kick-a**, modern  smartphones now.Give it a chance; I don't think you'll regret it! Just look at actual consumer reviews of the phones everywhere! (Here, on Verizon, AT&T;, Sprint, etc...)

I had issues getting this to work.I then powered on the device without the sim card just to see how the phone would operate.  I was stuck on the first screen \"welcome to blackberry\" page, and was effectively frozen -- and non cooperative.I then installed the sim card and powered it back on -- same issues -- FROZEN, and the visual/voice assist was stuck on so the device just kept yelling/repeating my gestures -- none of which would prompt the menu selection, including trying to power the device off.I got frustrated and figured I obviously had a defective device.  I called Amazon wireless to inquire about exchanging my device and they were very helpful and got Verizon tech support on the line with me.Verizon tech support suggested I go to their retail store to do the transfer(as i did not have an additional phone to use to call tech support)I then noticed my Z30 was finally accepting the \"check for sim card\" process..  So now i had hope that my device was not defective...So on my way to the verizon store --- If you had noticed already, Verizon has pulled all blackberry phones from their US retailers, so many of their representatives are not knowledgeable on how to sync/back up/transfer data from BB to BB.  Even so, I was grateful someone there was willing to assist me.  My phone is now connected/activated, but they were unable to figure out how to transfer my contacts..Luckily, i had used the \"backup assistant\" app on my old BB 9930, so after getting home i searched to the same app on my new Z30(standard equipped app) and was able to port my backed up contacts.Moral of my Review:  Customer support regarding Blackberry contract phones is a Do It Yourself process if you are in the USA.If you will need to use Verizon cloud to backup your contacts, or use the \"backup assistant app\" on your old phone > backup > then update/sync with your new phone.  Amazon does not provided instructions on the latter(i assume this is a BB to BB process of syncing/transferring contacts)So, even though i have not officially had enough time to review the phone - I am sure i will love it --- BUT i just wanted to know that the \"experience\" of having to order a phone online and troubleshoot the process before being able to properly use it is a detractor in my opinion.5 star for the phone(assume that if you are a current BB user, you will feel the same)  4.5 stars for Amazon, the ding being the instructions could have been simplified.  4.5 stars for verizon tech support, the ding being that they are not knowledgeable of BB devices issues anymore due to BB being a not factor in the US consumer market.  4 Stars for the Verizon store... issues lie at the carrier level not supported knowledge of the BB device.And last but not least, 2.5 Stars for Blackberry.  Congratulations, you have officially been removed from the US consumer smart phone macro-ecosystem and market as whole.  I will still purchase your phones, but I will dread the DIY requirements for not being able to rely on a Verizon store representative to act as a product advocate/concierge...  Remember:  I almost returned the device because I thought it was defective.  The phone isnt defective, just the process in which you have forced your US market to endure in order to reluctantly remain loyal to your brand.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Gina Anderson", "ReviewID": "RS3OG4QQFRPHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Z10 and the Z30 is even better its a shame that the Iphone blocks alot of its users. so alot of my freinds are making the change to the blackberry Z30. a lot better phone for the money .. to many problems with the iphones. thats why they keep bring out new ones every 6 months sad. just like windows for your pc.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best EVER!!!", "Author": "Timothy Pierce", "ReviewID": "R3JPKHAQEW5INJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Intuitive operations, simple communications with the Hub, keeping everything organized.

Although I didn't buy my Z30 through Amazon (it was sold out when I was shopping) I got it from Verizon.  My biggest fear was if the phone would be too big.  It's not.  In fact it's only slightly bigger than the Z10 it replaced which now seems kind of small to me.The best part of this device is the battery life.  I used to worry about making it through the day with all of my other phones (I've owned quite a few).  With the Z30 I no longer need to bring battery boosters and chargers with me during the day.  In fact it can last well over 30+ hours.  The wireless charging is a great feature; just drop the phone onto a little pad and the phone starts charging.The elegance and simplicity of the BB10 OS is very underrated and misunderstood.  Once you get past the swiping up from the bottom to minimize and close apps, you are set.  The swipe to the right to get to the Hub (all of your emails and notifications) followed by a swipe to the left to go back to your apps is so simple I find it unbelievable that anyone can think this OS is complicated.  What is complicated is trying to figure out how to close an app on an iPhone.There are some unexpected things like the great stereo speakers and the HDMI out port that you can get a cable for less than $5 here on Amazon to send everything on your phone to your flat screen TV in full HD.  And wireless with Miracast (although I haven't tried that yet).Now that I can upload all of the Android apps that were missing from BlackBerry World, I've got the best of both of those worlds.  What isn't to like?I highly recommend this phone.  It is the best piece of hardware I've ever picked up.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best phone on the market by far!", "Author": "S.

I read articles about how Blackberry is on the way out of the private consumer market, only to focus on business enterprise. Time will tell.For now, I must say that I'm so glad I stayed with Blackberry and not gone with the Samsung Galaxy or the Apple iPhone.Pros:The virtual keyboard is easy to type on, with fingers or a stylus. I was amazed at the auto text feature which suggests words as you type to speed up the typing process. I love this feature and is easy to use.Transferring your old phone information. The Blackberry hub makes it easy to transfer data to your Z30. I searched the Blackberry website for guidance, as my old operation system  was version 4.5 which was below what the new Blackberry hub could do. Never fear. Just back up your system to a micro SD card, then place in your new Z30. All of my information: contacts/call history/calendar/pictures/wallpaper was transferred easily to my Z30.Micro SD card. The Z30 is able to work with 64 GB.Flash player works so you are able to view images in your e-mail, etc.The Hub: It only took me less than  a day to get the hang of how the hub works and how to separate work email from personal accounts, texts and phone calls.Cons: Not as big of an applications catalog as iPhone, or Android operating platforms. But the big ones are there: Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter. Blackberry Travel is an app that is the Blackberry app for use with Worldmate and it works very well.  But with the great browser, you can visit direct websites.I love my phone. I just hope Blackberry markets it more.
