{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mini-2 Samsung", "Author": "Windsurfer \"Skimmer\"", "ReviewID": "RLX6RT7XJLDY1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade to an aged and worn-out HTC Aria phone (Android).  I was looking for something with more power, but still in a small form-factor that fits in the palm of your hand, like a \"normal\" phone.  This was it!  More memory, faster processor, great screen, good battery life.  This is a great unlocked GSM phone.  I use the ATT Go-Phone, no contract in the USA and I travel a lot to other countries, so now I have total freedom to swap out SIM cards and make inexpensive phone calls, anywhere.  Alternative no-contract is T-Mobile. I was at first \"put off\" by the \"yellow\" back-plate, but decided to jump in saying I could just paint over it. The phone comes with two back-plates, and one is a more conventional steel-gray, plastic back. I just used that instead.  Front face appears to be tough glass, and quite scratch resistant, although I am very gentle with my phone handling.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Mini 2 GT-S6500T", "Author": "S. Peterson", "ReviewID": "ROROJ4N9B5T12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone. For me it is the perfect phone. It is just the right size. It feels good in your hands. Has the perfect weight and feels generally well made. It is small enough to slip in your pocket and not feel bulky. I am not one who texts or spends loads of time searching the internet on my phone. I use it to make phone calls! And it does this well. Call clarity is good and generally loud enough for me, athough those that have slight hearing difficulty may be somewhat low for them to hear well. I also wish that ringer volume was slightly louder but is still acceptable. Signal range has been excellent so far. It has wi-fi to help download apps and update firmware as necessary. The phone also has hot-spot capability. Screen size is 3.27\". Again just right for me. It is certainly not going to compare with the current batch of smart phones with 5\"+ screens. But I generally have no issues when inputting text in either portrait or landscape modes. This phone is target toward those looking for a smaller smart phone and it does that perfectly. Camera is 3.2 MP, does not autofocus and no flash. The way I look at it, it you want to take printable photos, use a camera designed to do this well. I only use camera occasionally, possibly while shopping to photograph an item for comparison or to view later or snap printed details. Picture quality is excellent for this. Battery quality is good. While entering all my phone information after I purchased the phone, I entered my contact information and setup information over a 6+ hour period. So with the screen constantly on over that time, I still had approximately 50% battery life. The advertisement on Amazon stated that the phone was to come with both yellow and black battery covers. It only came with the black. I probably would not have used the yellow but would have came in handy should the back cover become damaged over time. This is a european phone, so it came with charger that matched the european design, but an adapter was supplied by the vendor. I use on the T-Mobile network. Since their data is 1700 MHz, it is not supposed to work on their network for data although I later realized that small amounts of data were being charged to me until I went into phone settings and set it to GSM only and turned off the data packet. Again, I only intended to use for phone conversations. You can use all data options on any other GSM carrier in the U.S.So in reflection, if you want a smaller good quality phone, this one fits the bill.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phone language", "Author": "Meraj Ramnarine", "ReviewID": "R5ANNVTCGLO19", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon should clearly advise all customes who is shipping the product.

The Mini 2 is the perfect size for people that don't want one of those extra large phones these days, but it still is very easy to operate and maintains full functionality of all the phone with the larger screen size.  Because of the smaller size it has an excellent battery life, so you can use it all day and not have to run to the nearest outlet.  The only drawback is that it cannot be upgraded to the latest 4.0 operating system, but for someone that uses it their phone as a liberally, it doesn't seem to make a difference.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice small full-featured Android phone", "Author": "Oleg Margulis", "ReviewID": "R3NRWEAR8CBPA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I previously owned Galaxy Mini.Mini II is pretty much the same with small improvements here and there.The only major issue I encountered is it's 3G.

Downside - small full keyboard, at least for my fingers. I find myself wishing for a Palm Pilot's stylus.___ As Smartphone ___Voice quality is good, and the numeric keypad is big enough to be convenient.The smart side is not news over the Palm, e.g. I've installed RealPlayer on the Palm to use it as music player. The mini 2 has additional functionality over the palm, e.g. those based on GPS (like waze) & ability to use wi fi.I learnt how to use it quick enough, though I'm sure I have plenty more to learn.___ As PDA ___I've bought a Palm Vx over a decade ago, and have been using Palm Pilots ever since. On this front I have three issues -(a) I had some issues importing data from the Palm. It was easy to import contacts, but memos (used Note Everything, which garbled the Hebrew) and calendar wasn't as easy.(b) Palm Desktop gives the ability to enter data on the computer, and sync it to the Palm. Kies does not.(c) I like the Palm's stylus for the keyboard. I've heard there are 3rd party solutions, and consider exploring those.It could be argued that Samsung doesn't position the mini 2 as a PDA, but it's a shame it misses the little required (stylus, Kies inteface to the calendar & memos, import those from palm) to make up for it.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs!!! - Perfecto para mis necesidades!!", "Author": "Sol", "ReviewID": "R1RL4M6NLCA1TH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is my first time with a Smartphone...

I love it.And if you if you need to flash again the OS, that's easy using only help.!!! WARNING !!!If you are buying this fantastic smartphone, order as well a cover and a strap, and of course: an insurance!In the first use, mine fell off the counter of the kitchen (3 feet) and the screen glass (yes, it is real glass!?!) broke into one thousand pieces! Ready to go to the trash!UPDATE 1: Amazon gave me a nez Smartphone after I return the broken one for free! (5 stars)UPDATE 2: After 6 months - during an official \"Samsung software Update\" the phone rebooted and it never worked again.I contacted Samsung USA: they told me that the only way was to send it to the costumer support and I discovered that they don't give support to this \"international\" version of S6500 in the US. They told me to contact Samsung UK!During two days I had the phone inoperable, not knowing what to do.Finally I decided to check on the net a solution and I was able to flash a new OS into it and now it works like a charm.
