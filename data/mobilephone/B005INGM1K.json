Probably has nothing to do with this phone, maybe just an improvement in the activation process at Net10.  Whatever the reason, it was great, and I had this phone activated in 10 min with unexpected bonus minutes!!  And that is on top of paying <$10 for the phone on clearance at Target.  So the price can't be beat.Good little phone.  Basic calling and texting features.  Even though it has browser capability, I will not use it.  This is a basic phone for making calls and sending messages, which I do little of anyway.  Those looking for smartphone-like functions will be disappointed, and need to spend more for an appropriate device with those features.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware of your sims card", "Author": "Tiny Pins", "ReviewID": "R26NZRKMI5BJM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been with Net 10 for several years and always had great service with them.  This phone gave me the blues.  It took Net 10, three weeks to figure out what was wrong with my phone.  I could receive a text message but couldn't make any calls.  The first week they said my sims card was bad.  Seven days later I received my other card.  I still wasn't able to make any calls and now I couldn't receive any either.Now they told me that the sims card was linked to my old address and the sims card wouldn't work in my area.  That didn't make since to me, because I was receiving messages from my first one.  Now they said they woud be sending me another phone, I waited another week for a new phone, and of course I had the same problem.  They kept telling me my phone was activated, but yet they couldn't call me either and I also was showing 4 bars so I didn't understand why I wasn't getting service.  I finally got to talk to a supervisor that had some since.  She asked me to go out side and see if the phone would activate, and it did, after I walked about 40ft from my house. As soon as I got close to the house I lost connection.  I called them back and talked with another supervisor she looked up the details of my phone.She told me that my phone was for outside use only.  My phone had a T-Mobile sims card it it.  She told me she would be sending me an ATT sims card. It took one more week to get that. I talked with 11 associates in that 3 week period.  My phone is working perfect.  The phone is great.  Downing loading graphics, or rings tones was easy.  Go on line pay with you minutes or pay with a credit card.  Net 10 does not offer any games. Their are a lot of bad reviews on T-Mobil sims cards.  Its still a nice phone.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good phone", "Author": "Cheryl", "ReviewID": "R1VW3G2WDJ84X2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a smart phone, this is definitely not it, but it makes a great all around phone for calling and texting.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A mediocre phone with huge issues", "Author": "James Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R1T7STJZJ0V2ID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a decent option if you want a hard keyboard on your phone, for texting and e-mail. However, there are a lot of problems with this phone that keep me from giving this a recommendation.PROSIt's a cheap, functional phone for calling and texting, although texting is very slow. While, of course, it's not an iPhone, it will do a couple of other things, like play MP3's. The call quality is OK, but there's not a lot of built-in calling features. The camera is not horrendous, though storage of photos is. The calling plans are decent, as well.CONS1. Other reviewers on other pages for this phone have said they have had problems connecting the phone to a PC in order to move files back and forth from the optional storage card. I've had the same issues...it's a miracle when I'm able to do it. You have to have the phone on, and try several times to connect the phone, via a USB cable, to get into \"Mass Storage Mode.\" If you really want to use this phone to store files, such as MP3's or photos, don't bother.2. LG is not supporting this phone. On several calls, I've been able to get support, other times I've been hung up on, and yet other times I've been told to call Net10 for hardware support. With this phone, you need support, especially to get the phone set up initially, and to learn the ins and outs of it. In my case, it was an enormous hassle.3. There are a lot of good Java apps out there for this phone, including the Opera Mini web browser. HOWEVER, the amount of on-board memory for this phone is pathetic, and you cannot use an external card for more memory. If you stick to the basic browser and small games, you can go for a while without the app crashing, but larger apps, like Opera, will allow only a few minutes of use before crashing.4. The browser itself is very slow and not very useful. Even with basic mobile web e-mail, the interface is clunky and hard to use, with a small screen, hard to find links, and difficult scrolling. And, while Facebook and Twitter are advertised as being \"compatible\" with this phone, they do not work with the browser included, as the browser will crash with an out-of-memory error before you can do anything on those sites. This phone is as useful as a flip phone for web browsing.5. Many other reviewers have complained about the Browser soft key...it's an annoyance, but it's not as bad as others have said, especially since you won't be using the browser, if you buy this phone.6. No wired hands free option is available; only Bluetooth is available, and you still have to hold the phone to your mouth to talk...horrible.7. Contact information is difficult to enter, but easy to export.8. There are too many settings missing from this phone...there are a lot of things I'd like to adjust, and maybe they're trying to make the menus simpler, but the settings just aren't available.Overall, while this is a relatively new model phone, it's technology from about 2002. I'll be lucky to get much more than a year out of this, and given the amount of time it took to get it functional, that's just no good. This phone might be suitable for a texting pre-teen (the target market for this?), but not if you're just out, and trying to send one legitimate, lousy e-mail via the web.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little phone except...", "Author": "P. Mac \"New England Patriot\"", "ReviewID": "RX00NCU1VC44E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been with Tracfone/Net10 for years to one degree or another. Picked this up yesterday. It came with 2 months of service and only about 20 minutes but I transfered what was left on my LG900G and brought it over to this one. I even transfered via bluetooth, all my contacts from the LG900G to this phone very easily. Activation was somewhat of a pain, it said I had a tracfone. Got on the phone with Net10 and they were able to get it activated. I have also had the same issues with tracfone trying to tell me a tracfone I was trying to activate was a Straight talk phone. and it wasn't even close to one!  I wanted a phone that was a little smaller. I have a hard rubber snap on case for it, It does make the phone more rugged. Battery life is good, it is easy to use.  The keys are a tad smaller than the LG900G phone. It can take up to a 4gb micro memory card in it. The one thing I do not like about this phone is the texting rate. With my LG900G the texting rate was .25  With this LG500G it's .50  I am trying to contact net10 now to find out why. Maybe it's just the rate the phone charges but I'd like to know why a cheaper phone would charge more of a rate than the expensive one. The camera in this isn't the greatest but it works for me, I really don't rely on it for photography. The signal is always strong. It can be used as an MP3 player but I don't use it for that either. I just text and talk...in that order, thus my complaint of the texting rate! All in all, I reccomend this phone if your looking for something small and lightweight with a qwerty keyboard.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the money.", "Author": "Donna M.
