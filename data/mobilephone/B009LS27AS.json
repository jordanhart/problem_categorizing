I use Net10 and I wanted a better phone and I chose this. It's awesome, it doesn't freeze, it handles even the most intense of apps and I've yet to regret it. The only thing is that the battery sucks, so I wouldn't recommend overly using it unless you get a portable charger or you don't surf the internet that often, or are by a plug. This thing gets charged twice a day. One time I fell asleep without charging it, it was about 87% when I went to bed and when I woke up about 7 hours later it was at 40% so make sure you always have the charger. Other than that it's a perfect phone, and seeing as I already had portable chargers I think this is perfect.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S2", "Author": "Sleeper", "ReviewID": "R2S5J7DW5TA19A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best phone I have had to date.

Having been a Sprint customer using non-smartphones, I realized that I had been paying too much and not getting a lot in return.  The phone has done everything I wanted it to thus far.Good:It takes good pictures and video.It is a solid balance of screen size and overall phone dimensions (not overly cumbersome to tote around)Voice recognition and Swype work wellScreen/capacitive buttons are responsiveFairly priced (for non-Sprint CDMA network)Android interface is easy to learnNot so good:Phone can run through battery if using heavily (browsing pages or syncing data constantly)Older Android version (this is an academic issue for me because I have never used later versions of Android and don't really know what functionality I am missing)No 4G (another academic point because where I live doesn't really have a  robust 4G network and I usually use WiFi anyway)Overall:I dig this phone quite a bit. I was able to purchase it through Amazon and avoided shipping/tax.  I did use my savings to purchase 3rd party rechargeable batteries which have been invaluable and I would recommend it for anyone considering this phone.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone for pre-paid!", "Author": "thomas duperry", "ReviewID": "R1382O233AFJX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This phone runs great! I upgraded from the LG Optimus and immediately the screen size was a huge difference. Finding a case can be a bit difficult. (Look for Model # S959G) (At&T;, and Verizon have other versions of this phone with none compatible cases for this phone.) Also, the battery life can be a drain. Install a WiFi toggle and a Data toggle asap. Maybe a battery manager as well. That way the battery will last much longer. On the plus side, this phone benchmarks well. Maybe not compared to it's younger brother, the S3, but I haven't found an application issue yet. Rugged as I work construction and this thing handles my work well. A recommended buy all around :) One last note; I bought this phone from here because the Net 10 Website said it wasn't available in my area. Well, I'm from central Maine, and there is no problems here at all. It's a marketing game Net 10 plays with it's customers, and that's not fair.

This is still a good phone in my opinion.... the only issues i have had are (1) a couple of games that crash but that could be from me leaving them running to long AND (2)  THE BATTERY... some days it might last 11-12 hours and other times it will last for 30-40 hours... Running the same apps??? Not really sure what's up with that... the only thing i can think of is that this battery has a sweet spot for when it needs to be charged for optimal battery usage....  This phone plays movies, music, youtube videos great and does email a lot better than i thought it would... I have had this phone for 5 weeks and have had less than a handful of videos that would'nt play....

Plus I'm glad for the LED Light its been helpful lol. Also the screen visuals are nice and clear, bright, and just look nice and clean first thing I noticed after going through the set-up process of the phone once turned on. The app functionality every once and awhile will get a little lagging but that's mostly when it overheats a bit (probably cuz of the gingerbread OS) or long excessive use. The other problem I tend to get is if I leave my phone on all night without unplugging it is that after unlocking the screen will be frozen but I've just been turning my phone off at night to prevent that.... Other than a couple \"glitches\" or \"bugs\" the phone itself definitely suits my needs.

It's quite durable, moderate speed, and connects to the network easily. The camera is nothing to sneeze at, and the addition of a contract-free tracfone makes this, even two years later, still pretty top of the line.If you need good battery life, however, this is not the phone for you. It falls a bit shy of the 8 hour talking time claimed by the manufacturer, expect about 6-7 hours instead. If you keep your charger somewhat near, this shouldn't be a problem, but it's a bit of a battery hog.Of note: Be sure to buy a Net10 Unlimited card with this. If you buy a 750 minute, or anything below unlimited, Net10 will refuse to activate your phone.

Took me ten minutes after the card arrived to square away the account and have full access.  No issues in my region or as I traveled to VA.  Always worked.As for Galaxy S II, the three positives are: easy to figure out, screen is small but sized right to fit in my pocket and camera is decent (not five-star quality but good enough).Now, speaking toward the battery.  If you run GPS and various functions throughout the day, and check emails eight times a day, and make five or six calls per day.....then this battery will be completely run down by 18 hours.  If you simply check your emails once a day, make five calls, and never run GPS....it'll last 48 hours.  So I would advise you to carry a charger around with you, and in the car, and check the battery symbol once in a while.This is a phone that I'd advise any light-user or older person with limited knowledge on new technology to buy.  It's not overly fancy or highly technical.  If you wanted a better camera...then buy a camera.  If you wanted a I-Phone....then buy a I-phone.  This is the general all-purpose phone and just accept that.  If you are on the go, and really use the phone alot....I'd advise you to go ahead and buy a second battery to have around and fully charged.
