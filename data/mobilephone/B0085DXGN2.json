I seem to break many of the other types of phones.  This phone has some internet functions, but it is not what I would call a smart phone.  I use my phone for phone calls, texts... occasional pictures.  I've had one of these for several years and bought this one for my son when his last one broke.  He also loves it.  I'd buy another and I hope I can keep finding them in the future.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "joanne", "ReviewID": "R1W2FJJXQ22TXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "same phone i had before i really love it.... everything is not for everybody those that dont like thats their opinion", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "finally found one", "Author": "Douglas Durow", "ReviewID": "R1AORLAYPYKYWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had been looking for a quality lotus 600 for some time.

My sister and I had been looking at the LG Lotus (and elite) for a while before finally getting this one. It does what it's supposed to, and as stated by the seller, as a few small blemishes, nothing that makes it unusable.  The only problem I have, is that I camera dosent seem to work. I'm not sure if that was stated before, but oh we'll.The seller also left a kind note with both an E-mail and phone number in case I needed to contact them. : DWould buy from them again!", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the Best", "Author": "AliciaLorraine", "ReviewID": "RDUI5SSPEG21Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Two years ago, this phone was the free uprgade from a Nextel model through Sprint, which is why I own it. Up until a month ago, everything worked as it should and I had no complaints. Now, however, it barely holds a charge, frequently fails to send/receive text messages, and often goes straight to voicemail even if I'm in an area where I have full service. I find it very suspicious that this phone suddenly begins to malfunction a few months before it's time for contract renewal--I think that it was designed this way on purpose so that Sprint's customers would have to upgrade immediately instead of at their contract's expiration. Seems like this way they're able to rope more people into new contracts instead of risking them having the chance to shop around with other companies.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "dont wast your money", "Author": "Andrew J.
