{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good basic phone", "Author": "David J. Brunell", "ReviewID": "R3KSCNA35ARE6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone because I was interested in switching to PlatinumTel, and it seems to be the most competent phone in their lineup.  The other choices included Samsung M350 and M910, Sanyo Incognito and Zio, and LG Rumor and Rumor 2.  This is the only phone that doesn't seem to have major reliability or usability issues, based on feedback which I've reviewed from across the web.  The keyboard has curved keycaps which makes it easier to use than other smartphone keyboards I've had in the past.  It's a sign of the times when a phone with a decent camera, SMS, picture messaging, email, web, appointment calendar, contact manager and bluetooth can be considered a \"basic\" phone.  I was able to set up my POP email very easily, and it has enough options that it should be able to support most email accounts.  There are a few shortcomings which I should mention.  First, I've been unsuccessful transferring files to and from the phone over USB.  It does not support USB mass storage device mode, so you have to use Susteen USB drivers, which I have been unable to get working so far.  However, you can upload photos by going through the PlatinumTel web site (messaging charges apply).  The second shortcoming is that the built-in web browser is fairly basic and doesn't render images very well.  However, it works fine for most mobile sites which are predominantly text-based.  The real beauty of the phone is that it enables you to access the PlatinumTel network.  Their Real PayGo plan is the lowest cost plan that I've been able to find for light users like myself.  I only use the phone when I'm away from a WiFi or ethernet connection, and Google talk otherwise, which is a great way to save a load of money on phone charges.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "My blackberry version", "Author": "Sassy S", "ReviewID": "R2NRJB3LE9188F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone once you get to learn how to work with the keyboard.
