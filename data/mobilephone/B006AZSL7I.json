{"Reviews": [{"Title": "<3 Windows Phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RKKRBSKKEU4TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my original HD7S for about a year. This is the first phone that I have purchased that I'm not already eager about getting a \"new\" phone. I've used every phone OS available on the market to date and the Windows Phone is by far the best phone OS available. The only issue I had with this purchase was that the battery (which was NEW and SEALED) was defective and kept rebooting the phone. I had a backup battery and put that in the phone which fixed the problem. I would like to get a fresh new battery with the phone but it's really not worth the shipping costs to ship a battery.Overall, great device - and for all you n00bs out there, if you don't have AT&T; your device would be an HTC HD7 - NOT - the HTC HD7S that way you don't run into your SIM card issues. This phone came with all the AT&T; markings and programs on it, also.Enjoy a device that comes with all the capabilities that a phone should (standard) without having to upgrade every year for a new feature...*cough*iPhone*cough*", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it & Hate it....... HTC HD7", "Author": "Cravebigger", "ReviewID": "R23GKY7S66Y6T0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Don't get me wrong for this price the phone is great but I think is best you know what your getting not just whats on the surface but inside.-It is true about the noises you hear when your on the phone chatting.-I had this phone for no more than a week & a half and almost every time i listens to music it freezes after a while. No returning unless you turn it off that SUCKS!!!!!-Normally i don't do review but i had to after finding out that every time someone send me a picture message it can never come through YEP most likely you wont be about to send or get pictures..... don't believe me look it up yourself.Am keeping it only because I spend my money i don't like shipping back and all that drama but plz know what your buying I hope this help you.

The 16gb is great. It did come unlocked. However, just letting you know, this phone is OLD. It does not matter WHO you buy it from, the phone will not COME NEW! It will never come sealed anymore. I bought my new and it came \"new\" but without the earphones that come with all phones and everything in the box was a mess. Also, HTC takes FOREVER to push their updates. This phone doesn't have Windows 7.5 yet! Many phones already do.In brief: This phone is outdated, Windows 7 OS is boring although cute/attractive, the phone is not very customizable, it's intuitive but not fun, and VERY limited apps... I wasn't happy and don't recommend Windows Phone 7. :( Bought a Galaxy S3 instead! :)", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very good phone.", "Author": "Jacob Farmer \"Yeah, Its me...\"", "ReviewID": "R24HAGNZYY8G0H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A lot of bang for the buck.  I have had mine for about 2 years now.  I have really enjoyed the phone and can give a strong critique of the pros and cons that others don't usually cover.Pros:The battery is an easy $5 replacement.Cases and protectors are still cheap and plentiful to order.The wider screen (compared to Nokias) works and looks great with the Windows GUI.Very solid operating system with few hangups.Will update to Windows 7.5 officially ( 7.8 unofficially..I am running 7.8 and it is worth the effort!)It is compatible with Family Mobile if unlockedDecent camera, but no auto stabilizer..Cons:The music player can freeze and I have read that this is actually a Zune issue not doing well with different audio formats.  Stick to  MP3's and no problems. It is the only thing that has ever made the phone freeze.No stabilizer for camera.Bright flash/flashlight.Audio could be louder, but it is okay.Does not offer hotspot function.Will not send photos through bluetooth. (its an HTC thing)If the cons do not bother you that much it is a worthy purchase.  I am still enjoying mine and considering that a Galaxy 3,4 and an HTC One still cost hundreds more it is a great deal. Also just a note here. The black column on the right side is eliminated with the OS updates and the icons take up the full screen(looks better).", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "htc", "Author": "naa mills", "ReviewID": "R3HEAGJJC7WRBU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i cannot connect my phone to the internet am always getting no result every time i try to connect htc Apps i called my network support but they could not help.

The phone had issues with the proximity sensor from the start. The phone would make whistling noises and constantly reboot for no apparent reason.  Yesterday (May 12th),  the phone stopped reading the Sim card and now it won't boot pass the HTC screen.  If or when it does it says emergency calls only and reboots. The phone was not dropped or exposed to any liquids of any kind.  It simply just stopped working 60 days after I placed my order.

This works pretty well for internet, messaging and e-mail, and I hadn't experienced the convenience of a mobile platform for anything other than cell calls and messaging.  The touch screen is kind of quirky and doesn't always do what I intend, but I assume that is more my problem than the phone.  It's heavier than I thought it would be.  If you purchase this phone and update it to OS 7.5, you will have to load Zune software to do so.  The screen is excellent for viewing videos, very clear and exact.  The only thing I haven't been able to do is send or receive text messages with pictures, which I could do with my previous phone.
