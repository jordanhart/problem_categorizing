But this phone is actually pretty amazing. I really have fallen in love with it. its very responsive and quick to the touch. The box includes, phone, flip over case (nice quality), two batteries, standard headphones,screen cover, usb charger with base. the cord to the charger isnt long at all, so you might want to by a longer one, just for convenience. Its a standard android charger, you'll have no issue finding a nice one for a cheap price. the speakers on this phone are AMAZING. very loud and clear. the phone looks exactly like a galaxy s4, most clones have a yellowish tint to the flash located under the camera. however the flash on this phone is clear, giving it a realistic look. im going to go ahead and say, if you are trying to buy a $100.00 phone, this is it! this is coming for someone who has had many phones. from  iphones to windows to androids. this is a real favorite of mine. now i just have to wait and see how long this phone will last.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Alejandra.", "Author": "Joselin L\u00f3pez", "ReviewID": "R2J6FF6ORF1FGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a very nice phone!

I bought 2 of them as gifts for 2 close friends of mine.  First of all it is super slow and it constantly freezes.  It was sold with 2 batteries each and the batteries and none of the batteries hold charge.  The camera is awful.  By the way its a beautifully designed phone, just looking at it but please don't waist any money on this phone.  Amazon need to remove this phone from its web site.  I was ripped off and i think this is some kind of scam.  I only wish I could get my money back.BUT WAIT! Here is the thing that really pissed me off, I bought the phones and you know how where it says  \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\" items.  well i also bought the case for the phone and it was too damn small for the phone - lol.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beware - Chinese Surveillance Software PreInstalled Infected ALL of my devices......BEWARE...", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "RCJ3H2E8R8Q8U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Rarely do I rate anything I purchase on Amazon with a one star but I had to let the public know, THIS PHONE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS...most of us have a paranoid voice inside our heads that warns us about our network security now and then, well that voice starts speaking very loud with this one.PROS1.  It looks like a google android phone and its cheap, that's it!CONSWhat the phone aka PORTABLE CHINESE SURVEILLANCE VIRUS PHONE comes with.1.  The phone looks like a Google phone on first glance, buts its far from it.  The phone comes in Chinese Language and most applications you can get in the United States are BLOCKED on this phone.2.  The phone is not recognized by the usb port when you plug it in your computer, but your computer will never forget this phone, the software on this phone takes over in the BACKGROUND.3.  If you plug an SD card into this phone and take it out and plug the same sd card in a real Samsung Galaxy S III, verizon(your phone carrier) doesn't even recognize what kind of phone you have anymore.4.  The phone has a factory reset button, but DOESN'T I REPEAT DOES NOT RESET THE PHONE.  The phone keeps all the information you put on it, including passwords, etc...5.  The phone says it is an S4 on it with HD video, has neither and if you try watching a movie on the phone you see your reflection the entire time.6.  This phone is worth at most $5 to $15 dollars, $90 dollars is too much to pay for this phone.7.  Having to replace other hardware and software that this phone comes in contact with costs far more than the savings on this phone.My Opinion, coming from someone that studied Computer Science:THIS PHONE CARRIES WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE CHINESE SURVEILLANCE CODE THAT CAN MOVE TO YOUR OTHER DEVICES...BEWARE....I really don't think the seller should be allowed to sell this on Amazon.The phone carries a virus and takes over anything it comes in contact with, that includes:  Bluetooth, Wifi, USB connections.  If you bought this phone think about getting new everything, now.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "DONT WASTE YOUR MONEYY !!!", "Author": "barbara kirkland", "ReviewID": "R1HTMOPNJE221J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is a piece of crap.

The phone looks great and that is the only positive thing to say about it. It comes with 2 batteries which are worthless. I was constantly charging a phone that I could barely use. apps will load but with not open. you only receive a small amount of internal storage so you really cant download anything unless u have a sd card. after a 30 min conversation this phone would run hot and shut off even though the phone was completely charged. internet Is slow even if you have wifi connected which also drains your battery after 10 mins. It takes forever to even text message. You have a front and back camera...It would be nice if they both weren't crappy...pictures come out looking horrible..I have called several times to speak with customer service which is like talking to a brick wall.they are in hong kong so you cant understand them and they pretend to not understand you. The lady actually had the nerve to tell me maybe I didn't know how to operate the phone correctly even though I explained to her lost i  my Samsung galaxy note 2 and chose to replace it with this phone. I didn't want to seem like a douchebag and keep asking to  return it and ask for a refund so I told myself I would keep it and deal with it since I made a bad judgment and bought the phone even after reading the bad reviews...well not a surprise it decided to stop working yesterday(april 14th 2014). it started ringing and when I looked at it the screen was black .so now I have a phone that I literally didn't even have for a month that I can only receive phone calls because the screen is black.

I was just surprised at how limiting the processor speed and memory capacity actually was. As a phone with a few simple apps, it will probably work nicely. If you can get a larger app from the Play Store to download in the limited space (even with a 4GB SD card installed) you will, depending upon the game, not really be able to engage if fully because of the slowness. (read 'crashes a lot'.)  On the positive side, this phone, with it's two sim card slots, is quite beautiful. Looks just like a Galaxy s4.  A very nice finish. Photos are fair to poor (use lots of light and forget the flash). Can you use it as a phone. Yes, with reservations. I did not put a sim card into it. Instead I used the Groove IP App that takes advantage Google Voice and made several free calls over the internet. Because Google will soon be discontinuing this service, I tried another App that also lets me use the internet but through my Ooma telephone service. This also worked nicely. Both apps let you use your contact list from Google to dial out. The downside of this for me is that incoming calls go either to Google Voice or to my home phone on Ooma. The best way to use this device as a phone is to purchase and use a sim card, provided the company you choose will let you connect at the 2G speed that this phone is limited too.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "sucks", "Author": "ALLAN", "ReviewID": "R3KIFY4QFWWDPI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this phone sucks don't wast your money.....go with the blu 5.5 its a very good phone I have one......... thanks", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phones are good, nice and hefty...", "Author": "Robert Ayson", "ReviewID": "RX4OE864I3K7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My order didn't came as expected, i feel disappointed at first, but it' s alright.

I tried to download Candy Crush but the phone said that I didn't have enough space.  Bear in mind at that time I only had one other app installed and I had a 16 GB memory card in the phone.

The screen scratches very easily too. The pros of this phone are that it comes with 2 backs and 2 batteries! Never got that with any other phone. Also one more drawback, the directions are very small and hard to read and I never have trouble reading any directions. I gave it 3 stars for the picture quality but the camera is not so good.

It is very difficult to make calls since the recipient  says it comes across as very chopped and broken up. Does not matter which SIM card or network is used or where you call from. Have tried it both here in US and in Germany. It is truly hopeless and useless..I have thought about putting up it for auction on one of the sites  but do not want to risk my good ratings.Was going to donate it to a domestic violence shelter but am worried that it would come across as chopped and fragmented in an emergency call situation..I purchased a dual SIM card LG phone through Amazon for around $25 and it is a power house. The reception and quality of the calls can not be beat.  If all you want to do is make calls that is your phone.Goes to show multi feature or high tech is not necessarily better.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy!!", "Author": "Heather Cox", "ReviewID": "R3R1KCNT2YJKA7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible.
