When I first got it, it worked well for a bit, but after about two weeks it started to slow down and it would shut down by itself every few hours. The paint also started chipping on it so I sent it back for a replacement. When I got my replacement I realized it was even worse and the battery only lasted about two hours before the phone would shut off on me. I don't know if it was the phone itself or the company, just DON'T BUY FROM CELL LOUNGE. I've sent them the second phone back and they've told me that they didn't receive it - which I know they have - so I can't get a refund.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "don't get it, never get another HTC phone anymore", "Author": "happyb8g", "ReviewID": "R1JN3PXWA4GAMV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had it for almost two years, and every minute I own it, I want to throw it out of the window because it takes forever to switch apps, making calls... If I weren't waiting for the new Samsung Galaxy S2, this phone would probably end up at the landfill!
