I wanted a phone with a QWERTY keyboard, but wanted to retain my $25 plan.  I like the keyboard, however, I needed the phone for text messaging and it does not have the capability of Threaded Text Messages.  My alcatel did, and this is unfortunate.  Otherwise, generally a good, easy to use phone.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone nice", "Author": "frances laws", "ReviewID": "R3SQVRNXY9DM8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my  son love the phone and the features the phone has offer and  the style how the phone are made", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wasn't good...I wasted my money.", "Author": "Ne'Shai", "ReviewID": "R1IODA0YLJ65RJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the reception is horrible...I had it for only 2 days and it continuously dropped  service.i couldn't give or receive call.the cellphone performs well,but the reception,.......0_o.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst phone I have ever owned.", "Author": "M. Winemiller", "ReviewID": "R39ZDKDMFXVO6G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It barely holds a charge. The volume is terrible; you have to put it on speaker to be able to hear anything. It either does not send my texts fully (texts that are longer get completely butchered), or it eats them after they were sent, which is a nuisance because I have to refer back to conversations and this will not let me. It also eats my phone calls; I have missed countless important phone calls because this blasted thing decided that it was not going to let the call go through, or it would but would not ring for it. It also rarely shows missed calls that it did decide to let through. Again, absolutely horrendous phone. Samsung should be ashamed of itself for putting this one on the shelves, and I am normally a big fan of their phones. Not this one, though.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lousy........", "Author": "Leonardo D.
