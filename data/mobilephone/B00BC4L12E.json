The dual standby works great. All of the other features like the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS are also working correctly. I have had a problem trying to pair one Bluetooth device but I think it is a problem with the device not the phone. The phone is running Android 4.0.4 (ICS) but Sony says it is going to release JB for the phone. There is not a light sensor on this phone so the display does not auto adjust. Through the Xperia settings in the settings menu it did download my service provider's APN info and it was correct for both SIMs. I am using a small service provider (Viaero) and the APN settings are not common.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BC4L12E"}}
