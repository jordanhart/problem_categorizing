I keep getting messages in Chinese as well that I cannot get rid of. In addition to it having not very clear sound quality, the headphone plug is very small so it does work with regular head phones, AUX jacks or anything that would require a regular headphone. And Lastly, I have been having trouble downloading more then two apps. So overall its okay if you need a phone but if you are looking for something with good quality this product I would not recommend.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "not working", "Author": "Mz Yatta", "ReviewID": "R23WZSVFQT7VW4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just bought this product mt T-Mobile sim is not working only my wifi took it to both stores and they could not reach the servers????
